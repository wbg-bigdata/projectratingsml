APPRAISAL OF
NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT S.A.
GREECE
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a proposed fifth Bank loan to the National
Investment Bank for Industrial Development (NIBID).
ii.       During the past two years, the Greek economy has come under in-
creasing strain as reflected in the sharp deterioration of the balance of
payments, increased external borrowing on unfavorable terms, slowdown of in-
dustrial activity, and high rates of inflation. The rapid increase in private
consumption and the rise in prices of imported commodities put the domestic
price level under severe pressure and a heavy burden on the balance of pay-
ments. Consumer prices increased by 16% in 1973, compared with about 4% in
1972, but rose only by about 5% in the second half of 1974, due to the Govern-
ment's stern anti-inflationary measures.  The current account deficit rose
from US$368 million in 1972 to US$1,219 million in 1974, resulting in a draw-
down of official reserves and heavy external borrowing. The contractionary
policies followed by the Government to curb inflation and to strengthen the
external account, coupled with the Cyprus crisis, resulted in a decline of
economic activity. Real GDP declined by 1% in 1974 compared with an increase
of 9.4% in 1973. The index of manufacturing production showed no growth in
1974 compared with an increase of 17% in 1973, while unemployment reached an
estimated 3%. Recent fiscal and monetary measures to increase the income of the
low and middle classes and to encourage investment are expected to usher in a
recovery of the economy. However, the balance of payments is expected to
remain a difficult problem in the next several years. To improve the external
account, exports of manufactures and non-traditional agricultural products
need to be stepped up. In the meantime, Greece must depend on long-term for-
eign capital at favorable terms to finance the gap.
iii.      The share of the manufacturing sector in GDP has continued to increase
in recent years, reaching 23% in 1974. The share of manufactures in total
exports has also increased, from 38% in 1972 to about 45% in 1974. However,
only about 10% of total output of manufactured goods is exported, thus under-
scoring the need to increase the sector's international competitiveness.
iv.       Interest rates for borrowing and lending are determined centrally
and are biased in favor of industry and agriculture. The Government considers
the interest rate ceiling for industrial loans (10.5% plus 1% commission p.a.)
an important element of its industrialization policy. However, the resulting
narrow spread on lending activities has not encouraged resource mobilization
by investment banks.
v.        After the change of Government in July 1974, the Governor of the
National Bank of Greece (NBG), NIBID's parent company, was appointed Chair-
man of NIBID's Board. There have been no major changes in the functions of



- ii -
NIBID's Board and Executive Committee, nor in the composition of NIBID's
management. NIBID's appraisal work continues to be of high quality. NIBID
is now calculating the economic rate of return for many of the larger proj-
ects it finances and it intends to expand the application of this technique.
For the next few years, NIBID plans to favor projects contributing to one or
several of the following objectives: (1) promotion of regional development;
(2) utilization of the agricultural potential (agrobased industries); (3)
promotion of exports; and (4) creation of large industries in petrochemicals,
basic metals and other fields.
vi.       NIBID competes successfully with NBG and other commercial banks,
as well as with the Government-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank
(HIDB) and the third, much smaller investment bank, the Investment Bank of
Greece (IBG).  Since the previous Bank loan, in November 1973, NIBID has
maintained its share of about 20% of total long-term finance extended to
the industrial sector.  Most of the projects it finances are medium-sized
companies with fixed assets below Dr 50 million (US$1.7 million equivalent).
In the past two years NIBID has made considerable progress, in line with
Government policy, in financing export-oriented industries and projects
located outside the greater Athens area (Attica) in regions classified by the
Government as "1less" or "least" developed.  Sixty-eight percent of NIBID's
total financing in 1974 was for such projects. Since industry is essentially
small- and medium-sized, NIBID's operations have focused on increasing the
efficiency and competitiveness of its clients, often by financing expansion of
plant capacity to achieve economies of scale. This is an important function
in view of possible full EEC membership for Greece by 1980.
vii.      In 1974, NIBID's total portfolio increased by 28%.  In spite of the
depressed state of the economy in 1974, approvals during 1974 exceeded the
record level attained in 1973 by 6%. As of December 31, 1974, NIBID had loans
and equity investments outstanding totalling US$220 million equivalent. Al-
though NIBID's profitability decreased slightly in 1974, it is still satis-
factory. The arrears position worsened in 1974, but as of December 31, 1974,
only 10 companies were more than 12 months in arrears, with total princi-
pal affected representing 2.3% of NIBID's portfolio. The arrears problem is
basically a short-term one, due primarily to the recession the Greek economy
experienced in 1974. NIBID's loan and equity portfolios are adequately se-
cured and continue to be sound.
viii.     At the time of the fourth Bank loan, it was envisaged that NIBID
would undertake a number of foreign and domestic borrowing operations. How-
ever, with the exception of a US$5 million loan, other attempts to tap the
international capital market failed, largely because the cost of borrowing
was prohibitive. Moreover, the Government was not prepared to assume the
foreign exchange risk and it would have been extremely difficult for NIBID
to pass it on to its clients in view of the availability of convertible
drachmas for imports of capital goods. In the face of high rates of infla-
tion in 1973 and part of 1974, neither NIBID nor other financial institutions
could have recourse to the domestic bond market.



- iii -
ix.       For 1975 and 1976, commitments are projected to total Dr 5.1 billion
(US$170 million equivalent), which represents an increase of some 34% over
the previous two-year period. Given NIBID's pipeline of projects and the
expected beginning of the recovery of the Greek economy during the second
half of 1975 and in 1976, this goal appears realistic. In order to cover
estimated commitments, NIBID would have to raise a total of about Dr 4.8
billion (US$160 million equivalent) in new domestic and foreign resources
during the two-year period 1975 and 1976.  Apart from internal cash genera-
tion and the sale of equity investments (Dr 740 million), NIBID expects to
raise funds from four other sources: (1) NBC and the Bank of Greece (Dr 1,750
million); (2) sale of non-voting preferred shares (Dr 450 million); (3) EIB
and KfW (about Dr 600 million); and (4) the international capital market and
other foreign sources (Dr 450 million).  If the interest rates on the inter-
national capital markets continue to decline and if a satisfactory solution
to the foreign exchange risk problem can be found, NIBID should be in a posi-
tion to carry out its plans to borrow abroad.
x.        The projected availability of resources would still leave a gap of
about US$25 million. The proposed fifth Bank loan would fill this gap, equi-
valent to about 15% of NIBID's need for new resources, and would provide criti-
cally needed support for Greek industry at a time when the economy and balance
of payments are under great strain. Moreover, NIBID is in a position to en-
sure that the funds would be rapidly disbursed, and that they would be chan-
neled to industries which have major export potential.
xi.       In order to ensure that the Bank would receive an adequate number
of projects for its review, the maximum size of any sub-loan or investment
financed with IBRD funds would not exceed US$3 million. The terms of the
proposed loan should be those normally applied to IBRD loans to development
finance companies, including the standard commitment fee. IBRD funds would
be used to finance the full cost of direct imports and the import component
of civil works and of equipment produced in Greece, estimated at 30% and 40%,
respectively. The Government would assume the foreign exchange risk on the
proposed loan, as in the past. The free limit would be US$1 million for the
use of IBRD funds and the aggregate free limit US$12.5 million. Repayment
of the loan would be made according to a fixed amortization schedule, approxi-
mating the composite term of sub-loans made by NIBID under the loan. On this
basis, an appropriate term of the loan is 12 years including 2 years of grace.






APPRAISAL OF
NATIONAL INVESTMENT BANK FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT S.A.
GREECE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a fifth Bank loan to the National Investment
Bank for Industrial Development S.A. (NIBID).
1.02      NIBID was established in 1963 by the National Bank of Greece and
ten foreign banks. In 1965 the company's share capital was increased and
several new foreign banks, and IFC, became shareholders. Since then NIBID
has received four Bank loans:  US$12.5 million in March 1968,US$20 million in
April 1970, US$25 million in December 1971 and US$15 million in November 1973.
This report focuses on developments since the 1973 Bank loan. The present
report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to NIBID in January
1975 composed of Messrs. H. Griesshaber and M. Takahashi.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC TRENDS
2.01      Following the Cyprus crisis in July 1974, the seven-year old
military regime was replaced by an interim civilian Government and in
November 1974 by an elected Government with a large Parliamentary majority.
Although the new Government is confronted with major issues regarding the
country's external relations, the internal political situation has become
more stable. In the economic field, the main pre-occupations of the new
Government have been the increased cost of national security; the need to
restore and broaden the country's economic relations with the world at large
and with the E.E.C. in particular; and the problems of inflation, balance
of payments deficits and the decline in growth and employment. With subsid-
ing inflation in the second half of 1974, the main objective of the Govern-
ment's credit policy is to regenerate growth of the economy while maintaining
relative price stability and without imposing further undue strain on the
balance of payments.
Recent Economic Performance
2.02      The Greek economy has experienced some major changes since 1973.
GDP grew at a rate of 9.4% in 1973, but is estimated to have declined by 1%
in 1974 below the 1973 level. The rapid increase in private consumption,
which was the main expansionary factor in 1973, and the rise in prices for
imported commodities, put domestic prices under severe pressure and a heavy
burden on the balance of payments. The consumer price index,which rose by
only about 4% in 1972 on an annual average basis,increased by 16% in 1973.
The overheated economy began to cool off in 1974 as a result of the Govern-
ment' s contractionary measures. These measures included a reduction in



-2-
budgeted expenditures of the Central Government and other public entities,
an increase in reserve requirements of banks, upward revision of interest rates,
and a ceiling on commercial bank credit together with other measures to
mop up liquidity and tighten credit, particularly in the construction indus-
try. During the first half of 1974 the consumer price index rose substan-
tially above the figure for 1973; however, durixg the last six months of 1974L,
the increase was only about 5%. During the last decade the share of the
manufacturing sector in GDP rose at the exenae of agriculture, while that of
the services sector remained more or less the same. However, in the past two
years, the composition of GDP deviated from this long-term trend. Agricul-
ture's share rose from 19% in 1972 to 21% (estimated) in 1974, while that of
manufacturing continued to go up from 20% to 23% (estimated) over the same
period. The increase in the above sectors was made at the expense of the con-
struction and services sectors. Structural unemployment is low and the cur-
rent rate of about 3% is expected to drop with the anticipated recovery of
the economy in the second half of 1975 and in 1976.
2.03      Balance of Payments.  The balance of payments deteriorated serious-
ly in the past two years. The trade deficit widened sharply from US$1,572
million in 1972 to US$2,861 million in 1974, due to a rapid increase in im-
ports during this period, partly reflecting worldwide inflation. Although
exports expanded vigorously, they accounted for only 38% of imports and 9%
of GNP in 1974 - an increase from 36% and 6%, respectively, in 1970.  Imports,
on the other hand, rose from 17% of GNP in 1970 to 23% in 1974. The share
of net invisible earnings in financing imports, which is normally about 40%,
dropped to 35% in 1974. As a result, the current account deficit grew
from US$368 million in 1972 to US$1,219 million-in 1974.  Capital inflows
to finance the current account deficit reached US$1.0 billion per annum
during the past two years. Nevertheless, official reserves had to be
drawn upon to help finance the gap, and reached the equivalent of less than
2-1/2 months of imports at end 1974, a decline from about 5 months in 1972.
Thus the debt service ratio of about 7% in 1974 is expected to rise substan-
tially in the next two years.
2.04      The problem of the balance of payments basically lies in Greece's
unfavorable trade balance. The deterioration in 1973 and 1974 has again under-
lined the vulnerability of the Greek balance of payments to disturbances both
at home and abroad. In view of the removal of trade barriers as a result of
Greecets association with the E.E.C., it will become more difficult to contain
imports. 1/ Therefore, exports have to be stepped up in order to reduce the
trade deficit, with the main emphasis being placed on non-traditional agri-
cultural products and manufactured goods. This will take time and until there
is improvement, the trade deficit will have to be financed by capital inflows.
1/   Since November 1974, import duties on industrial products which are not
locally produced and imported from E.E.C. have been abolished, while
those imported from outside E.E.C. are presently subject to custom duty
of 10-20%. Efforts are being made to advance the date of the complete
abolition of tariffs on industrial products imported from E.E.C. from
1984 to 1980.



-3-
One of the concerns in this respect is the deterioration of the terms of ex-
ternal borrowings with the grant element declining from 20% in the period 1970-
1973 to 7% in 1974. The Bank's continuing assistance to Greece, including
the proposed project, should help to meet the resource gap and improve the
external debt structure.
Manufacturing Sector
2.05      Due to high domestic and foreign demand, manufacturing production
grew at a rate of 17% p.a. in 1973. Intermediate and capital goods such
as chemicals, metal manufactures and electrical machinery showed faster growth
than consumer goods. In 1974, however, as a result of political developments
and economic uncertainty, manufacturing production showed no increase. Never-
theless the share of manufactured goods in total exports continued to increase,
rising from 38% in 1972 to an estimated 50% in 1974. However, export of man-
ufactured goods accounts for only about 10% of the total manufacturing output.
Gross fixed asset formation in the manufacturing sector (at constant prices)
levelled off in 1973 and 1974 but is expected to increase in 1975. Foreign
investment is relatively modest in scale but qualitatively important because
it provides technical and managerial expertise.
2.06      There have been no significant changes in the basic features of man-
ufacturing establishments, which generally remain small in size, family-owned
and with a limited export-orientation. In 1972, 65% of Greek companies had
total assets of Dr 50 million (US$1.7 million equivalent) or less. About 50%
of employment in manufacturing is concentrated in the greater Athens area.
The need for geographical dispersion is fully recognized by the Government,
and incentives to bring this about have begun to have effect.
2.07      Investment Incentives.  Industries are given a variety of invest-
ment incentives which fall into three categories:  those applied (i) to
industries in general (ii) to industries located in less-developed areas (iii)
to export-oriented industries. Regional development incentives are offered
according to the state of development in a given area (see map). Depending
upon which of the four regions is concerned, there is a package of incen-
tives such as accelerated depreciation (up to 200% of ordinary depreciation
rates), reduction in turnover tax (up to 50%) and credit incentives through
interest rate subsidies (up to 3.5%). There are also export promotion incen-
tives such as exemption from tax and duties on imported raw materials, deduc-
tion of export earnings from taxable income (up to 4%) and concessional inter-
est rates. These incentives appear generous, but their overall contribution
has not yet been studied in depth. However, industry's respectable growth
and performance in the past decade tends to demonstrate the beneficial in-
fluence of the incentives scheme. The new Government intends to review the
incentives system in order to increase its effectiveness and to reduce the
costs of its administration.



4-
Financial Environment
2.08      Commercial banks accounted for 41% of the total bank credit out-
standing at the end of October 1974. Two commercial banks, namely the
Government-controlled National Bank of Greece (NBG) and the Commercial Bank
of Greece (CBG), hold most commercial bank assets with shares of about 64% and
18%, respectively. There have been no fundamental changes in the structure
and activities of specialized financial institutions.  In the investment bank-
ing field, the state-owned Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (HIDB) con-
tinues to dominate with about three-fourths of the business. HIDB's opera-
tions have focused on financing shipbuilding and tourism, while its long-term
financing of the industrial sector amounted to only 38% of its activities in
1973. HIDB and NIBID (55% owned by NBG) provided 20g respectively and the Invest-
ment Bank of Greece (85% owned by CBG) 5% of industrial financing in Greece in
1973. The remaining resources came from a variety of other institutions, in-
cluding commercian  banks, as well as industries themselves.  In the future,
the state-owned investment bank (HIDB) is likely to play a larger role
in financing industrial investment. It is the intention of the Government
that HIDB revert to its original purpose of an industrial investment bank.
Consequently, competition between HIDB and private investment banks would in-
crease in future. However, since NIBID's reputation as a competent and effi-
cient institution is firmly established, increasing competition should not
affect substantially NIBID's business. Moreover, NIBID expects to continue to
receive the full support of the Government and the BG. In 1973, total credit
to manufacturing industries for investment purposes increased by 28% p.a.,
and the share of investment banks rose from 40% in 1972 to 46%, with a corres-
ponding decline in commercial bank lending.
2.09      Capital Market.  The volume of trade in the Athens Stock Exchange
showed an increase of about 16% in 1973, but fell by 11%, to Dr 7.6 billion,
in 1974. The price index for industrial shares (1952 = 100) dropped from a
high of 4,115 in July 1973 to 2,373 in July 1974 due to political uncertainty.
The market for bond issues was seriously affected by the Government's con-
tractionary policy to combat inflation, and only three bond issues were made
in 1973 and one in 1974. The Government, previously the largest seller of
bonds, made no new issues during the past two years. As for stock subscrip-
tions, the compulsory minimum ratio of self-financing to borrowed funds (30:70)
and the new incentive to reassess and capitalize fixed assets, through the
issue of new shares, have been instrumental in stimulating the stock market.
New share issues by private enterprises reached a record amount of Dr 4,430
million and Dr 850 million in 1973 and 1974, respectively, while new share
issues by banks amounted to Dr 470 million in 1973 (nil in 1974). Overall,
the Greek capital market is still in its infant stage, especially the cor-
porate bond market.  The aggregate amount of bonds issued by private enter-
prises over the past ten years (1963-1972) was Dr 1.3 billion, and accounted
for only 1% of total loans outstanding to the private sector for fixed capital
formation; the interest rate controls are only a partial explanation for this.
Other constraints on growth of the capital market are the Greek investors'
strong preference to keep financial assets as bank deposits and the predomin-
ance of family owned and tightly controlled enterprises which do not want to
broaden their ownership base.

2.10      Interest Rates.  The interest structure is determined by the Cur-
rency Committee which establishes maximum chargeable rates for each type of
deposit and credit. The highest lending rate is 14% p.a. for imports and
domestic trade and the lowest is 3% p.a. for certain types of credit to farm-
ers. The maximum interest rate for long-term loans to industry is 10.5% p.a.
plus 1% commission p.a. Rates payable on deposits in drachma range from 0.5%
p.a. to 11% p.a. The present level of interest rates is about three percent-
age points higher than during the period 1966-1972 when prices were relative-
ly stable. Regulated interest rates are an important element of the Govern-
ment's industrialization policy and do not necessarily reflect market condi-
tions or the availability of capital. However, in view of the fact that in-
flation has been subsiding since 1974, the level of interest rates as a whole
has come closer to market rates. The interest rate ceiling for industrial
loans, low compared to that for medium-term time deposits (up to 11% p.a.), is
one of the main impediments discouraging investment banks from raising domes-
tic resources through bond issues. However, the two private investment banks
play a useful role in converting short-term funds raised by their respective
parent banks (both commercial banks) into long-term capital for investment
in industry.
{II. NIBID'S STRUCTURE
Ownership and Control
3.01      Since 1972 NIBID's share capital has been Dr 450 million, of which
Dr 300 million is denominated in common stock and Dr 150 million in preferred
non-voting stock. The Government-controlled NBG continues to hold 55% of the
common stock, but NIBID nevertheless operates autonomouslv. In mid-1974
IFC reduced its investment in NIBID from 7% to 1% by selling 6,038 voting shares
at a price of Dr 11,000 to 12 other foreign shareholders (par value is Dr 3,000
which was IFC's cost in 1965). A list of shareholders is shown in Annex 1.
The preferred non-voting stock of Dr 150 million listed on the Athens Stock
Exchange is widely distributed among approximately 7,000 small private in-
vestors, with larger shareholders being the Credit Bank and the DELOS Mutual
Fund holding 19% and 11% respectively; another mutual fund and a few financial
institutions including a pension fund account for another 4%.
Policies
3.02      NIBID's investment and financial policies 1/ are unchanged since
the previous Bank loan. NIBID does not grant loans with a shorter term than
five years, and the legal maximum is ten years. Because of staff constraints,
1/   For a discussion of NIBID's borrowing policy (debt/equity ratio) see
paras 5.11 and 6.18.



-6-
NIBID generally discourages loans below Dr 3 million. The single exposure
limit to one enterprise is 20% of NIBID's share capital and surplus accounts
(including a subordinated loan by BC). In a few cases, NIBID's commitments
have come close to this limit. The ceiling set on NIBID's overall equity
investments (100% of NIBID's equity plus the subordinated BG loan) has been
approached to the extent of about 75% (or about 100% on a commitment basis)
at the end of 1974. Since current plans call for a capital increase in 1976,
this limit will not restrain NIBID's equity investment activity.
Board and Executive Committee
3.03      After the change of Government in mid-1974, Professor A. Angelo-
poulos, in his new capacity as Governor of NBG, was appointed Chairman of
NIBID's Board replacing Mr. Christos Achis. The position of first Vice-
Chairman of the Board was taken up at the same time by Mr. P. Tzannetakis,
the new Deputy Governor of NBG. Annex 2 shows the composition of NIBID's
Board and Executive Committee.
3.04      The powers of the Board and Executive Committee remain unchanged.
The full Board and the Executive Committee meet only once and twice a year
respectively. The Board has delegated its authority to approve loans or in-
vestments to the Executive Committee composed of seven Board members, which
in turn has authorized a sub-committee, consisting of three of its members
resident in Athens, to approve loans and investments up to Dr 60 million and
supplementary financing up to 30%. Operations below Dr 25 million need only
be approved by NIBID's management. W4hen the total exposure per company ex-
ceeds Dr 60 million, the projects are circulated by mail to the full Execu-
tive Committee for review and approval in writing.
Management and Staff
3.05      Since 1963 Mr. George Gondicas has headed NIBID as Managing Direc-
tor. He is competently supported by his Deputy, Mr. Christodoulou. There
have been no major changes among NIBID's very capable senior staff. In mid-
1974 NIBID set up an Economic Research Department headed by a qualified econo-
mist; its staff was recently expanded from three to five.
3.06      To support its Technical Department in cases requiring specific
technical expertise NIBID had established ADL Hellas a few years ago, a joint
venture of the consulting company Arthur D. Little and NIBID. Although the
cooperation with ADL Hellas has been useful, ADL Hellas was dissolved in the
second half of 1974, because only a few of NIBID's larger projects required
these high cost technical advisory services, and because Greek industries,
which are mostly small- and medium-sized, did not make sufficient use of
ADL Hellas to justify its continuance. Since 1973 NIBID's Technical Depart-
ment has increased its staff of engineers from three to five. NIBID further
strengthened its technical competence recently by securing the services of
a former manager of an oil refinery acting as advisor. This will enable
NIBID to take a more active promotional role in evaluating prospects in the
field of petrochemicals, which is expected to gain in importance.



3.07      As detailed in Annex 3, the staff now numbers 103 including 62
professionals compared with 86 and 52, respectively, in the first half of
1973. Because of its rapidly expanding business in the last few years, NIBID
is still understaffed, particularly in its six Operations Departments and in
the Follow-up Department. Recruiting additional staff with experience as
financial analysts and a background in industry is difficult, because NIBID's
salary structure, which is comparable to that of NBG, cannot compete with that
of large industrial firms. For this reason, NIBID relies more on the recruit-
ment of recent university graduates who are then further trained within the
company and through other facilities.
Procedures
3.08      Project Appraisal.  NIBID's assessment of the financial viability
of projects continues to be thorough and of good quality. The Technical
Department is equipped to appraise projects involving simple industrial
processes, but in view of the higher level of technical expertise required
for some projects which NIBID now promotes, the Department should be strength-
ened. NIBID's management is aware of this need and is already undertaking
the necessary steps (para 3.06). Since the fourth loan, NIBID has been pre-
paring economic rate of return calculations on major projects. This method-
ology is applied to all projects presented to the full Executive Committee
of the Board of Directors, except for projects exporting at least 75% of their
production since export-oriented industries (in the absence of major export
subsidies) can be assumed to be competitive. No full-fledged economic
analysis has been undertaken for projects excluded by these criteria, but NIBID
nevertheless checks to see whether the proposed venture is viable, assuming
it would not be subsidized or protected from competition. As is further
explained in para 6.07, NIBID intends to extend the application of Economic
Rate of Return calculations.
3.09      Procurement and Disbursement.  NIBID's practice is to encourage its
clients to procure equipment from the most competitive sources, and it often
assists borrowers in shopping abroad for machinery. Aside from expansion
projects, where procurement is usually tied to the same suppliers for proprie-
tary reasons, NIBID generally insists that its clients obtain quotations
from at least three different firms. NIBID's staff is capable of checking
civil engineering costs and verifying appropriate selection of machinery.
NIBID's disbursement procedures continue to be satisfactory.
3.10      Project Supervision.  In view of the rapidly increasing number of
equity investments, NIBID now has a separate group within its Follow-up
and Transactions Department supervising its equity participations. Generally,
the extent of NIBID's supervision of the loan and equity portfolios is satis-
factory, with full progress reports being prepared for 36% of NIBID's clients
in 1974. In addition, field trips to clients are frequently done on an in-
formal basis. Projects with loans in arrears receive the highest priority.
All clients are covered by a data collection system using the firms' annual



- 8 -
financial statements and other available information. By further increasing
staff and streamlining reporting procedures, NIBID hopes to cover the majority
of its clients with follow-up reports in 1975, or through appraisal of expan-
sion projects which also constitutes a form of supervision. The Transactions
Division, which reports to the same department head as the Follow-up Division,
oversees disbursements and the fulfillment of loan contract provisions. Both
divisions co-operate closely in supervising loans and investments.
Relations with the Government and Financial Community
3.11      NIBID has good relations with its parent NBG, the Central Bank and
the Government while maintaining its operational independence. NIBID's asso-
ciation with NBG has proved useful in obtaining long-term loans and, in case
of a few large projects, in setting up joint financing. Moreover, the two
institutions exchange information on clients' creditworthiness, which, given
NBG's many branch offices throughout the country constitutes a valuable source
of information for NIBID. Overall, however, NBG and NIBID compete with each
other in financing industrial projects. Joint financing ventures with HIDB
or IBG are infrequent, primarily because Greek industrial firms prefer to deal
with only one investment bank.
IV. NIBID'S OPERATIONS
4.01      NIBID's operations from January 1, 1964 to December 31, 1974 are
summarized in Annex 4. In 1974 approved loans and equity participations
totalled Dr 1,874 million, compared to Dr 1,772 million in 1973 and Dr 1,187
million in 1972.  The growth rate of total approvals was unusually high (49%)
in 1973, because many projects slipped from 1972 into 1973 due to staff con-
straints; consequently, the 1974 performance was better than reflected by the
above comparison, especially given the slowdown in the economy. Operations,
as shown in Annex 4 and elsewhere, are not broken down into domestic and
foreign currency transactions, because the drachma is convertible for the
purpose of importing equipment and machinery as well as raw materials. In
1973 and 1974, roughly 40% of NIBID's operations financed the import of
machinery and equipment. In 1974 commitments and disbursements related to
total approvals increased in proportion,indicating a reduction of the time
lag in processing projects after approval.
Loans
4.02      In 1973 and 1974 loans accounted for slightly over 80% of NIBID's
business in terms of approvals, the balance representing equity investments.
In 1974, NIBID granted loans totalling Dr 1,555 million for 57 projects.
Total loan approvals during the two years 1973 and 1974 were about 48% higher
than during the preceding two-year period, with most of the growth occuring
in 1973. The rate of interest charged on loans is the maximum legal rate,
which varied during the past two years between 7.5% and the present rate of



-9-
10.5%. 1/ In addition, a 1% commission is charged per annum. On certain
loans a profit-tied increment of up to 1.5% is charged, market conditions
permitting; however, due to competition NIBID usually charges a lower profit-
tied increment (income from this source has amounted on the average to 0.17%
of the loan portfolio).
4.03      Foreign Exchange Risk.  The foreign exchange risk of prior Bank
loans to NIBID has been borne by BG, as has the risk on other foreign ex-
change borrowings through 1973. The Government's policy is to maintain the
convertibility of the drachma and thus assume the foreign exchange risk for
most long-term industrial investments requiring capital imports.  Borrowers
can obtain long-term drachma loans from a variety of sources and convert what-
ever is required into foreign exchange. For this reason passing on the
foreign exchange risk to the ultimate borrower is generally only possible with
clients having an inherent hedge against foreign exchange risk, i.e., because
their exports go to the country in which the foreign exchange loan is denominated.
In the past only 5% of NIBID's loans carried the foreign exchange risk. For a
few months in 1974 the Government experimented with a policy of passing on the
foreign exchange risk to large industrial borrowers. This policy had a detri-
mental effect on investment activities, and the Government reverted to the
previous convertibility of the drachma for the purpose of authorized imports of
capital goods.
Equity Investments
4.04      In 1974 NIBID's approvals of equity investments remained at the pre-
vious year's level of Dr 318 million. 2/ Compared with the period 1971 and
1972, however, equity investments approved during 1973 and 1974 more than
doubled and thus expanded at a faster rate than loans. NIBID's equity partici-
pations are more important in relation to its total business than is the case
with its competitors. Its success in this field is primarily due to the
climate of mutual esteem and confidence that it has established with its
clients and the fact that NIBID often provides the seed capital for new
ventures. In 1974, NIBID continued to turn over part of its portfolio
through the Athens Stock Exchange or the mutual funds, thereby realizing
capital gains of about Dr 31 million. As further discussed under para 5.06,
the sale of shares from NIBID's equity portfolio contributes significantly to
its profitability, besides stimulating the development of the capital market.
4.05      In the second half of 1974, NIBID became a shareholder in Frab-Bank
International, one of the largest Euro-Arab banking institutions, with head-
quarters located in France. Half of Frab-Bank's share capital belongs to a
number of major European and Japanese banks, while the other half is owned
1/ The legal ceiling on the lending rate fluctuated as follows: January-
June 1973 - 7.5%, July-October 1973 = 9.5%, November 1973-January 1974
8.5%, since February 1974 = 10.5%.
2/ In terms of commitments, equity investments continued to increase in 1974.



- 10 -
by banks and financial institutions in Arab countries, primarily Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait. NIBID's share in Frab-Bank amounts to only 1%; nevertheless,
NIBID hopes its participation will provide an opportunity to attract foreign
capital into Greece and help establish business contacts between Greek and
Arab firms.
Characteristics of Operations 1/
4.06      Geographical Distribution.  In 1971 55% of NIBID's financing was
for projects in the Athens-Piraeus area, but this share has constantly de-
clined over time and dropped to 19% in 1974. Since the greater Athens-Piraeus
area and most of the remaining parts of Attica have become more industrialized,
the entire area with the exception of Lavrion was declared "developed" for the
purpose of eligibility for regional development incentives (see map). The re-
maining provinces of Greece are classified either as less developed or least
developed. In line with this categorization, NIBID has been successful in
making use of Government investment incentives (para 2.07) in achieving a
regional dispersion in its operations. The percentage of its projects lo-
cated in the "developed" area dropped from 49% in 1972 to 44% in 1973 and
32% in 1974.
4.07      Sectoral Distribution.  NIBID continues to assist a wide range of
Greek industry. Of the Dr 1.9 billion net approvals made in 1974, the main
beneficiaries were: building materials (24%), textiles (23%), metal products
(17%), and chemicals and pharmaceuticals (14%), the balance being spread over
11 other sectors including tourism. Since the last Bank loan this implies
a reduced exposure in textiles (share in 1973 30%) and a sharp decline in
the financing of the food processing sector from a little less than 15% of
total approvals during 1971-73 to 4% in 1974. The drop last year can be at-
tributed to the unfavorable performance of agriculture in 1973 which--with
some delay--affected investment decisions in 1974. The share of metal prod-
ucts has been fluctuating over the past few years and soared in 1974 mostly
as a result of NIBID's equity investment in a large steel plant. NIBID's
investment pattern broadly reflects existing investment opportunities. The
comparatively high exposure in textiles and metals does not constitute a high
risk, as both sectors are export-oriented. The allocation of financing is
about the same for loans and equity participations with the exception of tex-
tiles (higher share of loans) and tourism (higher equity participation).
4.08      Size and Terms of Loans and Investments.  NIBID finances approxim-
ately 40% of total project cost. The average size of NIBID's operations was
about Dr 21 million (US$700,000) in 1973 and Dr 23 million (approximately
1/   Analyses of the characteristics of NIBID's operations in terms of type
of industry, size and geographical distribution are given in Annex 6
and map.



- 1 1 -
US$770,000) in 1974, an increase from Dr 16-17 million in prior years reflect-
ing both rising prices and the trend towards more sophisticated technology.
However, more than 60% of the number of projects approved in 1974 were for
sums below Dr 16 million. Thus, the high average size of NIBID's operations
disguises the fact that the majority of projects it finances involves smaller-
and medium-sized industries. Over 50% of the companies for which loans were
approved in 1971-74 had fixed assets below Dr 50 million.
4.09      Since its inception NIBID has approved loans and investments in 502
projects, of which 28% were new projects. In terms of funds received, the
share of new projects is somewhat higher (30%). The percentage of new projects
changes from year to year and there is no apparent trend. There is no evi-
dence to support the conclusion that the high percentage of expansion projects
financed indicates that NIBID follows a too conservative lending policy. On
the contrary, as confirmed by the business community, NIBID is more prepared
to accept reasonable risks than its competitors, because its appraisal capa-
bility permits it to do so. Under the fourth loan 70% of subloans were for a
term of ten years, 20% for nine years and 10% for eight years. This pattern
is expected to continue.
Economic Impact
4.10      Since 1971 NIBID has maintained its share of about 20% of total
long-term finance extended to the industrial sector. This is an accomplish-
ment since NIBID is competing with the Government-owned HIDB as well as with
the commercial banks and the third investment bank, IBG. While HIDB is the
largest and most important channel for public financing to industry, the
commercial banks also compete in order to attract additional clients for
short- and medium-term credit (also, they are required by banking regulations
to extend the equivalent of at least 15% of deposits as term loans). IBG's
market share in financing industrial investments on the other hand, has
declined and it is now only about one-fourth of NIBID's size in this respect.
NIBID's main advantage over its competitors is the better service and tech-
nical assistance it is able to offer its clients.
4.11      Employment Creation.  Increased employment resulting from projects
approved by NIBID is estimated at 4,500 jobs for 1973 and 3,000 for 1974.
The average cost per job created comes to US$48,000. This relatively high
figure reflects the emphasis of part of Greek industry on export-oriented,
capital-intensive projects such as petrochemicals, steel, and base metals,
and the comparatively low level of unemployment.  By contributing to the
modernization of manufacturing industries increasingly exposed to internation-
al competition, NIBID is preserving jobs which otherwise might be endangered.
Under these circumstances increasing productivity in the manufacturing sector
is of higher priority than creation of new jobs. Moreover, by computing the
economic rate of return of major sub-projects NIBID helps ensure an economic
allocation of resources.
4.12      Export Performance.  The three major industrial exporting sectors
in Greece, food processing, textiles, and basic metals, absorbed more than 45%
of NIBID's financing in 1973 and 1974. In particular, the textile industry



- 12 -
benefited from NIBID's assistance. Of the 300,000 new spindles put into
operation during the last five years, NIBID financed the installation of
about 50% through long-term loans and equity investments. Overall, expected
proceeds from exports by projects approved in 1974 amount to Dr 2 billion
a year which constitutes roughly 40% of total sales of all projects financed
in that year. NIBID is therefore contributing significantly to the foreign
exchange earning capacity of Greek industry.
4.13      Secondary Effects.  NIBID's significant involvement in financing
agro-based industries--apart from augmenting exports--has contributed to
agricultural output, employment, income and dispersion of industry. The
food-processing industry has stimulated the development and diversification
of agriculture by gradually readjusting crop production to meet the industry's
requirements. Similarly, due to the expansion of the textile industry, cotton
production,which had been declining&has subsequently increased substantially.
4.14      Contribution to Capital Markets.  Since July 1973 all of NIBID's
non-voting stock is held by the public. Moreover, NIBID has acquired shares
in a number of unlisted companies and helped introduce some of them to the
Athens Stock Exchange and through the Exchange sold these shares to the public.
NIBID has also broadened ownership by selling shares of five companies to the
DELOS Mutual Fund.
4.15      Although dependent to a large extent on NBG funding, NIBID also
plays a useful role in promoting the domestic capital market. It converts
short-term funds collected by NBG through deposits by the general public into
long-term finance to industry offering specialized services beyond the reach
of a commercial bank. Floating of bonds has not been possible for reasons
explained in para 4.17.
Progress in Meeting the Objectives of the Fourth Bank Loan
4.16      The fourth Bank loan of US$15 million became effective on March 28,
1974. By March 31, 1975 about US$14 million of this loan had been committed
and it is expected that the remainder will have been committed by mid-1975.
The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by mid-1976.
4.17      At the time of the fourth Bank loan, there appeared to be good
prospects that NIBID would be able to undertake a number of foreign and do-
mestic borrowing operations and thus become less dependent on official Greek
and IBRD resources. For a number of reasons this diversification did not
take place. NIBID's efforts to raise foreign exchange resources on commercial
tterms included negotiations with one of its foreign shareholders for an
!uropean issue and discussions with a Middle East Government. Market conditions,
the Government's reluctance to assume the foreign exchange risk (para 4.03) and,
more importantly,the Cyprus crisis,prevented these borrowings from being under-
taken.  The issue of domestic bonds was prevented by the high rate of domestic in-
flation which kept even the Government from issuing bonds. The gap in NIBID's



- 13 -
resources caused by these events was filled by the Bank of Greece and NBC,
enabling NIBID to achieve its projected level of operations.
4.18      Another objective of the fourth Bank loan was to strengthen NIBID's
economic analysis of projects by applying the economic rate of return method-
ology. By the end of 1974, NIBID had calculated the economic rate of return
for ten projects. The resulting returns ranged from 12% (a chemical plant,
importing most raw materials) to 27% (manufacture of cables); half of the
projects have a rate of return of over 20%. These returns are satisfactory. 1/
V. NIBID'S FINANCIAL SITUATION
Resource Position
5.01      From its establishment in 1963 to December 31, 1974, NIBID has under-
taken long-term borrowings equivalent to approximately US$253 million (for
details see Annex 6). Of this amount the Bank of Greece has supplied 33%,
NBG 35%, IBRD 29% and NIBID's European shareholders 3%. NIBID also raised
local resources through the issuance of preferred shares.
5.02      As of December 31, 1974 total resources available to NIBID amounted
to Dr 7,412 million (US$247 million) of which borrowings, including Bank funds,
were Dr 5,983 million (US$199 million). 2/ On the same date, NIBID's total
uncommitted resources were Dr 381 million (US$13 million equivalent) of which
US$1 million was from the last Bank loan.
Quality of Portfolio
5.03      Loan Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1974, NIBID had loans outstand-
ing totalling Dr 5,739 million (US$191 million) in 227 companies. At that date
arrears of principal and interest over three months amounted to Dr 1l5 million.
The total principal affected by these loans in arrears was Dr 650 million, re-
presenting 11.4% of the loan portfolio (see Annex 7). Compared with the
corresponding ratio of 2.1% for December 31, 1973 , the arrears position has
worsened significantly, reflecting the general problems of the economy. How-
ever, as indicated in the Annex, as of December 31, 1974 only ten companies
were in arrears by more than 12 months, with total principal affected represent-
ing 2.3% of the portfolio. In its history NIBID has had to write off only two
loans, totalling Dr 4.6 million, and both involved service businesses. None

of the companies in arrears as of December 31, 1974 was in liquidation and, in
most cases, NIBID did not think it necessary to resort to rescheduling. On
the principal in arrears NIBID collects the maximum interest of 12.5% includ-
ing 1% penalty.
5.04      A review of companies in arrears indicates that only five are
having structural problems. They account for an outstanding amount of Dr
37.7 million which is equivalent to 0.7% of the portfolio. Provisions made
against possible losses amount to Dr 132 million, excluding provisions made
for tax purposes of another Dr 136 million. NIBID is therefore adequately
protected against losses, and its loan portfolio can be considered sound.
With the expected gradual recovery of the Greek economy, the arrears position
should improve significantly.
5.05      Equity Portfolio.  Annex 8 summarizes information on NIBID's equity
investments as of December 1974. At that date NIBID's shareholdings were in
54 companies at an aggregate acquisition cost of Dr 854 million, represent-
ing 13% of total loan and equity portfolio. Only five of the companies are
listed on the Athens Stock Exchange (110 industrial and commercial companies
are quoted on the exchange). As of December 31, 1974, the aggregate market
value for quoted stock and the book value of unquoted stock were equivalent
to 160% of acquisition cost.
5.06      Of the companies in which NIBID holds equity investments, 37 ope-
rated profitably in 1973, 9 are still in the pre-operational stage and 8 ran
into losses during 1973. The two largest investments, Dr 155 million in a
steel company and Dr 64 million in an aluminum company, account for 30% of
NIBID's equity portfolio. Depending on market conditions NIBID attempts from
time to time to reduce the imbalance in the portfolio by selling part of the
shares of its large investments. Overall, NIBID's equity participation consti-
tutes its most profitable activity with 1974 earnings of Dr 41.1 million (5.7%
of the average equity portfolio) from dividends, of Dr 30.9 million (4.3% of thq
average equity portfolio) from realized capital gains, and Dr 16.3 million
(par value) from stock dividends.
5.07      NIBID continues to promote the DELOS Mutual Fund, in which it has
a 50% interest (equivalent to Dr 5 million). In addition, it has invested in
50,000 Fund units of Dr 500 each. Investment decisions must be unani-
mously taken by the Investment Committee, on which the three shareholders -
NIBID, DEGAB (a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank A.G.) and the Hellenic Shipowners
Company - are represented. This ensures that there is no conflict of interest
in NIBID's dealings with the Fund. At the end of 1974 the number of units in
circulation was 726,000 and the total assets of the Fund Dr 410 million.
NIBID's earnings from its shareholdings in the management company of the Fund
(including advisory fees received) and from dividends on the 50,000 Fund units
it holds are estimated at Dr 2.5 million for 1974, which represents a return
of 8% on funds invested. The number of unit holders has been fluctuating be-
tween 4,000 and 5,000, which is rather low for a fund of this nature. The
DELOS Fund needs further improvement of its publicity and marketing program
and an expanded supply of suitable securities. A recent change in management
is expected to result in a more dynamic operation.

Financial Performance
5.08      Up to 1970 NIBID had a rather low profitability.  While profits after
provisions were below 7% of average net worth in the period 1968 to 1970 this
ratio increased significantly in the last three years to 16%-17%. 1/ The
rising profitability is primarily due to NIBID's equity investments. As a
result of the booming stock market, NIBID has realized sizable capital gains
since 1972. In addition, dividend income more than tripled in 1974, in part
due to extraordinary earnings from a major recent equity investment and the
increase of the equity portfolio by 42% in 1974.
5.09      In 1974 NIBID operated on a gross margin on total assets (including
income from equity investments) of 3.1%. The average spread between the cost
of borrowing and income from lending was around 1.9% during the last two years.
Salaries and administrative expenses have remained constant at 0.7% of average
total assets, which is low and reflects efficiency of operations. The spread
on the proposed Bank loan would be 3% at current interest rate levels.
5.10      In the past four years dividends declared by NIBID increased slight-
ly from 5% to 6.6% in 1974 (NIBID's dividend payments are low compared to
those of commercial banks but comparable to IBG's dividend level). During the
same period the pay-out ratio decreased from 49% to 26%. For 1974 dividends
were raised to 7.7%. As in the past, NIBID expects to pay no corporate tax
due to the liberal provision allowance permitted under Greek tax law and a
partial exemption from tax on income of investment banks.
Financial Position
5.11      Annex 10 gives NIBID's audited balance sheets for 1970-74.  NIBID's
total assets increased by 30% in 1974, while the equity portfolio grew by 42%.
The loan and equity portfolios represented 82% and 12% of total assets, re-
spectively. The ratio of term debt to equity as of December 31, 1974, was
7.3:1, which compares with a maximum limit, agreed upon with the Bank, of 8:1.
5.12      The book value of NIBID's shares as of December 31, 1974 was Dr 821
million, which is 183% of par value (Dr 3,000 per share) compared with 160%
at the end of 1973. NIBID's preferred non-voting stock is traded at consider-
ably higher prices; the premium over book value represents the potential for
capital gains in NIBID's equity portfolio as well as the institution's future
prospects for growth.  At a price of Dr 13,000 (March 19, 1975) 2/, NIBID's
price/earnings ratio is 16.4.
1/   Due to generous provisions, profits were not subject to tax in the period
under review.
2/   This compares with a price of Dr 14,000 to 15,000 per share during late
1973 and early 1974; the decline since then is lower than the drop of
the general price index for shares.

Audit
5.13      NIBID's accounts are audited by the Institute of Certified Public
Accountants of Greece, and the audit reports submitted to the Bank are
satisfactory. NIBID's fiscal year ends on December 31 and the auditors give
their opinion generally within three months in a short report, which is em-
bodied in NIBID's annual report to shareholders. Under the previous (fourth)
loan it was agreed that NIBID would furnish to the Bank: (i) certified copies
of NIBID's audited financial statements together with the auditors' opinion
within three months maximum, and (ii) the required long form audit report
within six months maximum. NIBID has confirmed its concurrence with the above
and indicated its intention to include a summary report of the audit when
submitting the audited financial statements within three months of the end
of the fiscal year.
VI. PROSPECTS
The Environment
6.01      Up to September 1974, Greek economic policy had to face the stag-
flation dilemma, attempting to promote economic activity while stopping
inflation. Since then greater attention has been given to fighting the re-
cession. The special tax on building permits was abolished and income taxes
for the lower and middle classes reduced. Most of the remaining credit re-
strictions that were imposed over the previous two years were shelved.  The
Government expects to present a revised five year plan by mid-1976 foreseeing
moderate public investment. The balance of payments is expected to remain
a difficult problem, at least for the next three or four years. In the absence
of any significant change in the international economic situation, or new
developments domestically, the beat that can be hoped for is a modest growth
in GNP of 2-3% in 1975 and 4-5% in 1976.
6.02      The Government is generally favorably disposed towards the manu-
facturing sector, which has to be further strengthened in order to withstand
the competition of full EEC membership which could come as early as 1980.
The business community, which hid postponed the implementation of many proj-
ects at the height of the external and domestic events in 1974, is expected
to resume plans for investment it the latter part of 1975 and in 1976. In-
flation was already on the decline dduring the second half of 1974 and is ex-
pected to stabilize at around 10% in 1975, a rate which the Government regards
acceptable in view of imported inflation and the need to overcome the reces-
sionary tendencies prevailing during the past 12 months.  Unofficial estimates
of Greek authorities put the growth rate of industrial investment in 1975 at
about 8% in real terms, or 18% in current prices; these rates are realistic
atid attainable.

Operations
6.03      NIBID's Forecast of Operations.  Annex 11 shows NIBID's forecast of
operations for the period 1975-79.  Assumptions are given in Annex 12.  Total
approvals are expected to increase from Dr 1.9 billion in 1974 to Dr 2.8 bil-
lion in 1976, which represents an average annual increase of somewhat more
than 20%.  For subsequent years the annual growth rate is projected to drop
to 10%.  A leveling off of the previous high growth rates seems plausible as
HIDB is expected to gain in importance as a channel of public funds to indus-
try (private and public). NIBID's pipeline of projects, which amounted to
about Dr 1 billion (US$33 million) as of January 1975, will support a compara-
tively high growth of operations for all of 1975, in spite of lagging economic
activities, at least in the first half of 1975. The estimated magnitude of
operations is perhaps conservative in that (i) it does not account for NIBID's
possible financing of a number of larger industries which it expects to pro-
mote (see para 6.04 subhead (d)), and (ii) it projects equity investments at
a rather constant level which, given past experience, may be too modest. Al-
together, NIBID's business projections are realistic and support the resource
mobilization effort now under way.
6.04      Lending Strategy.  In line with the present stage of development of
Greek industry and in support of the Government's broad conception of develop-
ment needs, NIBID plans to favor projects contributing to one or several of
the following objectives: (a) promotion of regional development, (b) utiliza-
tion of the agricultural potential (agro-based industries), (c) promotion of
exports, and (d) creation of large industries in petrochemicals, basic metals
and other fields. NIBID has already achieved significant progress in financ-
ing investments satisfying the first three of these criteria (see paras 4.06,
4.12, 4.13). These criteria are further detailed in Annex 17. NIBID has
confirmed its intention to continue to favor projects which promote export
growth, regional development and agro-industry.
6.05      Foreign Exchange Risk.  As explained in para 4.03, the convertibility
of the drachma makes it difficult for NIBID to pass on the foreign exchange
risk to its borrowers. The Government has therefore agreed to assume the
foreign exchange risk on the proposed loan, as it has in the past.
6.06      Utilization of the Proposed Loan.  NIBID's priority areas as de-
scribed comprise a sensible strategy for operations. Although promotion of
a few large industries also form part of NIBID's objectives, the proposed
loan will in principle not be utilized for that purpose. Rather, in line
with the Bank's general policy of lending to DFCs, loan funds would be spread
over a reasonable number of projects and the maximum size of any sub-loan or
investment financed with the proceeds of the proposed loan would not exceed
US$3 million.  The proposed loan would be utilized to finance the full cost
of direct imports, 30% of the cost of civil works and 40% of machinery and
spare parts produced in Greece, these percentages representing the estimated
foreign exchange component of such items.



- 18 -
6.07      Under the previous Bank loan, the free limit was US$700,000 and
the aggregate free limit one-third of the loan amount, i.e. US$5 million.
Given NIBID's experience, demonstrated competence and improved appraisals,
it is proposed to raise the free limit to US$1 million. The aggregate free
limit would be half of the loan amount (para 8.03). NIBID will prepare
Economic Rate of Return calculations for all projects exceeding the free limit
of US$1 million and for a representative sample of projects financed from
other sources. The wider application of this method of economic analysis
should enable NIBID to arrive at firmer conclusions about the relative econo-
mic merits of projects covering a broad range of Greek industrial subsectors.
Resource Requirements
6.08      The expected growth of commitments for the period 1975-79 follows
approximately the projected increase of approvals (para 6.03), the annual
growth rates for 1975 and 1976 being 16% and 13%, respectively. In absolute
figures projected commitments amount to Dr 2.4 billion for 1975 and Dr 2.7
billion for 1976, or a total of Dr 5.1 billion (US$170 million). As in the
past, it is projected that about 40% of NIBID's loans will be used for direct
financing of imported capital goods. On a commitment basis, NIBID will there-
fore need foreign exchange resources of Dr 2.1 billion (US$70 million equiva-
lent) for 1975 and 1976 operations.
6.09      As of December 31, 1974, NIBID's uncommitted resources amounted to
about 380 million, out of the Dr 5.1 billion needed. Thus, NIBID will have
to raise about Dr 4.8 billion (US$160 million equivalent) in new domestic
and foreign resources over the two-year period 1975 and 1976 in order to cover
estimated commitments. Apart from cash generation, the sale of equity invest-
ments and the proposed Bank loan, NIBID expects funds from four sources:
-    NBG and the Bank of Greece
-    Domestic capital market
-    European Investment Bank (EIB) and Kreditanstalt
fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW)
-    International capital market and other foreign sources
6.10      Borrowings from NBG and BG.  NIBID has assurances from both banks
that further funds will be available.  For 1975 and 1976, NIBID expects a
total of Dr 1,750 million from NBG and the Bank of Greece together, probably
shared equally between the two banks (contracts with both banks for Dr 500
million each are pending). This amount would constitute about one-third of
NIBID's resource requirements, compared to an average of two-thirds over the
past five years.
6.11      Domestic Capital Market.  NIBID plans to raise Dr 450 million in
1976 through the sale of preferred non-voting shares (par value Dr 150 mil-
lion) at a 200% premium. NIBID has been successful in similarly sized opera-
tions. NIBID intends to prepare the grounds for the planned capital increase



- 19 -
by persuading larger companies, whose shares are included in its portfolio,
to get listed at the Athens Stock Exchange. It is expected that this measure
will raise equity investments to a price level above the book value, which in
turn will contribute to raising the price of NIBID's preferred shares in the
stock exchange. Moreover, a split of shares is planned to facilitate trading.
6.12      Borrowings from EIB and KfW.  NIBID was to have received funds from
EIB at the time of the first Bank loan to NIBID in 1967, but EIB financing
was withheld due to subsequent events. In July 1974 NIBID's discussions with
EIB were resumed, and NIBID expects to obtain a loan of about US$10 million
by mid-1975. An additional loan from KfW through the Government is likely to
be contracted in the second half of 1975.  It is expected to amount to another
US$10 million.
6.13      International Capital Market and Other Foreign Sources.  On several
occasions in the past, NIBID made plans to borrow on the international capital
market (see para 4.17).  Interest rates in the international markets have
eased recently, and a continuation of this trend is favorable for NIBID's
plans. Hopefully rates will decline to a point where term borrowing at a
fixed rate can be arranged, since the floating rate formula is impractical
and risky for NIBID whose lending rate to clients is limited by a Government
ceiling (also, Greek industrialists would not want term loans from NIBID on
a floating rate basis). At present NIBID is exploring opportunities of borrow-
ing from a number of financial institutions including the EXIM-Bank and two
European institutions with similar functions. To complement its foreign
exchange requirements NIBID would have to raise about US$15 million in 1976.
NIBID's representatives have confirmed their institution's intention to expend
maximum efforts in diversifying its resources, particularly foreign, and NIBID
will keep the Bank informed on the results.
6.14      Summary of Resources.  Over the 1975 and 1976 period, NIBID expects
to mobilize resources as follows:
Dr million
(a) Uncommitted resources as of December 31,
1974                                             380
(b)  NBG/BG for 1975 and 1976                         1,750
(c)  Increase of share capital in 1976                  450
(d)  EIB and KfW                                        600
(e) Borrowings from international capital
market and other foreign sources                 450
(f)  Internal cash generation                           740
Total resources                        4,370
To the extent that NIBID does not succeed in raising resources on the inter-
national capital market, it will have to increase its domestic borrowings,
most likely from NBG/BG,or else scale down the volume of operations.



- 20 -
6.15      Total anticipated resources of Dr 4,370 compare with expected commit-
ments of Dr 5,100 million, leaving a gap of about Dr 730 million (US$24-25 mil-
lion equivalent) for 1975 and 1976. A Bank loan of US$25 million would re-
present about 15% of the new resources (about US$160 million equivalent) which
NIBID needs to raise during the next two years (the Bank's share of meeting
NIBID's total resource needs dropped consistently from more than 50% under the
first loan to 15% under the fourth loan).
Financial Prospects
6.16      Projected Profitability.  Projected income statements for the years
1975-79 are shown in Annex 13 and the financial ratios derived from projected
accounts in Annex 15. As a result of the growth of operations, NIBID projects
a doubling of its net profit during the five-year period. Compared with the
return during the past few years, projected profits are probably on the low
side as capital gains from the sale of equity investments are not included,
though likely. The average spread of NIBID's lending operations, which was
about 1.9% in 1973 and 1974, is expected to stabilize at about 2.2% (for 1975
the average interest income is estimated at 9.8% on the average loan portfolio
whereas the average cost of borrowing is expected to be 7.6% on average bor-
rowings outstanding).
6.17      Net profits (excluding capital gains) as a percentage of average
assets are projected to rise from 1.6% in 1974 to 1.8% in 1976 and decline
again to their present level towards the end of the period under consideration.
Related to average equity, net profits, which yielded a ratio of 15.5% in 1974
(or 11.4% if capital gains are excluded from income), show a drop in 1976 be-
cause in that year the equity base will be broadened by an increase of share
capital. NIBID intends to increase dividends gradually from 7.7% in 1975
to about 10% towards the end of the period under review, the pay-out ratio
fluctuating between 25% and 30%. On the basis of the projected dividend policy
the book value of NIBID shares will rise from about 200% of par in 1975 to
330% of par by 1979.
6.18      Financial Position.  Projected balance sheets through 1979 are given
in Annex 14. During the five-year period, the annual growth rate of total
assets is anticipated to decline from 20% in 1975 to 14% in 1979, in line
with NIBID's expectations that the rapid growth during the past few years
cannot be maintained in the long run. Long-term debt will grow from Dr 7.2
billion (US$240 million equivalent) in 1975 to Dr 13.0 billion (US$433 million
equivalent). The debt/equity ratio as defined in the Loan Agreement (debt
with a maturity of more than one year including guarantees related to equity
as defined in Annex 9) is expected to come close to the limit of 8:1 in 1975
but will drop in 1976 to 5.5:1 due to the increase of share capital and will
remain well below the limit for the rest of the period.
6.19      Projected sources and uses of funds (Annex 16) indicate that
NIBID's debt service will remain within a satisfactory range of between 1.4:1
in 1975 and 1.2:1 in 1978 and 1979.



- 21 -
VII. THE LOAN--ITS OBJECTIVES AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      Industry, and particularly manufacturing, has been the most dynamic
sector in the past decade, and the industrial sector together with agriculture
have provided the bulk of Greece's foreign exchange earnings. In 1974, how-
ever, despite a substantial increase of 44% in total exports,the overall balance
of payments situation deteriorated, resulting in a fall in reserves and a
large volume of borrowing on unfavorable terms.  Greece's balance of payments
problem is largely long-term and structural, stemming from the heavy dependence
on imports and the vulnerability of earnings derived from shipping, tourism
and workers' remittances, all of which underscores the need for greater
efforts to stimulate export industries and export-oriented agriculture. To
help foster this growth in agriculture and industry, Greece urgently needs
long-term capital on favorable terms. Taking into account NIBID's projected
level of commitments, its financing needs, and its proven competence in promot-
ing industrial development, including projects which are export-oriented and
located in the less-developed regions of Greece, further Bank support of
NIBID is well justified.  In addition, given NIBID's ability to disburse funds
rapidly, the proposed loan would assist the Greek economy, whose balance of
payments is expected to remain under considerable pressure in the immediate
future.
7.02      NIBID has demonstrated that it is an effective intermediary in
channeling long-term resources to viable projects. It operates in a competi-
tive banking environment where it has established an excellent reputation.
Even at times of slackening business activity--as evidenced in 1974 and at
present-- it has succeeded in expanding operations. NIBID actively promotes
new ventures and contributes to income re-distribution in Greece by concentrat-
ing its operations in the less and least developed areas, as defined by the
Government. A sampling of projects financed (see Annex 18) indicates that
they are economically sound with high economic rates of return. NIBID is in
the process of further expanding its developmental role by acting as a catalyst
in defining and financing a number of large projects in the industrial sector,
and its management has developed guidelines for allocating resources to prior-
ity sectors.
7.03      NIBID is a mature, well-established and competent institution which
is fully capable of carrying out its role once Bank lending to it has ceased.
Its relationship to NBG, BG, and its foreign shareholders ensures that NIBID
will continue to have support in mobilizing resources.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      NIBID is a dynamic institution further expanding its developmental
role. It continues to be a creditworthy borrower of the Bank and is parti-
cularly suitable for quickly injecting fresh capital into the industrial sec-
tor. Thus, a Bank loan will contribute to easing the country's short-term



- 22 -
economic strains. Against this background, a Bank loan of US$25 million,
covering about 15% of NIBID's resource requirements during 1975-76, is
appropriate.
8.02      The terms of the proposed loan should be those normally applied to
Bank loans to dfcs, including the standard commitment charge. As under the
past two Bank loans, a fixed amortization schedule, approximating the compo-
site terms of sub-loans, would apply in view of NIBID's proven competence and
the fairly narrow range of sub-loan maturities. The recommended term of the
proposed loan is 12 years, including a grace period of 2 years. This conforms
to NIBID's actual experience and allows for a maximum individual sub-loan
term of about ten years and commitments under the loan over a maximum period
of about two years. However, the loan is expected to be committed and dis-
bursed faster than normal DFC loans.
8.03      NIBID has further refined its appraisal techniques for major
projects and plans to progressively extend the application of the Economic
Rate of Return methodology (paras. 6.07 and 8.04). In view of this, it is
recommended that the free limit for the use of Bank funds be raised from
US$700,000 to US$1 million. The aggregate free limit would be US$12.5 million,
equivalent to 50% of the Bank loan (previously one-third). NIBID will broaden
its equity base through an increase of its share capital in 1976; no adjust-
ment of the present debt/equity ratio (para 6.18) is required.
8.04      Assurances have been obtained that NIBID would submit certified
copies of its audited financial statements within three months of the end of
the fiscal year and the long-form audit report within six months (para 5.13).
In addition, understandings were reached on the following points:
A.  with the Government that:
1.   it will assume the foreign exchange risk as it has done
with previous Bank loans to NIBID without payment of any
fee by NIBID or its sub-borrowers using the proceeds of
the proposed loan (para 6.05).
B.   with NIBID that:
1.   it will continue to favor projects which promote export
growth, regional development and agro-industries (para
6.04);
2.   the maximum size of any sub-loan or investment financed
with the proceeds of the proposed loan will not normally
exceed US$3 million (para 6.06);
3.   NIBID will expend maximum efforts to diversify its re-
source base, particularly its foreign resources (para
6.13);



- 23 -
4.   NIBID will prepare Economic Rate of Return calculations
for all Bank financed investments and sub-loans exceed-
ing the free limit of US$1 million and in addition apply
this technique on a sample basis for projects financed
from other sources (para 6.07);
5.   when submitting its audited financial statements to the
Bank within three months of the fiscal year (see above),
NIBID will include the opinion of the auditors and a
summary report of the audit (para 5.13).

/1  Historical]y, NI3ID has taken advantage of large provisions against possible losses
per'itted by law, thereby lowering profits and building up reserves (at the end of
197Ii* provisions against possibe- losses had reaoW- 3.0'f of the total year-end loan
and equity portfolio with legal and speciAl reserves accounting for another 3.6%).
To sstimate actual net profits, t    fore, part of the provisions were considered
to pe vanecessary and treated as profits. To derive actual net profits and financial
posiition, notional provisions were calculated in such a way that the year-end aggre-
gate pPo6vision is equal to 2% of the year-end portfolio.

(c) Greek Gov't subordinated loan has 15-year term with 10-years grace and
five annual instalments thereafter.
(d) Sale of equity investments Dr 80 million in 1975 increasing by Dr 10 million
in each of the subsequent years. Sales are based on book value not accounting
for capital: gains.
(e) Share capital increase: in 1976 Dr 150 million non-voting stock at a
200% premium.
(f) Draw-downs on World Bank and European banks loans: 35%-40% of total loan
and equity disbursements of the year.
(g) Payment of dividends: 7 % on share capital in 1975 increasing to 8% in
1976, 9% in 1977 and 10% in 1978-79.
(h) Directors' fees: Dr 1.5 million a year.
(i) Corporate tax:
Due to the fact that part of NIBID's income is tax-free (treasury bills,
deposits, bond loans under LD 3746/57), the Bank's undistributed net
profits, after deduction of the provision for bad debts and the allocatio,-
of capital gains to the tax-free reserve (Law 148/67), are not likely to be
liable to corporate tax.

Lending Strategy
NIBID's management intends to give high priority to operations of
the following-characteristics:
(a) Regional Development. The Government's efforts to provide adequate
infrastructure facilities outside the greater Athens Piraeus area
are beginning to bear fruit. Roads and ports have been improved.
The creation of industrial estates (planned for Thessaloniki,
Volos, Patras and Iraklion) has progressed sufficiently in case of
Thessaloniki, where part of the estate has been completed, but is
still lagging elsewhere. NIBID,which has already allocated the
majority of its resources (66% in 1973 and 68% in 1974) to the
less developed and least developed parts of the country, as de-
fined by the Government, will continue its efforts in this
direction.  A quantitative target, however, is difficult to
establish, as the Government is likely to make changes in the
present system of regional development incentives (possibly
altering the classification of regions).
(b)  Promotion of Agro-Based Industries.  In the last few years industries
such as textiles, wood processing, vegetables and fruit canning, and
beverages have served as a basis for restructuring agriculture,
thereby reducing regional income disparities. NIBID contributed
to this development by channeling 49% of approved loans during
1971-73 to the industries mentioned. Irrigation schemes such as
the ones planned with IBRD assistance in two sites in Northern
Greece, have led to increased crop production thus providing pro-
cessing industries with raw materials. NIBID assigns a high priority
to further progress in this field.
(c) Promotion of Export-Orient6d Industries. The future growth of the
industrial sector will depend more on the country's export perfor-
mance than continued import substitution. In the latter field the
sector has already achieved a fair degree of self-sufficiency. Good
export prospects can be foreseen for a few large projects in
branches such as chemicals and base metals. Apart from large,
capital-intensive projects greater export orientation is a must
for manufacturing industries in branches where the domestic market
is insufficient to support optimum-sized plant capacity. Examples
are food processing, wood products and textiles. The best poten-
tial is for industrial activities requiring a medium level of
skills, as in such cases industrialized EEC member countries, faced
with high labor cost, refrain from a further build up of capacity,
favoring industries with a higher degree of sophistication. Greece,
which has responded to the resulting opening of the market, for
example, exports now 50% of the country's cotton production and
currently supplies about 30% of EEC's needs of tomatoe paste.
Greece's recent success in greatly stepping up exports proves



ANNEX 17
Page 2
that Greek manufacturers, with the help of modern technology,
can effectively compete in overseas markets meeting the require-
ments of adequate marketing, regularity of supply and high product
quality.  New Middle East markets, which already gained importance
for export of construction materials, such as cement, will provide
further outlets for Greek exports in addition to strengthened ties
to the EEC.  In financing export-oriented industries in the past,
NIBID's staff has accumulated the expertise to help clients in
working out viable projects and establishing contacts with markets
abroad.
(d) Projects of National Importance, Given adequate financing and
technical expertise, there is a case for implementing a few large
sized and capital-intensive projects from which substantial
developments in the form of backward and forward linkages can be
expected. Opportunities have been tentatively identified, but
the projects' viability has not yet been studied in sufficient
detail. Also, the size and complexity of these projects call for
foreign participation, which has not yet been secured. Examples
for such projects are petrochemical industries (use of products of
the Thassos Oil Refinery), manufacture of caustic soda in conjunction
with the completion of the Nessalonghi salines, manufacture of
ammonia fertilizer and of sulphuric acid using sulphur, obtained
from the refining of sulphur-rich oil and from Greek pyrite
deposits and expansion of the alumina production based on locally
available bauxite. The capital requirements of these large
industries go far beyond NIBID's financial scope, but NIBID can
nevertheless play a crucial role as a catalyst prQviding a link
between foreign capital, and technical expertise, and potential
Greek investors. Furthermore, NIBT can coordinate and participate
in the undertaking of pre-investment studies.  'To this end, NIBLD
is strengthening its Technical Department. It plans also to expand
its Economic Unit by employing two economists to undertake sector
studies. ETnally, NIBID intends to initiate the creation of a
panel of exports consisting of representatives of Government
bodies and the business cowmunity organized in a committee; its
task would be to gather information already available on these
tentatively identified projects and help to further define them.

Economic and Financial Rates of Return of NIBID Financed Proj.ects
By the end of 1974 ERR calculations have been undertaken
for the following projects:
Rates of Return
financial            Economic
(1)  E.P.A.S.                    14.9%                  19.0%
(2)  Shelman                     14.5%                  19.5%
(3)  Kyknos                      14.4%                  14.6%
(4) Chemical Industries of
Northern Greece           14.2%                  11.5%
(5)  Manuli Hellas               18.3%                  27.2%
(6)  Barco                       10.8%                  12.9%
(7)  Balkanexport                 33.7%                 23.4%
(8)  Hellenic Steel               20.5%                 26.7%
(9)  Henninger                    20.0%                 17.5%
(10)  Sp. Damigos K.H.M.          17.6%                  24.6%
These projects refer to different branches of industry such
as Foodstuffs (3), Beverages (9), Textiles (6), Wood and Cork (1,2,7),
Chemicals (4), Machinery and Electrical equipment (5,10), Metallurgical
Products (8). Seven of the ten projects had lower financial than economic
rates of return (the lowest being 11%). The three projects with higher
financial rates of return illustrate that in Greek industry there are still
pockets with protection or incentives higher than justified.
