JORDAN
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
STAEF APPRAISAL REPORT
I.  SECTOR-BACKGROUND
1.01-    Introduction.  The Government's present energy policy and strategy
were reviewed by the Bank as part of the Energy Sector Study -  and during
the preparation of the Energy Development Project (Loan 2371-JO). Subsequent
Bank energy missions have also reviewed the sector strategy with the
Government. Since Jordan is entirely dependent on imports to meet its
commercial energy needs, the policy is aimed at improving the efficiency with
which energy is supplied and consumed so as to reduce the relative impact of
the oil import bill on the country's balance of payments.
1.02     The strategy developed by the Government and the Bank focuses on:
(i) improving efficiency of energy consumption through retrofitting industrial
plants, the refinery and loss reduction in the power system, as well as
providing advice to non-industrial users of energy on  inservation methods;
(ii) improving efficiency in handling and distribution of petroleum products
by developing an economic storage and pipeline network system; (iii) adopting
pricing policies that would ensure economic efficiency and financial viability
of energy sector entities; (iv) improving energy planning; (v) economic
development of domestic energy resources (oil/gas, solar and wind energy and
oil shale); (vi) strengthening energy sector institutions in planning,
mwangement and technical areas; and (vii) development of consistent
subsectoral least-cost investment programs as a basis of sectoral
development. These are being pursued by the Government under the on-going
Energy Development Project (Loan 2371-JO) and the current Five-Year Plan. The
following section presents a brief overview of recent developments in the
sector.
1.03     Resource Base and Development Prospects.  Jordan's energy resources
consist of oil shale deposits, some tar sands, a small hydropower potential
(87 GWh per year), and a few low temperature geothermal sources. To date, no
commercially exploitable coal, lignite, uranium or oil and gas reserves are
known to exist. With the exception of solar and wind energy, Jordan's
endowment of energy is modest.
1.04     Unless a commercial discovery of oil2' or gas is made, the
prospects of domestic energy resources making a significant contribution to
1/ Jordan Energy Sector Study (E.S.S) Report No. 4012-JO, February 1983.
2/ Although the hydrocarbon structures have been found in a number of areas
where geological surveys have been carried out, drilling results to date'
have been disappointing. Recent discoveries in the Hamza field indicate
potential production levels of about 70 barrels per day. Jordan's present
requirement of crude oil is about 50,000 barrels per day.



-2-
meeting the country's commercial energy needs appear bleak in the foreseeable
future. However, the participation of the international oil companies in
petroleum exploration, as envisaged under the Government's recent program,
would greatly improve the probability of commercial discovery -of oil or -gas. -
The Government has initiated discussions with three international oil
companies on their participation in petroleum exploration. Current and
projected levels of international oil prices make the extraction of oil from
oil shale deposits uneconomic at the current level of the technology. There
is uncertainty about the extent and viability of geothermal resource as a
source of energy. The full development of the remaining hydropower potential
of 83 GWh per year-L is hampered by issues of riparian rights.  With the
cwrrent level of energy prices and their future projected levels, solar
energy - Jordan's main renewable energy resource - is not likely to make a
significant contribution to meeting household and agricultural commercial
energy needs unless a significant breakthrough in the technology occurs. The
Government, during the current Five-Year Plan, intends to set up an advisory
unit under the Royal Scientific Society (RSS) to provide technical
information, services and advice on solar and wind energy development.
1.05     Energy Consumption.  Gross energy consumption grew at an average rate
of about 151 per annum (p.a.) between 1970 and 1980 then the average rate
declined to 8% p.a., reaching 2.7 million toe in 1985. The decline in growth
rate of consumption is attributable to the slowdown of the economy. GNP
growth averaged about 5.7% p.a. between 1980 and 1985 compared to about 121
p.a. growth rate between 1975 and 1980.  Despite the slowdown of the economy,
energy intensity increased from 1.5 toe/1,000 JD of GNP in 1980 to 1.8
toe/l,000 JD of GNP in 1985 reflecting the commissioning of additional energy
intensive industries and expansions to existing ones between 1981 and 1985.
Energy intensity in Jordan is high compared to those of similar medium-income
countries. The Government is currently undertaking a program of energy
conservation in industry, the power system and the refinery on the basis of
recomnendations of .-onsultants' energy audit studies carried out under the
Energy Development Project (Loan 2371-JO). In addition, the Government has
initiated a program of energy conservation in non-industrial sectors by
setting up an advisory body within the Ministry of Energy ard Mineral
Resources (MMR) to provide technical advice on building and home insulation,
heating and cooling.
1.06     Gross consumption of energy- i  forecast to grow at about 5S p.a. from
1985 reaching about 3.4 million toe by 1990, based on expected average growth
rate of GNP of about 4% p.a.
1.07    Electricity Consumption.  Electricity consumption in Jordan grew from
about 179 GVh in 1971 to about 1,772 GWh in 1985.  The increase was about 192
p.a. from the early 1970s through 1980 and about 152 p.a. between 1980 and '
1985.  This decline was due to the relative slowdown of tLe economy during
this period.  Presently, about-871 of the total population have access to
public electricity supply.
1.08     Electricity consumption, excluding projected sales to Syria of 360
GWh p.a. from 1986 to 1990, is forecast to grow at an average rate of about
I_ Currently, only about 4 GWh per year on the Zarqa River is developed.



102 p.a. from 1985, reaching about 2,?26 GWh by 1990 when access to public
electricity supply is expected to reach about 100% of the urban population and
about 902 of the rural population.  Between 1990 and 1994 the growth of demand
is expected to average about 61 p.a. and about 5% p.a. thereafter. A summary
of actual and projected demand for electricity is provided in Table-l.
Details are in Annex 1.1.

1.09     Petroleum Product Priciag:  During the preparation of the Energy
Development Project in 1983, petroleum product prices were on the average
about 1131 of the economic cost. As of April 1986, each product WLs priced
above its economic cost and the consumption-weighted average price was about
173S of economic cost. This was due to the removal of the subsidy on jet fuel
to the national airline (ALIA), reduction in the subsidy on fuel oil, and,
mainly, to the recent fall in international oil prices. Despite the recent
fall in international oil prices the Government's present policy is to
maintain the prevailing retail prices to mobilize resources for the national
budget. Due to uncertainties surrounding future international oil prices, the
understanding that was reached with the Goverrment under Loan 2371-JO to phase
out subsidies on petroleum products over the medium term (1984-1989) has been

Electricity Tariffs..
1.10     Tariff Structure.  In late 1984 the following-changes were made in
electricity tariffs:  (i)  the introduction of uniform tariff structure for
the various consumer categories throughout the country; (ii) differential
adjustments in electricity rates which led to an average increase of about 82'
in the average revenue per kilowatt-hour sold to final consumers.  As a
consequence, the average price of the Irbid District Electricity Company
(IDECO) to its domestic consumers declined from 64 fils/kWh (US$ 0.17/kWh) to
about 50 fils/kWh (US$0.13 kWh) presently.
1.11     The current tariff structure consists of peak kilowatt rates and
time-of-day kilowatt-hour rates for bulk supply to the distribution companies
and the large industries and for medium industries, increasing block rates for
domestic consumers and public buildings, flat kilowatt-hour rates for
commercial consumers and a declining block rate for small industrial
consumers. In addition, a Fixed charge per month is levied on domestic and
small industrial consumers. For large and medium industries, there is also a
penalty for poor power factor in addition to the rates.  The current tariff
structure is provided in Annex 1.4.



1.12     For industrial, water pumping and heating consumers, the existing
tariff structure does not provide sufficient incentive to shift part of their
demand from peak period to off-peak period. The proposed tariff study to be
undertaken by the Government (para. 1.14) would investigate the
appropriateness of the current tariff structure-for industrial Consumers and
for water pumping and heating and would provide recommendations for necessary
modifications to the tariff atructure.
1.13     Existing Tariffs and Economic Cost of SUPPlY. The overall average
electricity price is about 38 fils/kWh (US$0.10/kWh) ranging from an average
price of about 25 filslkWh (US$ 0.066/kWh) for bulk eupply to large industry
to an average of about 55 file/kWh (US$o.14/kwh) for-domestic consumers.
Street lighting is free. The economic cost of supply was estimated at about
30 fils/kWh (US$0.08/kWh). The estimate was based on an economic cost of
crude oil of JD 5.5 (US$14.4) per barrel to Jordan as of April 1986. The
average electricity prices to all consumers with the exception of rural
domestic consumers are above their respective economic costs. The average
prine to rural domestic consumers is about 90X of economic cost, however, the
average for the domestic consumer category, on the whole, is above economic
cost (1281). The overall average retail price is now about 125% of the
average economic cost of supply.    Table 3 shows the comparison of average
retail prices with economic cost as of April 1986.

1.14     The Government is initiating an energy pricing study to be financed
by USAID that would include: (iM review of the economic cost of electricity
supply; and (ii) design of consumer tariffs taking into consideration economic
efficiency in electricity consumption. financial viability of the power
entities and Government's social policy,.  In February 1986, the Bank provided
to the Government a draft Terms of Reference for the study which ia expected
to be completed by December 1987. During negotiations an understanding was
reached with the Government to exchange views with the Bank on the findings of
the study and its recommendations and on the steps to be taken for
implementing such recommendations.
1.15     Institution.  The Government created the Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources (MEMR) in late 1984 with the responsibility for formulating
policies on pricing and development of the energy sector.  Since the Ministry
is still in its formative stages, the Government recognixes the need to
strengthen its capabilities, and a program of training and recruitment is
under way to strengthen the Ministry (para. 2.13).   With the creation of the
Ministry, policy formulation and coordination of sector institutions is
expected to improve.

II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
2.01     Subsector Organization.  Several entities including the MEMR, the
Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), the-Jordanian Electric Power Company
(JEPCO) and the Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO), are responsible
for the development and the operation of Jordan's power subsector: (i) MEMR
is responsible for the development, coordination and pricing policy
formulation for the subsector and for regulating the operation of the private
enterprises in the power subsector; (ii) JEA, a financially and
administratively autonomous Government-owned utility, created in 1967, is
responsible for the formulation of plans for the overall development of the
power subsector, the construction and operation of generation and transmission
facilities for virtually all the publicly supplied electricity, bulk sales to
large industries and the distribution companies and for the distribution of
electricity in the areas under its jurisdiction. JEA is also responsible for
the formulation of the national rural electrification program in consultation
with the Ministry of Planning (MOP) and MEMR; (iii) JEPCO, a private company
owned by investors, JEA and the municipalities, distributes electricity in the
city of Amman and its environs and accounts for about 70% of total electricity
sold at the medium- and low-voltage levels in 1985; and (iv) IDECO is a
semi-private company owned by JEA, the municipalities of Irbid governorate,
and by private investors. IDECO's service covers a concessionary area
encompassing the governorates of Irbid and W'fraq with the exception of the
Jordan Valley area which is entrusted to JEA.  IDECO's sales in 1985 amounted
to about 15% of total electricity sold at the medium- and low-voltage levels.
2.02     Subsector Development.  Jordan's power subsector grew very rapidly in
the decade between 1970 aud 1980 mainly in response to the economic boom
experienced during that period (see para. 1.04). Installed generating
capacity increased from about 30 MW in 1970 to about 298 MW in 1980 and 692 MW
presently. The distribution system has expanded in unison with the growth in
generating and transmission capacities.
2.03     The private sector in Jordan has played a significant role in the
development of the subsector. JEPCO and IDECO are participating in the
development of the power distribution systems. Before the creation of JEA
large industries had their own generating plants of total-capacity of 84 MW
presently, which have now been connected to the national grid.  In addition to
meeting their own demand these industries supply electricity to the public
system during peak periods when JEA supply is inadequate to meet total system
demand.
2.04     Rural electrification has also expanded rapidly.  Access to public
electricity supply has increased from about 25% of rural population in 1975 to
about 85% at present.  Within the next five years, access to public
electricity supply is expected to reach about 902 of the rural population.
2.05    -Role of IDA/Bank.  The World Bank Group has been involved in six
operations in the power subsector.  The first two were made in the form of
credits (386-JO in 1973 for US$10 million and 570-JO in 1975 for US$5 million)



-                  o~~~8-
to support the Government's efforts in initiating the first stages for the
development of generation fscilities with 3x33-MW steam power units and
lx13-MW gas turbine at the Hussein power station, the reconditioning of-the
Marka diesel power station, and a study for the formulation of a plan for the
development of the transmission and distribution grids in the southern
region. The combined projects completion report for the two Credits (June
1982) states that the projects exceeded the expectations of the appraisal.
Loan 1688-JO (1979) of US$15 million financed the development of the national
transmission network and the extension of public supply of electricity to 33
villages in the areas served by JEA. The related completion=report (July
1984) indicates that the Project fully accomplished its objectives. Loan
1986-JO (1981) of US$25 million covered parts of the development programs of
JEA and JEPCO for the 1981-1984 period. Implementation of the Project has
been satisfactorily completed and the related Completion Report is being
prepared. Loan 2162-JO (1982) for US$35 million, with cofinancing from a
number of bilateral and multilateral institutions, assisted JEA in covering
the foreign exchange cost of a 2x130-MW thermal power station at Aqaba with a
total cost of about US$250 million. Implementation of the Project is
proceeding with only minor delays. Loan 2371-JO (1984) of US$30 million with
cofinancing from USAID and EEC covered the foreign exchange cost of parts of
the development programs of JEPCO's and IDECO's power distribution system, and
other operations, particularly in petroleum exploration, energy conservation
and energy planning, that would contribute to the improvement of Jordan's
overall energy efficiency. Implementation of the Project is now proceeding
satisfactorily after a slow start due to the Government's delay in meeting the
effectiveness conditions. The proposed Project would enable the Bank to
continue its efforts to achieve the institutional building objectives set
under the previous loans and the Energy Sector Study.
General Characteristics of the Electric Power System
2.06     Generation:  By the end of 1985, JEA's installed generating capacity
was 602 MW of which 60.31 (363 MW) was oil-fired steam units installed at the
Hussein Thermal Power Station (UTPS), 30.21 (182 MW) was gas turbine plant
firing heavy fuel oil and installed at HTPS, Amman South, Marka and Karak, and
the remaining 9.5% (57 MW) was diesel generator plants installed at Marka,
Karak, Tafila and Aqaba. Three diesel generator units with a total installed
capacity of 6 MW are owned and operated by IDECO. The first stage of-a new.
oil-fired power station - Aqaba Thermal Power Station (ATPS) - is under
construction with Bank's assistance: the 2x130 MW oil-fired units are
expected to be commissioned in late 1986 for the first unit, and early 1987
for the second unit.  Industries own a total of about 84 MW of installed
capacity in steam and diesel units which are connected to the public supply
system.
2.07     Transmission:  At the end of 1985, the transmission network consisted
of (i) 1,320 circuit-km of which 132-kV transmission lines (1,284 km), 230-kV
transmission (17 km) and 66-kV subtransmission (17 km) tie-lines with Syria;
and (ii) substation capacities totalling 1,370 MVA. The 400-kV transmission
line between ATPS and Amman South substation is currently under construction
and is expected to be commissioned in 1986. This line will be operated
initially at 132 kV.



2.08     Distribution:  The distribution networks at the end of 1985 consisted
of 34220 km of 33-kV, 1l-kV and 6.6-kV networks, and 8,500 km of 0.4-kV
network with substation capacity of 1,670 MVA.
2.09     Supervisory Control Centers:  JEA's generation and transmission
system and JEPCO's main distribution networks are respectively supervised and
controlled by two separate control centers which were introduced in 1983 to .
improve the quality of supply and operating efficiency. These centers will be
extended along with the development of JEA's generation and transmission
network and JEPCO's distribution network. The proposed Project would extend
JEPCOs control system by connecting existing control points installed in the
past two years to the control center.
2.10     Power System Losses:  Total power system losses are presently
estimated at about 161 and are expected to show a slight decline in the
foreseeable future. The losses consist of auxilliary constunption of about
6.61, transmission losses of about 1.4% and average distribution losses of
about 12X. Losses in the distribution systems are about 131 in JEA's system,
191 in IDECO's system and about 10% in JEPCO's system. JEA and IDECO have
relatively larger rural distribution than JEPCO. The loss levels in the
distribution systems are relatively high when compared to the economically
achievable levels of about 6-8X. Consequently, as part of the general power
system efficiency improvement program, the Government has initiated, under the
on-going Energy Development Project, a Load Research and Management Study,
with the assistance of consultants, which would (i) identify the sources and
nature of distribution system losses, provide recommendations and an action
plan to reduce them, (ii) provide information on consumers characteristics for
tariff design, and (iii) propose recommendations on load management. During
negotiations the Government agreed to provide the Bank for its comments an
action plan for the implementation of the recommendations of such study which
is expected to be completed by June 1987 (para. 6.01).
Manpower Development and Training
2.11     The labor force employed in the electric power,subsector has grown
mainly in the technical and administrative areas to meet the needs of the
rapidly expanding subsector. The total labor force has grown from about 3,500
employees in 1980 to about 4,162 in 1984 which is about 11 of the total
employed labor force in Jordan. Labor productivity in the power subsector has
also grown from 250 MWh sold per employee in 1980 to about 390 MWh sold per
employee in 1984. This is a relatively high productivity rate compared to
those of other countries in the region.
2.12     MEMR.  The Ministry is currently drawing up a training program that
would cover all areas of its operations.  The emphasis of the training program
is on strengthening its capabilities in the areas of planning and pricing.
Under the Energy Development Project (Loan 2371-Jo), the European Economic
Community (EEC) is financing an expert who is assisting the Ministry as well
as providing training to its planning staff in the establishment of an Energy
Data Base Management System (EDBMS). The EDBMS would serve as the-main input
for the Computer Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED) for energy demand
forecasting. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Bank are
providing training and technical advice on use of the MAED model.  In



- 10 -
addition, through EEC financing, the IAEA is providing training on the
integration of the Jordan macroeconomic model-and the energy planning models
(MAED and WASP III). In the area of pricing, the staff of the Ministry would
participate in the forthcoming energy pricing study which includes provision
for training of Jordanian participants.
2.13     JEA. The rapid expansion of electricity supply in Jordan has been
accompanied by the structural reorganization and development of JEA based on
the recommendations of the management consultants appointed under Credit
386-JO. JEA is well organized and properly managed and has already- proven its
capabilities in carrying out its responsibilities satisfactorily.  JEA pays
due attention to the training of its staff to improve its technical, financial
and administrative services. The training is being done overseas or locally
at JEA's Training Center located in Amman South. The introduction of hot line
work technique included in the Project would involve the training overseas of
selected maintenance crews and training personnel for the three entities JEA,
JEPCO and IDECO. Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive training
facility for the power subsector which would cover all the required servic!s,
JEA is working on a proposal from the Japanese Government which would provide
Jordan with a much improved training center to be made available to the three
power entities: JEA, JEPCO and IDECO. This training center would enhance
training of newly recruited peop'e and would provide improvement and upgrading
courses for the existing staff in the power entities.
2.14     JEPCO.  JEPCO is well organized and its staff, on the whole, are well
qualified. However, improvements are still needed in various areas;
especially in management, organization and finance and the Bank financed under
the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1986-JO) a Management Information System Study
(MIS), aimed at identifying the major issues and outlining strategies for
addressing thpm. The study was completed in September 1983. JEPCO has
started to implement recommendations on financial management. The proposed
Project would include implementation of recommendations aimed at addressing
the organizational structure with the reorganization of the existing
districts, personnel management with a comprehensive definition of functional
requirements, job analysis and description and'staffing needs, and operation
and maintenance services.
2.15     IDECO.  Although IDECO's operations are reasonably well managed
considering its size and remoteness, improvements are still needed in its
organization and management, particularly in finance and operation and
maintenance. Some of these weaknesses are being addressed under the ongoing
Energy Development Project (Loan 2371-JO) which represents the first Bank
operation with IDECO. A study financed by another donor and currently under
way would outline a strategy for strengthening IDECO's capabilities in the
area of financial planning.  The diagnostic study of the power distribution
system included in -the proposed Project would also outline measures for
improving IDECO's'efficiency in operations and maintenance.
2.16     Power System Planning.  Generation and transmission system planning.
is done by'JEA with the assistance of consultants. JEA has presently acquired
the WASP III computer model and MAED to improve its planning capability.
Assistance in the use of these programs is being provided by the IAEA and the
Bank through training and technical advice.  Distribution planning is in
accordance withAdistribution standards and is done by each of the power



- II -
entities separately for theitr various concession areas.  Based on a consistent
load forecast for tbe subsector prepared by the power entities, JEA's
least-cost power generation and transmission programs are combined with
distribution progrm  to form a least-cost development program for-the
subsector.

1II.  THE PROJECT
3.01     Project Objectives.  The main objectives of the Project are: (i) to
'help improve the efficiency with which energy is-supplied-by expanding
electricity supply from the grid to substitute for petroleum products, mainly
kerosene for lighting and to a lesser extent diesel fuel for isolated power
generation; (ii) to continue the implementation of some major investments that
would contribute to the improvement of Jordan's power system efficiency; and
(iii) to continue the institutional development objective initiated under the
previous loans by providing assistance in introducing new technologies,          .
reducing system losses and improving the power entities' management, planning
and forecasting capabilities. The Project, when completed will initially
extend the public electricity supply to about 32,000 new consumers and improve
the quality of service to about 73,000 existing consumers.
3.02     Proiect Description.  The Project, which is a continuation of the
Fourth Power Project (Loan 1986-JO) and the on-going Energy Development
Project (Loan 2371-JO), consists of the supply and installation of the
necessary equipment and material and the associated engineering services for
the implementation of high priority parts of the 1986-1990 national least-cost
program for the power subsector.  It involves:
(a)  rehabilitation and extension of the urban distribution network in
JEPCO's and IDECO's concession areas with the supply, construction
and erection of about 390 km of 11 and 33-kV lines, about 810 km of
380-V lines, about 180 MVA of power and distribution transformer
capacity, and three--phase and single-phase consumer connections;
(b) electrification of about 95 villages (35 villages in JEA's area, 45
villages in JEPCO's area and 15 villages in IDECO's area), with the
supply. construction, and erection of about 510 km of 33-kV and 380-V
lines and about 6 MVA of distribution transformer capacity, and
single-phase consumer connections;
-  . (c)  consulting services to assist JEPCO and IDECO in Project engineering
and construction supervision;
_(d)  implementation of the recommendations of the management information
system study undertaken under the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1986-JO);
(e)  supply of computer hardware and software and.equipment and tools for
operation and maintenance with specialized hot line work equipment
and associated training; and;
(f)  consulting services to undertake a diagnostic study of the -existing
power distribution system in Jordan with the objective of defining
measures to improve its managerial, operational and technical
efficiency.
Annex 3.1 gives a detailed description of the Project and Map IBRD 19554
indicates the location of the main Project components.
3.03     Status of Proiect Engineering.  JEPCO's and IDECO's programs for the
rehabilitation and expansion of the urban distribution networks have been



- 13 -
planned-on the basis of studies carried out by their respective staff with the
assistance of consultants Kennedy and Donkin (K&D) and Preece Cardew & Rider
(P.C.R.). respectively. These studies involve load flows for the 33-kV and
11-kV networks, investigation of distribution areas with voltage drops and
proposals of measures for rehabilitation. The methodology and results of
these studies have been reviewed by the Bank and found satisfactory. The Bank
has reviewed with JEPCO the scope of the work which remains to be done in the
upgrading of the 6.6-kV network in Amman, which started in 1982 with the
Bank's assistance (Loans 1986-JO and 2371-JO). During negotiations JEPCO
agreed to provide to the Bank by December 31, 1986 an action plan to ensure
completion of this upgrading operation by 1990 (para.-6.05).
3.04     For the rural electrification component, the Project design
constitutes the least-cost alternative for providing electricity service to
the concerned villages. The selection of the villages for electrification was
based on a ranking study, the methodology of which is acceptable to the Bank.
The technical specification of equipment and materials to be used were
reviewed and agreed by the appraisal mission.
3.05     JEA's, JEPCO's and IDECO's engineering departments are well staffed
and detailed Project design is well advanced (completed for JEPCO's rural
subcomponent and underway for the other Project subcomponents). Bidding
documents are expected to be issued starting May 1986.
3.06     Project Cost.  The total cost of the proposed Project including
physical and price contingencies but excluding interest during
constructionL' is estimated at about JD 26.80 million (US$71.65 million) of
which JD 17.95 million (US$47.95 million) is in foreign exchange. The cost
estimates do not include custom duties and taxes from which the power entities
are exempt.  Details of the cost estimates for the proposed Project are given
in Annexes 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 and summarized in Table 3.1 below.
The cost estimates for the Project are based on anticipated January 1986
prices derived from detailed data provided by the power entities and discussed
with the Bank and quotations received recently for equipment, materials and
services similar to those included in the proposed Project.  Total physical
contingencies are about 7% of the base cost because of the advanced stage of
the design and the repetitive and routine nature of the components for the
Project. Price contingencies have been computed assuming a five-year
disbursement profile as compared to the seven years relevant Bank standard
profile. This is justified by the fact that the power entities are good
performers, previous experience in project implementation has been very good
and project preparation is well advanced. Specific annual increases for
domestic and international prices are as follows:
1986      1987      1988       1989      1990      1991
Local (%)               5          7         7          7         7         7

1/ Interest is not capitalized for projects for which construction is
completed within the year in which construction began: this applies to
distribution projects.  The interest expense for the proposed Project is
treated as an operating expense and is paid from each utility's annual
earnings.

3.07     Project Financing.  The proposed Bank loan of US$27.5 million would
finance about 382 of the total cost of the proposed Project and 57% of its
foreign cost.  The remaining US$44.15 million would be covered by the power
entities' internal cash generation, customers, contributionsl' and
Government contribution.  A summary of the Project financing plan is given in

3.08     Lending Arrangement.  The proposed Bank loan would be made to the
Government. An amount of US$0.35 million will be retained by the Government
for implementing the diagnostic study of the power distribution system. The
remaining US$27.15 million would be on-lent to JEA (US$3.15 million), JEPCO
(US$20.0 million) and IDECO (US$4.0 million) on the same terms as the Bank
loan. This is reasonable in view of the fact that: (i) the Bank loan
represents non-concessionnary funds for JEPCO and IDECO which are responsible
for the implementation of the Government's rural electrification program; (ii)
the Government is a major shareholder in both companies; and (iii) the three
utilities have been able to secure loans for their development programs at
interest rates which are substantially lower than the on-lending rate proposed
for Bank loans. Execution of the subsidiary loan agreements between the
Government and JEA, JEPCO and IDECO shall be a condition of loan effectiveness
(para. 6.08). The foreign exchange risks would be borne by the power entities.
3.09     Engineering and Consulting Services.  JEPCO and IDECO were assisted
by their respective consulting firms K&D and P.C.R.- in preparing the proposed
Project. The services provided by K&D involved preliminary design of- the
network on the basis of the results of the load flow study, specifications of-
the equipment and cost estimate. The services provided by P.C.R. involved
only preliminary design for the rehabilitation of the main distribution
network in the cities of Irbid and Ramtha. It is important to underscore the
fact that the Bank's assistance in manpower development enabled JEPCO's and
IDECO's staff to substantially increase their participation in preparing the
proposed Project. In addition, and contrary to previous practices, the power
entities are expected to increase their involvement in engineering and
implementation of the proposed Project and would retain the services of K&D
for JEPCO and P.C.R. for IDECO only for specific tasks related to the
preparation of the bidding documents, evaluation of bids and supervision of
construction. In the case of JEPCO, the Project would therefore include about
340 man-months of consulting services for project engineering and supervision
at an estimated total cost of about US$4.20 million, of which about US$1.30
million would be in foreign exchange. In the case of IDECO, the Project would
include about 50 man-months of consulting services to implement the Project at
an estimated cost of about US$0.6 million and of which about US$0.11 million



- 16 -
would be in foreign exchange.  With regard to JEA component, the required
engineering services will be carried out by force account. In order to ensure
the timely implementation of the Project, JEPCO and IDECO agreed during
negotiations to provide evidence that the existing contracts with K&D and
P.C.R. respectively. have been amended to specifically include the services
required for the Project.'
3.10     With regard to JEPCO's component, implementation of the
recommendations of the Management Information System Study undertaken under
loan 1986-JO (para. 2.14) will involve supply of devices and equipment, such
as computer software and hardware,-and will require about 70 man-months of
consulting services at an estimated total cost of about US$0.80 million, of
which US$0.60 million would be in foreign exchange. These consulting services
will assist JEPCO in undertaking specific studies to cover: (i) organization
structure with definition of functional responsibilities, job analysis and
description, staffing needs and action plan for implementing the
recommendations; (ii) review and development of formal consumer services
procedures with introduction of up-to-date techniques for customer information
systems to provide the capability to respond rapidly to inquiries and
complaints; and (iii) review and development of modern materials management
system. The TORs related to these studies have been reviewed during
negotiations.
3.11     Implementation of the diagnostic study for the existing power
distribution system will be the responsibility of the MEMR and will require
about 40 man-months of consulting services at an estimated total cost of about
US$0.500 million, of which about US$0.350 million would be in foreign
exchange. TORs for this study (Annex 3.8) have been finalized and the
invitation for bids has been issued in March 1986.
3.12     Proiect Implementation.  The Project will be implemented by JEA,
JEPCO and IDECO, except for the Diagnostic Study of the power distribution
system which will be implemented by the Government through the MEMR. The
implementation of the Project which is only part of the extension and
rehabilitation of the existing system, is within the capabilities of the
entities. The Project implementation schedule is given in Annex 3.9. The
preparation of detailed design and tender documents for procurement of goods
and services are underway and would be completed by December L986.
Installation and erection of the facilities covered under the Project would
start in September 1987 and is expected to be completed by December 1990.
Upon commissioning, these facilities will be owned, operated and maintained by
JEA, JEPCO and IDECO.
3.13     Procurement.^ The goods and services to be procured for the Project
have been grouped into 6 packages for JEA's component, 12 packages for JEPCO's
component and 9 packages for IDECO's component.  Annexes 3.10,'3.11'and 3.12.
give the detailed list of these packages and their estimated procurement
schedule.  The packages proposed for Bank financing are listed in Tables 3.3,
3.4 aiA 3.5 below.  All items to be financed by the Bank will be'procured in
accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines.

Items (a) through (e) for JEA's component, (a) through (h) for JEPCO's
component and (a) through (e) for IDECO's component will be procured through
international competitive bidding (ICB). For procurement of goods through
ICB, local suppliers will be allowed a margin of preference equal to the
existing rate of custom duty applicable to nonexempt importers or 152 of the
c.i.f. price of such goods, whichever is lower. As there are a limited number
of suppliers for the specialized equipment such as autoreclosing circuit
breakers, hot line works equipment and computer software/hardware packages,
and as the amounts involved are also small the procurement for such goods and
services will be through limited international bidding (LIB).  Consulting
services for JEPCO and IDECO and for the Diagnostic Study of the existing
Jordan power distribution system will be procured in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Use of-Consultants. To complete their respective share
of the proposed Project, JEPCO and IDECO will provide the following goods and
services which will not be financed by the Bank: (i) JEPCO will arrange
financing for the procurement of conductors for the urban subcomponent,
substation equipment, and equipment and tools for operation and maintenance
which will be procured through ICB. JEPCO will carry out the installation and
erection works for the urban subcomponent by force account or local
contractors; and (ii) IDECO will arrange financing for the procurement of
low-voltage cables, poles and crossarms, and equipment and tools for operation
and maintenance which will be procured through ICB. IDECO will also carry out
the installation and erection works for the urban subcomponent by.force    -
account or local contractors. Local procurement procedures have been reviewed
and found acceptable to the Bank.  All the contracts for works and equipment -
and materials to be financed by the Bank and costing over US$250,000 each will
be subject to prior Bank review. Other Bank-financed contracts will be
subject to post-award review. Table 3.6 below summarizes the procurement
arrangements for the Project.

3.14     Disbursements - Special Account - Retroactive Financing.  The
disbursement from the proceeds of the proposed loan will be made for (i) 1001
of the foreign expenditures of directly imported equipment and materials or
100% of local ex-factory cost of goods manufactured--in Jordan; (ii) 4f5 of
total cost of contracts procured through ICB procedures for installation and
erection works for JEA's component and JEPCO's and IDECO's rural component;
and (iii) 851 of total expenditures for services of consultants domiciled in
Jordan and 1001 of foreign expenditures for services of other consultants for
JEPCO's components and for the diagnostic study of Jordan's power distribution
system. In order to avoid delays in Project Execution and given the large
number of relatively small contracts, disbursements for contracts below
US$50,000 equivalent -will be claimed under Statements of Expenditures (SOE),
documentadion of which will be retained for review by Bank missions. Also,
the Government agreed to open and maintain in US Dollars a special account of
US$2.0 million in a major commercial bank or in its Central Bank on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 6.01).
3.15     Retroactive financing of up to US$0.30 million is proposed for costs
incurred after December 1, 1985 for consultant's services for JEPCQ's
component and the diagnostic study of the power distribution system.
3.16     The estimated disbursements from the proposed loan are shown in Annex
3.13; they have been computed on the basis of a five-year profile instead of
the seven years EMENA Region standard profile given the fact that: (i) the
Project is a straight-forward distribution project; (ii) design work is well
advanced and bidding documents are being sent to the Bank for review; and
(iii) implementation experience for similar projects in Jordan is very good.
Annex 3.14 gives a comparison with the actual disbursement of Jordan Third
Power Project (Loan 1688-JO) and with the actual/estimated disbursement of
Jordan Fourth Power Project (Loan 1986-JO) which is near completion.
3.17     Environmental Impact.  The Project has no major adverse effects on
the environment. Possible adverse aesthetic impact would be kept at a minimum
level by suitable line routing. In addition, the Project has positive impact
by providing a higher quality of life, since lighting by electricity is
cleaner and less of a fire hazard than by kerosene lamp.
3.18     Project Risks.  There-are no major risks associated with the proposed
Project. However, there is some uncertainty surrounding JEA's likely
electricity sales. A sensitivity analysis with 102 reduction in sales
indicates that JEA would incur net operating income losses.  However, the
revenue covenant (para. 4.06) which requires Government actions to ensure
financial viability of JEA, would offset the above risk.  Land requirements
and rights-of-way for the Project components are secured.

IV. FINANCE
4.01     The combined Jordan power subsector (JEA, JEPCO and IDECO)
investments in electric utility assets as of December 31, 1985 amounted to
about US$600 million at book cost, of which about US$412 million was invested
from 1982 through 1985. For 1986 through 1994, it is estimated that the
combined power subsector would invest an additional US$824 million in
generation, transmission and distribution facilities. Annex 4.1 presents the
computation of the combined power subsector self-financing levels for
1982-1984 and projections for 1985-1994. The combined power subsector
obtained 322 of its total investments from internal sources for 1982-1985; and
projections indicate about 401 of the 1986-1994 investments would be raised
from internal sources.
4.02     Although the combined Jordan power subsector's financial position is
satisfactory, there are certain short-term weaknesses; however, the long-term
projections indicate an improving financial position. Investments in electric
utility power plants and transmission lines are very intensive in certain
years while benefits are derived over more than 30 years, consequently the
short-term yearly self-financing levels show wide variations. The following
is a graphic representation of the annual investments and the self financing
levels:

The annual investment in construction curve reflects the increase in
investments for Aqaba Phase I during 1984-1987 and Aqaba Phase II during
1989-1991.  The 1987-1988 fall in the annual self-financing curve is explained
largely by the expiration of the grace period for loans financing Aqaba
Phase I. This chapter will look into the short-term and long-term financial
positions of JEA, JEPCO and IDECO.
Revenue Shortfalls
4.03     Rural electrification is generally a losing proposition for a-utility
because the revenues from the consumers, particularly in the first few years
of electrification, normally fall short of the utilities' cost in providing
service. This is due to the low level of utilization of the capacity,
combined with the relatively large up-front investment required. In addition,
the supply of electricity for public   ghting is provided free of charge by
JEA, JEPCO and IDECO and further rea..es the average revenues per kWh sold by
the utilities. Rural electrification is in line with the national and social
objectives of the Government to provide services to the rural community at
reasonable cost. Since the Government's objectives for the subsector aim at
developing the utilities into financially viable and autonomous enterprises,
it is reasonable to expect the Government to compensate the utilities for
losses stemming from implementation of measures to meet the Government's
social objectives.
4.04     The above issues were discussed during negotiations for Loan 2371-JO  -
in October 1983 and, at that time, a committee was proposed to study the
issues and recommend measures to compensate the utilities for the losses of
revenues. At the time of negotiations the Government stated that the rural
fils tax -' which was in effect, would provide about JD 2 million annually
towards financing rural electrification and a new regulation would be
introduced to require rural beneficiaries to contribute a lump sum towards
investments in their communities. Since the proposed actions were estimated
sufficient to meet the revenue requirements of the entities, it was agreed not
to proceed with the establishment of the proposed committee. However, after
the 1984 tariff action, the rural fils tax was eliminated and the community
contribution was implemented for only one year in IDECO's area. Therefore the
financial problem for compensation of lost revenue is again an issue for the
power subsector. JEA's financial forecasts include a subsidy to IDECO for the
years 1985 through 1991; however, IDECO's financial projections (para. 4.36)
show additional financial shortfalls for 1987 through 1994, after allowing for
substantial improvements in operating efficiency. IDECO's financial
shortfalls are more severe than JEA's and JEPCO's due to the larger percentage
of rural consumers compared to the total number of consumers; however the
declining rate of return for JEPCO reflects the effects of the shortfall of
revenues from rural electrification and from free electricity supplies.  In
order to address the financial shortfalls, during negotiations the Government
agreed that during the annual review referred to in paras. 4.08, 4.21 and
4.32, consideration shall be given to the impact on the financial position of
IDECO for providing electrical services to rural areas (para. 6.01).

Jordan Electricity Authority
4.05     Accountin8.  JEA maintains its accounts under a uniform system of
accounts as recommended by consultants (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co.) and
similar to the accounts used by U.S. electric utilities. JEA has computerized
the accounts, and management is provided with timely monthly financial
reports.  A simplified corporate model is also on JEA's computer and is
utilized by the Planning Department, JEA's management, and the Government.
JEA's growth has been quite significant; consultants are reviewing JEA's
accounting procedures and computer requirements, and recomendations for
updating these are expected by April 30, 1986. A committee of representatives
from JEA, JEPCO, and IDECO meets periodically to review the recommendations
and define measures for the unification of the accounting systems of the
entities.
4.06     Accounts Receivable.  JEA's accounts receivable as of December 31,
1984, were JD 7.4 million from the electricity consumers and JD 1.7 million
for the sales of poles and other materials. The receivables from electricity
consumers amounted to 56 dayst billings caused by a dispute on the November
and December billings to JEPCO. The dispute was settled in January 1985 and,
as of September 30, 1985, JEA's accounts receivables were equivalent to 45
days' billings, which is within acceptable limits. However, due to the
present slowed economic conditions, JEA is encountering increased difficulties
in collecting industrial accounts as promptly as was previously experienced.
During negotiations, Government and JEA agreed to take all necessary actions
to ensure that JEA's accounts receivable do not exceed 45 days' billings
(para. 6.02).
4.07     Revenue Covenant.  A rate of return covenant was included in Credits
386-JO and 570-JO and Loan 1688-JO, but Government disagreed with the
principle of rate of return and particularly with revaluation of assets and
requested that a self-financing level-' covenant be substituted for the rate
of return covenant. The present revenue covenant for JEA was established
under Loan 1986-JO and repeated under Loan 2162-JO whereby Government and JEA
agreed to achieve self-financing levels of 25% in 1981 through 1983 and 35% in
1984 and thereafter. In 1981, when this covenant was drafted, JEA's
construction expenditures were estimated at JD 70.3 million for the years 1985
through 1987 compared to the present estimate of JD 105.0 million.  At the
time it was formulated (1981), this target was considered attainable in the
light of the least-cost investment programs of JEA and JEPCO and the projected
average growth in the electricity demand of about 132 annually from 1981 to
1995. However, due to the recent downturn in the economy, prospects for
future growth are less optimistic; as a result an average growth rate of only
about 8.52 per year appears achievable over the period 1985-1994. Although
the self-financing level of 35S would be met in 1989 and-thereafter with the
1/ Self-financing level is measured by adding net income before interest,
depreciation, customer contributions and customer deposits less debt
service (interest and amortization) divided by the average of construction
expenditures for the current and previous years.



- 24 -
current tariff levels, these would not be sufficient to achieve the currently
covenanted self-financing level of 352 in 1986, 1987 and 1988.  Electricity-
rates are currently sbove the economic cost of supply (para. 1.13).  The
Government is therefore reluctant to increase electricity rates only to meet
the self-financing level of 352 in 1986, 1987 and 1988 and requested that the
self-financing level be lowered for these years. On the basis of financial
projections agreed with JEA and which assume improvements in JEA's efficiency,
the maximum self-financing level that could be attained in 1986, 1987 and 1988
would be about 25% to 30%. These levels of internal cash generation would be
adequate to cover the local components of JEA's investments after meeting
operating expenses and debt service.- -Since the foreign exchange requirements
of on-going projects have already been secured, the financial position of JEA
would remain sound. Accordingly, the reduced self-financing levels of 25%-302
in these years is acceptable.
4.08     During negotiations, Government and JEA agreed to take all measures
as shall be required to produce funds from internal sources equivalent to not
less than 252 for fiscal years 1986 and 1987, 302 for fical year 1988, and 351
for fiscal year 1989 and each of the following fiscal years of JEA's average
capital expenditures for electricity operations for two years, comprising the
year in question and the next preceding year (para. 6.02). Due to the
financially sensitive effects of fuel prices, exchange rates, operating
expenses, and costs involved in construction, the financial projections should
be kept under annual review. During negotiations Government and JEA also
agreed to repeat the covenants under the existing loan agreements to:
(i) review, at least three months before the end of each fiscal year and on
the basis of forecasts satisfactory to the Bank, the adequacy of JEA's
revenues to meet the agreed self-financing level for the following year; and
(ii) on the basis of the above review, take all actions required to achieve
the agreed self-financing level (para. 6.02).
4.09     Past Performance and Present Position.  JEA's income statements,
balance sheets, and sources and applications of funds statements for the years
1982, 1983, and 1984 are given in Annex 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4. JEA's past
financial performance has been generally satisfactory. Its self-financing
level was 18% in 1982, 421 in 1983 (including the Government's fuel subsidy to
JEA) compared to the required 25%; however, in 1984 JEA achieved only 29%
(without fuel subsidies which were removed in 1984) compared to the required
35%. The following table sunmmarizes JEA's past and present financial
performance:

Due to the economic slow-down JEA's sales of electricity did not increase as
expected, and the December 13, 1984 tariff increase was not sufficient to
maintain JEA's financial position in 1985. In addition, this tariff increase
achieved, in-part-. the goal of energy-conservation by energy consumers cutting
back on their consumption; this reduced usage is reflected in reduced revenues
and the drop in JEA's estimated rate of return in 1985. JEA's self financing
level for 1983 is projected only at 22, and the rate of return on average net
fixed assets at Book cost is expected to be about 5.87-.
4.10     JEA's Financial Plan and Funds Statement.  The investments in JEA's
electricity assets as of December 31, 1985 were JD 159.3 million (stated at
book cost). The construction program for 1986 through 1994 (including
interest during construction) is estimated at about JD 227.8 million. JEA's
construction program and financing plan for 1986 through 1994 are suzmmarized

Internal Sources would provide a total of 46% of construction requirements and
the remaining balance of 542 would be from long-term borrowings.
4.11     Future Performance.  The economic slowdown and the resulting decline
in growth of JEA's sales would be offset by the recent agreement to supply
power to Syria. JEA's sales of electricity are estimated to grow about 8.$%
annually from 1985 through 1994. The forecast income statements, balance
sheets, sources and applications of funds, and computation of self-financing
levels are given in Annexes 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5.  The forecasts do not
assume any tariff increases and do not include any fuel subsidies from
Government, and the projections are made on-the basis of MEMK's declared
intention to exercise very tight control of wages, salaries, and
administrative expenses. JEA's ability to generate funds internally for
expansion is dependent on a variety of factors such as fuel cost, wages and
salaries, administrative costs, maintenance, debt service, and overall
operating efficiency. JEA is taking measures to maximize its efficiency and
to control costs. During negotiations the Government confirmed its policy to
continue to charge JEA the fuel prices ruling in 1985 notwithstanding any
decline in the price of oil which may accrue to the Government. Therefore,
fuel prices ruling in 1985 have been used in the financial projections. The
assumptions used for the financial projections are shown in Annex 4.14.
4.12     JEA's debt/equity ratio as of December 31, 1985 is 59/4', during the
1986-1994 period the debt/equity would increase to a high of 63/37 in 1986 but
would inprove by 1994 to 42/58, which are within acceptable levels.  JEA's
debt service coverage in 1985 was 1.64; by 1988 the debt service coverage
would drop as low as 1.08 but would improve to 1.5 and above from 1992-1994.
JEA's liquidity as reflected by the current ratio would be at acceptable
levels for all years. JEA's rate of return on revalued assets as of December
31, 1985 was only about 3.8% but would reach about 6.4% by 1994.
4.13     Provided that JEA can control its expenses, its financial position
over the long-term to 1994 is satisfactory; it would meet all of its annual
operating expenses and debt service, and provide a self-financing level of 46S
of its long-term investment program, which includes the completion of the
first phase of the Aqaba thermal power station and the additional coal-fired
units of Phase II of Aqaba.
4.14     Debt Service Coverage.  JEA's debt service coverage is presently-1.6,
but financial projections indicate it would drop to 1.08 in 1988.  Under Loan
1986-JO, JEA agreed to obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new long-term
borrowings unless the net revenue for each year during the term of the debt
(before depreciation and interest) is at least equal to 1.5 times the
projected debt service requirement for such years on all its debts incl'uding
the debt to be incurred. In order that JEA may raise quickly the funds
required for the planned construction program, the covenant is repeated but
modified to permit JEA in the period through 1994 to borrow, for the exclusive
purpose of construction,'amounts not to exceed the equivalent of US$1.0
million per-year (para. 6.03).
4.15     Auditing.  Under previous loans, JEA agreed to appoint independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank to audit its accounts and submit to the Bank
its audited financial statements and audit reports for each year not later
than five months after the end of the year.  The accounts of JEA are audited
by Shair & Co., a local firm. The auditing arrangements are generally



- 27 -
satisfactory and the reports have been submitted within the timeframe as
covenanted.  Rowever, due to the establishing of the Special Account and the
introduction of the SOE (para. 3.14), it is necessary to include auditing of
this account and the documentation for expenditures under the SOR provision.
Therefore, during negotiations JEA agreed to include such additional auditing
each fiscal year, and to include a separate opinion by the auditors as to
whether the proceeds of the Special Account and the amounts withdrawn from the
Loan Account on the basis of SOEs have been used for the purpose for which
they were provided (para. 6.03).
4.16,   Insurance.  JEA's arrangements for insurance coverage under the
previous loans have been satisfactory. Insurance coverage for its assets is
provided by local insurance companies operating under Government regulation.
JEA engages qualified inspectors to make annual inspection of boilers and
generating equipment and insurance against risks has been in such amounts as
considered consistent with sound utility practice. During negotiations JEA
agreed to repeat the existing covenants relating to insurance (para. 6.03).
4.17     Monitoring System.  The comprehensive set of key indicators agreed
under previous loans has been satisfactory for purposes of monitoring JEA's
technical and financial performance. During negotiations JEA agreed to
reporting to the Bank the agreed key indicators for technical and financial
performance (para. 6.03).
Jordanian Electric Power Company
4.18     Accounting.  Under Loan 1986-JO the consultants (Gilbert
Commonwealth) prepared a management study which included a recommended uniform
system of accounts. The recommended accounting system is similar to the
system used by JEA and meets the overall objective of the unified accounting
system for Jordan. Implementation of the recommended accounting system and
training of JEPCO's accounting staff by the consultants was provided under
Loan 1986-JO. The training program has been completed. Initially, the new
accounting system was run on JEPCO's computer in parallel with the existing
system and full implementation of the new accounting system began January 1,
1986.
4.19     Accounts Receivable.  Due to a breakdown of JEPCO's computer system
and the subsequent loss of billing data which required bringing in an
expatriate computer expert to re-establish the billing records, JEPCO's
accounts receivable as of December 31, 1984 amounted to 94 days' billings.
JEPCO's accounts receivable as of September 30, 1985 have been reduced to 69
days' billizgs, and further measures are being taken to reduce receivables.
To ensure JEPCO's cash position, and to eliminate unnecessary short-term
financing, the collections require constant monitoring and, at times, special
collection efforts. During negotiations JEPCO agreed to take all necessary
actions to maintain its accounts receivable at a level not to exceed 45 days'
billings (para. 6.05).
4.20     Revenue Covenant.  JEPCO agreed under Loans 1986-JO and 2371-JO to
generate internally, after the payment of taxes and dividends, at least 25% of



- 28 -
its construction requirements in 1982-and 1983 and at least 352 in 1984 and
thereafter. The level of self-financing is computed on the average of
construction expenditures for the current and the preceding years.
4.21     JEPCO has in the past achieved the agreed self-financing levels;
however, the self-financing level was achieved largely as a result of delaying
a major portion of its planned urban rehabilitation and rural electrification
programs.  The reduced and delayed rehabilitation and construction program is
very evident in 1984 and 1985, and the rural electrification program for
villages around Amman is behind the Government's planned program. The
proposed Project is set within a planned adequate level of construction for
1986 through 1994 for the electrification of these villages and the
rehabilitation of the urban network to improve quality of supply. Although
the self-financing ratio of 35% would be met in 1988 and thereafter, tariff
increases would be required in 1986 and 1987 to achieve the covenant.
Electricity tariffs are currently above the economic cost of supply and the
Government is reluctant to increase electricity rates only to meet the
self-financing level for 1986 and 1987. On the basis of financial projections
agreed with JEPCO and which assume improvements in JEPCO's efficiency, the
maximum self-financing levels that could be obtained in 1986 and 1987 would be
about 25S to 302.  These levels of internal cash generation would be adequate
to cover the local components of JEPCO's investments after meeting operating
expenses, debt service and payment of dividends. The financial position of
JEPCO would remain sound and the reduced cash generation in these years is
acceptable. During negotiations, Government and JEPCO agreed to take all
measures as shall be required to produce funds from internal sources to not
less than 252 for fiscal years 1986 and 1987, 30% for fiscal year 1988 and 35%
for fiscal year 1989 and thereafter of JEPCO's average capital expenditures
for electricity operations for two years, comprising the year in question and
the next preceding year (para. 6.04). Government and JEPCO also agreed to
repeat the covenants under the existing loan agreements to: (i} review, at
least three months before the end of each fiscal year and on the basis of
forecasts satisfactory to the Bank the adequacy of JEPCO's revenues to meet
the agreed self-financing level for the following year; and (ii) on the basis
of the above review, take all actions required to achieve the agreed
self-financing level (para. 6.04).
4.22     Past Performance and Present Position.  JEPCO's income statements,
balance sheets, sources and applications of funds and computation of-
self-financing levels for the years 1982, 1983 and 1984 are given in Annexes
4.7, 4.8, 4.9 and 4.10.  JEPCO's past financial performance has been generally
satisfactory. Its self-financing level was 57S in 1982, 29% in 1983, and 47%
in 1984 compared to the required 25% for the 1982 and 1983 and 35% in 1984;
however, the high levels of self-financing were achieved as a result of
delaying a portion of the planned construction program by about 35S.  JEPCO's
sales and revenues were affected similarly to JEA's (para. 4.07) by the tariff
increase. The following table summarizes JEPCO's past and present financial
performance:.

JEPCO would provide 502 of its.1986-1994 construction requirements from
internal sources. JEPCO's sales of shares, including the estimated premium on
share sales, would provide 72 of the construction requirements. The remaining
432 would come from long-term borrowings amounting to about US$75.8 million,
of which US$20 million would be provided by the proposed loan and the
remaining US$55.8 million is provided by ongoing loans of US$5.2 million and
future loans of US$50.6 million.
4.24     Future Financial Performance.  Projected income statements, balance
sheets, sources and applications of funds statements, and computation of &alf
financing ratios for the years 1985-1994 are given in Annexes 4.7, 4.8, 4.9
and 4.10. The forecasts assume increases in sales of 8.3X in 1986, 10.8% in
1987, 10.72 in 1988, 10.61 in 1989, 6.52 in 1990 and about- 5.02 annually in
1991 through 1994. There are no assumed tariff increases through 1994, and
administration costs and wages and salaries are assumed to increase annually
at about 11 and operation and maintenance costs to increase annually about
62. Although the projected intqrnal cash generation would provide 50% of
JEPCOs construction financing requirements for 1986-1994, the self-financing
level is projected at only about 28% in 1986 and 332 in 1987, increasing to
levels over 35% in the later years.
4.25     The low return on JEPCO's investments for rural electrification is
reflected in the financial projections for 1986 through 1994. In 1985 JEPCO's
rate of return, after taxes of 38.5%, was about 8% on assets at book cost and
42 on revalued assets but decreases by 1994 to 42 on assets at book cost and
only 1.82 on revalued assets. However, JEPCO's debt/equity averages a very
satisfactory 55/45 through 1994 and debt service coverage averages 1.4. The
low rate of return is reflected in JEPCO's liquidity through its current ratio
dropping from 1.6 in 1985 to only about l.0 from 1989 through 1994e The
projected dividend payments reflect the austerity measures.
4.26     Debt Service Coverage.  Under Loans 1986-JO and 2371-JO, JEPCO agreed
that it would not incur any debt without prior approval of the Bank unless its
net revenues (before depreciation and interest) less proposed dividends for
each year during the term of the debt is at least equal to 1.5 times the
projected debt service requirement for such year on all its debt, including
the debt to be incurred. In order that JEPCO may raise quickly the funds
required for the planned construction program, the covenant is repeated but
modified to permit JEPCO in the period through 1994 to borrow for the -
exclusive purpose of construction amounts not to exceed the equivalent of
US$1.0 million per year (para. 6.05).
4.27     Auditing.  Under previous loans, JEPCO agreed to appoint independent
auditors satisfactory to the Bank to audit its accounts and submit to the Bank
its audited financial statements and audit reports for each year, not later
than five months after the end of the year. The accounts of JEPCO are audited
by Khadder, Ramadan & Co., a local firm.  The auditing arrangements are         
satisfactory, and the reports have been submitted as covenanted. However, due
to the establishing of the Special Account-and the introduction of SOEs (para.
3.14), it is necessary to include auditing of this account and documentation
for the expenditures under the SO provision. Therefore, during negotiations
JEPCO agreed to include such additional auditing^each fiscal year, and to



- 31 -
include a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the proceeds of the
Special Account and the amounts withdrawn from the Loan Account on the basis
of SOs have been used for the purpose for which they were provided (para.
6.05).
4.28     In8uranee.  JEPCO's arrangements for insurance coverage under the
previous loan have been satisfactory. Insurance coverage for its assets is
provided by local insurance companies operating under Government regulation.
Insurance against risks has been in such amounts as considered consistent with
sound utility practice. During negotiations JEPCO agreed to repeat the
existing covenant relating to insurance (para. 6.05).
4.29     Monitoring System.  The comprehensive set of key indicators agreed
under Loan 2371-JO has been satisfactory for purposes of monitoring JEPCO's
tecbnical and financial performance. During negotiations JEPCO agreed to
reporting to the Bank the agreed key indicators for tecbnical and financial
performance (para. 6.05).
Irbid District Electricity Company Limited
4.30     AccountinM.  IDECO appointed consultants satisfactory to the Bank, in
agreement with Loan 2371-JO, to outline a plan for strengthening IDECO's
capabilities in financial planning, management and control. Although the
consultant's study is not yet completed, some recommendations regarding meter
reading, consumer billing and collections of accounts are being implemented by
IDECO. The consultant's recommendations regarding accounting and financial
control are expected to be presented in draft by June 30, 1986. The
consultant's recommendations will then be submitted to the Bank for comments.
Initially, IDECO would prepare its accounts using the recommended system in
parallel with its present accounting system to test accuracy before fully
implementating of the recommended system. The new accounting system is
expected to be fully operational not later than January 1, 1987 and would
conform to the accounting systems used by JEA and JEPCO.
4.31     Accounts Receivable.  IDECO's accounts receivable as of December 31,
1984 amounted to 69 days' billings as compared to the agreed level under Loan
2371-JO not to exceed 45 days' billings by December 31, 1984. The requirement
under Loan 2371-JO was rather ambitious considering the computer system in use
by IDECO, the absence of mail facilities and the rather large territory of
IDECO's distribution area. The consultant has completed the study of IDECO's
billing and collection procedures and has recommended several changes which
have now been implemented by IDECO. As of September 30, 1985, IDECO's
accounts receivable were reduced to 52 days' billings; however, one account,
the water pumping account, with three months' arrears represents a major
portion of the total arrears.  IDECO is monitoring the accounts receivable
very closely and is pressing Government to settle the water pumping arrears.
During negotiations IDECO agreed to take all measures necessary to maintain
its accounts receivable at a level not to exceed 45 days' billings (para.
6.07).

4.32     Revenue Covenant.  Under Loan 2371-JO, Government and IDECO agreed to
take all measures as shall be required to produce funds from IDECO's internal
sources, equivalent to not less than 20 for each of the fiscal years 1984
through 1988 and not less than 302 in 1989 and thereafter of IDECO's average
capital expenditures for two years, comprising the year in question and the
next preceding year.   The self-financing level of 20X (for 1984-1988) is
reasonable considering the rather large investment required to achieve the
Government's plan for electrifying the villages and towns in the Irbid area
and the rehabilitation of the existing network. During negotiations the
Government and IDECO agreed to repeat the existing covenants under Sections
4.03 and 4.04 of the Project Agreement under Loan 2371-JO (para. 6.06).
4.33     Past Performance and Present Position.  IDECO's income statements,
balance sheets, sources and applications of funds statements, and computation
of self-financing level for the years 1982, 1983 and 1984 are given ifs Annexes
4.11, 4.12,-4.13, and 4.14. IDECO's concession agreement provides for the
distribution of net profit as follows: (i) an amount equal to lfl of the
profit before Lax would be allocated to a reserve account; (ii) an amount not
exceeding 20% of net profit, as determined by the General Assembly of the
Shareholders, would be allocated to a voluntary reserve; and (iii) after
providing for appropriate remunerations for the Board of Directors, a portion
of the remaining profit as determined by the General Assembly of the
Shareholders would be distributed as dividends. IDECO has set its financial
goals within the framework of the provisions of the concession agreement.
4.34     IDECO's financial performance has been generally satisfactory.  Its
self financing level was 30b in 1982, 75X in 1983, and 31% in 1984 compared to
the required 20% for 1984 (1984 was the first year that the self-financing
level was covenanted). The rather high self-financing level achieved in 1983
and 1984 was due to: (i) a major portion of long-term debts of IDECO being
rescheduled with a grace period until 1988; (ii) IDECO did not pay dividends
in 1983; and (iii) due to shortage of funds and equipment, the proposed
construction program was reduced by about 352. IDECO's rate of return
improved in 1985 in contrast to JEA's (para. 4.08) and JEPCO's (para. 4.22)
due to the subsidy granted by JEA to offset the effects of the tariff
reduction in rural areas. The following table summarizes IDECO's past and
present financial performance:

million. IDECO's sources and applications of funds statements for 1985-1994

4.36     Future Performance.  IDECO's projected income statements, balance
sheets, sources and applications of funds statements, and computation of
self-financing levels for 1985 through 1994 are given in Annexes 4.11, 4.12,
4.13 and 4.14. Prior to the December 13, 1984 tariff actions taken by the
Government, IDECO's average revenue was 41.5 fils per kWh. The tariff action
taken by the Government unified the tariff structure throughout Jordan and
reduced IDECO's average tariff to 37.3 fils per kWh while electricity
purchased from JEA increased from 22.5 fils per kWh to 26.0 fils per kWh. To
offset this loss of revenues to IDECO a subsidy from JEA was established and
is being paid monthly to IDECO through a credit for electricity purchased from
JEA. The following table calculated from the financial projections, shows the
subsidy required by IDECO and the subsidy as set forth in JEA's financial
projections.

The above annual subsidy would be required for IDECO to meet its operating
expenses (including taxes), debt service, dividends and Director's fees. The
1986-1994 financial projections for IDECO assume improved efficiency and
control of costs, annual increases of only 8% for administrative expenses, 6%
for distribution expenses and loss reductions from 14% in 1985 to 10% in 1990
and 9% in 1991 and thereafter. The financial projections of JEA included
sufficient subsidy for IDECO to fully meet its financial obligations and the
financial covenant only for 1985 and 1986. The Government's agreement (para.
4.04) would address the issues of revenue shortfalls for 1987-1994.
4.37     Debt Service Coverage.  Under Loan 2371-JO, IDECO agreed not to incur
any debt without prior Bank approval unless its net revenues (before
depreciation and interest) less proposed dividends for each year during the
term of its debt is at least equal to 1.5 times the projected debt service
requirement for such year on all its debt, including the debt to be incurred.
Since IDECO's debt service coverage averages about 1.3 for 1986-1994, it is
necessary to keep under review IDECO's assumption of further debt
obligations. During negotiations IDECO agreed to repeat the debt service
coverage covenant under Loan 2371-JO in the proposed Loan (para. 6.07).
4.38     Auditing.  The accounts of IDECO are audited annually by auditors
appointed each year by the shareholders during their annual meeting in
accordance with the company's Articles of Incorporation. The local auditing
firm of Maroof T. Migbel & Co. has been appointed by IDECO to audit its
accounts for fiscal year ended December 31, 1985 (this auditing firm has been
appointed by IDECO for the past 10 years).  The auditing arrangements are
generally satisfactory to the Bank, and the audit reports have been submitted
to the Bank within the covenanted five months after the end of the fiscal
year. However, due to the establishing of the Special Account and the
introduction of the SOEs (para. 3.14), it would be necessary to amend the
audit covenant to include auditing of this account and the documentation for
the expenditures under the SOE provision. Therefor-, during negotiations
IDECO agreed to include such additional auditing ea.-h fiscal year, and to
include a separate opinion by the auditors as to whether the proceeds of the

4.39     Insurance.  IDECO's arrangements for insurance coverage under Loan
2371-JO have been satisfactory. Insurance coverage of its assets is provided
by local insurance companies operating under Government regulation. Insurance
against risks hAs been in such amounts as considered consistent with sound
utility practice.  During negotiations IDECO agreed to repeat the insurance''
covenant under the proposed L-oan (para. 6.07).
4.40     Monitoring Syst   .  The comprehensive set.of key indicators agreed
under Loan 2371-JO has been satisfactory for purposes of monitoring IDECO's
technical and financial performance. During negotiations IDECO agreed to
reporting to the Bank the agreed key indicators for technical ant financial
performance (para. 6.07).

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Electricity Demand
5.01     At the time of project completion, the total number of new rural
consumer connections, mostly households, is estimated at about 4,300 with a
total consumption of about 3,600 MWh. Electricity consumption is projected to
grow in these new rural markets at annual average rates of 8X from 1990 to
2000, 62 up to the year 2005 and 41 thereafter.  These increases include
expected growth in the number of consumers (Annex 5.1).
5.02    Most rural households in the areas to be electrified would take
public electricity supply because of the higher quality of electric lighting
compared with kerosene lighting, the greater convenience of some electrical
appliances, such as irons, fans and refrigerators and greater access to
television. This has been observed in almost all the rural areas that have
been electrified in the country.
5.03     The rehabilitation of parts of the urban distribution networks of
JEPCO and IDECO under the Project will lead to improvements in the quality of
service (improved voltage and reliability) to about 60,000 existing consumers
in JEPCO's area and about 13,000 existing consumers in IDECO's area as well as
enabling an increase in their level of consumption (Annex 5.1). In addition,
the expansion and rehabilitation of these networks would make it possible to
provide service to about 25,000 new urban consumers in JEPCO's area and 21700
new consumers in IDECO's area. The consumption of these new urban consumers
is expected to grow at the same rate as those of existing urban consumers.
Currently the specific household consumption in the urban markets served by
JEPCO and IDECO are about 2,800 kWh/year and 1,200 kWh/year, respectively.
B. Least-Cost Justification
5.04    The proposed Project is a continuation of the Government's rural
electrification and urban distribution programss which are part of the
medium-term national least-cost power development program (para. 3.04).
5.05     The least-cost means of electrifying a village under the Project was
made on the basis of comparison of the incremental economic cost of
electricity supply from the national interconnected grid to the economic cost
of supply from an isolated diesel generating set. It was estimated that the
break-even distance from the grid at which there would be no difference in
economic costs between grid extension and isolated diesel generation was about
8 km. Beyond this distance, isolated diesel generation appeared to be the
least-cost means of supplying electricity to a village. Seven out of the 95
villages included in the Project are at distances beyond 8 km of the existing
grid and are in JEA's area. JEA plans therefore to install isolated diesel
units in those villages. The least-cost means of supplying electricity to the
villages has therefore been adopted. Details of assumptions and analyses in
the comparison of cost grid extension to cost of isolated diesel generation,
are available in Project File.



- 37 -
5.06     The urban rehabilitation component of the Project would involves
reinforcement of existing medium and low voltage lines ag well as expansion of
the existing over-loaded transformer substations. Electricity supply in these
areas is currently characterized by frequent outages, and brown-outs due to
voltage and frequency drops. The voltage levels in parts of the presently
overloaded low-voltage networks range from about 140 volts to about 185 volts
as compared to normal levels of 200-230 volts. Reinforcement of the existing
distribution systems in these areas offer the only means of improving the
quality of service to the existing consumers as well as providing service to
new urban consumers in these areas. The Project is designed to achieve these
objectives at least cost.
C. Rate of Return
5.07     The rate of return (ROR) of each project component was first  =
calculated with benefits measured as revenues at existing tariffs and consumer
contributions. An adjusted rate of return (AROR) was then calculated for each
project component taking fuel savings, arising from mainly the substitution of
electricity for kerosene in lighting, as an additional project benefit.
Project benefits are still underestimated even with the inclusion of fuel-
savings (para. 5.09). Moreover, the projected growth in demand resulting from
the rehabilitation of the urban components does not fully capture the benefits
of improved quality of service (reliability, stable voltage, etc.). Therefore
the ARQRs do not fully represent the economic rates of return (ERRs) of the
project components. Summary results of rates of return calculations are
presented in Table 1.

5.08     The ARORs of JEA and JEPCO components are above the opporttnity cost
of capital in Jordan of about 102, whereas that of IDECO is below the
opportunity cost of capital. For the JEA component which is to serve a purely
rural market, the relatively high AROR is attributable to the fuel savings
that the electrification would capture. JEPCO's component is predominantly
urban rehabilitation and extension and therefore the AROR shows the adequacy
of the urban electricity price compared to the economic cost of supply (para.
1.12). Although IDECO's component is predominantly urban rehabilitation also,
the low AROR reflects the relatively high cost of the smaller rural
electrification subcomponent (see Annex 3.1) and the fact that about half of



- 38
the capital cost of the IDECO urban rehabilitation and extension involves
replacement and standardization of equipment, the benefit of which is not
fully captured since the benefits derived from improvement in quality of
service are not easily quantifiable. Consequently, the AROR shown
underestimates the true rate of return of the IDECO component.  Rowever, since
the component represents the least-cost means of supplying electricity (para.
5.05), it is justified despite the low rate of return. For the subsector as a
whole, the total Project is justified since the AROR is above the opportunity
cost of capital.
5.09     The ARORs were calculated on the basis of quantifiable costs and
benefits expressed in January 1986 prices. Costs consist of capital cost
(including physical contingencies), fixed operation and maintenance cost, the
long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of generation and transmission and short-run
marginal cost (SRMC) of fuel and other variable operating cost of supplying a
kilowatt-hour to the final consumer. Benefits consist of incremental revenues
at the existing rural and urban consumer tariffs, incremental revenues from
consumer contributions, and fuel savings arising from the substitution of
electricity for petroleum products consumed by rural households. The fuel
savings were estimated as difference in household expenditure on kerosene for
lighting and the expenditure on equivalent amount of electricity that would be
substituted for kerosene. In addition, it was estimated that about 601 of the
rural households who presently operate television sets on acid batteries would
switch to the use of electricity. The difference in cost to a household of
operating its television set on acid batteries and the cost of using the
equivalent amount of electricity to operate its television set was added to
the fuel savings. Separate estimates of fuel savings were made for the new
rural markets of JEA, JEPCO and IDECO. The estimates do not fully reflect the
true savings arising from the substitution of electricity for kerosene for
lighting since the higher quality of electric lighting over kerosene lighting
was not taken into consideration. Moreover, the greater convenience of
household electrical appliances (para. 5.02) was not taken into consideration
in estimating fuel savings. Assumptions underlying the ROR analyses are
provided in Annex 5.1. Details of calculations are shown in Annex 5.2.
5.10     Sensitivity Analysis. Due to uncertainties surrounding any
forecasts, sensitivity tests of the rates of return of the various project
components to changes in the capital cost and power sales were performed.  For
IDECO and JEPCO, the ARORs appear to be relatively insensitive to 10% increase
in capital cost but relatively sensitive to a 101 decline in projected power
sales.  For JEA, the AROR appears to be relatively insensitive to these
changes because fuel savings constitute the major component of project
benefits and is relatively unaffected by these changes.  Results of analyses
are summarized below.  Details of calculations are available in Project File.

SIXTH POWER PROJECT
Detailed Project Description
1.       The Bank has financed (Loan 1986-JO) and is financing (Loan 2371-JO)
parts of JEA's, JEPCO's and IDECO's 1981-1986 power distribution investment
programs in parallel with other commercial, bilateral and multinational
organization and financial institutions. The proposed Project is part of the
power entities' 1986-1990 program which is a continuation of the Government-
and the power entities' efforts in meeting the growth of demand, improving the
quality of supply and extending public supply of electricity to the rural
areas. In essence the Project would involve extension and rehabilitation of
JEPCO's and IDECO's urban distribution networks; electrification of 95
villages in JEA's, JEPCO's and IDECO's areas; supply of equipment and tools
for operation and maintenance of the distribution network; and consulting
services. Detailed information on all Project components with a list of
equipment and their main characteristics are available in the Project File;
the paragraphs below give some details on the major components.
Extension and Rehabilitation of the Urban Distribution Network
2.  -   Parts of the urban distribution networks in the concession areas of
JEPCO and IDECO, and more specifically in the cities of Amman and Zarqa for
JEPCO and Irbid and Ramtha for IDECO, are reaching their maximum capacity and
unless the networks are reinforced, the level of losses would -increase and the
quality of service would deteriorate significantly. The extension component
would extend the distribution network to allow for the supply of electricity
to about 31,900 new consumers. The rehabilitation component would complete
the upgrading operation of the old 6.6-kV network in Amman and Irbid, replace
the equipment that are currently overloaded to reduce the number of outages,
ensure improved quality of service and contribute towards the reduction of
losses from 10% in 1985 to about 9.6% in 1994 for JEPCO and from 18  in 1985
to about 9% in 1994 for IDECO. The Project would also result in the
installation of new 33-kV power transformer substations, the doubling of some
main feeders which would provide uninterrupted supply to the pockets of high
concentration of consumers and improve the system reliability. Attachment 1
gives some details on the characteristics of the urban component.
Rural Electrification
3.       The Project would extend public supply of electricity to about 1,970
rural consumers in 35 villages in JEA's area   , 1,840 rural consumers in 45
villages in JEPCO's area and 400 rural consumers in 15 villages in IDECO's
area. This would increase the access of rural consumers from 60T in 1985 to
85% in 1990. It would mainly displace kerosene currently being used for
household use. The list of the villages with their respective characteristics
is available in the Project File and the Attachment I gives the main
characteristics of the rural component for JEA, JEPCO and IDECO.
1/  Seven out of the 35 villages would be electrified by isolated diesel units.

JORDAN
SIXTH POWER PROJECT
DIAGNOSTIC (OR AUDIT) OF THE POWER DISTRIMUTION SYSTEM
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE
OBJECTIVE
1.       The objective of the audit is to define measures to be taken to
implement cost effective modification to the power distribution system
facilities, operations, and construction standards to improve the technical
efficiency of the system. This audit will highlight the areas requiring
urgent measures and will set the pattern for the progressive development of
the power distribution system.
The study will concern the three entities responsible for the power
distribution in Jordan namely: Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), the
Jordanian Electric Power Company (JEPCO), and the Irbid District Electricity
Company (IDECO).
SCOPE
2.       The audit will include sample diagnostic studies of distribution
circuit and facilities, a critical analysis of distribution system standards
and practices along with units prices of materials and installation and a
review of customer service activities including metering and billing.
ln-depth studies of such areas as management and organization, staffing,
financial and accounting procedures and tariffs are not included in the
proposed study except to the extent that the audit findings lead to
recommendations for further studies or improvements in such areas.
PROCEDURZS
3.       In order to assess the overall efficiency and capability of the
entity, a series of short interviews would be held with members of senior
management. This would show management's policy toward, and goals for,
improving the efficiency of the power distribution system. The informations
obtained on the problems ieing encountered would indicate where problems-were
occurring and what steps were taken or contemplated to resolve them and to
improve the efficiency of the system.
4.       The distribution system would be examined through discussions with
appropriate staff and site visits to substations, distribution workshops,
other facilities and customer service departments. Available statistics on
system performance would be analysed.

ANNEX 3.8
Page 2 of 3
5.       An assessment of the performance of operating practices and of the
efficiency of existing distribution plants would be made through site visits,
discussions, inspection of the equipment and other records.
6.       Coordination with the ongoing load research and management study will
be sought.
REPORTING
7.       The results of the audit will be presented in a concise report.  The
recommendations will be presented in two phases.
A.       The first phase would be in the form of a short term preliminary
action program (PAP), which would outline immediate steps to be taken to
improve the most urgent problems. It would cover a period of two to three
years, would be described and given a justification and approximate cost
estimate. When required, a scope of work or terms of reference would be
provided to facilitate the contracting of consulting, engineering or other
services or the implementation of the activities recommended in the PAP. This
phase would include the following items where appropriate:
(f)  system planning methods and procedures 1/;
(2)  design criteria and construction standards;
(3)  standardization of electricity supply systems (voltage levels,
underground, overhead) and type of electrical equipment with the
objective of uniformity between the three entities concerned namely
JEA, JEPCO, and IDECO and investigation for taking advantage of
advances in technology;
(4)  construction methods, standards, equipment and procedures;
(5)  system operations and maintenance (maintenance programs, procedures
and effectiveness, crew organization, adequacy and condition of
equipment and manual for operation and maintenance, spare parts
stocks, etc.);
(6)  service outages and their causes;
(7) voltage control and monitoring procedures;
1/  To be coordinated with the ongoing load research and management study.



-59-
ANNEX 3.8
Page 3 of 3
(8)  distribution circuit analysis using computer-based programs and the
data-base for this analysis;
(9)  transformer specifications and load management-I/
(10) metering systems, operations, maintenance, testing, installations and
service standards;
(11) meter reading, billing and monitoring procedures (deeentralization
with possibility of introducing agencies to reduce burden on
headquarters offices);
(12) system and circuit power factor measurement and corrective measures;
(13) system technical loss assessment, value of losses and estimate of
loss reduction potential -';
(14) review of non-technical losses and measures to control them ';
(15) the needs for training programs will be assessed in as far as this is
related to improving Distribution Systems management.
B.       The second phase would be in the form of a long-term Distribution
System Betterment and Expansion Program covering a period of about five years
after PAP. This would have a general description, an order of magnitude cost
estimate and be defined objectively to specify desired results, criteria and
approach.
STAFFING AND WORK PROGRAM
8.       The consulting firm shall give its references foi equivalent studies
it performed with indication of location, average size of the concerned power
system, scope of the study and date. A sample of reporting will be welcome.
9.       The audit shall be performed by experienced engineers applying
judgemental analysis. The consultant will ensure performance of most parts of
the study in the field. The methodology, duration, staffing and resumes of
the staff to be assigned to the study will be clearly indicated. The
cooperating entities will provide data, office space, and counterpart staff
for the duration of the study.
1/  To be coordinated with the ongoing load research and management study.

8.       Distribution expenses of JEPCO and IDECO are projected to increase at
an annual rate of 6.
9.       Taxes.  Corporation taxes for JEPCO and IDECO are-calculated on the
present rate of 38.5% of taxable income and the University tax of 1 of
taxable income.
10.      Depreciation-is calculated using depreciation rates prescribed under
the laws of Jordan.
III. Balance Sheets
11.      Assets are carried at book value.  For purposes of proforma
revaluation, the following multipliers were used:
1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993   1994
JEA           157    160    163    168    173    178    183    188    193
JEPCO         185    190    193    198    203    208    213-   218    223
IDECO         185    191    200    205    210    213    216    219    225
The multipliers were developed based on net plant in service (removing fully
depreciated plant) and including plant under construction to eiiminate effects
of large investments coming in only after completion and to reflect present-
replacements costs for plant in service.
12.     Accounts receivables are projected to average about 45 days' billings.
13.      Long-term debt is calculated on existing debts at interest rates and
amortization schedules in effect; the proposed loan assumes interest at 8.5%
and 3/4 of 1% commitment fee and 17 years' repayment, including a 4-year grace
period. Other future loans assume terms similar to past loans..
14.      The entities capitalize interest to construction on projects that
require more than one year to complete; the distribution projects of JEPCO and
IDECO assume completion within the year started, and all interest is expensed
during 1986-1994.
15.      Customer contributions are based on the estimated cost of the
customer's portion of the supply line.
16.     Reserves are based on the statutory requirements and provisions of
the Articles of Association.
17.      Sales of JEPCO shares in 1986, 1988 and 1990 are assumed to sell with
a 50% premium; the premium is expected, not due to a return on investment but
rather on the undervalued assets carried on the balance sheets.

2.       The calculations are set out on pages,,L through 4 of Annex,5.2.  The
main assumptions underlying the analysis are presented below.
3.       Capital Cost of grid extension including physical contingencies were
taken from project cost tables provided in Annex 3.2.  All costs were
expressed in January 1986 prices.
4.       Fixed O&M. Annual fixed operation and maintenance cost was estimated
at about 1% of total capital cost.
5.       Electricity Consumption.  The following growth rates in the number of
consumers were adopted (para. 5.01).
1993-2000 - 4S p.a.
2001-2005 - 3% p.a.
2006-2020 - 21 p.a.
Specific consumption per connected rural household at project completion were
as follows:   JEA - 430 kWh/year, JEPCO - 900 kWh/year, and IDECO - 825
kWh/year. Electricity consumption was forecast to grow at the following'
annual average rates (para. 5.01):
1985-1990  -  10%
1990-20O0   -   82
2000-2005  -   6%
after 2005 -   4S

For urban households, specific consumption was assumed to be as follows:
JEPCO - 2,800 kWh/;ear and IDECO - 1,200 kWh year. Specific consumption was
assumed to grow at 22 per year.  Consumptiol was adjusted for losses of about
20% for gross generation to serve the final rural consumer and about 172 to
serve the final urban consumer.
Economic Cost of Supply
6.       Economic cost of supply from the national interconnected system was
based on the long run marginal cost (LRMC) of generation and transmission and
the short-run fuel and other variable costs of delivering a kilowatt-hour to
the final consumer. The economic cost of supply, excluding LRMC of
distribution was estimated at 30.4 fils/kWh (US$0.08IkWh) for supply to urban
households and 33.47 fils/kWh (US$0.09/kWh) for rural households. Details of
economic cost calculations are available in project files.
Benefits
7.       Benefits were measured as (i) incremental net sales valued at the
urban and rural electricity prices. Based on specific consumption in the new
market areas of the three power entities, different average prices were used.
These were:
JEA         66 fils/kWh (US$0.173/kWh)
JEPCO       56.28 filsS/Wh (US$0.148/kWh) for urban and
51.3 fils/kWh (US$0.135) for rural
IDECO       48 fils/kWh (US$0.126) for urban and
52.5 fils/kWh (US$0.136/kWh) for rural
(ii) Incremental revenues from connection charges at JD50 (US$135) per new
consumer; e I (iii) fuel savings.
8.       Fuel savings were calculated as the difference between household
expenditure on kerosene and expenditure on electricity for lighting. It is
assumed that each rural household consumes about 1.5 litres of kerosene per
day, mainly for lighting. This is to be replaced by an equivalent amount of
electricity. It was assumed that about 50%-75% of household consumption of
electricity would replace kerosene used mainly for lighting. The remainder of
of electricity purchased would be used in operating electrical appliances (TV
sets, radios and refrigerators). At the prevailing price of 65 fils/litre of
kerosene the daily household expenditure on kerosene was estiimated at 97.5
fils.  Based on the assumed specific consumption per consumer per year
(para. 5) and at the prevailing rural electricity prices (para. 7), separate
estimates of fuel savings arising from the substitution of electricity for
kerosene were made for each of the concession areas as follows:
JEA:    JD 21/year/household
JEPCO:  JD 13/year/household
IDECO:  JD 13/year/household

9.       In additioni it was assumed that about 60% of the rural households
who presently operate television sets on liquid acid batteries have to
recharge and replace them at annual operating and capital cost of about JD
60/year.  The difference between annual rural household expenditure on
operating its television set on acid battery and the expenditure on equivalent
amount of electricity was taken as an additional "fuel savings". These were
estimated as follows:
JEA:    JD 42/year
JEPCO: JD 45/year
IDECO: JD 46/year
Sensitivity Analysis
10.      Sensitivity of rates of return to changes in capital cost and
electricity demand were investigated. Results of analysis are provided
