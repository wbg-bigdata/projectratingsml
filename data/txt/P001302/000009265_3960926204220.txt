MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO KENYA
FOR A THIRD POPULATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendacion on a proposed
development credit to Kenya for SDR 9.00 million (US$12.2 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity and help finance a third
population project. The project would be cofinanced by NORAD for SDR 3.7
million (US$5.0 millicn equivalent) and ODA for SDR 6.2 million (US$8.4
million equivalent).
2.        Background.  Rapid population growth is probably Kenya's most
difficult. pervasive. and urgent development problem. Kenya was the first
Sub-Saharan African country to launch a National Family Planning (PP)
Program in 1967. Nevertheless, the rate of population growth increased from
3.3Z in 1969 tv 4.11 at present due to continued improvements in infant and
child mortality nd increase in fertility (mostly related to a decline in
breast feeding and reduction in post-partum abstinence). In response, the
government prepared a new PP Five-Year Program (1975-79) and the first IDA-
supported population project began in 1974. Although successful in
expanding the network of health services. the program and the project did
not meet their FP goals. The program relied too heavily on the supply of
services by a single ministry, the Ministry of Health (MMO). and did not
adequately promote demand. PP activities were not integrated with those of
other government ministries and non-governmental organizations (NGO). In
1982, the Government responded to these problems by developihg a population
sector strategy which placed emphasis on demand creation and expansiot% o. PP
services in rural areas. At the same time. a National Council on Population
and Development (NCPD) was established. The IDA financed Integrated Rural
Health and Family Planning (IRHEP) project (Credit 1238-KE) in 1982 has been
supporting implementation of this strategy.
3.        By mid-1984. it became clear that even though the strategy was
sound and should be continued. fertility rates had not yet begun to go down
for a number of reasons. First, NCPD had been slow to establish itself. and
had not developed a national information. education and communication (INC)
program. Second, the MOH had continued to pay more attention to health
infrastructure than to FP services. Finally, the project excluded urbav
areas where attitudes to family planning were rapidly changing. To take
advantage of heightened political and social commitment to fertility
reduction. particularly in urban areas. the IRHFP project was amended (May
1985) to strengthen FP service provision by MOB. At the same time, the
NCPD's mandate was expanded and it was given additional manpower so that it
could function as a national population agency. This approach worked well.
and Kenya has now a sound institutional basis for its FP program, with NCPD
as a coordinating. funding. and monitoring agency and the MOR. other
Ministries and NGOs providing multi-sectoral. complementary support for both
demand generation and the supply of services ranging from natural family
planning to voluntary surgical sterilization. Meanwhile. it has become



-2-
increasingly clear that the MON, potentially the largest service provider in
the country. faces major budgetary. organizational, and managerial problem
which affect its ability to provide services. To allow government and IDA
to focus more thoroughly on the critical issues affecting the population and
health sectors, it was decided in September 1986 that IDA should,
henceforth, lend for separate population and health projects in Kenya.
ThUs. the proposed population project would reinforce the capacity of (a)
NCPD to generate demand for VP and coordinate the sector; (b) MOH to supply
FP staff services and facilities; and (c) other ministries and NGOs to
promote and deliver IF services. A subsequent Health Sector Financing
Project would focus on improving the financial management and organization
of the health sector.
4.        Project Obiectives:  The objectives of the project are to:  (a)
strengthen the capacity of NCPD to plan, program, finance, coordinate and
monitor population program activities: (b) create further demand for, and
acceptance of, FP services through the implementation of a strategically
planned and coordinated IEC program; and (c) increase the availability.
accessibility, and quality of FP services provided by the government and
NGOs.
5.        Project Description:  The proposed project has three components:
(a) continued support to NCPD. focusing on institutional development.
establishment of a management information system (MIS). a research and
evaluation capacity. dad initiation of district population programs; (b)
multisectoral population programs to expand VP demand and service delivery
in key government departments and ministries, including support for the
family health division of the MON; and (c) NGO programs focusing on IBC
expansion and service delivery. The project. to be disbursed over an eight
year period. provides funds for civil works; vehicles, furniture and
equipment; materials and supplies; technical assistance; overseas and local
training; monitoring. research and evaluation; and incremental operating
costs. Total estimated project cost is US$28.3 million equivalent. 35K of
which is foreign exchange. A breakdown of costs and the fincrcing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in Kenya are given in Schedules C and D. respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No.7053-KB, dated April 20. 1988. is attached. A map is
also attached.
6.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project builds upon
the experiences of two earlier projects, and will be critical in the
development of population programs at the district level and below.
Investment in the population sector is central to IDA's country strategy, in
that the rapid population growth can negate the benefits. in per capita
termsD of IDA involvement in other sectors. Previous IDA assistance has
concentrated on supply and demand and on institution building. This project
will further develop the population program through the establishment of
district level activities. External assistance will continue to be required
for the medium-term to achieve fertility decline through an effective
population program. IDA dialogue with NCPD and other senior government
officials on population and institutional policy issues is excellent and has
helped attract additional cofinancing for the sector.

7.        Actions Agreed.  Government would:  (a) by effectiveness:  (i)
establish an acceptable organization structure for the Media Production
Center under the NOH; (b) covenants: Government has also agreed to the
following dated covenants by October 31. 1988: (i) NCPD would submit a
timetable fo. holding national, regional and district workshops with NGOs;
(ii) NCPD would define the roles of district population officers and propose
district level coordination arrangements and a related training program;
(iii) MOH would submit a plan. acceptable to IDA. to ensure the quality of
the voluntary surgical contraception program; (iv) by October 1989
Government would appoint key personnel satisfactory to IDA at the Media
Production Center; (v) by December 31, 1989 NCPD would undertake a study of
NGO financing and adopt mutually agreeable recommendations one year later.
Other covenants are: (i) a list of research priorities would be agreed every
year with IDA starting with March 1. 1989; (ii) all proposals for funding
new NGO activities under the project would be submitted to IDA for prior
review and approval; (iii) audits of project accounts and SOEs acceptable to
IDA would be carried out; and (iv) acceptable annual work plans including
adequate budgetary allocations would be submitted by March 31 of each year
and a amtd-term review based thereon would be undertaken no later than
December 31. 1990; (c) As a-condition of disbursement of the funds relating
to incremental operating costs for the MOH. the Ministry will prepare by
March 30 of each year an acceptable annual plan of action focusing primarily
on policy and implementation issues. and will implement it by March 30 of
the subsequent year.
8.        Benefits.  The proposed project would reinforce institution
building activities initiated through the IRHFP project, further strengthen
the NCPD and consolidate and expand multisectoral population programs under
key government ministries (especially MOH) and NGOs. The project would
expand demand for FP as well as service provision and so benefit about 6
million people within 14 selected districts whose population (14.5 million)
is 652 of the country's total. Wider acceptance of family planning would
reduce fertility and slow the rate of population growth.
9.        Risks. The main risks of this project relate to the
administrative. managerial and financial capabilities in the family health
division of the MOR. the ability of the NCPD to coordinate and manage an
expanding multisectoral program. and the dependency of NGOs on NCPD for
funding. New appointments and organizational development assistance to the
family health division. and the appointment of a technical deputy director
in NCPD are expected to alleviate the first and second risks respectively.
To address the third risk, a study will be undertaken to examine possible
alternative mechanisms to finance NGOs including development of fund raising
techniques and improving local support and contributions.
