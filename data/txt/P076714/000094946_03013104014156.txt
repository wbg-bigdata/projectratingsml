Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Project Background
The proposed Tongling-Tangkou Highway Project (the TTH or the Project) is located in the Wannan (south
Anhui) mountainous and economically disadvantaged region in Anhui Province, P. R. China. The TTH is a
section of the Hefei-Tongling-Huangshan expressway which, in turn, is a key element of the national trunk
highway, the Tianjin to Shantou expressway. The TTH is designed to form a key south-north road
transportation corridor in the Anhui Provincial highway network, as well as a critical road connecting
provincial capital Hefei with the significant tourism sites of "Two Mountains and One Lake" (Huangshan
Mountain, Jiuhuashan Mountain and Taiping Lake). The construction and operation of the TTH is expected
to greatly improve the transportation network, accelerate the economic development in the poverty region
and promote the tourism of Anhui Province.
The proposed project will start from the end of Lutong expressway, through Tongling City (Tongling
County), Chizhou City (Qingyang County, Shitai County) and Huangshan City (Huangshan District) and
ends at Shancha village near Huangshan mountain where it connects with state highway G205. The total
length of the recommended route the project is 116.146 km.
Development of the project started at the end of 1990's. In November 2001, Anhui Provincial Road
Exploration and'Design Institute prepared the Pre-feasibility Study Report and in December 2001 completed
the Feasibility Study Report. The preliminary was completed in August 2002. The Environmental
Assessment (EA) for this project is based primarily on the preliminary design documents.
1.2 Progress of EA
In December 2001, Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute (SSSRI) was engaged by the World Bank
Financed Project Office, Anhui Provincial Communications Department (APCD) to undertake
Environmental Assessment (EA) for the TTH. An EA team was formed in December of the same year, which
then conducted four site visits for investigation along the proposed project alignment, including
environmental baseline, protective targets or sensitive receptors, forest diseases control, and collection of
other relevant data. During these visits, the EA team also interviewed provincial and local environmental,
hydrology, forest, public health, national land and resources, tourist and other relevant government agencies.
In April 2002, the draft terms of reference (TOR) for the EA was reviewed by the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA) and a World Bank project identification mission which provided its
comments on the TOR in its first Aide Memoir.
The EA team conducted the another round of field investigation based upon the comments on TOR and the
Aide Memoir of the World Bank mission. The first draft EA report was prepared in August 2002 following
the extensive field investigation and monitoring, information analysis, impact modeling, public consultation
and release of project information to the affected public.
In September 2002, a World Bank mission conducted the project pre-appraisal which included a review of
the draft EA report. Additional comments were provided, which together with the comments received from
the earlier mission as well as from the SEPA on the TOR, have been incorporated into the second version of
the EA report. The new version includes a section dedicated to the requirement/comments raised in the first
Aide Memoir for environmental aesthetic impact analysis, a summary on resettlement and relocation, and
revised and enhanced assessment on impacts of the induced tourists on the Huangshan mountain.
SSSRI ensures that the Chinese version and English version of the EA documents are basically consistent,
I



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
except the analysis on economic loss and benefit which is not required by OP4.01. Minor discrepancies in
the two versions may exist due mainly to different expressions in the two languages during translation but
there is no difference of substance in the two reports.
1.3 Purpose of EA
The EA predicts various environmental and socio-economic impacts of the Project, and analyzes the impacts
quantitatively where possible or qualitatively through the investigation or monitoring of the physical,
biological, socio-economic environment, and through public consultation along the project area. More
specifically, the purposes of the EA are:
ï   To improve the decision-making process by introducing environmental criteria and assessment to
design engineers and decision makers and to ensure the Project is environmentally sound and
sustainable;
o   To ensure adverse environmental impacts be identified and evaluated in the earlier stage of the Project
so as to develop appropriate measures including alternative alignments and designs to avoid, mitigate,
reduce or otherwise minimize the adverse impacts to acceptable levels;
o   To develop measures of compensation for the impacts which could not be avoided or mitigated; and;
o   To provide a basis for Project executing agency and relevant government agencies to develop and
implement plans for environmental management and monitoring.
1.4   Bases of Assessment
World Bank Requiremnents
The World Bank requirements include primarily the Bank's ten safeguards policies, involving Operational
Policies (OP), Best Procedure (BP), Good Practice (GP) and Operational Directives (OD). These safeguard
policies are:
o   Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP4.01);
o   Forestry (OP/GP4.36);
o   Natural Habitats (OP/BP4.04);
o   Safety of Dams (OP/BP4.37);
o   Pest Management (OP4.09);
o   Involuntary Resettlement (0D4.30);
o   Indigenous People (OP4.12);
o   Cultural Property (OPNI 1.03 and soon to be OP4. 11);
o   Projects in Disputed Areas (OP/BP/GP7.60); and
o   Projects on International Waterways (OP/BP/GP7.50).
Among these safeguards policies, Environmental Assessment is the primary requirements and thus the focus
of this report. In addition, other Policies such as Natural Habitats (OP4.04), Indigenous People (OP4.120),
Forest (OP4.36), Cultural Property (OP4.1 1) and Pest Management (OP4.09) are also applied in the EA first
for screening and then full assessment if triggered.
Policies on Involuntary Resettlement are the subject of a separate assessment by another team but the key
findings are included in this report as well.
Since there are no project components that involve international waterways, dam construction or disputed
areas as defined under OP7.60, Bank's safeguard policies related to these subjects are not applied in the EA.

1.7 Methodology
Expressway construction projects are linear development. On-site investigation shows that the
environmental conditions of most road sections along the proposed route are similar, except for a
few areas where the receiving environment is sensitive. Therefore, the EIA method adopted is to
focus on sensitive receptors and representative areas to determine the impacts of the entire project
area.
Noise level, air quality, water quality and soil erosion are predicted and assessed by the means of
modeling and analogous analysis, whereas socio-economic environment and visual/scenery
impacts assessment is conducted primarily through site investigation and analysis. Ecological
environment and bio-diversity assessment are based primarily on field investigation, remote
sensing mapping and eco-dynamics analysis. Sub-consultants from the nation's most specialized
firms on bio-diversity, scenery and cultural properties were retained to conduct the assessments on
these subjects.
1.8 Applicable Standards
According to an official letter on environmental assessment standards for the proposed project
issued by the Anhui Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau and relevant World Bank

Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
Chapter 3     Project Description
The Project described in this Chapter is the Highway to be built on the preferred aligmnent,
following initial identification and detailed analysis of several altemative and sub-altemative
alignments. The final TTH route, described below, has been selected based on the overall
considerations for the least environmental impacts, lowest capital costs and engineering
considerations.
3.11  Direct Project Benefit Ares
The proposed project will cross Tongling City, Chizhou City and Huangshan City in south Anhui
province. The areas directly benefited from and impacted by the TTH include Tongling Couinty of
Tongling City, Qingyang and Shitai Counties of Chizhou City, and Huangshan District of
Huangshan City.
3.2   Geographical Location
The proposed Tongling to Tangkou Highway (TTH) is located in south Anhui province of
southeast of the People's Republic of China. The province, located between east longitude 114054
'to 119039  and north latitude 29∞23  to 34∞39', spans across both the Yangtzi (Changjiang)
River basin and Hui River basin and is bordered by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to the east,
Jiangxi Province to the south, Hubei and Henan provinces to the west, and Shandong province to
the north, as shown in Figure 3-1.
The proposed TTH is within the Wannan (south Anhui) region of Anhui Province. The project is
bordered within an area of east longitude 117046 -118∞17- and north latitude 30∞52 -30005'.
Starting from the end of Lutong expressway, the TTH extends south and southeast bound through
Tongling County of Tongling City, Qingyang County and Shitai County of Chizhou City,
Huangshan District of Huangshan City and ends at the Shancha Village of Tangkou Town of
Huangshan District (Figure 3-1).
3.3 Project ARignnnmeint
From the beginning at the south end of Lujiang to Tongling highway, the TTH goes along the west
side of provincial highway S103 along Hamaling and then crosses Qixing river before intersecting
with the planned Yanjiang (river side) highway. After crossing Qingshiling mountain from the east
of Qingyang county, the alignment will cross S103 at Dongbao and then extend south bound along
the west side of S 103 through Taling and Yangmei Villages and crossing the Taiping Lake at about
170 m south of the existing bridge. After Taiping lake, the TTH alignment turns towards southeast
through Zitong, Caihong bridge, Gantang town, Hekeng, Tanjiaqiao, Maotaling towns and finally
reaches its end at Shancha along Machuanhe River (Figure 3-2). The total length of the project is
116.146 km.

Bridge
The TTH will have 13 extra-large bridges along its alignment, with a total length of 8610 m. In
this context, bridges are not always necessary above rivers or streams. They can also refer to
elevated viaducted above some difficult terrain and topography where high on the ground surface
would be difficult engineeringly or generate very high impacts such as sever a wildlife habit. The

Connecting/link roads (ramps)
The TTH will be integrated into the local road network primarily through connections at the
interchanges. The Qingyang interchange will connect with G318, about 200 m beyond the toll
station on the ramp and the Tanjiaqiao interchange will connect with G205 about 100 m following
the toll station. These ramps and connection roads have been included in this project.
In addition, new connection raods will be built Lingyang and Gantangchengbei interchanges as
illustrated in the following maps.

Lingyang connection road is a proposed link between SI 03 and S325 with a total length of 1.39
km. It will be built in Grade II highway standards, with 8.5 m wide road base, asphalt pavement,
and 7 m wide road surface. S103 is the main existing road within the project area, connecting
Qingyang county and Huangshan district whereas S325 is the main existing road towards Shitai
county as well as the sole connection between the Shitai area and the TTH. Shitai is a state level
poverty county and currently has no highway within its territory.

3.7 Relationship of TTH and the Regional Road Network
At its north end, the TTH will connect with Lujiang to Tongling highway (LTH) which is currently
under construction. Through Hefei to Anqing highway (HAH) which was financed partially by the
World Bank in Anhui Highway I project and is now operating, LTH and thus TTH will connect
with the provincial capital of Hefei (Figure 3-1). At its south end, the TTH will connect with Tunxi
at the provincial border through Tunxi to Huangshan Highway (THH) which is currently under
planning. The highway network will enter into other provinces (details below) and connect with
the inter-provincial highway network.
The LTH started its construction at the beginning of 2002 and is expected to open for traffic at the
end of 2004. Prior to its construction, a detailed environmental impact assessment with full
considerations of environmental and resettlement issues had been completed, which was then
reviewed and approved by SEPA (copy of the approval document included in Appendix 1).
The planned THH has been approved by the MOC (copy of the approval document in Appendix
II). At the present, engineering feasibility study for THIi is being prepared and the environmental
impact assessment is to start soon. As described above, THH connects the TTH at its north end
and several highways at the other end. To its east, it will connect with Huihang highway which is
under construction and then connect with Hangzhou and Ningbo in Zhejiang province. To the
south, it will connect with the planned Tunxi to Kaihua Highway and through the south of
Zhejiang connects with Fujian province. To its west, it will connect with Tunxi to Jingdezhen
Highway and enters into Jiangxi province. These connections are shown in Figure 3-3.
The proposed THH has a smooth alignment selected with considerations of harmony and
integration with scenic sites and urban development along the highway, as well as to avoid directly
going through nature reserves, scenic sites, cultural properties and other environmentally sensitive
spots. In the next stage, the EA team for THH will conduct further impact assessment and develop
mitigation plans to minimizing the occupation of agricultural and forest land, minimizing
resettlement and other adverse impacts to natural and socioeconomic environments. Although
THH is not part of the TTH, thus not part of this EA, it will be thoroughly analyzed for its
potential environmental and socio-economic impacts with the similar standards and methodologies
applied in the EA for the World Bank financed TTH.
3.8 Construction Material
There will be 22 proposed borrow pits and spoil disposal sites. The total required earth is
estimated to be 786,000 m3 and the accessive materials requiring disposal will be 3,580,000 m3
The locations and scales of these sites are presented in Table 3.8-1 and other materials required by
highway construction are presented in Table 3.8-2.

4.1 Overview of Natural Environment
4.1.1  Topography and Geomorphy
The proposed TTH will go through Tongling County of Tongling City, Qingyang County and Shitao County
of Chizhou City and Huangshan District of Huangshan City. The north of project area is characterized by low
relief, valley plain and basin while the south is basically mountainous land, mixed with hills and deep plains.
The project area slopes from south to north, crossing the following two topographical areas:
o   Plain with low hills from starting point of the project to Lingyang section. In this area the project will
cross polder area, valley plain, low-relief land and basins. Although the topographic features vary, the
average elevation is generally lower than 200 m.
o   High mountainous area from Lingyang section to Shancha section. The proposed road will wind through
the rolling land mixed with mountains and valleys. The differential ground level can vary largely. The
average elevation is more than 200 m. It is difficult to select alignment in this area due to constrains in
topography.
4.1.2  Meteorological Conditions
The project is located in north semi-tropical zone with wet monsoon wind which is characterized by cold
winter, hot summer and mild spring and autumn. The annual average temporature is 16.1 C, with the highest
temporature of 40.9 C in July-August (Shitai) and the lowest of -13.5 C (Gantang) in January. The rainy
season falls usually in May to July for about 40 days when heavy storms may occur as well. The maximum
one day rainfall on record is 200 mm. On region wide, the average annual precipitation is 1600 mm,varying
greatly from year to year. The maximum yearly precipitation recorded is 2610.7 mm (Qingyang). Wihtin the
year, the precipitation also varies greatly with the season. The least precipitation happens in December which
is only 21% of that in June. On the seasonal basis, the precipitation in spring accounts for 32% of yearly total,
and summer is 38%. The snowfall period is short, only 12 days per year on average. The prevailing wind
direction is northeast to south-northeast. Strong wind and rain storms caused by Typhoon often occur in
autumn, at least 2-3 times each year. The wind speed in mountainous area is fast, often reach Grade 4 or 5.
The rainy, storms and hot summer could pose adversely impact on the road construction works. Flooding
often occur in storm season. In summer, the ground temperature and moisture is high .
4.1.3 Hydrology
There are two major river systems, Qingtong River system and Qingyi River System, in the project area, both
of which ultimately discharge into Yangtzi (Changjiang) River. Other major streams and lakes within the
project area are: Shuiqiao Lake in Tongling County, Qingxing River and Lingyang River in Qingyang County,
Taiping Lake, Yangxi River, Puxi River and Machuan River in Huangshan District.
18



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
The major rivers/surface water bodies to be crossed by the TTH are (Figure 4-1-1):
*   Shuiqiao Lake is a branch of Bailang Lake. Bailang Lake is situated in the north of Nandatong River
within Tongling County, to the south is Guichi City. The catchment area within Tongling County is 97.5
kM2, and the ground level is 9-10 m. The major function of the lake is for irrigation, flood storage and
aquaculture.
*   Qixing River is the biggest branch of Qingtong River, with a total length of 68 km. The catchment area
is 646 km2. River level is affected by Yangzi River. The primary function is for irrigation and flood
discharge.
*   Lingyang River arises from Lanxi stream which discharge trough SuoVillage before conflunce with
Nanliu xi stream. Then it flow to south through Shaji before confluence with Taiping Lake. The total
length is 19 km, the river bed is 15 - 40 m wide. The catchment is 94.8 km2. The flow rate is 0.4-1.0
m3/s. The maximum flow rate is 180 m3/s. The major function is for irrigation and flood discharge.
*   Taiping Lake is the largest artificial reservoir in Anhui Province. It is discharged by natural streams from
Huangshan and Jiuhuashan Mountains. The surface area is 88.6 km2. The total storage capacity is 2.47
billion m3. The average depth of water is 40 m. Taiping Lake is connected with Yangzi River by Qingyi
River. The primary function is for irrigation, flood control, acquaculture and tourism. The function
zoning is the reserve for fish. Class 2 standard is enforced.
*   Puxi River arises from Shiziling of Huangshan Mountains. It discharge through Gengcheng Village to
Taiping Lake. The total length is 34.5 km., with a catchment of 207.7 km2. The flow rate is 1287 m3/s
(1/100 year). The primary function is for drinking, irrigation and flood discharge.
*   Machuan River, also called Dongpu River, is originated from Bushuifeng of Huangshan Mountain. It
flows through Tangkou, Tanjiaqiao, Sankou Village, Xinrning Village and Shuixianyuan Township,
before dicharge into Taiping Lake. The total length is 78 kmn, with the catchment area of 690 km2. The
flow rate at Jiangjia of Tanjiaqiao is 2316 m3/s (1.100 year), at Hutian of Tanjiaqiao is 2246 m3/s
(/100 year). The primary function is for drinking, irrigation and flood discharge.
4.2 Natural Reserve Zone and National Park along the Project
There are several Nature Protection Zone, Scenic or Landscape Site, and Forest Park, collectively known as
the "Three Zones" along the TTH. According to relevant regulations, the three zones are defined as follows:
*   Nature Protection Zone, also known as Nature Reserve: refers to as land and fresh or marine water
where natural ecosystem, natural habitat for endangered wild life and natural heritage sites of special
significance are located (Management Regulations for Natural Reserve Zone, State Council);
*   Scenic or Landscape Site. refers to as an area of cultural, scientific, aesthetic or scenic significance, and
natural and historical sites, which has a considerable geographical size and scope sufficient for
development of tourism, leisure, or scientific and cultural activities. These sites are typically designated
by the county level or higher governments (Interim Regulations for Management of Landscape
Showplace, the State Council);
*   Forest Park, refers to as an area with beautiful forest landscape, and concentrated natural and/or
historical resources, with a geographical size sufficiently large for tourism, leisure or scientific, cultural
19



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
and educational activities (Forest Park Management Regulations, the Forestry Ministry).
According to the above definition, seven "three zones" sites along the TTH have been identified. The
locations of these sites and their relations to the proposed highway alignment are shown in Table4-2-1 and
Figure3-2.

Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
As shown in Table 4-2-1, the relation of the TTH with the "three zones" can be basically characterized as:
o   The proposed road will not cross any natural reserve zone;
o   The proposed road will cross Taiping Lake scenic site and Lushan forest center of Huangshan Forest
Park; and
o   In most case, the proposed road will cross only the peripheral area of the "three zones".
The TTH area has two nature reserves at Shibasuo and Shilishan, three scenic sites at Jiahuashan, Taiping
lake and Huangshan (commonly known as Two Mountains and One Lake in the region) and two forest parks
at Jiuhuashan mountain and Huangshan forest parks. In the EA, the two nature reserves are the focus of the
bio-diversity, ecosystem and natural habitat assessment while the Two Mountains and One Lake are the focus
for visual reviews and induced impacts (increased tourists). The two forest parks are really part of the
Jiuhuanshan mountain and Huangshan mountain respectively. Impact assessment for these parks are included
in sections on forest, natural habitat and visual impacts.
According to the Clause 8 of the "Interim Regulations for Management of Landscape Showplace": Any
construction project within landscape showplace or in the peripheral buffer zone will be harmonized with the
site and causing no damage to the scenery, pollution to the environment and disruption of the tourism
facilities. The Clause 13 of the "Method for Management of Forest Park" stipulates that any occupation,
acquisition and transfer of forestland within forest park will be subject to the agreement of the management
of the forest park.
4.3 Ecosystem
4.3.1  Geological conditions along the proposed expressway
The proposed TTH is aligned roughly from northeast to southwest, with the starting point at Tongling in the
north and the end point at Tangkou in the south. The forest or woodland ecosystems dominate along the
alignment, where lakes and polders are also scattered. The highway may been divided into seven sections in
terms of geological properties:
(1) Suburban area of Tongling county and the polder area near the Shibasuo Natural Reserve Zone
This section is about 15.5 km long (K78+060-K93+500), starting from suburb of Tongling county, with I km
within the suburban area, before going into the polder area of Yangtzi River which is characterized by
mixture of small hills and polders. The polder area is largely cultivated where large scale farming exists,
including irrigated paddy fields and a small amount of fish ponds. The flat terrain of the area is well
cultivated and densely populated. Being adjacent to the Shibasuo Natural Reserve, waterfowls are often seen
in the area's irrigated fields and ponds.
(2) Basin and hilly section to the east of Qingyang County
This section is approximately 18.5 km (K93+500-K1 12). The first 4 km section is a hilly area, mostly farmed
as tea garden and cash woodland, with a small portion of artificial masson pine forest. The remainder is
cultivated land for large scale crop farning, tea/vegetable gardens or for building land. Again the relevatively
flat terrain of the area attracts intensive cultivation and population settlements.
22



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
(3) Valley plain in Jiuhuashan Mountain
This section is about 31 km(KI 12-K143. In order to pass through the narrow valley, considerable tunnels and
deep cuts will be constructed. The major vegetation coverage in the area is artificial conifer forest. Farmers
reside sparsely, living on limited land on hill slopes. The last 6 km of this section is adjacent to Yangmei
Village, where there are mixed conifer and broadleaf wood land and the secondary broadleaf forest providing
habitats for various wild lives.
(4) Taiping Lakeshore section
This section is 8 km long (K143-K151), going along the lakeshore once passing the main lake body. The
provincial highway S103 separates the proposed TTH and Taiping lake for the most part. The major
vegetation in this artificially planted conifer forest mixed with fractions of secondary broadleaf forest. A few
species of aquatic plants appear at the lakeshore waters. The lake water is clean with high quality and lake
shore area has few population settlements, although the area is under development plan for tourists.
(5) Section outside Shilishan Natural Reserve Zone
This section is 9 km long (K151-K160) and the best preserved zone under natural vegetation coverage,
where the broadleaf tree with diameter over 20 cm can be seen, so can be the wildlife in this area. The
proposed TTH will be mostly on elevated viaducts and tunnels in this section. This section is a focus of the
ecological assessment in this EA.
(6) Gantang Basin
This section is 13.5 km long (K160-K173+500), characterized with mixed hills and plains. The hills are
covered with tea, fruit or fir trees. The flat plain and gentle slope are mostly cultivated or used as building
land. Major crops include wheat, maize and rice. The flat terrain of the area attracts intensive cultivation and
dense population settlements.
(7) Section outside Huangshan Mountain Landscape and Showplace Zone
This section is 21 km long (K173+500-K194+350). It is well covered by natural vegetation where secondary
forest dominates. Major types of vegetation include mixed conifer and broadleaf trees. According to the
"Guideline for protected areas management categories" (1992 edition) of the Intemational Union for Nature
and Natural Resource, Huanshan Mountain Landscape and Showplace Zone falls into the category II
(national park), with the major objective to protect the ecosystem and maintain functions for human leisure
and recreations. Any developments in such areas will not conflict with the overall management objective and
will be in harmonious with the surrounding environmental and cultural settings. This section is also a focus of
ecological assessment.
In general, the ecosystems along the TTH alignment is of a good quality, especially the three sections of
Taiping lake, Shilishan Mountain and Huangshan Mountain. The vegetation coverage is over 70%, dominated
23



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
by second growth forest followed by artificially planted woodland.
4.3.2   Bio-diversity
According to International Convention on Bio-diversity, bio-diversity is defined as the variability of lives
from all sources, including terrestrial, oceanic and other aquatic ecosystems and the integrated ecosystem
thus formed. The variability includes that within the same species, between species or in a whole ecosystem.
In general, bio-diversity may be understood as the collective name for the badies of all lives. As such it
represents sharing of the same earth between human beings and other forms of life. Therefore, human beings
will consider the living conditions of other lives while live on the earth and utilize its resources.
According to the Anhui Province Chronicle (Natural Environment Section) and Series of China Natural
Resources (Anhui Province Volume), Anhui province has 3139 species of fascicular plants, belong to 225
groups, 1222 categories, including 232 species of fern, 53 species of gymnosperm, and 2854 species of
angiosperm. The plants in this region generally fall into the category of middle Asian evergreen broadleaf
forest which gradually dominates along with descending elevations. At the higher land, deciduous broadleaf
trees dominate in this region.
The above Series divides amphibian and reptile animals in Anhui province into six geographical distribution
areas, while birds and mammals into five distribution areas. The major animal distribution areas to be
affected by the project is Wannan mountainous and hilly area and the Yangzi River bank area In Wannan
mountainous and hilly area, there are 493 species of vertebrate including 29 species of amphibian, 26 species
of reptile, 342 species of birds, and 96 species of mammals.
According to the Huangshan City Chronicle, the city which includes the Huangshan mountain has about 300
species of wild animals, including 70 species of mammals, 170 species of birds, 30 species of reptile 20
species of amphibian. The Qingyang County Chronicle records that there are 1200 species of plants and 300
species of animals within its terretory.
As there is no uniform criteria for assessment of bio-diversity, the species diversity and abundance indicators
are described using those defined in the Study for Bio-diversity Index System for the ecological assessment.
The diversity and abundance indictors cover four classes, and their definitions are given in Table 4-3-2-1.

provincial total;
Species        Class B       The quantity of vertebrate and fascicular plant accounts for more than 25% of the
Abundance                                             provincial total;
Class C       The quantity of vertebrate and fascicular plant accounts for more than 10% of the
provincial total;
Class D         The quantity of vertebrate and fascicular plant accounts for less than 10%;

Referring the definition in Table 4-3-2-1, Table 4-3-2-2 shows that the species diversity in Jiuhuashan and
Huangshan mountain areas is Class B, showing relatively diversified ecosystem. The comparison of number
of species of fascicular plants and vertebrate in the project areas with the provincial totals and Wannan region
totals, indicates that the species abundance falls into Class A. Clearly, these key project affected areas are
very rich in wildlife.
4.3.3 Tree Coverage Distribution
4.3.3.1 General
The proposed TTH is within the Wannan mountainous area. According to the general classification of
vegetation coverage, it belongs to the middle semi-tropical evergreen broadleaf forest. The type of regional
tree coverage is the evergreen broadleaf forest. In the low hill areas where evergreen broadleaf forest have
bee widely replaced by deciduous trees forest, mixed deciduous and evergreen broadleaf trees exist with the
deciduous trees gradually dominate with descending elevation. Due to heavy human activities, some parts of
the forest have degraded into secondary bush.
In terms of vertical distribution, the planted woodland dominates the area below the elevation of 400 m which
is mixed in small part with low bush and grassland. In areas with elevations from 400 m to 1000 m there are
mainly upland broadleaf forests. The tree coverage distribution in the area above 1000 m is typically from
mixed forest of evergreen broadleaf and deciduous trees to highland bushes.
4.3.3.2 Vegetation Cover along the TTH
The EA team conducted a field investigation in July 2002 for vegetation coverage along the TTH area. The
investigation results, presented below, demonstrate the vegetation baseline of the project area as well as
provide a basis for impact assessment.
25



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
Content and Scope of Survey
The scope of the investigation is 1 km on both sides of the proposed TTH alignment from Yangtian Township
of Qingyang County to Tangkou Township of Huangshan District.
The major content of the investigation is forest distribution and plant types/species, identification of
endangered or protected species, if any, and the existing status of the forest and stability of forest system.
Methodology
The investigation is based on remote sensing analysis and site survey. Remote sensing analysis is largely
limited to understanding and assessment of the area topography, environment and vegetation distribution,
while the site survey is for analysis and assessment for forest community.
The site survey is limited to the area 500 m within the road central line. Sample lands that could represent
various plant communities has been identified as sample land. There are total 6 such sample lands.
According to the basic methods for field forest ecosystem investigation and actual conditions in the field, the
2           2
sample lands have been defined to be 20 X 20 m or 20 X 30 m . The field investigation covers arbor layer,
shrub layer, succession layer and herbaceous layer. The investigation of arbor layer includes tree scale, type,
height, chest diameter and coverage. Investigation of shrub layer is carried out based on the indicators for
type, quantity, height and coverage degree. The herbaceous layer is not the focus for investigation of this
project, which will receive a general description. The field investigation also includes key site environmental
factors such as topographical features, slopes, locations, absolute elevation, relative height, soil and rock
conditions.
Vegetation Cover Type of Each Section
According to the field investigation, the vegetation coverage of the area along the highway can be classified
into five categories: artificially planted woodland, secondary forest, bamboo, bush and tea gardens. The
artificially planted forest could be further divided into masson pine forest and fir forest which distribute
within areas below an elevation of 400 m with most of these trees aged at 15-20 years. The land between the
trees is covered by bushes. The secondary forest is distributed in the area with an elevation higher than 400 m
or the steep lope with an elevation lower than 400 m, most of the trees are deciduous and evergreen broadleaf
trees. Bamboo is a major local economic or cash growth. In most cases it grows in the fertile land with an
elevation lower than 400 m. The species diversity for the under-growth in the bamboo land is poor and the
bushes are sparse, as human activities is concentrated on such areas. In the lowland hilly and the mountainous
area that is strongly affected by human activity, there are limited bushes. Tea tee is another major cash crop in
this region which is planted in valley plain where is densely populated, or grows in the fertile slope land.
The types of major vegetation cover in these sections are as follows, and Figure 4-3-3-1 shows the details of
vegetation distribution.
o   Suburban of Tongling City to the polder area outside the Shibasuo Natural Reserve Zone. The major
vegetation type in the area is farm crops. Small parts of land are covered by artificially planted masson

pine forest and bushes, such as areas near Hamaling. Fractions of aqua plants grow in the lakeshore of
Shuiqiao lake.
*   Valley plain in the east of Qingyang County and hilly area. Besides the lands near Shenggongshan
Mountain and Qingshan Mountain where are covered by artificially planted firs, bushes and bamboo,
farm crops are the major vegetation in the region.
*   Valley plain in Jiuhuashan Mountain. The farm crop coverage to the forest coverage ratio in this region
is 3/2. About 90% of the forest coverage is artificially planted woodland and bushes. Small plots of
secondary forest grow on the steep hills near Dongdengbao and Yangmei Village.
*   Lakeshore section of Taiping Lake. The major vegetation coverage is artificial planted firs (about 50%),
followed by farm crops (about 30%) and tea gardens (about 15%).
*   Section outside Shilishan Natural Reserve Zone. The land in front of the Zitongkeng Tunnel is most
covered by secondary forest (75%), followed by tea gardens (15%), with the reminder covered by
bamboo and farm crops. The land behind the tunnel is mostly covered by artificially planted firs (nearly
70%), followed by bamboo (nearly 25%), as well as tea gardens and farm crops.
*   Gantang Basin. Farm crop coverage to forest coverage ratio in this region is 1/1. Artificially planted
woodland accounts for 80% of the total forest land. There also is a big proportion of bush and grassland,
but only a small proportion of tea trees.
The section outside Huangshan Landscape Showplace Zone. Farm crop coverage to forest coverage
ratioin in this region is 2/3. Artificially planted woodland accounts for 70% of the forest, and secondary
forest accounts for 25%. There is a small proportion land for tea gardens.
Major Forest Community along the TTH
As the proposed TTH will cross valley plain or lowland, the regional plants such as evergreen broadleaf
forest which grow on highland, will be hardly affected. The protected tree species including Castanopsis
eyrei, Phoebe shearer,and Cyclobalanopsis glauca have not been found in the field investigation.
The site survey has revealed that the artificially planted woodland (firs and masson pines) are the major
vegetation coverage in the area. In the area with complex topography and sparse population settlement, the
mixed forest grows. The typical trees are Castanopsis Scierophyiia which grow in the transitional zone from
mixed forest to evergreen broadleaf trees. In the low-relief terrain, there is abundant grass and bush in
addition to the artificially planted woodland, which play a role in soil conservation.
The distribution and features of various forest colonies are as follows:
Natural secondaryforest
The natural secondary forest is distributed in the valley plain of Jiuhuashan Mountains, the outside area of
Shilishan Natural Reserve Zone and Huangshan mountain scenic site. The alignment of the proposed
highway has been redesigned to avoid directly going through Jiuhuashan reserve core area, therefore several
sample lands have been designated in Shilishan Natural Reserve Zone and Huangshan scenic site for further
investigation.
In consideration of the steep topography and a proposed tunnel near Zitongkeng of Shilishan area, two
27



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
sample lands with area of 20 X 20 m2 have been defined for investigation. The proposed highway will pass a
vast bamboo grove near Sukeng of Huangshan Scenic site. Only a small area of natural secondary forest
under the hills, therefore a 20 X 20 m2 sample land is defined.
The features of the structure and type of natural secondary forest community are:
Features of community type: The frequency of ocurrance of Castanopsis Scierophyiia among the 26 species
and 196 arbor trees is 100%. In the sample land of Zitongkeng there are 40 Castanopsis Scierophyiia,
accounting for 41.7%. In the sample land of Sukeng there are 16, accounting for 27.6%. The associated
species are different: in Zitongkeng area, Lithocarpus giaucai accounts for 22.9%, and Azalea accounts for
18.7%; in Sukeng area, lindera accounts for 10.3%, and Liquidambarformosana accounts for 6.9%. But in
both areas, Castanopsis Scierophyiia is the dominant species. Therefore it is clear that Castanopsis
Scierophyiia is the dominant tree in the natural secondary forest land under 400 m of elevation.
The features of ecosystem: The surface relief is steep in Zitongkeng area with the slope degree at the
surveyed area at about 50∞, the elevation at 420 m above the sea, the relative height at 200 m, the aspect is
NW 40∞ and the closed degree of forest is 85 %. There are rare human activities in this area due to its
remoteness from population settlements. The under-soil is moist perennially. Moss grows on the naked rock.
The leaf litter contains much humus. The sample land in Sukeng area is under moutons, with slope degree of
30 0 and the closed degree of forest at 60 %. Large population settlements are located around this area. The
edge of the forest community is heavily affected by human activities as a result its proximity. Although the
falling leaf is thick, there is a low level of decaying and humus content.
Structure feature of the forest community: The combined amount of Castanopsis Scierophyiia t, Lithocarpus
giauca and Azalea accounts for 83.3% of the total woodland in Zitongkeng area which are the dominant
species (which means dominance in the community with decisive roles in determining community structure).
The combined amount of Castanopsis Scierophyiia (lindl.) Schott, linderaaccounts and Liquidambar
formosana accounts for 40.8% of the total in Sukeng area. The structure of the forest community reveals that
although the type of the forest in the two areas are similar, the forest in Zitongkeng is more stable than that in
Sukeng in terms of the species structure.
Feature of vertical structure: In Zitongkeng, the separation of arbor and shrub layers is distinct, with little
under-wood. The average height of shrub layer is 2.5 m. In contrast, there is abundance of under-wood in
Sukeng area, with 27.6% of the total at a height of 3.5-5.0 m. The average height of shrub layer is 2.5 m and
the separation of arbor and shrub layers is ambiguous.
Composition of succession forest: In the area of Zitongkeng, the major regeneration species are Castanopsis
Scierophyiia, Cunninghamia lanceolata Eurya muricata Serissa serissoides Camellia sinensis, Lespedeza
bicolor, Pleioblastus amarus, Phyllostachys congesta, Quercus fabri Linera aggregats, Cinnamomum
subaveniumn  Lindera angustifolia  Lithocarpus giauca  Evonymus myrianthus, Evonymus carnosus,
Ericaceae spp  Clerodendrum cyrtophyllum  Alniphyllumfortunei Itea chinensis vay oblonga, Diospyros
kaki varsylvestris, Holbeellia fargesii etc. In the regeneration layer, deciduous species accounts for 44.4%,
and evergreen species accounts for 55.6%, reflecting the clear trend from evergreen deciduous broad-leaf
forest to evergreen broad -leaf forest. The regeneration species in Sukeng area are: Liquidambarformosana,
Eurya muricata, Rhus chinensis, Toxicodenron sylvestre  Pistacia chinensis Acer davidii Lindera
28



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
angustifolia  Quercus giandulufera var.brevipetiolata. Lindera rubronervia  Dalbergia hupeana  Rhus
chinensis, nandina domestica, Quercus fabri, Eurya muricata Cephalotaxus sinensis Cunninghamza
lanceolata, Linera glauca etc. In the succession layer, deciduous species accounts for 60%, and evergreen
species accounts for 40%, implying that the forest is at the succession stage of evergreen deciduous
broad-leaf trees and mixed deciduous broadleaf trees.
In summary, the secondary forest in Zitongkeng area is stable in terms of species formation and community
structure. It is at the stable stage of community succession. However, based on the analysis of species of
regeneration layer, the climax of community succession is the zonal evergreen broad-leaf forest. The forest in
Sukeng area is at the beginning stage to the mixed evergreen deciduous broad-leaf forest.
Artificialforest
The artificially plant woodland (artificial forest) is found everywhere during the field investigation. The two
most common artificially planted trees are masson pines and firs. In part of the area, there are artificial mixed
forest of masson pines and firs, or the mixed forest of Sassafras tzumu, masson pine and Paulownia australis.
Referring to the alignment of the proposed highway, the sample land of artificial forest surveyed is to be the
artificial fir forest.
The dominant species of artificial fir forest is firtree. The under wood species are centered on heliphilous
plants, such as Liquidambarformosana, Diospyros kaki, varsylvestris Rhus chinensis . Quercus fabri and
Phyllostachys congesta; the evergreen species are Eurya muricata Linera aggregats Camellia sinensis etc.
On the slope facing south, the heliphilous species are dominant in the under-wood shrub and regeneration
plants. On the slope facing the north, the shade-loving deciduous trees dominate. Based on the analysis on the
property of under-wood and regeneration plants, the succession of community will orient to deciduous
broad-leaf forest if there is no outside interference.
Bamboo grove
Bamboo grove is an important economic forest in southern China. It grows mostly in the hilly areas along the
proposed project. The under-growth vegetation is sparse, the major species of under-growth are:Castanopsis
Scierophyiia,   Quercus    stewardii,   Serissa   serissoides,   Ulmus     changii,   Quercus
giandulufera .var brevipetiolata Platycarya strobilacea . Dalbergia hupeana Lespedeza bicolor. Pleioblastus
amarus, Phyllostachys congesta, Diospyros kaki varsylvestris Eurya muricata Quercus fabri, Linera
aggregats, Liquidambarformosana, Lindera angustifolia  Toxicodenron sylvestre Tilia oliveri Actinidia
chinensis Euscaphisjaponica Vitex negundo Rhus chinensis, Rubus peltatus etc.. According to the surveyed
data, the average density of bamboo grove is 250/mu, the closed degree is 65%, and the average height of
under-growth shrub is 80 cm, with a coverage degree of shrub of 35%. The dominant herbaceous species are
ferns, Liriope spicata and plants of Roceasae, Gramineae and Labiatae, the cover degree is 10%. It is the
feature of bamboo grove that the growth of underground plants would be largely restrained, therefore it is
difficult for succession of community.

Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
As there are abundant sunshine and rainfall, the distribution and growth condition of shrub in this area is
limited only by the local soil condition. The shrub is expected to develop to deciduous broad-leaf forest on
the land of good soil condition.
The detail information of each sample land investigation is shown in Appendix 3.
The main plants found in the vegetation investigation are shown in Appendix 4.
In summary, the woodland, forest and other vegetation coverage in the project area are diversified. They
differ in different sections of the TTH, as well as in different elevation within the same area. Table 4.3.3-1
summarizes the major forest and woodland communities found in the TTH affected areas, based on the field
investigation by the EA team.

4.3.3.3  Precious, Ralre and Endangered Plant Species
Based on the information collection and analysis, the assessment area is unlikely to have plant species under
the national Class I protection list. The area may however have 12 plant species under national Class 2
protection list. These species and their distribution in the country are:
o   Cereidiphyllumjaponica, sub-tropic area, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces
o   Emmenopterys henryi, sub-tropic area, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces
o   Liriodendron chinensis, sub-tropic/tropic areas, east and south China region

4.3.4 Wild Animals
As the wild animals have large activity area, the assessment area will not be limited to the area of 1000 m
from the proposed highway. The basic area covered in this assessment is the entire Qingyang County, Shitai
County and Huangshan District, with the 1 000 m area as the focus.
Is has been identified during the site survey that peripheral area of Shilishan Natural Reserve, peripheral are
of Huangshan scenic site and the area from Shaji to Taiping Lake bridge are rich in wildlife resources.
Therefore the field investigation of wild animal is concentrated in the peripheral area of Shilishan Natural
Reserve and Huangshan mountain scenic site.
4.3.4.1  The methodology for site survey and analysis
The field investigation combines a focused survey and a general survey in line with the general methodology
for field study of reptiles, birds and mammals, as well as the amphibian. Local residents were also visited and
interviewed during the field investigation in search of wildlife information.
Amphibian and reptiles: The distribution of amphibian and reptile is identified by sample collection,
personal interview and information review. The sample collection is random which could ascertain the
relative quantity of amphibian and reptile in an area. However, there is lack of unified specifications for
presentation of relative abundance of species community. The species proportion of hunted animals is applied
to present the relative quantity.
Bird: The distribution of birds is identified by sample collection, personal interview and information review.
The relative quantity of birds is determined by route statistics method. In view of the fact that the distribution
and species community abundance could vary largely in different ecosystems, the statistics isi repeated for
2-3 times for birds in different project affected ecosystems.
Mammals: The distribution and relative quantity of medium or large mammals are identified through field
observation, personal interview and collection of wild animals furs trade. The small mammals such as mouse
are investigated using mouse traps. 150-200 mouse traps were installed across the project affected area.
The collected information from the field investigation is then analyzed, through the following step:
*   Sort and appraise the samples collected
*   Prepare the zonal category for various species communities based on historical information.
*   Identify features of mammal species and communities according to the zonal category and filed
observation.
4.3.4.2  Analysis of land vertibarate
Amphibian
31



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
There are eight species of amphibians within the assessment area, the names are listed in the Appendix 3-1.
Andrias davidinus is under at Class 2 national protection list, and Bufo gargarizans and Rana spinosa are
under the Class 2 of Anhui Province protection list. Rana limnocharis ,Rana livida ,Rana schmacheri ,Rana
spinosa are the most common species while Rana limnocharis are the dominant species in the region.
With regard to the environment they live and life habits, the eight species of amphibian may be divided into
two types:
o   Land type: This type of amphibian largely lives in moisture land environment and move to water only
during the spawn period. They typically live in the sediment during the winter time, however.
o   Water type: This type of amphibian live in the water and the peripheral area, with eggs and young life
also in the water.
The field investigation did not find Andrias davidinus. According to relevant records and reports, Andrias
davidinus is very rare in this area.
Reptile
There are 15 species of reptile within the project affected area. The names of these reptiles are listed in
Appendix 3-2, among which there is none under the national or protection lists but six under the Class 2 of
Anhui Province protection list. Among these species, Gekko japonicus, Enmeces chinensis, Takydromus
septentrionalis, Dinodon rugozonatum, Elaphe carinata, Zaacys dhwnnades and Deinagkistrodon acutus are
the most common species while Gekko japonicus , Takydromus septentrionalis and Elaphe carinata are the
dominant species.
With regard to their live environment and life habits, the species of amphibian may be classified as near-water,
irrigated farmland, buildings and forest types, described as follows:
o   Near-water type: This type of reptiles is living in near water ecosystem, or near streams, canal and paddy
field; or in wet environment except during the spawn period. They typically search for their foods in the
water but live on dry land.
o   Irrigated farmland type: This type of reptile lives in warm land environment. Some reptiles are active in
day time, such as lizard which always look for food when the land is warm. In early summer, it is active
in the afternoon. The active time could extend with the increase of sunshine and temperature. But in the
hot area under the straight sunshine, some reptiles would be inactive. Snakes are active in both daytime
and nighttime. They generally are active after sunrise in the early summer and throughout daytime and
nighttime in mid-summer.
o   Building area type: This type of reptile lives in residential buildings, resting in daytime and active in
nighttime. The majority of their food sources is fly or mosquito.
o   Forest type: This type of reptile lives in the forest. Most are living the shade and wet environment.

According to the field investigation and historical information collected, there are 85 species of birds within
the assessment area, with 49 species of Passerifomes and 36 species of non-Passerifomes. A complete list of
these birds is presented in the Appendix 3-3.
There is one species of bird under the Class 1 at national protection list, five under Class 2 of national
protection list, 11 under Class I of Anhui Province protection list and 11 under class 2 of Anhui Province
protection list. Streptopelia orientalis , Streptopelia chinensis , Cissa e erythrorhyncha , Capella stenura,
Zosterops japoniaca , Cuculus micropterus , Corous macrorhynchus , Garrulax perspicillatus , Troglodytes
troglodytes and Passer montanus saturatus are the common species while Streptopelia orientalis , Cissa e.
erythrorhyncha , Corous macrorhynchus and Passer montanus saturatus are the dominant species in the
region.
Mammals
According to the field investigation and historical information collected, there are 72 species of mammals
within the assessment area. The names are listed in Appendix 5-6.
Three species of mammals under Class I at national protection list and they are Neofelis nebulosa, Muntiacus
crinifrons and Cervus nippon; nine under Class 2 in the national protection list, such as macaque, pangolin,
zibet, rasse, jackal, otter; four under Class I of Anhui Province protection list; and five under Class 2 of
Anhui Province protection list.
There is a large proportion of Carnivora, Rodentia and Artiodactyla in the assessment area, totaling 58
species in three groups of mammals, accounting for 70% of all mammals identified. Among them,
Hipposideros armiger, Hipposideros pratti , Lepus capensis Leporidae , Tamiops swinhoei, Cricetulus
barabensis, Mustela sibirica , Microtus fortis and Sus scrofa are the most common species while Lepus
capensis Leporidae, Tamiops swinhoei Cricetulus barabensis, Sus scrofa are the dominant species in the
region.
The mammals have been further classified as river valley-terrace type and forest type.
*   River valley-terrace type: There are 23 species of this type, accounting for 30.7% of the total in the area
affected. The small mammals are dominant.
*   Forest type: The species structure is complicated.
Important mammals
Important mammals refer to those included in the national protection list. According to the field survey, the
typical vertebrates are Neofelis nebulosa, Muntiacus crinifrons, Capricornis sumatraensis and Cervus nippon
once was active and today still have signs of activity in the affected area.
Neofelis nebulosa
Neofelis nebulosa belongs to Felidae. It is an animal under the Class I protection at national level. It
33



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
originally lives in the southern province to Yangtzi River, and Shanxi Province, Gansu Province and Taiwan
Province. The body weight of an average sized Neofelis nebulosa is 15-20 kg, and body length is 1 m, smaller
than leopard (refer to photo)
The Neofelis nebulosa has the nocturnal habit. It lives in the evergreen broad-leaf forest. It is more adroit in
trees than on ground. It copulates in night, pregnant for 90 days, each time 2-4 fetuses. The area of activity of
individual Neofelis nebulosais 10 km. There is overlapping of the activity area between Neofelis nebulosas.
The activity route is regular.
It preys on bird, squirrel and monkey on the trees at night, and also prey on rabbit and deer. Based on the
stomach analysis of four dead Neofelis nebulosais, the major food is bird, rabbit and deer. According to the
stomach analysis of Neofelis nebulosa in Jiangxi Province, the rabbit accounts for 57.2%, squirrel, deer and
fox accounts for 14.3% respectively.
The Neofelis nebulosa is distributed in 14 counties of Anhui province's south mountainous area. It is believed
that the best activity area of Neofelis nebulosa is 2770 kM2, and the normal activity area is 650 km2.
Therefore the quantity of Neofelis nebulosais estimated to be 117.
The peripheral area of Shilishan Natural Reserve is the edge of the activity area of Neofelis nebulosa. The
peripheral area of Huangshan Landscape Showplace is the normal activity area of Neofelis nebulosa. The
distribution map of Neofelis nebulosa in 2000 is shown in Figure 4-3-4-1. During the field survey, the local
people reported that the Neofelis nebulosa can be seen in Shimenjian of Shitai County, Dabao Village and
Jiao Village of Huangshan District, and the Huangshan Showplace in the recent 2 years.
The newspaper occasionally reports the presence of Neofelis nebulosa, details are included in Appendix 7.
Neofelis nebulosa is the climax sarcophile in the forest ecosystem in the south mountainous area. It gradually
migrates from the deep mountain to low relief and villages. In day time, it often hides on the road side to
prey on animals. That maybe related to the damage of food chain or the over-growth of the Neofelis nebulosa
population.
Muntiacus crinifrons
Muntiacus crinifrons is the animal under the Class I protection at national level. It originally lives in Anhui,
Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Fujian Provinces. Muntiacus crinifrons is unique in China. The body length of
Muntiacus crinifrons is 100-110 cm, the height of willer is 60 cm, and the body weight is 21-26 kg (refer to
photo).
Muntiacus crinifrons lives in mountainous forest, most move around alone. It always looks for food in the
same area. The fresh leaf and branch of arbor and shrub are the major food source. The reproduction period is
variable, the pregnant period is 6 months, each time 1 fetus.
The food is branch, fruit and seed of plant. There are 60 species of plants could provide the food for
Muntiacus crinifrons. The nuts fell on ground are the primary food for Muntiacus crinifrons during autumn
34



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
and winter the south mountainous area. It also eats Pueraria lobata,~ Rubus sumatranus, Actinidia chinensis,
Hemerocallis sp.; in the mountainous region of Jiangxi Province, it eatsRhododendron ovatum,~ Itea chinensis
var oblorga, Kadsura Longipedunculata,. Veronicastrum villosulum. Muntiacus crinifrons always approach
the small plots of farmland for food. And often come to the same plot of farmland.
The natural enemy of Muntiacus crinifrons is camivora animal, such as jackal, Neofelis nebulosa and stoat
Muntiacus crinifrons lives in the evergreen broad-leaf forest and the mixing deciduous and evergreen
broad-leaf forest above 600-1200 m elevation. The secondary shrub and secondary deciduous broad-leaf
forest also are the habitant of Muntiacus crinifrons when rarely interfered by human activity.
Muntiacus criniftons distribute in 12 counties in the south Anhui mountainous area. It is reported that the best
activity area of Muntiacus crinifrons in the south mountainous area has been divided into 5 separate segments,
with the total area of 4420 km2 according to a special study in year 2000. Within these areas, there live about
2000 Muntiacus criniftons.
The road sections from Shaji to Taipinghu Lake bridge, the peripheral area of shilishan Natural Reserve and
the peripheral area of Huangshan Landscape Showplace are the normal activity area of Muntiacus criniftons.
The distribution map of Muntiacus crinifrons in 2000 is shown in Figure 4-3-4-1. It is reported that
Muntiacus crinifrons appeared in this area in recent two years.
Capricornis sumatraensis
Capricomnis sumatraensis belongs to Bovidae. It is protected at national class 2, living in the northwest,
southwest, Huangdong, Huangnan and Huazhong regions. They look like goat, with the body weight of 60-90
kg (refer to photo). They animals live in the rock cliff of high mountains or steep forest land. It lives in
individual or small group. It copulates in autumn, pregnant for 7-8 months, each time I or 2 fetus.
It is reported that Muntiacus crinifrons appeared in the peripheral area of Shilioshan Natural Reserve in
recent two years. Appendix 5 presents the report.
Cervus nippon
Cervus nippon belongs to Cervidae. It originally lives in the northeast, Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province and
Sichuan Province. It is protected at the national Class I level. Cervus nippon is a medium deer, the body
length is 140-170 cm. The willer height is 85-100 cm, and the adult is 100-150 kg , the female is relatively
smaller (refer to photo).
Cervus nippon lives in the forest edge or mountain grassland. The habitat changes with seasons. The male
live alone except the estrous period. It copulates from September to November, during which the males
compete aggressively. The fetus is born in next April - June, each time 1 fetus.
Cervus nippon was over-hunted for its high economic value which jeopardized the population of Cervus
nippon Under the artificial breeding, the population has recovered to hundreds of thousands.
35



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
Cervus nippon currently lives in Jing County, Jingde, and Ningguo. A natural reserve zone at national level is
planned to establishin the south mountainous area in 2005.
4.3.5   Assessment of Land Use and Reserved IFarmland
4.3.5.1 Current land Use
According to the stipulations for management of land use in China, the land uses are classified into eight
categories: cultivated land, garden plot, forestland, grassland, residential land, industrial land, transportation
land, water bodies and un-used land. The primary land uses involved in the HHT project are cultivated land,
forest land, residential land, water bodies and transportation land.
Figure 4-3-5-1 presents an aerial photo of the project area and field mapping showing land uses.
The agricultural ecosystem in the area from riverside polder zones of Yangtzi River to the hinterland of hilly
area is complicated. In broad term, land uses include cultivated land, forest land, and cash crop land. Among
these lands, forest includes natural secondary forest and artificial woodland, and the cash crop is dominated
by tea and mulberry. Table 4-3-5-1 shows the area and cultivated rate of cultivated land and cash crop land in
each county along the project. Table 4-3-5-2 presents the area and coverage rate of forest land in the primary
townships in Huangshan District and each county. Please as the TTH will go through Shitai county by only
2.9 km and thus have very limited impact to the land uses in the county, the land baseline and impact
assessment this report do not include Shitai county.

In summary, land uses in the project may be characterized as follows:
*   The cultivated land area is small, so is the area for mulberry, fruit and tea. The rate of cultivated land in
each township of Tongling and Qingyang Counties is more than 10%. The highest rate of cultivated land
is in Rongcheng Township, 26.93%, and the total cultivated rate is also the highest, is 30.56%. The
proportion of cultivated land in each townships of Husngshan District is very low, less than 0.2%. The
lowest proportion is in Tangkou Township, about 0.006%, and the total cultivated rate is the lowest at
0.048%. It is determined that the agriculture mounts high weight in Tongliang and Qingyang Counties,
and slight in Huangshan District.
*   The woodland is large, accounting for more than 30% in each townships along the project. The coverage
of woodland increases as with the proposed TTH extends toward the south. In all of the townships,
except Rongcheng, in Tongling and Qingyang, the forest coverage rate is less than 60%. And in all of
37



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
the townships, except Xianyuan in Huangshan district, the forest coverage rate is more than 60%. The
largest rate of forest coverage is in Tangkou Township, is 94.14%. Clearly, forestry dominates in
Huangshan District.
o    Large plots of cultivated land spreads in the north section of Qiugang and Polder zone. But in the south
section, the farmland spreads in terms of small plot in the valley plain, or distributes along mountain
trench.
4.3.5.2  Reserved Farmland
Table 4-3-5-4 presents the current farmland area, reserved farmland area and their proportion in the total
farmland area. It is shown in the table that, the highest proportion of reserved farmland is 89% (in Sankou
Township of Huangshan District), and the lowest proportion is 80.10% (in Rongcheng Township of Qingyang
County).

4.3.6 Summary of Ecosystem Baseline
Based on the above investigations and assessment, it may be summarized that the ecosystem in the
assessment and the peripheral areas is of a high quality. The good quality may be reflected in the following
aspects:
*   The three sections, Jiuhuanshan Mountains, Shilishan Mountains and Huangshan Mountains, are rich in
wildlife species. According to the diversity and abundance indicators defined in the Index System Study
for Bio-diversity, the diversity of wildlife species in Jiuhuashan Mountains and Huangshan Mountains is
Class B and abundance of species is Class A. There are project area enjoys a high level of bio-diversity.
*   The vegetation coverage of forestland has been classified into artificially planted woodland, secondary
growth forest, bamboo grove, shrub and tea gardens. Sample land investigation has been conducted on
artificial woodland, secondary forest and bamboo grove. The coverage rate of shrub and glass is found
to be over 95%. A Cephalotaxus sinensis, which is a state level Class I protection species plant, was
found in the sample land of mixing evergreen and deciduous broad-leaf forest in Sukeng Village of
Shancha. No other plant species under national protection list has been found however. Although the
community of species under the national protection level has not been found, there probably is some
precious plants protected at national level in the area, they are Cereidiphyllumjaponica, Emmenopterys
henryi,, Liriodendron chinensis., Pseudolarix kaempferi., Pseudotsuga gaussenii, Sinojackia xylocarpa,
Monimopetalum chinens., Kirengeshoma palmate, Magnolia officiinalis subsp, Ormosia hosiei,
Cephalotaxus sinensis, Cinnamomum camphora.
* The wild vertebrate animals in the assessment area are: 8 species of amphibian, 15 species of reptile, 85
species of bird, 72 species of mammals. The wild animals in the inventory for protection at national
level found in the area are: giant salamander (Class 2), Syrmaticus ellioti (Class 1), glede (Class 2),
Falco tinnunculus (Class 2), Cygnus columbianus(Class 2). Tragopan temminckii (Class 2), Syrmaticus
reevesii (Class 2). Neofelis nebulosa (Class 1)> Muntiacus crinifrons (Class 1)> macaque (Class 2),
Macaca thibetana (Class 2). pangolin (Class 2), zibet (Class 2), Viverricula indica (Class 2). jackal
(Class 2). Capricornis sumatraensis (Class 2) and otter (Class 2). And there are some wild animals
included in the inventory for protection at provincial level.
*   The land uses within the assessment area include cultivated land, forest land, water bodies, gardens,
residential land, industrial land and transportation land. The proportion of forestland is the highest
among all land in the project area.
4.4 Acoustic Quality Assessment
4.4.1 Survey of Sensitive Receptors within the Assessment Scope
Based on site surveys during the EA and preliminary design, 71 noise sensitive receptors along the preferred
alignment (including the connection roads) have been identified, including five schools and two seniors
houses and villages closely located to the proposed highway alignment. Details of these sensitive receptors
are presented in Table 4-4-1 (villages), Table 4.4-2 (schools) and Table 4-4-3 (seniors houses), respectively.
The locations of those sensitive receptors are shown in Figure 4-4-1.

4.4.2 Locations of monitoring points
Based on the principle of using representative sites to cover the whole alignment, 13 monitoring points have
been selected for noise baseline monitoring from villages and schools located in different road sections and
different topography. Among the monitoring station, the Dongdian primary school also included sectional
noise monitoring of noise from SI 03 and Wucun village had a 24-hour continued noise monitoring. The
detailed description of the monitoring points is given in Table 4-4-4, the layout of the monitoring points are
shown in Figure 4-4-3 and the location of the monitoring points is shown in Figure 4-4-2.

4.4.3 Monitoring Method and Timing
According to the "Monitoring Method for Environmental Noise in Urban Area" (GB/T14623-93), a
monitoring program has been developed by Anhui Provincial Environmental Monitoring Center for these
pre-identified monitoring points from July 9 to 11, 2002. At each monitoring station, noise level was recorded
for one day from 8:00 -11:00 am, and 22:00 pm -6:00 am the next morning. At Wucun village, noise was
recorded continuously 24 hours on July 11.

4.4.5 Assessment forAcoustic Environment
4.4.5.1  Assessment for Current Sensitive Receptors
From Table 4-4-5 one can see:
*   With the day-time environmental noise in villages at 41.OdB(A) to 60.5dB(A), some of the
villages meet the Class 0 or Class I standards in the "Environmental Noise Standard for
Urban Area". Those villages, which are close to the existing road, the noise level reaches
Class 2 to slightly exceed Class 2 standard. In night-time, the noise levels are 37.5 dB(A)-
43.1dB(A), meeting the Class 1 standard specified in the " Environemntal Noise Standard for
Urban Area". It is apparent that the Project area currently has a very high acoustic
environmental quality.
*   There are five schools along the proposed road. The day-time noise levels are these school
are 47.5 dB(A) to 54.OdB(A), meeting the Class 1 standard specified in the " Environmental
Noise Standard for Urban Area". The noise level in night-time is 39.1 dB(A)-45.1 dB(A),
basically meeting the Class 1 standard (the noise level in Hongshan Primary School exceed
the Class I standard by 0.1 dB(A), but there is no classes at night in the school). It is
therefore apparent that the acoustic environmental quality in the school areas is also good and
in compliance with the acoustic requirement.
4.4.5.2 Assessment for Acoustic Environmental Quality Near S103
About 40 km of the proposed highway will go in parallel and in the close proxinmity to the existing
S103. Therefore some sensitive receptors will be impacted by the compounded noise from both
the proposed TTH and the existing S103. It can be seen from Table 4-4-6, the current traffic flow
on S103 is so small (108 / hr in day time, and 21 / hr at night time), that the area at the two side of
the road are not impacted significantly by noise. The noise level in the area 40-80 m from S103
can meet the Class I standard, areas 80 m from the road and beyond can meet the Class 0 standard.
In night time, the noise level 40 m from the road could meet the Class 1 standard. Therefore, the
project area along with S103 is not seriously impacted by the traffic noise from S103.
4.4.5.3 Assessment Noise Monitoring Results at the Sections on S103
From Table 4-4-7, it is can be seen that: the noise level from 5:40 to 19:40 is 46.1 dB(A)-58.7
dB(A), meeting the Class 2 standard. The higher noise level is due to larger traffic flow on S 103 in
this time period. However, the noise level from 20:40-am 4:40 is 37.2dB(A)-45.3 dB(A),
meeting the Class 0 standard as the traffic is very small at this time period.
In summary, as the proposed TTH avoids going through the large urban areas, the acoustic
environment of the villages has a high quality, meeting Class 2 standards and better. The schools
all meet Class I standard with an excellent acoustic environment.

4.5.3 Current Waters Quality
4.5.3.1  Existing water quality investigation
The EA team used historical water quality data and a monitoring program to determine water
quality at the project area.
Taiping Lake is a focus in the water quality assessment. The annual average water inflow into
Taiping Lake is 1.95 billion m3 and its storage capacity is 2.47 billion mi3. There is no industrial
wastewater discharge within the Taiping Lake Scenic site. The domestic wastewater sources are
tourism service facilities, discharged at 40,000 t/a. By August 2000, 15,000 of the wastewater has
been treated and discharged within the applicable standard.
According to EA team's site investigation, there is no industrial discharge within the Taiping lake
scenic site area. The main sources of water pollutants come from domestic origins, primarily
tourism facilitiss and local households. By August 2000, among the total of wastewater discharge
of 40,000 t/year, 15,000 t/year had been treated to the discharge standards before released to the
lake. There are, however, a few industrial wastewater discharges within the Taiping lake
catchment area, with the total volume of 438,700 t/a.. The urban domestic wastewater (from
Gantang Township, Tangkou Township and Xianyuan Township of Huiangshan District) is about 2
million t/a.
The monitoring program selected a site near Shuiqiaohu as the representative lake water quality
monitoring location which is 180 m to the Taiping Lake bridge. Monitoring parameters used are
permanganate index, oil and SS and monitoring program was carried in July 2002, with methods
in compliance with the "Method for Environmental Monitoring and Analysis" recommended by
SEPA. Water quality data for other surface water bodies are basically from existing sources, i.e.,
the routine monitoring data in the recent years.
Table 4-5-3-1 presents the monitoring data. Water quality information has other rivers and lakes
are based primarily on the recent routine monitoring data from archives.

4.5.3.2   Assessment of existing water quality
Table 1-8-4 and Table 4-5-3-1 demonstrate the compliance status and water quality in the project
area. This status is summarized in Table 4-5-3-2.

It is clear from Table 4-5-3-1 and Table 4-5-3-2 that the water quality in the rivers within the
project area meet the corresponding water quality standards, except the permanganate index in
Puxi River which exceeds the standard slightly.
Lingyang River, Yangxi River and Puxi River, similar to Machuan River are upstream rivers to
Taiping Lake with their flows coming primarily from springs and runoff from mountains. As such,
the flows vary significantly with the season. There are no regular water quality monitoring data for
Lingyang River and Yangxi River while the one-time monitoring is not considered representative.
But, their water quality can be considered similar to that of Machuan River which is located in the
same area with the similar environmental conditions.
54



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
Lingyang River, Yangxi River, Puxi River and Machuan River flow through many townships and
urban areas which do not have any wastewater treatment facilities. As a result, the untreated
wastewater is discharge directly into these rivers and then into Taiping Lake. It is therefore
believed that water quality in Taiping Lake is affected primarily by domestic wastewater and small
amount of industrial wastewater discharged into the lake through these rivers. The primary reason
for water quality to exceed the standards in Puxi River is direct discharge of domestic wastewater.
4.6 Ambient Air Quality
4.6.1 Existing ambient air quality
The investigation and assessment scope in this EA is divided into the airshed in the scenic sites
and airsheds in other road sections
Air qualitV at scenic site
The proposed TTH will cross the Taiping Lake Scenic Site at the section of K142-K150+500.
During the field survey, no air pollution by industrial emmissions has been found. Oil-fuelled or
gas-fuelled boilers are widely used in the lakeshore area however, consisting of the main air
emission sources. The monitoring data in 1998 and 1999 provided by the Environmental
Monitoring Station of Huangshan District are presented in Table 4-6-1.
Table 4-6-1   Monitored Air Quality in Taiping Lake(Unit: mg/Nm3)

The above table shows that, the air parameters in Taiping Lake area, i.e., S02, NOx and TSP all
meet the Class I standard of Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996 revised edition). The
air quality in Taiping Lake is very good.
Other road sections
The proposed highway alignment has been carefully selected to avoid large-scale sensitive
receptors, such as cities and townships. The proposed project will largely cross the hilly area and
small villages. Some road section will be adjacent to the existing road 103. The current air
pollutants in these sections are primarily from the motor vehicle exhaust gas and air-borne dust
arising from S103. But the emission volume is small.
Two air quality monitoring stations have been established based on the distribution of receptors,
project location and the topographical condition. The details on monitoring point locations are
shown in Table 4-6-2 and Figure 4-4-1.

4.6.2   Assessmeunt of Ambient Air Quality
Table 4-6-1, Table 4-6-3 and Table 4-6-4 show that:
The air quality in the road section at Taiping Lake meets the Class I standard of Ambient Air
Quality Standard (GB3095-1996 revised edition). The one-hour average concentration of NO2 is
ranged between 0.010-0.026mg/Nm3 and the daily average concentration between 0.010-
0.022mg/Nm3. The daily average concentration of TSP is 0.100-0.167 mg/Nm3. The monitored
NO2 and TSP meet the Class 2 standard of Ambient Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996
revised edition).
In summary, the monitored NO2 and TSP at each of the monitoring point meet the applicable air
quality standard. The air quality in the project area is very good, implying a large air pollution
assimilative capacity in the region.

4.7 Social Environment Baseline
4.7.1 Overview of directly impacted area
The proposed highway project will go through Tongling City, Chizhou City and Huangshan City
of Anhui Province (see Figure 3-1). The areas under the direct impact of the project are: Tongling
County of Tongling City, Qingyang County and Shitai County of Chizhou City, Huangshan
District of Huangshan City. In total, 15 townships will be directly affected and they are Xinjian
Township and Dongdian Township of Tongling County, Xinhe Township, Rongcheng Township,
Yangtian Township, Yangtian Township, Lingyang Township, Shaji Township of Qingyang County,
Liudu Township of Shitai County, Guanyang Township, Taiping Lake Township, Gantang
Township, Xianyuan Township, Tanjiaqiao Township, Sankou Township and Tangkou Township.
The details of the affected areas may be described as follows:
Tongling County: Tongling County is located in the mid-south of Anhui Province at the south
bank of Yangtzi River. Southeast of the county is mostly low-relief land while its northwest is the
shore plain of Yangtzi River and hills are rolling across the middle area. The total area of the
county is 886 km2.
Qingyang County: Qingyang County is located in the north of Wannan Region. It borders with
Tongling to the north, Nanling and Jing County to the east, Taiping Lake and Huangshan
Mountains to the south, and Guichi to the west. Jiuhuashan Mountains, a major Buddhism
2
throne site, is located in the southwest of the county. The total area of the county is 1180.6 km .
The low-relief and hills comprise the main characteristics of the terrain. The folk saying of the
county goes that the county is "seven tenth be the mountain, one tenth be the water and two tenth
be farmland".
Shitai County:   Shitai County is located in the south of Anhui Province, the hinterland of the
south mountainous area. It borders with Qingyang County, Qimen County and Yi County . The
2
total area of the county is 1403 kM . Qingyang is a poverty county.
Huangshan District: It is located in the south of Anhui Province. The total area of this district is
2
1775 km . There are many tourism resources in the district, such as Taiping Lake and Huangshan
Mountains.
4.7.2 Population Structure
The population structure in the project area is detailed in Table 4-7-2-1.
Table 4-7-2-1      Population structure in affected area

Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
The above table shows that the population density in the affected area is low, especially in Shitai
County and Huangshan District. Furthermore, these areas are all rural with similar population
structure. More than 80% of population is agricultural based, belonging to typical mountainous
rural region.
4.7.3  Primairy Economic indicators
The project area is partially in the low hill/plain area and partially in the mountainous area. In
general, the project area is poor, including a national poverty county (Shitai). The major macro
economics indicator are shown in Table 4-7-2-1.

The above table shows that, Tongling County and Huangshan District are relatively prosperous.
Shitai County on the contrast is economically weak in Anhuhi Province, with per capita GDP far
below the other counties.
4.7.4  Quality of Livinmg
l[ncome
The quality of living in the area to be directly affected by the project is poor and there is an
enormous disparity between the urban and rural areas in this region. The annual net income of
farmers is marginally higher than RMB2000 with the worst at Shitai County at less than RMB
1200 per capita on average.
lTable 4-7-4-1 Income Data in the Project Area
Area          Annual per capita income (urban)  Annual per capita income (rural)
(RMB)                            (RMB)
Tongling County               5553                             2356
Qingyang County               6484                            2145.86
Shitai County               4961                             1144.77
Huangshan District             7089                             2416
During the field visits, the EA team learnt that the income variation among farmers is wide. Some
farmers could get the annual income more than RMB10,000 due to prosperous tourism and
income form tourists. In contrast, the farmers living in the remote mountainous region rely solely
58



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
on the farmland for their income. Worse, the soil in the region is poor which have low yields. The
life quality of these farmers is extremely poor.
Disease Control
In order to effectively control and eliminate the epidemics and infectious diseases, widespread
immunization of children has been proposed across the whole project area. The Project region has
not reported any Class 1 infectious diseases and severe epidemics.
Additionally, AIDS has begun to spread in the province. Since the first case of AIDS in Anhui
Province in 1994, there have been 499 reported cases of AIDS to September 2001. These cases
have been reported in 41 counties of 13 cities in the province. Young people are the dominant
population of the infected. The people aged at 20-49 accounts for 85.57% of the total infected. The
AIDS case has been increasing year by year in the province. Measures have been taken in Anhui
Province against HIV positive spreading and to cure the infected people. The knowledge about
AIDS has been widely distributed among the rural area via TV, radio and newspaper.
4.7.5 Infrastructure
The main transportation infrastructure in the project region is presented in the following table:
Table 4-7-5-1 Major Infrastructures in the Project Area
Grade of road      Expressway   Gradel   Grade2   Grade3   Grade4    Other   Total

It can be seen that there is currently no expressway in the project area, and the grade of roads is
low. The transportation condition in the area-is poor.
4.7.6 Natural Resources
Land
The project will be through the mountainous region where farmland is scarce and precious. The
site investigation shows that the cultivated land per capita in the project area is about 1-2
mu/capita, belonging to scarce cultivated land rural region.
59



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
Mineral Resources
The distribution of mineral resource in the project area is shown in following table.
Table 4-7-6-1 Mineral Resouirces in the Project Area
Area                                Overview of mineral resource
The primary minerals are copper, gold, iron and coal It is one of the key base of gold and
Tongling County  coal production in China. There is the largest gold mining industry, Huangshilao Gold
Tongling County     Mine, in Anhui Province. The annual production of gold in the county is more than 50
thousand liang ( I hang equivalent to 50 g).
The mineral resources are dolomite, calcite, lime, pyrites, quartz and granite The storage
Qingyang County   of dolomite is 400 million t, with high quality and easy to mine. The mineral development
will be the new focus for economic development
Shitai County                             More pyntes and marble.
Huangshan District                    Molybdenum, coal, vanadium and quartz.
The above table shows that there are abundant mineral resources in the project area. The
exploration and development of the mineral are limited, however, by the poor transportation and
available technologies.
4.7.7   Tourist Resources in the Plroject Area
The project influenced area, which includes Tongling, Qizhou and Huangshan cities, has one of
the richest tourist resources in China, particularly Huangshan city. Huangshan city has three
administrative districts (Tunxi, Huangshan and Huizhou districts), four counties (She, yi, Xiuning
and Qimen counties) and one scenic site (Huangshan Mountain Scenic site), and the city has its
government organizations in Tunxi District.
Huanshan city has its world renowned tourist attraction, Huangshan mountain. In addition, the city
has other natural and cultural attractions within its boundary, including world cultural heritage site,
Xidi, Hong village; Dong religious shrine site, Qiyu Mountain; Hui traditional housing and
Tangyue monuments in the Naping and Qiankou area; Guniujiang Nature Reserve; Taiping Lake
scenic site, etc. The locations of these sites are shown in Figure 4.7-1.

Taiping Lake Scenic site and Jiuhuanshan Mountain Scenic site which is located in Qingyang
county, will be directly impacted by the highway construction and/or operation. These three major
scenic sites are collectively known as "Two Mountains and One Lake".
Huangshan Mountain Scenic site (i.e., the Huangshan Mountain): Huanshan Mountain is
located in the mountainous region in south Anhui province, China. It is within the jurisdiction of
Huangshan district, Huangshan city. Huangshan Mountain is 1864 meter above the sea and the
scenic site covers a total area of 154 km2. As a typical mountainous scenery, Huangshan Mountain
was included in the list of "State Key Scenic Sites" in 1982 and selected as one of the ten best
known scenic sites of China in 1985. In December 1990, Huangshan Mountain was awarded both
World Cultural Heritage and World Nature Heritage sites by the UNESCO, and included in the
World Heritage Sties list. Huangshan Mountain is known for its beautiful scenery particularly its
stunning pines, remarkable rocks, sea of cloud and hot springs. Often Huangshan is praised to be
such a beauty with different faces that it "collects the best of all mountains in one site and melts
all wonders of the world in one pot".
Taiping Lake Scenic site: Taiping Lake Scenic site is located within Huangshan District, between
Huangshan Mountain and Jiuhuashan Mountain, about 30 km to both sites. Taiping Lake is a
man-made lake originally known as Chencun Reservoir. The Lake is about 60 km long in
east-west direction and 6 km wide in north-south direction, with a total surface area of 88 km2 and
average depth of 40 m. In 1987, Taiping Lake was approved by Anhui provincial government as
one of the provincial key tourist attractions.

The Taiping Scenic site consists basically of the clear lake, low hills, wood land and farm fields,
scattered with rural housing and, occasionally, large villages around the lake. The entire scenic site
is about 260 km2, which is also listed as a key ecological reserve where there are state protective
species of plants and wild life.
Taiping Lake Scenic site has currently developed several scenic spots including Bagua island, Hou
Island, Taiping bay and Huangjin Island (see Figure 4-7-3 for their locations), but the development
so far is at very low level. At the south shore, there are some hotels and marina for pleasure boats,
but once again they are relatively primitive. In general, the Taiping Lake Scenic site as a tourist
attraction is still yet to be developed.
Jiuhuashan Mountain Scenic site: Jiuhuashan is located in Qingyang county, Chizhou city, with
a beautiful scenery. But more significantly, the mountain is well known domestically and overseas
for its Buddhist culture. Jiuhuashan Mountain is one of the four major Buddhist mountains in the
country and best known in, besides China, east and southeast Asia particularly Korea, Japan,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao where Buddhist is deeply rooted in their cultures.
Jiuhuashan Mountain Scenic site is about 120 km2 and within the site there are over 90 temples
including ten as the state key temples, with a total of over 600 monks. The key attractions include
Rushen Hall, Longevity Palace, Diyuan temple, Tiantai and Fenghuang Pine.
To-date, highway S103 is the only transportation route connecting Huangshan Mountain,
Jiuhuashan Mountain and Paiping Lake scenic sites. However, the road conditions at S103 are
poor and it is the sole connection between the region with the outside world. As the transportation
capacity on S103 is very limited, the tourists resources in the region have not been well utilized
with some of them are still yet to be known by outside world.
4.7.8  Urban Pllanning alloig the Proposed ARignment
Tongling city plan
The proposed highway will pass the urban area in the April 1995 approved Tongling City Plan.
The actual land use for the highway will be road land according to the plan. On the both sides of
the highway, the planned land uses are green area. At present, the highway area is still countryside
land. The relationship between planned Tongling urban area and the proposed highway is shown
in Figure 4-7-4.
Qingyang county plan
The townships closely related to the proposed project include Rongcheng, Tongfu, Xihe, Yangtian,
Tongbao, Lingyang, and Shaqi. The proposed highway will pass the east side of Rongcheng on
transportation land reserved in the April 1996 approved Qingyang county plan. The closest
distance to the planned township center is 1000 m. The relationship between planned Qingyang
urban area and the proposed highway is shown in Figure 4-7-5.

Huangshan City Urban Area Plan
The Master Plan of Huangshan city was approved by Anhui Provincial Govemment in June 1994.
In the Plan, the urban is to be further developed and expanded towards the relatively flat land in
the southwest. The proposed highway will go through north of the urban area, about 900 m to
Huangshan district (Gantang township) at its closest point. As shown in Figure 4-7-6, the project
will be located outside of the Master Plan area for the city and have no inference with city
planning and development. In fact, the construction of the TTH will help further development of
the Huangshan city due to the greatly improved transportation conditions and the link of the city
with the outside world.
4.7.9 Planning for "Two Mountains and One Lake"
The Master Plan for Regional Tourism in the "Two Mountains and One Lake" Region of Anhui
Province is prepared by the World Tourism Organization which is engaged by Anhui Provincial
Tourism Bureau. The final version of the Plan was completed and approved by the government in
May 2002. The master plan has provided advice and recommendations to the development of
tourism resources, construction of supporting facilities and environmental protection in the "Two
Mountains and One Lake" area based on the assessment of regional tourism resources. This
project will cross the core of the "Two Mountains and One Lake" area and detailed impact
assessment is included in Section 5.6.5 of this report.
4.7.10 Domestic Solid Waste Disposal
There are no dedicated solid waste disposal facilities in the region and those generated by the local
residents are randomly dumped or sometimes burned in an uncontrolled manner in the field.
Domestic solid waste can be seen in many rural areas during the field survey. The impacted area
has no significant industries and no industrial waste. All solid waste generated is of a municipal
nature or origin.
4.7.11 Cultural Relics
A detailed field survey was conducted for cultural relics/archaeological sites along the main and
preferred alignment of the highway, the five section alternative alignments, and 22 borrow pits and
waste disposal. The scope of the survey is 100 m from the central lines of the highway alignments
and the borrow pits/disposal sites themselves, based on the information provided by the project
design team.
This section focuses on the finds from the survey on the preferred alignment and borrow pits and
disposal site. The impact assessment of to the relics sites is presented in Section 5.7.1, mitigation
measures, Section 5.7.3 and those on the alternative alignments, Chapter 6.

4.7.11.1 Methodology of the Survey
The cultural relic survey was carried out by the Anhui Provincial Cultural Relic Archeological
Institute. The Institute first collect and review the relevant documents including previous
archaeological finds, study reports, etc. about the field. Then May 20 to June I of 2002, the field
team from the Institute conducted a site survey and prepared its first draft report in July 2002. In
October 2002, following the requirements from comments from a World Bank project preparation
mission, additional field survey was conducted and the reported revised. Sections in this EA report
relevant to the cultural relics field survey and assessment are based on the information contained
in the October 2002 version of the archaeological study report.
4.7.11.2 Survey Results
In total 9 cultural relics sites including one fossil site, two ancient sites, two ancient tomb groups,
one ancient kiln site and one ancient building have been found by the field survey. Table 4-7-1 1-1
shows these finds and the locations of these sites are shown in Figure 4-7-7.

None of the above sites fall into the cultural relics protection categories at the state, the provincial
and municipal level, indicating limited cultural and archaeological significance and value.
4.8 Current Status of Natural and Cultural Heritage
The TTH will result in certain levels of environmental pollution and ecological impacts, but also
visual or other impacts to the scenic sites. Scenery originally is a geography definition, describing
generally natural scenes including their forms, structures, colors, etc. More substance is later
added to the definition, resulting in scenery with different concepts, including aesthetics and
geographic scenery, cultural scenery and ecological scenery. The scenic concept applied in this EA
refers mainly to aesthetics scenery, that is, visual scenery.
4.8.1 Formation of landscape and objective for assessment
In broad term, all forms of the natural and artificial structures and colors could constitute a scenery.
A road scenery includes the road itself, as well as natural and man-made scenery (scenic
environment) along the road. As such, a road is the collective visual scenery of the road and all
visual environment within a certain scope from the road.
The objective of assessment for scenery/visual impact is to identify the potential impacts, both
positive and negative, on the scenery throughout the project stages of construction and operation,
and to provide mitigation measures for protection, utilization and development of the scenery and
minimizing the adverse impacts.
The scenic or visual impacts assessment is to first identify natural or artificial scenery (scenic
environment). The status of scenic environment assessment would be conducted based on such
criteria as aesthetic quality, sensitivity and threshold. The mitigation measures would be then
designed in context of the identified potential impacts.
4.8.2 Assessment of quality of the scenery
Quality of the scenery is assessed primarily based on aesthetic quality, sensitivity and threshold.
Aesthetic quality
The aesthetic quality is closely related with visual significance. Although there is variation in the
scenery quality assessment due to the difference in geographical location, culture, background and
education level, a wide consensus on common aesthetics does exist. Usually, people would accept
that aesthetics is natural, harmonious and unique.
Sensitivity
The sensitivity of scenery is the degree and scope to be acknowledged which is defined by the
65



Tongling-Tangkou expressway project EIA
relative angle, distance, frequency of presence and comparison degree.
In general, the larger the relative angle between the viewer and the scenery is, the more area of
scenery would be seen or receive an attention, namely the sensitivity is larger. In visual scope, the
closer the distance between the viewer and the scenery is, the higher the visibility and clearness,
namely the sensitivity is higher. Furthermore, the more frequent occurrence and/or the longer the
lasting of the scenery within the visual scope of the viewer, the higher contrast of the scenery
against the background (contrast can be the form, configuration, color, materials and movement)
and thus the higher sensitivity.
Threshold
The threshold is an indicator for tolerance of landscape against the outside interference (artificial
interference), and the recovery capacity after damaged caused by outside interference. It covers
the aspects of ecological and visual. The threshold applied in this report is largely limited to visual
significance. Where the threshold is low, minor outside interference could bring significant visual
impact; where the threshold is high, minor visual impact would be caused regardless of the
magnitude of interference. The low threshold always presents in the landscape isolated from
human activity. In contrast, the strongly human active area deserves a higher threshold.

Chapter 5 Environmental Impact Assessment and Mitigation Measures
5.1 Category and Extent of Environmental Impacts
The TTH is a major infrastructure in Anhui province, and in particular, part of the TTH alignment will go
through sensitive ecosystems. The massive construction activities which are to last for four years and the long
term operation of the TTH will bring adverse temporary or permanent, reversible and in-reversible impacts,
as well as benefits, to the natural and socio-economic environments. Table 5-1-I lists the categories and
extent of environmental impacts expected to be brought about from the TTH and the detailed assessment of
these impacts are presented in the reminder of this chapter, as generally outlined in Table 5-1-2.

The Wannan (south Anhui) region covers the whole area south of the Yangtzi River within Anhui Province.
The general topography in the region is characterized with high and low hills with forest coverage accounting
for 58.8% of the total regional area. This region can be further classified in termns of topography into southern
mountainous area and peripheral low-relief area. The southern mountainous area covers Qimen, Xiuning, She,
Yi, Ningguo, Shengde, Shitai, Dongzhi, Guichi, Qingyang, and Huangshan counties/cities, while the eripheral

low-relief area.covers Zhicheng, Langxi, Guangde, Nanling, Fanchang, Tongling, Wuhu, Dangtu and
Ma'anshan counties/cities.
The Wannan region, especially the southern mountainous area, was once covered with exuberant forest where
wildlife was abundant and bio-diversity level was high. Due to thousands of years of human activities,
especially in the peripheral low-relief area where has been significantly impacted by the human activities
such as construction of settlement and infrastructure, cultivation and pollutant discharges, the natural
ecosystem has been nearly destroyed. In the southern mountainous area, natural ecosystem size has shrink,
the continuity degree decreased and the ecosystem becomes more fragile, due to the strong interruption by
human activities.
Based on the field investigation, the human impacts on the area along the proposed project area in the
southern mountainous region have been mostly through the following:
*   The wide valley plains in the region have mostly be built-up with population settlements, which are
connected with one another among the villages, counties or cities by local or village roads;
*   In the narrower valley plains (about 50 m wide or less) have mostly been cultivated. It is also very
common to cultivate on the slopes.
*   Most gentle slopes near village or population settlements have been planted with economic forest such
as mulberry, tea and bamboo. In the mountains far from village but with an easy access, the timber stand
such as pines and firs are planted.
*   Industrial factories and mining industry operate in some villages and townships while massive services
and supporting facilities have been constructed in scenic areas such as Taiping Lake and Huangshan
mountain scenic site for tourism.
In principle, the degree of natural ecosystem fragmentation would increase with the increase in population
density. It has been reckoned (Wu Xiaoming, 2001) that the total population within the 926 natural reserve
zones in China (1996 data) is about 13.3366 million, and population in communities peripheral to these zones
is about 54.634 million, with an average population density of 15/km2. However, this figure will become
60-70/ km2 if taking away the 50 biggest reserve zones which is more than 90,000 hectares. Table 5-2-1-1
shows the population density and cultivated ratio in the major counties in the Wannan mountainous area.

human activities, followed by Yi County and Xiuning County.

southern mountainous area, TM images are used for ecological analysis, as shown in Figure 5-2-1-1. In the
map, the city and township and large human active region have been circled. The warm colors in the map are
bush and grass, while the cold colors are secondary evergreen broadleaf forest and artificial coniferous
woodland. The villages and farmland are shown by the yellow lines, the operational primary roads, by dark
yellow line, the preferred route for the TTH, by the red line, and the alternative alignments, by the blue lines.
The existing and proposed natural reserve zones, and scenic sites are also shown in this map.
The Figure 5-2-1-Ishows that, the natural ecosystem remains in existence in the southern mountainous area.
Located mainly in the Jiulongfeng-Wuxishan-Dahongling-Shitai-Laoshan area with the secondary evergreen
broad-leave forest and bush dominating the vegetation coverage, followed by artificial coniferous woodland.

It is reported that the average population density in most of this area is 30 /km . Clearly, this is a area with the
least impacts from human activities and is the core of the southern mountainous area with rich wildlife and
high level of bio-diversity. This core area of the ecosystem is about 20 km from the proposed TTH.
5.2.1.2  Impacts to Natural Ecosystem Integrity
Fiogure 5-2-1-1 shows the natural ecosystem integrity and the potential impact to it from the proposed project.
These impacts will primarily be:
Long-term impact of human activities
Human activities are undoubtedly a major trigger to fragments of natural ecosystems.
The north section of the proposed road is located in the peripheral low-relief area which has been
significantly impacted by active human activities. The south section is located in the Wannan mountainous
region which is mixed of natural and semi-natural ecosystems. The middle area of the Wannan mountainous
region has been impacted by human activity as well which has divided this area into east and west parts. The
area east of Jing county, Jingde county, Jixi county, She county is the east ecosystem which is connected with
Zhejiang province (see Figure 5-2-1-1) while area west of these counties is the west ecosystem which is
connected with Ganbei mountainous area. The active human activities create segregation in the natural
ecosystem. The villages and farmland and road networks have also contribute to the fragmentation of natural
ecosystems.
In the third meeting of the World Bank's Subsidiary Body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice,
(SBSTTA) held in Montreal from September I to 5 of 1997, the Coordination Team for Bio-diversity
Indicators presented an indicator system for assessment of bio-diversity. This system covers the type of
ecosystem and sub-zone areas. There are four classes of subzone area indicating the ability for maintaining
self-recovery. These subzones are sized as 1-10 km', 10-100 km', 100-1000 km', 1000-10000 km'.
In the Wannan mountainous area, there is no natural ecosystem segment larger than 1000 km2 . Except a few
73



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
segments within Huangshan Mountain, Guniujiang, Jiulongfeng and Dahongling which are larger than 100
2                                                2
km , most of the segment ecosystems are smaller than 100 km
Increased segregation of ecosystem by human activities
The south section of the proposed TTH is within the west part of the Wannan mountainous area (described
above). The road would go through the suburban area of Tongling city, outside folder area of Shibasuo
Natural Reserve, valley plain east of Qingyang County, valley plain of Jiuhuashan Mountains, lakeshore area
of Taiping Lake and Gantang basin. The TTH alignment in the above areas is basically along farm land or
operating road where human activities have already been very active. The incremental increase in the impacts
of the TTH to the fragmentation of ecosystems in these areas is therefore very limited. However, the
proposed road could enforce the fragmentation which already exists.
aImpacts to the intact area
The proposed TTH will go through Yangmei village section near Jiuhuashan, the peripheral areas of Shilishan
mountain nature reserve and the peripheral area of the Huangshan mountain scenic site where the natural
ecosystems are basically intact. The construction and operation of the TTH will have significant impacts in
terms of ecosystem fragmentation in these areas.
Existing or planned natural reserve zones
The existing or planned forest ecosystem and wildlife/nature reserve zones are mostly located within the area
with good natural conditions. The Figure 5-2-1-1 shows that most of the reserve zones are to the southwest of
the proposed road. It implies that these areas are so far less affected by human activities.
In summary, the proposed TTH would cross the east edge of the west part (west ecosystem) of the Wannan
mountainous region. The road would contribute to fragmentation of natural ecosystems in this region.
5.2.1.3  Tlrend in lmpacted Bio-diversity
Occupation of woodland will inevitably damage some trees, likely including the trees included in the national
or provincial protection lists. As these plants also grow in other places in the region, the impacts from the
highway would unlikely to cause any species to extinguish..
Within the project area, there are several species of wildlife under the protection lists, such as neofelis
nebulosa, and serow Although the project will enhance the segmentation and fragmentation of the natural
ecosystems, large natural ecosystem area with will still remain on both sides of the highway. Again the
construction of the TTH will not cause any species to extinguish.
In summary, the proposed project will not cause any species to extinguish although it could reduce the size of
the habitat for some wildlife, or form meta-population. The details of the impact analysis are included in
Section 5.2.3.

Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
5.2.2 Impact to Natural Plant Colonies and Protected Plants
Restricted by topography conditions, the proposed highway is aligned mostly along the broad valley plain.
The elevation of the road is less than 350 m. and the natural reserve zones have been avoided with a special
attention paid during the design and analysis of alternative alignments. However, the vegetation cover will
still be damaged during the construction and operation. The damage includes the loss of part of the vegetation
cover in the highway area, change of natural colony succession, damage of individual precious plants, and
intrusion of exotic species and pest.
5.2.2.1 Estimation of Loss of Woodland
Woodland will lose to the TTH due to land occupation by the highway. Based on the site investigation on
plant distribution, the major type of vegetation to be affected by the TTH includes secondary forest, artificial
woodland, bamboo grove and tea garden. Table 5-2-2-1 shows the areas of each type of forestland to be
permanently lost due to the project land occupation, and Table 5-2-2-2 shows the statistics result of the trees
to be cut by the project.

Table 5-2-2-1 and Table 5-2-2-2 show that, the permanent occupation of forestland is 4052.14 mu (270.14 ha),
accounting for 43.3% of the total land to be acquired. There are 7310 trees to be cut.
5.2.2.2  Natural succession of forestland
The proposed road will in part cut through mountains and forest, resulting in direct damages of the forest
colonies, vegetation coverage, and reduced bio-diversity. Moreover, the influx of people and motor vehicles
would impose significant impact on the arbor, shrub and herbaceous layers. In particular, the shrub and
herbaceous in the areas could be damaged so badly that they may extinguish from the area completely,
resulting in a loss of a forest colony layer. The arbor layer will become vulnerable to the change of
environmental conditions without the support and stimulus of the under-wood, rendering them more easy
targets and victims for pest invasion. As the whole forest colony becomes weak at assimilation and
self-adjustment, the stability of the colony will decrease. Without a prompt recovery, the natural succession
would stop or even reverse. Furthermore, the trees to be cut is concentrated on several areas, resulting in
deterioration of the forest colonies or even becoming bare land.
When the highway is constructed, the forest land acquired and occupied by the highway will become road
and supporting facilities. The area originally deep in the forest will then become an open land, causing the
evergreen and shade-loving plants be replaced quickly by heliphilous plants, forming a "forest gap" in the
forest. In such gaps, plant colony succession will be changed or even succeed by broadleaf forest.
The above described impacts, formation of forest gaps, could also occur in connetion roads, construction
camps, borrow pits, disposal sites, if not handled properly.
76



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
5.2.2.3 Analysis for impact on precious plant
Within the land to be permanently acquired, there are no colonies of plants included in the national or
provincial plant protection lists. However scattered precious trees have been seen at the project area during
the field investigation, which will be affected (cut) by the TTH construction.
5.2.2.4 Analysis for impact by intrusion of exotic species and pest
Today, the pests threatening the forest along the Tongling-Tangkou highway area include bordered white
moth, pine nematode and capricorn beetle. Bordered white moth is the dominating pest in Anhui Province
which often occurs in the pine forests along the proposed road as well as elsewhere in the province. The
suffered forest area is about 100,000 mu or 6700 ha in a bad year which could cause serious harm to the pine
forest. Pine nematode is the fatal pest to pine trees and has been ranked as a key control target in the forest
quarantine in the country. However, there is still no effective method to control it. At present, the suffered
area of pine nematode in Tongling County is 600 mu .Up to now, there is no pine nematode been found in
pine forests of Jiuhuashan Mountain and Huangshan Mountain areas. The capricorn beetle can bring
dangerous harm to poplar, pine and cypress. The capricorn beetle has been found in the three counties along
the proposed road.
The pest will be brought into the area by use of timber, wooden case and new trees trucked from other places
during construction and operation. There are vast masson trees grow along the proposed highway, therefore
the pest control will be oriented toward the protection of pine trees.
The most popular pest in the project area is pine nematode which spread by the stem borer. The
characteristics of the pine nematode include:
*   Multiple speicies and wide distribution.
*   Large suitable areas to survive. In fact most regions of China are suitable for pine nematode to live in
terms of climate and host plant;
*   Quick to spread through insects and movement of timber or timber products; and
*   Fatal to plants and hard to control. When a pine tree is infected with the pine nematode, it is very
difficult to cure and within 40 days the infected trees will die. Especially in the forest, the pine nematode
can spread across the forest very fast. A entire forest can be destroyed within 3-5 years. Therefore pine
nematode is called as cancer of pine tree.
There are various host plants for pine nematode, dominant by pine trees. Under natural conditions, there are
44 species of trees which can host the pest and 18 species of trees can be infected by artificial inoculation. In
China, nice speicies have been found in the past to have been infected and they are:
Pinus thunbergii P Massoniana P thunbergi, P massoniana P Luchuensis P bungeana P elliotti ,P Taeda,
Ppinaster
The pine nematode could be spread by means both of natural and man-caused. The natural means is insects
which bring the pine nematode from infected to healthy trees. In a rare case, the pine trees could be infected
by direct contact of roots with infected trees. Studies in the past show that the natural spreading range is
77



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
about 100 m. The pine nematode also can be spread by man caused means. The timber or wooden products
infected with pine nematode could bring it to remote places. In prosperous areas where there is a faster
material flow, the possibility of man-caused spreading is higher.
Up to now, five insects have been found to be able to bring the pine nematode: Monochamus
alternatus(major insect vector). Acanthocinus griseus, A gundaiensis, Blastophagus piniperda, and
Odontotermes formosanus In addition, the insect vectors reported in foreign countries that also found in
China: Monochamus saltuarius, Ahropalus rusticus, Spodylis buprestoides.
In summary, the pine nematode is a devastating pest to pine trees. It could spread across China, causing
significant damage to forest resources and ecosystems, unless there is efficient and effective control plan.
Today, the intrusion of foreign species has become a focus of ecological study worldwide. Especially in the
case of herbaceous plant which could invade into an area at astonishing speed. The studies show that in most
cases the exotic species invade to the area with active human activities. The bare area of the TTH could likely
become the pathway for exotic species intrusion.
5.2.2.5  Other impacts on forest
Other impacts of the TTH to the vegetation coverage in the project area include exhaust gas from motor
vehicles, and air borne dust, and soil erosion.
The operation of the TTH will bring a large number of motor vehicle traffic to the project areas. The emission
from the motor vehicles could affect the healthy growth of the forest.
The dust due to construction activity will directly affect the forest and under-wood plants. The change of the
environmental conditions, directly or indirectly caused by the project, will also affect the growth of forest.
In particular, the water holding capacity of forest will be eroded by the permanent occupation of land.
According to Study of Ecological System Service Function and Ecological Value in Hainan Island (Ou
Yangzhi, 2002, Meteorology Press), the average water holding capacity of evergreen broad-leave forest is
623.91 t/(km2o a), and the average water holding capacity of farmland is 362.99 t/(km2o a). Simiarly,
according to Ecological Environmental Impact Assessment (Mao Wenyong, China Evironmental Science
Press, 1998), each mu of land covered by forest could hold 20 m3/a (equivalent to 300 mi3/ kM2) more water
than that not covered by forest.
The permanent occupation of forestland by this project is 296.67 kM2, and additional 7310 trees will be cut
down which is converted to be 302.4 km2 of forest land, the total forestland therefore is 5.73 km2 (each hec.
forest has 1275 trees). Assuming the average water holding capacity of forest in the southern mountaineous
area is 375 m3/(km2o a), the total loss of water holding capacity due to the permanent occupation of forest is
estimated to be 113,400 m3/a.
5.2.3  Wildlife (Wild Animals)
78



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
The potential impacts of the TTH to wildlife or wild animals will be due mainly to interference of their
habitats including damage of vegetation cover, corridor blocking, noise and vehicle light. This section
presents the analysis of the impacts to the wildlife, in preparation for design of effective preventive and
mitigative measures. The impact assessment is primarily based on the ecological principles, with
consideration of animals habits and distribution as well as the various construction and operation activities of
the TTH.
5.2.3.1  Impact in construction phase
Amphibian
The amphibian animals will be directly harmed by construction activities, such as entrance of people and
equipment into their habitats, operation of equipment, stockpile of materials and disposal of waste materials
from tunnels. In particular, construction activities in the steep slopes, the amphibian animals in a large
number could be killed. In addition, construction workers could catch several species of frogs for food,
threatening the survival of these species in the project areas.
During the site investigation, amphibian animals were seen to be killed by running motor vehicles. In view of
greatly increased flow of motor vehicle traffic during the construction phase, more amphibian animals are
expected to be killed this way.
Land excavation and access road to site will damage part of the ecosystem. Slag disposal at slope land or
riverside could directly damage frog population. The slag pile or waste disposal sites may not see any frogs
for about 6-10 years due to significant change of the environmental conditions, but this impact is reversible.
In the valley and streams at Shilishan Mountains and Shancha Village there is trace of Andrias davidinus
which is the protected animal under the Class 2 of the national list. Care will be taken during the construction
phase to avoid the damage to this precious animal.
Reptiles
Reptiles also could be affected by the construction activity. The noise arising from construction activity could
force the reptiles out of the construction site. The slag tapping and stockpile could hurt some reptiles. The
slag pile site, before the plant cover is restored, will not be a suitable habitat for such reptiles as snakes due to
straight sunlight it receives; but heliphilous animals such as lizard could gather in the site.
The most potential impact on reptiles is the local culture to eat snakes. The this habit could not be effectively
controlled in the construction site. When there is a large number of people moved in to the construction
camps, more snakes could potentially end up in the dinning tables, resulting in decrease in snake population
in the area. Furthermore, rodents which are naturally controlled by snakes could over-reproduce, causing
significant damage to crops and forests.
79



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Bird
The adverse impacts of the TTH construction likely to birds are:
* Damage of the bird habitat. The ecosystem in terrace and river valley could be damaged within the
construction site due to housing, road pavement and other construction activities. Waterfowls will have
to mitigate to other places.
*   Due to explosion operation, vibration of equipment, noise of vehicle and construction machinery, air
emission and wastewater discharges, the birds may be forced to leave the site for other places.
*   If the construction worker catch bird, the impact would be more significant.
Mammals
Part of mammals habitats will be destroyed by the project, forcing the mammals, such as otter, to mitigate to
other places.
Explosion operation, vibration of equipment, noise of vehicles and construction machinery, air emission and
and wastewater discharges also would become one of the important reasons for mitigation of mammals.
The influx of construction workers will bring together some rodents which accompany human being. In
response, the quantity of colony of mammals that feed on rodents may increase.
5.2.3.2 General Impact in operation phase
Amphibian animals
The noise and light from running motor vehicle could disturb the amphibian animals. Some animals that like
to live in quient environment and sensitve to noise, such as giant salamander, could be forced to migrate from
the area affected by noise and light.
The amphibian animals will only be active in small area. The severance by the TTH will not significantly
affect the amphibian animals and their habitats.
Reptiles
The severance and blocking of the movement by the highway will impact reptiles because the activity area of
reptile is relatively large. Without their normal pathways, the colony of reptiles would be separated by the
road, which is harmful to their survival. The light of running vehicle will attract more moth, which will in
turn attract more lizards feeding on moth. The parking lot will attract the mouse, which will in turn attract
more snakes.
Birds
Wilcove (1985) birds destroyed by their natural predators are proportional to the distance of their nests to the
80



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
perimeters of the forest. For example, percentage of destroyed nests located at the perimeter of forest is 6
times higher those located 600 m into the forest. Clearly, with the TTH, a large area of now deep forest will
become perimeter forest, increasing the likelihood of nests in those areas to be destroyed by their natural
predators.
Deijnen (1995) studied the relationship between of noise and bird reproduction rate. The observations of 43
species of birds showed that traffic noise will affect bird reproduction. When birds are exposed 24 hours in
noise level exceeding 50 dB(A), the bird reproduction rate will reduce by 20-98%. The noise modeling shows
that within 200 m from the central line of the highway, noise level will be basically higher than 50 dB(A).
Therefore the increased noise level from the TTH operation will affect reproduction of birds living within this
area. It could also force the birds to build their nests further inside the forest. It is expected that in the area of
600 m to the highway, bird population will decrease and will be lower than that in the deep forest.
As birds fly, the operation of the TTH is not expected to have other significant impacts to birds.
Mammals
In view of large activity areas required for mammals, the pathway blocking and habitat severance by the
highway will significantly affect the mammals.
The noise and light will make large or medium-size mammals far away from the road, however, some small
mammals, such as Muridae, Mustela sibirica and Felis bengalensis will gather in this area.
5.2.3.3 Impact on endangered animals during operation phase
Within the project affected area, there are several mammals under the national Class I or 2 protection lists.
Therefore potential impacts to these mammals are a major concern and a sensitive issue.
Waterfowls under protection in the Shibasuo nature reserve zone can fly over to the Shuiqiao Lake and ponds
in the areas for the highway now without any disruption. The noise and exhaust gases will render the area less
attractive or suitable for the waterfowls to come for food near the highway area. However, the TTH is not
located within the reserve zone itself, and the areas near the highway are not the major food pool for birds.
Therefore, the waterfowls are not expected to be significantly impacted.
The carnivorous animals, such as neofelis nebulosa, are most sensitive to human activities. The noise in
operation phase will directly disturb them, forcing them to be out of the road corridor area. Herbivores are
more tolerant to noise than carnivorous animals. The degree of tolerance to noise is not reported for some
herbivores. It is likely that these herbivores would leave the noise area, or they could adapt the noise
environment to some degree.
Motor vehicle lighting could impact some mammals, confusing the animals on day and night. Such confusion
could disrupt their life cycle or habits. These mammals may leave the lighting affected area as a result.
Corridor blocking and habitat severance will adversely affect the daily life of animals. The only feasible way
81



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
to overcome the problem is to provide animal paths under the highway. In general, it would take several years
for animals to adapt the new man-made paths. Some available information shows that such paths work well
for small animals but will do little for large-size animals some of which are protective species. According to
the minimum width for animal paths in the U.S.A: 5.0 km (Hopkins, 1982) for America lion, and 2.5 km
(Giffith, Fendly, 1982) for bobcat. Based upon the local conditions, the minimum width for free paths for
neofelis nebulosa is 2 km and 0.5 km respectively, and for survival paths is 0.5 km and 0.1 km respectively. A
pre-condition of these path widths is that there is no human activity near the paths.
According to the preliminary design, the proposed bridge, culvert and tunnel are listed in Table 3-4-1. The
tunnel covered with natural vegetation, and the bridges with length over 100 m and span over 25 m, could all
be used as the paths for large-size animals. Culverts and medium-small size bridges, except for pedestrian
passageway, could be used as paths for frogs, snakes or small mammals. The proposed bridge, culvert and
tunnel that also could serve as pathway for animals are listed in Table 5-2-3-1.

According to the field investigation, the suburban area of Tongling City, outside polder area of Shibasuo
Natural Reserve, the valley plain and hilly area east of Qingyang County and Gantang basin are concentrated
with human activities. No big animals are reported around these areas. There are several paths for small
animals, averaged 2.85/km, 3.73/km and 3.26 /km for these areas respectively. At this density, the paths are
believed to provide sufficient pathways for small animals.
The proposed road at Jiuhuashan valley plain (except K138-K142) and the lakeshore of Taiping Lake is
basically parallel to the existing provincial highway S103, where no big animals are reported. There are
proposed paths for small animals at the two sections, averaged at 3.55 /km and 2.75 /km, respectively. These
sections are at the edge of the activity area of Cervus nippon, and the possibility for them to the other side of
the highway is low. Therefore these paths are considered to be able to meet the occasional requirement of
82



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Cervus nippon.
The vegetation cover outside of Shilishan Natural Reserve (K151 to K160) is in good conditions where is is a
major activity area for wild animals. However, from the distribution map of Cervus nippon and neofelis
nebulosa, this area is not among the most suitable habitats for these animals. The length of bridge is 583.3 m
/km, and there are 5 big bridges between K154 and K157 and a 2350 m tunnel which will provide sufficient
pathway for these large animals. The highway is not expected to increase heterogeneity level.
The outside area of Huangshan scenic site is under a good vegetation cover and it is the normal activity area
of neofelis nebulosa and Cervus nippon. The impact of corridor blocking and habitat severance is more
obvious. There are six tunnels and 15 bridges in this section, averaged 370.1 m of tunnel per km of highway.
In addition, there is on average 1.72 bridge/km for small animals, alleviate the impacts of the severance. In
fact, prior to a film shooting base at K188, S103 goes along the Machuan river. Except one place, distances
between any two villages in this area are less than 500 m. Clearly the existing conditions already pose a
significant severance and the wildlife on both side of S103 have already evolved in heterogeneity. Based on
the field investigation, area between Sankou to Meilan may be the wild animals pathway corridor. In this area,
the TTH will include a 1500 tunnel, three medium to small tunnel and four large bridges. Therefore, the
highway will not affect significantly the animal pathways, nor cause further animal heterogeneity. From
K188 to the end of the TTH, the original design has one 1100 m tunnel and five bridges. The EA team
suggested to add one more tunnels and three more bridges, which have been accepted by the design engineers.
As a result of this addition, the 6.5 km section of highway will have eight pathways for large animals, with
average length of tunnel at 611.5 m per km of highway. This will mitigate the impacts of habitat severance. In
summary, the EA team believes that because of the impacts from both G205 and the TTH, neofelis nebulosa
and black elk population may form heterogeneity. However, due to the fact that ecosystem areas on both sides
of the highway are relatively large, they will be sufficient to support the survival of neofelis nebulosa and
black elk.
5.2.4 Impact on nature reserve and scenic site
Natural reserve
This proposed TTH will not cross any nature reserve and is in fact more than 500 m from any the reserves in
the region. In comparison, the impacted areas from the air emission and noise generated from the TTH are
typically within 500 m from the highway. Therefore such impacts from the TTH will not affect the reserves.
With regard to the Shibali nature reserve, the main protective targets are birds which could fly outside of the
reserve to the TTH area for foods. During the construction and operation of the TTH, the noise and air
emission will affect the birds flying to the highway area, particularly flying over the highway to the other side.
As the highway area is not the main food sources or habitats for the birds however, the TTH area may
become not attractive to birds but will not affect bird population or reproduction.
The TTH is about 500 m to the closest point of the Shilishan reserve and there is a ridge in the middle. The
distance to the core area of the reserve is about 4000 m. As wildlife are mostly active in the core area, the
TTH construction and operation will not directly impact the reserve. In contrast, as the TTH operation will
83



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
attract most of the through traffic from S 103 which is currently going through the reserve, the reduced traffic
in the reserve areas will have positive impact to the reserve ecosystem.
According to Nature Reserve Protection Guides of the P.R. China, tourism sites are not allowed in the core
and buffer areas of nature reserves. The field investigation by the EA team shows that there is no tourist
functions and no plan to build any such functions in Shibasuo and Shilishan reserves. Thus, the TTH
operation will not have induced or indirect impacts to the reserves.
Scenic site
The proposed project will cross the Taiping Lake scenic site and near the Huangshan mountain scenic and
Jiuhuashan mountain scenic sites. The impact on these scenic sits is detailed in Section 5.8 of this chapter.
The TTH area within the Taipiing lake scenic site is not a major habitat for wildlife and thus will not affect
habitat impacts as well as wildlife themselves. The assessment of impacts to vegetation at the shore area of
Taiping lake section of the TTH (K 143 to K151) are included in Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3.
The TTH will not go through Jiuhuashan mountain and Huangshan mountain scenic sites and thus will have
no direct impacts. However, as the transportation conditions to these areas will be greatly improved following
the completion of the TTH, the traveling time from Tongling to Huangshan Mountain will be reduced by
more than one hour. This project will also be a fundamental part of national expressway network, which
could attract more tourists all over China due to significantly reduced traveling time, thus a great increase in
the number tourists to the scenic sites can be expected. The indirect impacts thus induced from the increased
tourist and environmental burden to the scenic sites can be significant. Details are discussed in Section 5.6.1
of this chapter.

It is clear from the above table that, this project will partially change the land use of each county affected,
reducing the area of cultivated land (including reserved farmland) and forestland. However the maximum rate
of reduction is less than 7% and the minimum, less than 1%. In addition, the local farming system and
climate would remain intact, indicating that the agricultural sector will not be significantly affected.
Furthermore, the experience of previous expressway projects from 1980's in China shows that the original
land use and agricultural structure have not changed. However, in Taipinghu Township, Tanjiaqiao Township
and Tangkou township where the cultivated land area is relatively small and the reduction rate is higher (5%),
the project would certainly impact on the agricultural production. The project owner will cooperate with the
local government to carry out the land reallocation and receive compensation in order to minimize the
adverse impact.
5.2.6  Consultation with Bio-diversity Specialists
In view that the project is located in the area with sensitive ecosystems and bio-diversity level is high, an
expert consultation meeting is held on July 20 2002 in Nanjing in order to ensure a n accurate and
comprehensive bio-diversity assessment. Experts invited to the meeting are from the various fields of
bio-diversity such as ecology, zoology, botany, forestry and natural reserve. The topics for consultation are
the ecological status, potential impact on bio-diversity and mitigation measures.
5.2.6.1  Result of expert consultation
Table 5-2-6-1 summarizes the consultation result based on merits system derived from the questionnaires
filed on by the experts. The detailed questionnaire used in the consultation is included in Appendix 6.

5.2.6.2  Analysis of consultation result
It can be seen from Table 5-2-6-1 that there is consensus among the experts on the impact on vegetation and
forest ecosystem and the plants on national protection lists. In general the project will bring minor impact on
the function of forest ecosystem, and with mitigation effort the function would recover to the before project
level. For plants on the national protection lists, some individual plants will be lost to the highway.
Four experts think that part of the ecosystem would be slightly impacted while five experts think large part
will be slightly impacted and small part will be seriously impacted. Two experts express concern of future
population increases and development of tourism projects.
There is slight conflict of opinions about the impact on mammals. All of the experts think the project would
no impact on the giant salamander. Except two experts think the birds would form heterogeneity population,
the reminders think the project would produce slight impact on birds. But several mammals in the national
protecction lists, such as neofelis nebulosa, would become heterogeneity population due to ecosystem
severance. The habitat will be encroached which could reduce the population of mammals and at the same
time some mammals could be injured. In the south mountainous area, the population of neofelis nebulosa is
very small, and the major activity area is to the west of the assessment area, therefore it is recommended that
the impact on neofelis nebulosa needed not be included in the assessment scope.
5.2.7  Conclusionm of impact on ecology
Based upon the above assessment, the following conclusion of the impacts on ecology has been drawn:
O   The natural ecosystem in the south mountainous area has already become fragments due to years of
cultivation, construction and other human activities. There is no natural ecosystem area of more than
1000 km2 in this region and the existing individual natural ecosystems larger than 100 km2 are primarily
located in Huangshan scenic site, Jiulongfeng and Dahongling. Most of the more fragmented ecosystems
are smaller than 100 km2. The proposed TTH will cross several areas with less human activities, such as
Shitai County, Qimen County and the east edge of Huangshan District. In these areas, the TTH will
further fragment the natural ecosystems. But there will be no impact on the core area on the west part,
from Jiulongfeng-Wuxishan-Dahongling-Shitai-Laoshan.
o   This project would not result in extinction of any species. The potential impact on bio-diversity is
limited to contraction of wildlife activity areas for some important mammals or heterogeneity population
88



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
for others.
*   Loss of biomass willl occur due to tree cutting. The overall landscape of forest within the project area
will be changed by construction and operation of the highway, forming forest gaps. A small number of
individual plants under the national protection lists may be damaged or cut. The bare soil created in
construction and operation phase could become the corridor for intrusion of exotic or foreign species.
The pine nematode may potentially be brought into the area along with the transportation of pine timber
products during the construction and operation of the highway.
*   The slag tapping or stockpiling would injure amphibian and reptiles, but the impact will disappear with
the commence of operation; The influx of construction workers will bring with them some rodents
which typically accompany human being. As a result, the quantity of colony of mammals that feed on
rodents will increase in the areas.
*   The corridor blocking effect on the mammals protected at national level are reflected in isolation or
severance by the highway of neofelis nebulosa and black elk population. Although there will be tunnels
and ridges over the major activity area of these animals to serve as their pathways, these mammals
would become heterogeneity population due to ecosystem fragmentation.
* This project will cause virtually no impact on ecology of the "three zones". The resulting influx of
tourists would increase the loads to the scenic sites and forest park, which are the subject of another
section in this chapter.
*   In general, the project will not cause large impact on the agricultural ecology. But the Zhongdun Village
and Shancha Village where the Tanjiaqiao and Shancha interchanges are located will suffer a significant
loss of cultivated land and a high level of impact.
5.2.8 Mitigation Measures
In order to minimize the adverse impacts of the TTH construction and operation, a series of preventive and
mitigation measures are planned and designed. These measures are to be taken during the design,
construction and operation stages, as described as follows.
5.2.8.1 Design stage
The following ecological protection and impacts mitigation measures are to be taken during design stage:
Minimization of land occupation
During the preparation of preliminary design, the planned land occupation will be minimized. The best effort
will be given to the selection of alignment to avoid well cultivated land and valuable or otherwise sensitive
forest. Instead, waste land, shrub, hilly area or dry farmland will be given the first consideration when it
comes to alignment selection and land occupation.
During the preparation of construction drawings, the temporary occupation of land will be largely limited to
road beds. Sensitive forestland, especially the secondary broad-leave forestland will be avoided when
planning temporary occupation of land. (Distribution of secondary forest is shown in Figure4-3-3-1)
89



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
When the proposed highway cross the farmland with high yield, the road bed will be installed with retaining
wall and the excavation width and stockpiling of the spoil will be minimized.
Use of local tree, shrub and grass in greening
The trees, shrub and grass will be planted at the land permanently occupied. In order to prevent the intrusion
of exotic species, all bare soil resulting from various construction activities will be landscaped with local
species of plants. In the flat area where the population settlements are dense, the greening and landscaping
will be created at the two sides of the highway to mitigate the potential impact of the project during operation
phase.
For the road sections which cross forest, the greening plan will be designed against the forest background to
harmonize with the surrounding environment. Alternatively, the forest edge landscape will be restored. For
the road sections to be greened, it is recommended that only the plants from local species will be used.
The structure of greening is based on the mixture of arbor, shrub and grass, the mixture of evergreen tree and
deciduous trees, broad-leave trees and coniferous trees. All of the plants to be used in the road side
landscaping must use indigene species.
Greening buffer areas
The lighting from moving motor vehicles and the road lamp could impact animals active at night. To mitigate
this potential impacts, dense shrubs will be planted at the both sides of K138-K160 and K173+500 sections.
The shrub wall will be 1.5 m -2 m wide in order to prevent the light from penetrating through it and into the
forest. At the ends of tunnels, dense buffer belts also will be developed in order not only to prevent adverse
impact caused by the vehicle lighting and noise to wild animals, but to prevent accidental falls of wild
animals. The safety of vehicle and wild animals can be safeguarded at the same time.
Animal paths
At each road section, there will be bridges, tunnels and/or culverts that could also serve as animal
paths/crossings to the other side of the highway (see details in Table 5-2-3-1). There are 21, 18 and 5 large
paths in the outside area of Huangshan Showplace, Shilishan Nature Reserve and Yangmei Village,
respectively. The EA team recommended the design engineers to re-design a road section between the film
production base (K188) and Shancha village. One tunnel and three large bridges have been added as a result
in the revised design in order to provide sufficient paths for large animals.
As tt may take several years before wild animals can adapt the artificial paths, the natural vegetation covering
the land at the end of tunnel and under bridge will need to be particularly protected during construction phase.
After the construction, the land near paths will be replanted with local arbor and the signs of human activities
will be cleaned up to the highest extent possible.
Camouflage building
90



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
On both sides of the highway especially both ends of the animal paths, spatial greening will be designed to
form a landscape similar to that in the natural background. The piers of elevated viaducts, bridges and
interchanges, spatial greening also will be carried out. At the same time, several support stands, about 20-30
cm long and 5-15 cm wide, will be installed on the pier at various height. These supporting stand would help
to attract birds and help wild animals to adapt the new environment as quickly as possible.
5.2.8.2  Construction phase
Re-landscaping of occupied land
The land temporarily occupied by the project would be re-cultivated immediately after the construction. The
mellow soil layer, about 30-40 cm thick, will be first collected and stored. When the construction activities at
the site terminate, the soil will be returned to cover the temporarily occupied land and then landscaped on
the top. The deep borrow pits that cannot be restored for cultivation for economic reason will be converted
into fish ponds, for landscaping or recreation.
In the hilly area, tall arbor trees will be retained as much as possible in the land temporarily occupied. For
area requiring complete disturbance, the surface layer of soil will first be removed and stored, which will then
be used for restoration, reclamation and landscaping after the construction.
Minimizing impact on wild life
Forestland is the key section for ecological protection. The construction activities will be scientifically
scheduled to minimize the construction period on forestland and the explosion operation also will be
minimized in order to minimizing the disturbance to wild animals in the area.
The contractor will be requested to cooperate with the forest agency to locate construction sites, camps and
temporary access road. The construction camps will not be allowed to build in forestland and the construction
of the camps will be controlled to minimize damage to soil and vegetation.
After determining the exact location of forestland to be occupied by the project, the contractor will be
requested to invite the technical staff of local forestry station to identify and label the plants under the
national protection lists. (see Annex I). The labeled trees will be transplanted to the nursery of Shilishan
Reserve or to a nearby unaffected place.
In order to protect forest ecosystem and reduce the forest edge effects, in the highway sections crossing
forestland (Kl38 to K160, K173+500 to Shancha), a protection line/protection zone will be defined and
drawn jointly by local forestry agency and contractors. At the early stage of construction, guarding wall or
bank may be constructed to prevent vehicle and people from entering tin the protected zones.
The construction activities will be carefully scheduled to avoid the peak time of for wild animals activities.
Explosion operation will be prohibited in the morning, dusk and night since such time frames are the peak
active time for wild animals. From the end of autumn to the next early spring is the reproduction period for
neofelis nebulosa. Explosion operation will not be allowed from November to the next March at the section
91



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
from Shilishan to Shancha.
Borrow pit and disposal site
The borrow pit will be selected at hills, waste land, or bare land. The quality farmland will not be used for
borrow pits. In addition, the soil profile will be surveyed in order to determine the depth of the borrow pit.
The surface clay layer will be retained at the borrow pit for the purposes of prevention of soil degradation and
also for future opportunity of development.
The waste materials will not be allowed to dump in any stream or at the riverside.
The slag stockpile will be selected at the valley plain where soil erosion potential is very low. Retaining dams
will be constructed around such sites.
Screening the exotic timber
According to the Clause 11 of Method for Pine Nematode Management in Anhui Province, host plants of
Pine Nematode are prohibited from entering into the area under stringent prevention and protection against
pine nematode, such as the Huangshan District. In order to prevent pine nematode from entering into this area,
it is recommended that the foreign pine timbers that are prone to pine nematode will be banned for use in the
project. The materials for package will be clearly explained in contractors' bidding documents. Timber
materials either for construction or package in this project will be those from the local market or foreign
timber only after pre-treatment.
Education and training
The public and contractor education bill boards for environmental protection will be erected around the
construction sites before ground breaking. Seminars on environmental protection and bio-diversity will be
provided to contractors. The construction workers will be organized to study relevant ecological protection
regulations, technology, and method for identification and protection of sensitive wildlife.
Incentives will be provided to the workers who are active in environmental protection. At the same time, any
damages to the ecosystems, such as wild animals killing and protective plant species cutting without proper
procedures, will be punished.
Construction supervision
Full-time environmental staff from the construction supervision companies and the project proponent will be
assigned as the ecological supervisors during the construction phase. The local environmental agency and
forestry agency will carry out site inspection regularly, to examine the implementation of ecological
protection measures and quarantine the pine benatode.
5.2.8.3  Operation Phase
92



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
During the operation phase of the TTH, the following mitigation measures will be taken:
*   Erect warning signs about the forest pest and applicable bans to certain materials from entering into the
sensitive area. The signs will be located at the highway entrances and set a forest diseases and insect
pests prevention station along the road before the Huangshan section to prevent pine nematode.
*   Enhancement of environmental management and regulate the construction activities. At the both side of
the road section which cross the animal active area (K138-K142, K151-160, K173+500 to Chancha),
dense tree fencing will be planted. At the both end of the section, a explosion ban sign will be installed.
*   Emergency capacity building for ecosystem safety will be implemented. Cooperation with the Wannan
First-aid Center for Wild Animals is critical to the protection of wild animals on construction site.
5.2.8.4 Other measures
The project area is very rich in bio-diversity. Good ecological protection may not be possible by single
agency or organization, but rather will be based on multi-agency and multi-disciplinary cooperation effort,
such as the follows:
Protection measures for Wannan ecosystem
The protection, compensation and recovery of bio-diversity may also be supported by mitigation measures
taken outside the affected area
From the analysis of ecosystem integrity, the area covering Huangshan Landscape Showplace, Shitai County,
Qimen County and Qian County, particularly Jiulongfeng-Wuxishan-Dahongling-Shitai-Laoshan, is remote
from human active area. The ecosystem intactness in these regions is good. Thus these areas will be the core
of the south mountainous ecosystem where the precious species may take as habitats. This project will
contribute effort to the protection of the reserves in order to provide better opportunity for development and
growth of precious species. These measures are also critical components of the mitigation measures.
Proper planning and comprehensive decision-making process
The planning for various sectors will be based on inter-institutional and multi-discipline cooperation between
forestry, environment, transportation, hydrology and land agencies, in order to avoid conflict between these
planning. Such planning and decision making process will be taken particularly when it comes to activities
which could potentially affect the ecosystem of the region
Wannan Wild Life Foundation
The protection of wild life needs significant funding resources. Currently most of the fund for protection and
preventive programs come from government grants or donation from international organizations. Still, in
many economic disadvantaged regions, wild lives have not been effectively and properly protected due to
short in funding. With the rapid growth of the economy and income among the people of China, personal or
company donation can be expected to increase along with the growing environmental concerns and
awareness among the general public. Government will consider to initiate a Wannan Wild Life Foundation by
93



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
inputting a base fund to stimulate more donation from individuals and companies.
5.3 Noise Impact
5.3.1  Noise Impact during Construction Phase
Various construction equipment will be used for the construction of the TTH which will include highways,
bridges, tunnels, elevated viaduct, fly-overs and supporting and other facilities. In addition, explosion
operation, excavation, and pavement will affect the acoustic environmental quality near the construction sites.
Typically, noise from the construction machinery is high and irregular and impacts noise-sensitive spots along
the TTH alignment including significant scenic sites, schools and residential areas. Furthermore, as the
construction period can be long (2003-2007), the noise impacts will last in that period as well.
The major noise source during the construction phase is construction equipment and the transportation
vehicles. The noise level at different distances from different construction equipment (excavator, bulldozer,
land leveler, mixer, road roller, spreader, etc.) is shown in Table 5-3-1-1.

Note: The noise level at 5 m from the source is measured value.
Besides the above noise machinery, explosion operation will be needed at several mountain sections. The
explosion operation will be carefully scheduled in day time and the local people will be informed with the
schedule in advance. The potential noise impact from this operation to human health and the daily life of the
residents is not expected to be significant, but it will possibly disturb the wild life.
According to the "Noise Limit for the Construction Site Boundary" GB12523-90), the noise limit for day
time is 70-75dB(A) and 55dB (A) at night. Compared with Table 5-3-1-1 it is clear that the noise level at 40
m from the source in day time and about 200 m at night can meet the applicable standards.
There are several houses within 40 m from the proposed TTH alignment and thus the construction sites.
However, the natural barriers, such as rising terrain and trees around some of the houses would significantly
attenuate the noise before it reaches the sensitive receptors. For these villages, noise levels in daytime arising
from equipment operation can basically meet the limit. For other villages where there is no natural barrier,
noise levels are expected to exceed the applicable limit if located less than 40 m from the construction sites.
At night, however, the construction operation would significantly higher than the applicable standards
because the standards are much more stringent and impacted areas are much bigger, disturbing the people
within the assessment area. Therefore specific mitigation measures will be developed for such road sections.
94



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
5.3.2 Traffic Noise during Operation Phase
During the operation phase, the noise will mostly be caused by the traffic flow of motor vehicles on the
highway. The noise impact to all sensitive receptors is forecasted through modeling for the short, medium and
long terms. On this basis, effective mitigation measures could be developed based on the noise forecast which
will also be a basis for future rural development planning.
5.3.2.1 Traffic Flow and Proportion of Vehicle Types
Based on the Feasibility Study Report for Tongling-Tangkou Highway Project, the future traffic flow has
been forecasted and provided in Table 3-7-1 and the proportion of vehicle types and the traffic flow in
day-time and night time period are given in Table 5-3-2-2.

5.3.2.3 Noise Prediction Model
Noise level projection model is a major tool for road planning, building layout on road sides, impact
assessment and development of mitigation measures. Noise level determined by several factors, such as
traffic parameters (traffic flow, vehicle speed and vehicle types), topography of the area where the road is

According to the design documents of this project, the traffic flow will vary in different years, and on some
road sections the difference is very large. The model recommended in the "Specifications for Environment
Assessment for Road Construction Project (interim edition)" will be applied for this project for noise
projection. Based on the previous experience within the country, the recommended model is suitable for noise
projection at high traffic flow condition, such as traffic levels exceeding 20000 pcu/d.

embankment or road ditch, forming an acoustic shadow which will reduces the noise intensity.
5.3.2.4  Projected Noise Levels
Based on the noise projection models and the assumed parameters, noise levels have been projected for the
key years (2008, 2014 and 2022). The scope of the projection is limited to the area 30-200 m from the central
line of the road or the first row of buildings along the highway.
The rolling terrain along the highway makes it difficult to project the noise level. To simplify the process,
noise level is projected on the assumption of flat roadbed for each road sections for the key years of 2008,
2014 and 2022. In the case of detailed projection for each sensitive receptor, the type of roadbed and height
of roadbed will be taken into account separately.
Table 5-3-2-4 shows the projected noise level along the road.
98



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
From Table 5-3-2-4, it can be seen that the projected noise level for key years will vary due to varying traffic
flows on each road section. In general, the projected traffic flow derived from the Feasibility Study Report is
very large. The short-term traffic flow on the highway exceeds 20,000 pcu/d in all sections, particularly that
from Xiaxichong Fly-over to Qingyangdong Fly-over sections where the traffic flow will exceed 31,855
pcu/d. For the long-term, traffic flow will exceed 40,000 pcu/d except the starting section where the traffic
flow is 39,323 pcu/d. Such high traffic will result in high noise levels for short, medium and long terms. The
conservative projection has been undertaken on the assumption of flat roadbed throughout the route. In fact,
the rolling terrain and the vegetation screen will attenuate the noise level somewhere before it reaches the
receptors. Therefore it is thought that the actual noise level will be lower than the projected.

5.3.3 Noise projection and assessment for sensitive receptors
The projected noise level on road sections has been modified to reflect the local acoustic environmental
conditions. The modified noise level has been compounded with the baseline noise level to forecast the
noise level at the receptor. The modification of noise level will take into account of topography and
vegetation cover. Most of the houses nearest to the road are one storie building without windows on the
side walls.
Different assessment criteria will be applied for different receptors. Therefore the receptors have been
classified into three groups, i.e., schools, villages and seniors houses. The No. 46 document issued by
SEPA "Reply to the issues concerning applicable standards for environmental noise assessment for road
construction project" has been applied for assessment of noise level at the villages and schools. The
Class 4 standard of "Environmental Noise Standard for Urban Area" (GB3096-93) has been applied to
the residential area and the buildings nearest to the road. Class I has been selected for the particularly
sensitive receptors such as schools and seniors houses for both day time and night time. Table 5-3-3-1
shows the estimated environmental noise level at sensitive villages, and Table 5-3-3-2 and 5-3-3-3 show
the noise level for school and seniors houses, respectively.
The projected noise level at receptors shows that, the non-compliance of standard is commonly in the
first 50 km of the highway in the north part due to flat terrain. The hilly terrain and the sparse population
in the south part, together with good vegetation cover, help the noise level in compliance with the
standards. The detailed assessment for noise level for short, medium and long terms is as follows:
Day Time
Acoustic environmental assessment for the villages
In year 2008, noise levels in all of the villages will meet the Class I standard (7OdB(A)) according to the
modeling results. In medium term (2014), however, noise at six villages will exceed the standard. These
six receptors are all located near S103 and thus under the combined impact of noise from the proposed
highway and the existing road. The exceedance of standard will be about 0.1 -3.5 dB(A), in most case
within I dB(A).
Over the long term (2022, noise level in 20 villages will exceed the standard due to the increased traffic
and combined impact of noise from the proposed road and S103. The exceedance will be about 0.8-5.9
dB(A).
Schools
Except Fenliu Primary School located in K123+650 and separated from the highway by a small hill, all
other schools will exceed the applicable standard (55 dB(A)) in 2008, 2014 and 2022. The exceedance
will be quite significant (Table 5-3-3-4) affecting classes and other school activities.

Seniors Houses
The senior houses would need a quiet environment for the elderly who can be sensitive and may not be
in good health.. The noise modeling results show that the two senior houses will have high noise levels
significantly exceeding the standard in 2008,2014 and 2022 (Table 5-3-3-5)

Acoustic Environmental l[rmpact Assessment for Night Time
Villages
In year 2008 noise level at 19 villages will be exceed Class 4 standard with the exceedance of 0.3 -4.4
dB(A). The noise level will further increase and by year 2014, 28 villages will not meet Class 4 standard
with the excess values of 0.6-6.9 dB(A). Over the long term, noise level at 41 villages will exceed
Class 4 standard with the excess scope of 1.0-9.2 dB(A).
Schools
The schools along the proposed route are all primary schools without any boarding facilities and there is
no night class in these schools. Therefore it is unnecessary to assess the acoustic environmental impact at
night.
Senior houses
The noise levels at the two senior houses exceed the standard (45 dB) significantly in 2008, 2014 and
2022, as shown in the following table.

The mitigation measures will be designed based on specific conditions of these receptors where the noise
level exceeds the standard. The facilities for environmental protection will be designed according to the
"Design Specifications for Road Environmental Protection" (JTJ/T006-98)

5.3.4  Mitigatiomi Measuire agaiist Noise 1Impact
Mitigation measures in construction phase
The following measures will be taken during construction to mitigate the noise impacts:
o   The low-noise equipment is to be used for construction. The construction equipment will be
first tested for noise compliance before moving to the site. All the equipment that do not meet
the requirement for noise control will not be allowed to be used in this project. The
maintenance will be carried out regularly to ensure constant compliance of the equipment.
o   The noise will cause short-term impact compared with that in the operation phase. However,
the impact of noise will significantly disturb the residents in the night time. Therefore the
noise equipment will be prohibited for operation from 22:00-6:00 each day. The construction
schedule will be carefully developed for the section near the schools in which the
construction activity will be concentrated on the school vacation or after classes to the extent
possible, or temporary facilities to reduce noise, such as wood acoustic insulation barriers,
will be installed.
o   The construction site boundary will be carefully defined according to the "Noise Limit for
Boundary of Construction Site" in order to avoid residential area within the site.
o   The temporary access road will be designed away from villages or schools where possible.
The transportation of construction materials on the existing roads will be carefully scheduled
to avoid any disturbance to the local traffic. At night, construction vehicles will be requested
to operate at low speeds and banned for any homing.
o   The workers on site will be provided with personal protective appliances such as earplug and
helmets.
o   The construction management and supervision will be enforced, particularly for the road
sections near schools, seniors houses and villages, as well as the scenic sites.
Mitigation measures in operation phase
Proper highway maintenance and operation management can be effective in controlling noise
pollution. The motor vehicles in poor condition will be rejected from entering the highway and the
road surface will regularly maintained to keep in good conditions. Signage for speed limit and
control and horn banning will be erected on the road sections near major sensitive receptors
(school, rest home and population settlements).
In order to further mitigate the noise levels at the sensitive receptors to the levels in compliance
with applicable standards, specific measures have been designed and developed for each of the
sensitive receptors. These measures will be taken prior to the time when noise impacts will exceed
the standards according to the modeling. Table 5-3-4-1 presents the mitigation measures at the
sensitive receptors, implementation time and estimated costs.
In future reconstruction of houses, schools and other facilities which may be sensitive to noise, the
local governments will require the locations be sufficiently far from the highway. The projected
108



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
noise level will be considered for new planning of rural development and new settlements in order
to avoid the noise impact. Based on the modeling results, any new noise sensitive houses,
including residential housing, will be located at least 200 m from the central line of the highway,
to prevented such facilities impacted by the highway noise.

5.4 Impact Assessment of Water Environment and Mitigation Measures
5.4.1 Pollution Sources for Surface Waters
Run-off water from road surface
Pollutant concentrations of run-off from road surface are dependant upon various factors, such as
intensity of traffic flow, intensity of rainfall, dust fall and drying period prior to the rain. Therefore
it is difficult to have a general prediction of these concentrations. The average pollutant
concentrations in road run-off based on 120-minute monitoring are shown in Table 5-4-1-1.
Based on the years of climate records, the average annual rainfall in Tongling County, Qingyang
County and Huangshan District is 1385 mm, 1527 mm and 1350 mm respectively. The total area
of road surface is 2.59 km2. Therefore the annual road run-off water is 3.68 x 106m3, The pollutant
loads are shown in Table 5-4-1-1.

Wastewater from service station and parking lots
Domestic wastewater
Table 5-4-1-2 shows wastewater discharged from the supporting facilities. Domestic wastewater is
estimated using the following equation:
Qs=(Kq,V,)/1000
where: Qs-domestic wastewater discharge, t/d;
q, -Daily consumption of water per capita, I OOL/(capita * d);
V1-population in service station, capita;
K-Discharge ratio in service station, 0.9.
The equivalent number of people in the service station is 350, including 40 staff in administration
building, restaurant, shop and hotel; 30 staff in parking lots, maintenance center and gas station;
and 280 transit people. The number of people in the Yangtian parking lot is expected to be 55,
including 40 transit population. The equivalent number of people in Changyuan Parking lot is 45,
including 30 transit population.

5.4.2  Analysis of impact on water environment
The major source for water pollution during the construction phase is the domestic wastewater
from construction camps, and muddy surface runoff water from construction sites. The major
source for water pollution during the operation phase is run-off road surface, and wastewater from
supporting facilities. In addition, traffic accidents at the locations near water bodies involving
hazardous materials, particularly vehicle carrying toxic materials, could be another source
threatening water quality.
5.4.2.1 Construction phase
The impact on water environment in construction phase is from the following aspects:
Construction of bridge
116



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
There will be seven super large bridges, 32 large bridges, nine medium bridges and 30 small
bridges in this project. Shuiqiaohu super large bridge is supported by piers requiring in-water
construction while other bridges will span over the streams without piers and thus no direct
in-water construction.
The impacts on water environment during the construction bridge:
*   Uncontrolled stockpile of oil and chemical materials at the river side would cause pollutants
enter water bodies during raining season.
*   The underwater and in-water operation during the construction of Shuiqiaohu super bridge
would cause re-suspension of sediment and increasing turbidity of water. The in-water
construction activities may also result in construction materials released to the water if not
properly controlled.
*   Oil leakage and spillage from equipment, particularly the spills from the operating boats.
Domestic wastewater and solid waste from construction site and camps
Direct discharge of domestic wastewater from construction site and camps would result in water
pollution. Also uncontrolled dumping of domestic solid waste in or near water bodies can
potentially pollute water as well.
Construction sites near waters
Some sections of the project are to be built near Lingyang River and Machuan River. Construction
solid water, muddy surface runoff, spillage and spoil would cause pollution of river water.
The water intake for the Lingyhang township is located right on the TTH bridge site and the
construction activities at this the site will seriously impact the water quality and suitability of the
this intake as a drinking water source.
As the two other water intakes of water purification plants are located far away from the
construction sites, the construction activities will not impact the water quality in these area and
these intakes will not be affected.
From the above analysis, the major mitigation measures during construction phase is to enhance
construction management and supervision, particularly over the construction of bridge, labor camp
and construction site near waters. Section 5.4.3 of this chapter has discussed the detailed
mitigation measures.
5.4.2.2 Operation phase
Impact on regional hydrology
There is an abundant surface water in terms of rivers, creeks, irrigation channels, lakes, water and
117



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
fish ponds, etc. within the project area. The regional hydrology is characterized by irregular
precipitation from year to year. Within a given year, most precipitation occurs in the summer,
followed by spring and autumn, and the least precipitation is in winter. The flooding season is
from May to August while the dry season is from December to the next February. Dry season is
the best time for highway construction, particularly for bridge. The proposed project will cross
rivers and canals via bridge and culvert, the river system would not alter the discharging channels
in these surface streams and will not reduce their flood discharging capacity.
The Shuiqiao Lake (K80+640, K80+560 super bridge), Qixing River (K91+045, super bridge),
Lingyang River (K130+506, large bridge), Taiping Lake (K144+345, large bridge), Yangxi River
(KI52+030, fly-over crossing), Puxi River (KI59+465, large bridge) and Machuan River
(ZK175+077, ZK175+670, K176+084, K182+039, large bridge) have the function for flood
control and discharge. The requirement for flooding control has been taken into account in the
design, and high standard has been applied for bridge and culvert (300 year flood is considered
for super bridge, 100 year flood is for other bridge and culverts). Thus, the hydrology and flooding
control function of the waters will not be affected.
Wastewater from supporting facilities
The major supporting facilities along the road are Taipinghu Service Station, Yangtian and
Changyuan Parking Yard. Table 5-4-2-1 shows the size of these facilities and wastewater
discharge.

Road surface run-off water
During the operation phase, the pollutants such as SS, CODcr and oil on the road surface may be
washed away and discharged with surface runoff into fish ponds, lakes or streams along the
highway. Such discharge could result in water pollution.
Pollution load of road run-off water
See Section 5.4.1.
Run-off water in the highway catchment
The run-of water flow in the highway catchment is shown in Table 5-4-2-3, which is estimated for
Puxi River and Machuan River.

Impact on stream quality
As there are many uncertain and unpredictable factors which could affect surface runoff and its
impacts to surface water, a simplified approach has been used for impact assessment. It is assumed
that the surface runoff will be completely mixed with the receiving water upon entering into the
water bodies. Under this simplified assumption, the receiving water quality may be estimated by
the following equation:
C= (Q, * C±+Qo * CO) / (Qi+QO)
where:   C-Pollutant concentration of receiving water at the cross section with the highway,
mg/I;
Q, -River flow rate, m 3/s, average flow rate for years;
QO-Road run-off wastewater flow, m3/s;
C,-Baseline concentration in stream, mg/I;
Co-pollutant concentration in road run-off wastewater, mg/l.
The projected impact on stream by road run-off wastewater is shown in Table 5-4-2-4.

*There is no measured data for oil in Puxi River and Machuan River, the baseline concentrations
of oil in these rivers are assumed to be 0.05 mg/I only for comparison purpose.
Clearly, under the simplified assumption, the surface runoff from the highway will contribute very
little to the pollution in the receiving water and virtually have no impact on water quality. This is
because that the receiving water has very high flows and enormous dilution and assimilative
capacities.
Risk analysis for water pollution accidents
Source for water pollution accidents
A number of studies have showed that the major sources contributing to water pollution accidents
by road project consist of:
o   The construction of bridge piers could involve potential accidents in water traffic, resulting in
leakage of toxic materials or oils into the waters during the construction phase;
o   Crash of ships of water traffic with bridge piers during operation, resulting in leakage of
toxic materials or oils into waters;
o   Highway traffic accident on bridges or near water involving vehicles carrying hazardous
materials; such accidents may cause spills of such hazardous materials and/or vehicles falling
the rivers. Either way, the river would be under a major danger for a pollution incident likely
to have serious consequences
As the streams involved in this project are not navigation channels, the major risk of accidents
would come form highway traffic accidents over the bridges.
Probability of accidents
Probability of a serious accidents involving vehicles carrying hazardous materials on the bridges
may be determined using the following equation:
P =QoX QlX Q2X Q3X Q4
P        Probability of pollution risk in important waters;
Qo -Current probability of truck crash in this area, times/million vehicle Xkm;
Q,    -Absolute traffic flow in the projected year, million vehicle/a;
120



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Q2 -The percentage of trucks transporting toxic materials against the total traffic flow (%);
Q3    -Length of important waters, km;
Q4     ratio against normal traffic accidents;
Qo may be determined according to the records of traffic accidents in a similar highway:
Guanshan Expressway (Guanzhou to Huidong) (see Table 5-4-2-5). Accidents in past seven years
on this highway is 950 per year on average. With the total length of this highway at 180 km and
the average traffic flow at 14,500 (converted to passenger car equivalent), the probability of traffic
accident may be calculated to be 0.225/million vehicle/km/per annum.
Table    5-4-2-5  Traffic statistics on Guangshan Expressway in recent years
Year          1985    1986     1987    1988    1989    1990     1991   Average

Therefore, Qo is 0.225times/(million vehicles X km).

Q2 is assumed to be 1.54% based on the proportion of the trucks carrying chemical, pesticide and
oil in the total vehicle fleet.
Q3 is the length of important water within will be directly affected by the TTH. The actual values
of Q3 are shown in Table 5-4-2-7.
Q4 is the ratio of traffic accidents on the highway over normal roads and is assumed to be 0.75.
(3)Projected result
Based on the above equation and assumed parameters, the probably of accidents which would
involve major spills of hazardous materials into the major area receiving waters may be calculated
and the results are presented in Table 5-4-2-7.

The above estimation shows that the probably of a major accidents of motor vehicles carrying
hazardous materials on the bridges is extremely low. However, small probably events do happen.
And once it happens, consequence will be to result in a serious pollution in the receiving water
quality even a fish kill, to affect the receiving water as a scenic site and to risk the health and well
being of residents, farm cattle/domestic animals and wildlife who rely or live on these water
bodies
5.4.3  Mitigation mneasuires
5.4.3.1 Design phase
The following design provisions will be incorporated into the engineering design of the TTH as
mitigation measures for potential water impacts:
o   The side ditches of highway will not directly connect with streams, fish ponds and farmlands
to provide certain holding capacity and allow reaction times;
o   Except the Shuiqiaohu extra large bridge, there will be no requirement for in-water
construction for any other bridges in the TTH;
o   Drainage systems will be designed for Lingyang River Bridge, Taiping Lke Bridge, Yangxi
River Bridge, Puxi River Bridge and Machuan River Bridge, to allow collected road run-off
wastewater to be drained into settling/holding tanks near the bridges first. The settling tanks
also could function as a storage and holding facility in case of accidental spills involving
motor vehicles accidents and hazardous materials. Such facilitiesthere would provide a buffer
time to allow emergency measures.
o   Strong guard rails will be installed on Shuiqiao Lake Bridge and Taiping Lake Bridge to
prevent trucks, especially the trucks transporting toxic materials, from falling into the water
in case of a traffic accident.
O   Wastewater treatment facilities will be provided to the service station, and two parking yards.
Flow diagrams of the treatment processes are shown in figure below. The car-washing
wastewater which contains oil will be treated with an oil separation process before flowing
into tertiary treatment process for in preparation for re-use. Domestic wastewater will be
treated with a biological treatment process and the effluent will meet Class I standards in
the "Integrated Standard for Wastewater Discharge" (GB8978-1996), before discharging
into the environment. The "Quality Standard for Irrigation Water" (GB5084-92) will be
applied for any effluent to be used for irrigation.

5.4.3.2  Construction phase
In order to protect water quality and irrigation facilities in the project area, the following
mitigation measures will be taken during the construction phase:
*   The water intake of Lingyang County Water Purification Plant near Lingyang River Bridge
will be relocated to 500 m upstream of the bridge.
*   The construction materials, such as asphalt, oil and chemicals will not be allowed to stockpile
at the river sides, or near fish pond, lake and water wells. The stockpiles will be covered with
canvas sheet.
*   Side ditch will be constructed prior to road construction, to prevent the muddy water flowing
into streams, canal or farmland.
*   The temporary canals will be provided to replace the existing canals to be temporarily
occupied. Culvert pipe will be laid under the road prior to road bed construction. The
diameter of pipe will be sufficiently large to acccommodate the local conditions and
rquirements for irrigation and/or flood discharge.
*   Retention walls and/or interception ditches will be provided at the river side when
construction is taken near the river.
*   Construction camps will not be located at the Taiping Lake Bridge. The camps for bridge
construction will be located in the villages nearest to the bridge site.
*   The construction period for bridge is long and a lot of workers will be involved in and this
will generate wastewater. In addition, the many of the streams are seasonal with large
variation of water flow in the streams. Bridge construction, particularly those activities which
must be in-water or near water, will be conducted during the dry season when the flows in the
rivers are smallest. In addition, further measures will be taken during bridge construction,
described as follows:
-   Advanced technology will be applied in the construction of Shuiqiao Lake Bridge, such
as cofferdum methods for the construction of piers and others which must go in-water.
-   Septic tanks will be provided for construction camps and construction site. The
wastewater from dinning rooms will be at first treated with oil separation process before
discharge to the septic tank.
-   The domestic and construction solid waste will be separated and collected for reuse as
possible. The remaining will be transported for landfill in timely manner.
-   The spoil will be transported to the designated site by local environment agency for
stockpile.
-   The equipment and operation ship will be examined to ensure free of leakage of oil.
123



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
5.4.3.3  Operation phase
The following measures will be during the operation phase:
o   The effluent from Taiping Lake Service Station will meet Class I standard in the "Integrated
Standard for Wastewater Discharge" (GB8978-1996), before discharging into the receiving
streams. The "Quality Standard for Irrigation Water" (GB5084-92) will be applied for
effluent to be used for irrigation. The effluent from Yangtian Parking Yard could be
discharged after the treatment into the ponds in the Zucun village nearby in which the
effluent will be further treated through natural purification processes. Selected vegetation
will be planted in the bonds such that it can act as an oxidation pond. The treated effluent
from Changyuan Parking Yard will be discharged into Machuan River (the river section at
Changyuan Parking Yard is not used for drinking water sources).
o   Because the TTH will go through many large and small water bodies along its alignment,
some of which are very sensitive, a tight control of motor vehicles using the highway will be
exercised. Visibly leaking and dripping vehicles will not allowed to enter into the highway
and the control may be taken at the poll stations on both ends.
o   An emergency system against major pollution accidents involving toxic materials will be
established. It basically has the following elements
-   Emergency telephone sets will be installed near Shuiqiao Lake Bridge and Taiping Lake
Bridge. The telephone line will connect directly with the monitoring and control center.
-   An emergency team will be established including members from environmental agency,
road management, and monitoring and control center. In case of catastrophic accidents,
the team will control the accident site. At the same time the team will report to senior
governmental departments for proper actions
-   The management system for trucks transporting toxic materials will be based upon the
requirements of driving license, hazardous materials transportation license and
transportation permit. The warning signs will be marked on all such trucks.
5.5   Aiir 1mpact arndl Mitigation Measures
5.5.1  Construction phase
The maj or source for air pollution during construction phase is the construction sites, unpaved
roads, material stockpile sites, and access roads. Air-bome dust from the site, air emissions from
the asphalt mixing and pavement operation, and exhaust gas from the operational equipment will
impact the surrounding environment.
Air-borne dust from roads
Several factors may cause dust on the roads to be air-borne. These factors include traveling speed
of motor vehicles, wind speed, dust fall on road and moisture on road and in the air. In particular
the moving construction vehicles are the most significant source of the air-borne dust and has the
124



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
most serious impacts to the surrounding environment. The traveling distance of air-borne dust is
most dependent of the wind speed. The construction materials transportation in the project will use
mostly S103 which is a paved road. However, from S103 to the construction sites, temporary and
unpaved roads will be used. These dirt roads are the major sources of air-borne dust, particularly
in the dry and windy season when the impacts to the surrounding environment will be most
significant.
According to a study by Highway Research Institute of the MOC, the monitored data on
Jing-Jin-Tang expressway during construction phase, at the 150 m leeward, the TSP is 5.093
mg/m3 , exceeding Class 2 standard of National Environmental Air Quality Standard
(GB3095-1996).The same study also that the air-borne dust can be effectively controlled by water
spraying on the dusting road surface (see Table 5-5-2).

Air-borne dust from stockpile site
The main factors responsible for causing dust air borne at material stockpiles are wind force,
loading and unloading of materials, and moving vehicles from the roads and vehicles leaving the
construction site. The type of materials in storage is also a major factor: low density and small size
materials tend to be more easily air-borne than the heavier and larger ones. Once air-borne, the
dust will pollute the areas surrounding the construction and storage sites. Past experience shows
however, the air-borne dust could be reduced by 70% through regular water spraying.
Material preparation
Materials preparation such as concrete mixing can be a source of dust and chemical emissions
during construction. There are two common mixing methods: in-plant mixing and on-site mixing.
The on-site mixing will take place within the construction site and affects a relatively small area
due to its small scale but it is difficult to exercise emission control. In contrast, in-plant mixing
tends to influence a bigger area because of its larger scale, especially in leeward direction and
when a large amount of materials is to be mixed. In-plant mixing can better be controlled
particularly if in an enclosed space.
According to a dust monitoring program in August 1999 for the Bazhou Mixing Station during
Jing-Jin-Tang Expressway construction in north China, TSP concentrations in different distances
were recorded, as shown in Table 5-5-3.

in upwind direction
The table shows that in the central mixing has much higher TSP concentrations than the road side
mixing, due clearly to the much larger quantity of materials handled at the central mixing at a time.
The road side mixer can meet the Class 1I standard of 0.3 mg/Nm3 at about 150 m in leeward
direction. For central mixing, even 200 m in the upwind direction, the TSP concentration still
exceeds the standard, indicating the facility as a strong source of airborne dust.
Asphalt mixing station
Asphalt will be the primary materials for the highway surface pavement. Studies show that when
over 180∞C during asphalt preparation, a large amount of asphalt spoke will be generated. At 100
m in leeward direction, the ????? concentration, a major contaminant in the asphalt spoke, may
meet the applicable standard. Beyond 100 m, the ???? and hydrocarbon concentrations are all very
low. Therefore, the impacted area will most be within 100 m from the asphalt mixing station.
5.5.2 Operation phase
Exhaust tail gas from vehicles is the major source of air pollution during the operation phase of
the TTH. The volume of the emission is proportionately to traffic volume on the highway. The
emission control facilities in and conditions of motor vehicles are affecting factors.
The traffic volumes and vehicle types are presented in the section for traffic projection.
Pollutant source intensity
The pollution source of exhaust gas on the road can be considered as a linear source, and the
intensity of source Q can be calculated by:
Q    ,      =          A              E               3600

Source intensity of pollutant discharge
Based upon the discharge factors of individual vehicles, the projected traffic volumes (see Table
2-6-1) and types of vehicles in the fleet (see Table 2-6-2), the source intensity of pollutant
discharge of exhaust gas, expressed in mg/m r s have been calculated. The discharge factor of
individual vehicle is derived from the Specifications for EA of Road Project (pilot). The projected
source intensity for the projected traffic flow is presented in Table 5-5-2-1.

Dispersion model
Air emission dispersion in the environment is simulated using CALINE-4 model. CALINE-4 was
first developed by the laboratory of Transportation Department of California of U.S.A. This model
could be applied to the projection for linear source air emissions, both definite or indefinite, and it
also could be applied in the diffusion projection of road network. The model is presented as
follows:
Ci                                exp ( (       ) + exp  (-       )]

where, n is the number of linear sources with equivalent intensity within the road network.
Determination of parameters
Diffusion parameters
The dispersion of exhaust gas is affected by the movement of motor vehicles. The exhaust gas will
diffuse in vertical and horizontal directions immediately after emitted from the end pipe of a
moving vehicle. At this point, effect of atmosphere conditions is limited and dispersion relies
mostly on effects from disturbance from vehicles. But as the emissions drift away from the
highway, the effect from moving vehicles is reduced and effect from atmospheric conditions will
become more significant to the dispersion of the exhaust gas. Therefore the actual vertical and
horizontal diffusion parameters, a , and a Y, will consist of two parts, vehicle disturbance and
environmental disturbance.

In order to accurately determine the initial diffusion, 0 yo and 0 zo has been put into a function

Wind speed will largely affect the diffusion of exhaust gas. The average wind speeds in the
prevailing wind direction for the projected sections are presented in Table 5-2-2-2.

Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Effective height ofpollutant emission source
Effective height of pollutant emission source consists of the height of road and the height of the
source above the road. The height of the highway varies according to the location. The height of
source above the highway is assumed to be 0.5 m.
5.5.2.1  Impact on air quality in operation phase
Conditions for projection
The assumptions and modification of parameters used in the dispersion model have been
discussed above. The air pollutant simulated is NO2 according to the EA TOR. The hourly traffic
volume under the normal conditions is used in the model. For atmosphere stability, stability D is
selected to represent the most common air stability in the region.
Projected result
The average distribution of NO2 has been calculated out on 1 hour basis, using the model
described above. Table 5-5-2-3 shows the projected NO2 within 200 m from the central line of the
proposed TTH and Table 5-5-2-4 shows the projected hourly concentration of NO2 at school and
seniors house during the operation phase.

5.5.2.2  Assessment results
Table 5-5-2-3 indicates that in general the hourly concentrations of NO2 at each section increase
along with the growth of traffic volume. The concentrations differ in different sections as
discussed below
Road section at scenic sites
The projected hourly concentrations of NO2 within 200 m from the central line of the proposed
road is below the Class I standard of Environment Air Quality Standard (GB3095-1996)
throughout the key projection years. Therefore it is clear that the project will not have significant
impact on air quality within Taiping Lake area.
Other road sections
The projected concentrations are all within the Class 2 standard, indicating the impact of the TTH
on surrounding area air quality will not be significant. From Table 5-5-2-4, it can be seen that the
projected hourly concentrations of NO2 at schools and rest homes will comply with the applicable
standards.
The above modeling is based on the most conservative atmospheric conditions and for the
mountainous region where air dispersion is slowest because of the terrain. Even under such
conditions, NO2 concentrations are not expected to exceed the standards. Therefore, the TTH is
expected not to have significant impact to air quality even under other conditions and in other
sections.
5.5.2.3  Impact to Air Quality at Service Areas
The detailed design for the supporting facilities, such as service station and parking zone, have not
been completed at this stage. However, recommendations have been put forward to the design
130



Tonghng-Tangkou Highway EIA
engineers that Paiping Lake service station not have coal fired boilers. Any such need will be met
with electricity base facilities. In other places, electrical boilers also be recommended to the
designers, in order to eradicate the boiler waste gas pollution.
All service areas and parking zones will have wastewater treatment and garbage collection and
storage areas. Wastewater treatment will produce odor so will the garbage collection and storage
areas. These facilities will be well designed to minimize odor emissions and be located away from
dining and other public areas of the service stations.
5.5.3 Global Climate Issues
Compared to the previous centuries, the last 100 years have seen rapid global warming. The trend
will unlikely to reverse in the 21st century with the enormous consumption of fossil fuels, such as
coal, petroleum and natural gas. Combustion of these fuels generate greenhouse gases, such as
CH4, NOx and predominantly CO2 which all contribute to global warming.
The motor vehicle exhaust includes HC and CO from incomplete combustion, smog dust and NOx.
Among these, methane and NOx are greenhouse gases and CO, when converted to CO2 upon
oxidation, is also a greenhouse gas.
In the project area, the major existing road is S103 which extends from Tongling to Huangshan
District. As the current road condition is poor, there is frequent idling, acceleration and
deceleration of motor vehicles using the roads. Motor vehicles emissions including all these
greenhouse gases, will be higher to much higher while idling, acceleration and deceleration than
while running on constant speed. The situation of S103 is presented in Table 5-5-3-1.
Table 5-5-3-1 Basic Conditions of S103

Grade 3 and 4: 97 km    2
After the project, the pollutant discharge would be reduced, since the project is designed to
provide better transportation conditions allowing shorter traveling distance between the same
destinations, higher speeds and most smooth driving.
The pollutant discharges for the S103 and the proposed TTH are estimated for the long term,
based on the milestones, running speed of vehicle and rate of vehicle type (big to medium to small
vehicles=6.79: 17.06: 76.15). Table 5-5-3-2 presents the comparison of pollutant discharge sof
the two roads.

From the above table it can be seen that although NOx is increased by 67%, CO and THC are
reduced by 41% and 36% respectively, by the project. The total CO generation around the world is
371x106 tons and total THC, 1684x106 tons (from Introduction of Environmental Protection of
Communications, May 2000). The emission reduction from this project will account for a very
tiny percentage of the global total. Nevertheless, the decreased emission, compared with no
project scenario, will still be contributing to slowing down the global warming process.
5.5.4  Mitigation Measures
Air impact of a highway is primarily in the construction phase and the following mitigation
measures have been developed in the TTH construction.
Design Stage
ï   During the design stage, the locations for borrow pits, disposal sites, asphalt and concrete
mixing and preparation stations will be carefully sited to avoid sensitive receptors such as
residential areas, schools and seniors houses. Both asphalt and concrete stations will be
located at least 300 m in leeward direction.
o   The construction materials transportation will use as much existing roads as possible to avoid
creating dirt, temporary roads.
o   Asphalt and concrete mixing station will not be allowed to be located within Taiping Lake or
Huangshan mountain scenic sites.
o   The wastewater treatment facilities and solid waste collection station will be located far from
the rest area and hotel. The wastewater treatment facilities will be tightly covered to prevent
the odor from releasing to the air. High trees will be planted around the facilities. The solid
waste collection station will be tightly enclosed, and the solid waste will be transported out in
timely manner.
Construction stage
o   Water spray vehicles will be provided by contractors to unpaved road and other disturbed soil.
The water spray operation will be carried out in the dry or windy day, at least twice per day
(moming and afternoon). The frequency of water spray at sensitive receptors, such as village,
school and seniors houses, will be increased.
o   The materials storage sites will be selected in leeward direction from sensitive receptors.
Where necessary, such storage piles will be covered to prevent the powdering and dry
materials air-bome.
o   Trucks carrying powder materials, such as cement, sand and lime, will fully be covered.
132



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
*   The temporary roads, if not hardened will be paved with gravel and crashing stones to reduce
the dust air borne potential.
*   The entrance of construction sites and construction vehicle parking sites will be wetted all the
time and if necessary covered with bamboo sheet or straw sheet to prevent dust from air
borne.
*   The asphalt mixing will be installed in enclosed spaces and spoke from asphalt mixing will
be treated before released to the ambient air.
5.6 Socio-economic Impacts and Mitigation
5.6.1 Impacts to Scenic Sites
Among the "Three Zones" in the TTH project region, three are national and provincial level scenic
sites. They are Huangshang Mountain scenic site, Jiuhuanshan Mountain scenic site and Taiping
lake scenic sites, also known as "two mountains and one lake" sites. This section analyzes the
potential impacts of the TTH to these scenic sites.
5.6.1.1 Impacts to Huangshan Mountain
Existing Conditions
Huangshan Mountain scenic site is divided into six scenic zones: Wenquan (hot spring) scenic
zone, Yuangu (cloud valley) scenic zone, Songgu (Pine valley) scenic zone, Diaoqiao (Suspension
bridge) scenic zone, Beihai scenic zone and Yuping scenic zone. About 80% of the tourists enter
the Huangshan Mounntain scenic site through its south gate.
The management organization for and relevant regulations on Huangshan Mountain can be briefly
summarized as follows:
There is a dedicated management organization for the management of the scenic site, which
is Huangshan Mountain Scenic Management Committee, under the jurisdiction of Huangshan
City Government.
*   The development and administration of the scenic site are based on the Huangshan Mountain
Master Plan which has been approved by the State Council and Huangshan Mountain Scenic
Site Management Regulations, enacted by Anhui provincial People's Congress.
*   All development and construction projects within the scenic site must be approved by the
Ministry of Construction of the central government, as well as the approval of their
environmental impact assessment by the State Environmental Protection Administration
(SEPA) at the same time.
*   An environmental protection office has been set up in the scenic site, including in the office
an environmental supervision station and environmental monitoring station.
*   There is a well developed regulatory and policy framework for the management the
Huangshan Mountain scenic site. The framework includes Interim Methods for Huangshan
133



Tonghing-Tangkou Highway EIA
Mountain Scenic Site Sanitation Management, Interim Methods for Huangshan Mountain
Scenic Site Environmental Management, Management Methods for Huangshan Mountain
Scenic Site Wastewater Treatment Facilities Operation, etc.
As a major tourists site, Huangshan Mountain scenic site has a certain amount of service facilities,
including 3696 hotel beds. Three overhead passenger cable cars lifting tourists to the top of the
mountains with a total capacity of 15,000 person-times/day. Water supply of the scenic site is
provided from local reservoirs which have a total capacity of 4 10,000 m3.
The management authority has taken several environmental protection and other management
measures at the scenic site, including:
o   For the total of 600,000 t/y of domestic wastewater generated within the scenic site, the
management authority has invested RMB13 million since 1989 in 15 treatment facilities. As
a result, about 90% of the wastewater is treated and discharged within the applicable
standards;
o   The management authority has invested a total of RMB6 million since 1991 to renovate 22
public toilets within the tourist areas of the scenic site. The current facilities are adequate for
the demands of 20,000 tourists per day.
o   The management authority has invested a total of RMB8 million since 1985 to set up five
municipal solid waste disposal facilities and over 600 garbage collection bins along tourist
routes within the scenic site. The scenic site now has 154 environmental sanitary workers
responsible for garbage collection, transportation and disposal at site. The municipal solid
waste generated within the site is first separated and the non-recyclable portion of the waste
(mostly organic waste) is disposed of through incineration, composting and sanitary landfill.
The recyclable and non-disposable waste is manually transported down the mountain daily.
o   A laundry center is set up outside the scenic site, which is responsible for bed sheet, table
cloths laundry from the hotels and restaurants from the mountain. Such a setup reduces the
water demands as well as wastewater generation with the scenic site.
o   There is a vegetable processing center outside the scenic site which provides the service to
the site itself. The center reduces the waste generation from raw vegetable preparation.
o   At the Yupinglu wastewater treatment facility within the scenic site, an effluent tertiary
treatment and recycling facility is added to reduce the demands and conserve the water
resources on the mountain.
o   Within the scenic site, coal and firewood burning is banned. The major fuel and power
sources are liquified petroleum and electricity. The ban helps control air pollution within the
scenic site area.
o   There are six transportation brigades within the scenic site, responsible for transportation of
goods in and out of the mountain.
o   The key scenic zones are in rotary moratorium to provide time and opportunity for the
ecosystem in these zones to take a break and rest from tourist pressure.
Because of the outstanding management of this major scenic site, including the measures
described above, the Huangshan Mountain Scenic site has received many awards over the years.
134



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
In particular, the site received Outstanding Management Authority for World Heritage Site in 1998,
and International Cultural Scenery Protection and Management Award in 1999. There have been
only three awards for the later in the world so far and only one in Asia, to Huangshan Mountain.
Impact Assessment
The proposed TTH will not go through the Huangshan Mountain scenic site directly and as such
will not impact the site directly. However, due ot the improvement in the transportation conditions
to the scenic site, there will be increase tourist volume, which will bring potential adverse impacts
to Huangshan Mountain and the scenic site. In addition, the highway construction would also
cause adverse visual impacts in the scenic area as well as adverse impacts to the transportation.
The visual impacts of the highway construction activities to Huangsha Mountain is discussed in
Section 5.8.2 and the following discussion focuses mainly on the potential impacts to
transportation to Huangshan Mountain. As described before, S103 is the sole transportion route
from Hefei, through Tongling to Huangshan and the sole transportation for the tourists from the
Hefei direction (which is a major tourist source). The proposed TTH will cross S103 several times
requiring grade separate pass construction over S103 and demanding temporary detour of S 103.
Furthermore, construction vehicles will use S103 heavily during construction. These activities will
reduce the road capacity at S103 and increase the travel time for tourists.
During the operation phase, TTH will greatly improve the transportation conditions, reduce
traveling time, and increase the comfort level of road transportation, attracting more tourists to
Huangshan Mountain. A major potential impact from such increase will be the increased burden to
the environmental capacity and tourists service capacity at Huangshan Mountain. Many factors
could affect environmental and tourist service capacity of a mountain based scenic site, including
scenic area, tourist route length, accommodation, cable car lifting capacity, water supply, waste
disposal, etc.
Tourist capacity
Many factors affecting tourist service capacity in a scenic site. These include scenic site area,
tourist route length, accommodation capacity, cable car capacity, water supply, etc. The TTH
completion and operation will greatly improve the transportation to Huangshan Mountain
inducing increase in the number of tourists to the site and adding the burdens to the existing tourist
capacity. The following section uses cable car capacity and tourist route to represent the tourist
capacity at the Huangshan Mountain scenic site, which will, in turn, serve as the basis to analyze
the impacts of induced increase in tourists to the site.
Based on the design capacity of the cable cars at Huangshan Mountain, the scenic site can receive
a maximum of 15,000 per day or 5.48 million per year. At the present, the daily tourists using the
cable cars to the mountain is merely 2600 or 950,000 per year and there are only 12 days in a year
when the cable cars reach its design capacity. Therefore the increased burden to tourist service
capacity is limited as there is still a large room to accept additional tourists.
135



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
The tourist route capacity may be calculated by:
Q =L/Q
Where, Q is tourist route capacity
L is the length of the tourist route within the scenic site and
M is the average length occupied by a tourist, assumed to be 3 m/person
Based on the actual site information and the above equation, the tourist route capacity may be
calculated as follows:
Wenquan and YunGu scenic zones:   3200/3 = 1067 person-times/day
Yuping scenic zone                7374/3 = 2458 person-times/day
Beihai scenic zone                10189/3 = 3397 person-times/day
Songgu scenic zone                17078/3 = 5693 person-times/day
Diaoqiao scenic zone              14125/3 = 4708 person-times/day
Total                                      17323 person-times/day
On the annual basis, the maximum existing tourist route capacity is 6.32 million
person-times/year.
With regard to the tourist volume, the tourist statistics of the past 10 "golden weeks" (i.e., the first
week of May, October and Chinese New Year when the whole country have one week holidays)
shows that Huangshan daily maximum tourists is 30,176 person-times. This peak occurred in
October 1999, the first ever golden week in the country, when the site was highly crowed and
there was a lot of tourist complaints. The following golden week, tourist volumes to Huangshan
Mountain have been around 20,000 person-times per day, still significantly larger than the normal
volume which peaked at 10,837 person-times per day. Due to enhanced management and well
preparation, such volumes seem to be acceptable to the tourists. Therefore, the tourist capacity, if
using 20,000 person-times as a basis, would be 7.3 million person-times per year.
Ilnduced Tourist Increase
Tourist volume to a scenic site depends on transportation, travel time, holiday schedules,
economic development, attraction of the site itself, etc. Clearly, transportation improvement will
induce increases in tourist volume, transportation condition is not the only affecting factor. Over
the last 10 years, tourist volumes to Huangshan Mountain has been generally increasing as shown
below:

tourist volume of Huangshan Mountain
According to Huangshan City Tourist Economy Development Plan (2001-2010), the future tourist
volume will increase at the rate of 15% per year. The OD survey and traffic forecast in the project
feasibility study report also predicts a 15% annual increase for the period of 2000 to 2008 but will
slow down afterward to 12% from 2009-2015 and to 8% from 2016 to 2025. Using these growth
rates, the tourist volumes to Huangshan Mountain over the 25 years period to 2025 will be:

Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
even with the induced tourist increase. With the economic development, Huangshan Mountain will
be further explored and developed and tourist service capacity will also be increased in the future.
Therefore, the TTH is expected to have significant adverse impacts to tourist capacity at
Huangshan Mountain scenic site.
However, the other service, especially environmental protection facilities will face increased
burdens from the increased tourists, inducing potentially adverse impacts to the environment at
Huangshan Mountain scenic site unless effective mitigation measures are taken. For example, the
existing wastewater treatment capacity is not sufficient enough to treat all existing wastewater
generated (90%). With the rapid increase in tourist volume at 15% per year for the next six years,
wastewater generation will increase at a similar rate. More raw wastewater would be discharged to
the delicate environment in the Huangshan Mountain area unless additional wastewater treatment
facilities are added to the site or existing facilities are expanded to accommodate the increased
volume of wastewater.
Similarly, more solid waste will be generated, demanding more solid waste collection, storage,
transport, and disposal facilities or environmental pollution will result. Other facilities, such as
toilets, laundry, etc. will also have to be expanded at a similar rate as the tourist volume in order to
prevent any potential impact to the environment quality. However, increased service facilities,
such as toilets, garbage bins, disposal/treatment facilities, restaurants, and hotels will occupy more
land within the scenic site and could potentially cause visual impacts if not designed and
harmonized with the surrounding area properly.
An environmental upgrading program funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the "Two
Mountains and One Lake" scenic sites, including Huangshan Mountain, is soon to be implemented.
The program takes into consideration of the growth in tourists to these scenic sites and increased
burden to the environment and supports capital projects to build new or expands existing waste
collection and treatment facilities (eight wastewater treatment stations, 15 km sewer network,
solid landfill and incinerator, 11 public toilets, etc.). This, together with other pollution control
programs from local funding sources, will help ensure that the waste management capacity at
Huangshan Mountain will expand and upgrade in a timely manner to accommodate the anticipated
increase in the tourist volumes.
Impacts to areas outside Huangshan Mountain scenic site
Besides the Huangshan mountain scenic site itself, the proposed TTH will also affect the
surrounding area, primarily from the following two aspects:
o   Following the operation of the TTH, there will be a great increase in flow of people to
Shancha village at the foot of the Huangshan mountain, resulting in local economic
development and urbanization. If not properly planned and controlled, disorderly
development may occur including disorderly development of the tourism zones which are not
easily accessible without the TTH, seriously impacting environmental and tourism resources
quality in the area.
138



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
The relatively massive construction of the TTH ending point at now quiet and undisturbed
Shacha village, including interchange, toll station and management center, will damage the
natural setting and the environment at this village. These facilities will also be visible from
one of the major tourist zones on the Huangshan mountain causing visual impacts to the
tourists, although about half of the tourists hold positive view of the facilities in terms of their
visual impacts, according to the EA team's survey at the site.
5.6.1.2 Impact to Jiuhuashan Mountain scenic site
As one of the four major Buddhist mountains in China, Jiuhuashan Mountain attracts many
believers among the tourists visiting the mountain, about 60% of the total visitors. Compared with
other major Buddhist mountains, Jiuhuashan receives relatively less tourists, about 500,000 person
times per year, seemingly far too few compared with its major Buddhist status. The main reason
for the relatively small number of visitors is the poor transportation conditions. Jiuhuashan
Mountain is about 3 hours or more from nearest airport and has no highway connecting with the
outside.
Jiuhuashan Mountain scenic site currently generates a total of 400,000 t/y of domestic wastewater,
treated through four septic tanks. The total solid waste generation is 5357 tly. The two existing
solid waste disposal plants in the site have a total capacity of 3571 t/y, with the reminders
randomly dumped. Solid waste generated within the site is handled by 72 environmental sanitary
workers
Jiuhuashan has three cable cars lifting to the mountain top, with the maximum capacity of 13,200
person times per day. The current actual usage is about 2466 person-times/day with 40% of the
visitors choose not to use the cable car but to climb up to the top. Within the site, there are
currently 5200 hotel beds, with additional 800 to be added by 2005.
The closest point between the proposed TTH to Jiuhuashan Mountain scenic site perimeter will be
5 km and thus the highway will not impact the scenic site directly. However, the TTH construction
will greatly reduce the travel time from Hefei as well as from nearby Hefei and Huangshan
airports, tourist volume is expected to increase. Once the visitors exceed a certain volume, they
will bring adverse impacts to the Jiuhuashan Mountain environment.
According to the current service capacity, Jiuhuashan Mountain scenic site can receive 5.82
million visitors each year. The past six year tourist volume has been, however, far below this
service capacity, as shown below:

forecast of tourist volumes of Jiuhua Mountain
From the above projected tourist volume, before 2024 Jiuhuashan Mountain scenic site will have
sufficient service capacity and not to generate adverse impacts to the scenic site environment. The
above estimae shows that the tourists are forecast to increase to 5.92 million by 2024, roughly the
capacity today. Therefore, the TTH development is not expected to have adverse induced impacts
to Jiuhuashan Mountain. In fact, because of the increased tourist volume to Jiuhuashan Mountain,
its service capacity can be better utilized, helping promote local economic development.
Jiuhuashan Mountain Scenic Site management authority is currently implementing following site
management and environmental protection projects:
1 An






Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
*   Move the management organization off the mountain and leave more scenic sites to tourists.
It is planned that by 2005, all management organizations will move out and by 2010, all
residents wthin the core area will be moved out.
*   Revise the 1988 Jiuhuashan Master Plan, expected to complete in 2002. The Plan will take an
integrated approach towards development and environmental protection
*   Anhui province is currently implementing an ADB funded "Acid rain control and
environment improvement" project which includes nearly US$10 million plus matching fund
from local government of RMB160 million for Jiuhuashan Mountain environmental
improvement. The funding will be used primarily to expand water supply capacity within the
scenic site from the current 3000 t/day to 20,000 t/day, one wastewater treatment plant with a
capacity of 15,000 t/day and construct a new solid waste disposal site. These pollution
control facilities have given adequate considerations to the increase in tourist volume in the
future.
5.6.1.3  Impacts to Taiping Lake scenic site
Taiping Lake scenic site is centered on Taiping Lake and surrounded by the mountains with a very
beautiful natural environment. Due to the limited investment, scenic spots development and
market promotion, Taiping Lake scenic site is rarely known in the general public and has not
become a hot tourist attraction. There were only 64,000 visitors in 1998, 80,000 in 1999, 121,000
in 2000, and 146,000 in 2001. The growth rate is however, quite significant and the tourist volume
doubled in the last four years.
The main tourist attraction spots of Taiping Lake scenic site are the small islands in the middle of
the lake and the tours of the site are highly dependent on boats. The current pleasure boat
maximum capacity is 600 per day or 219,000 per year.
The TTH will go through Taiping Lake scenic site and construction of the TTH could cause soil
erosion, and disposal of construction waste, wastewater and solid waste generated by construction
workers could also impose adverse impacts to the scenic site Furthermore, the earth work and
change in terrain due to construction activities would have visual impacts to the scenic site.
Further assessment of visual impacts of waste disposal is included in Section 5.8.
Taiping Lake has wide water surface and many islands. If sufficiently funded (e.g., on pleasure
boats, tourists attraction development, etc.), the tourist capacity in Taiping Lake scenic site can be
much larger than a mountain based scenic site as the scenic site development is relatively less
constrained by the surrounding environment. The current main constraints are however
transportation and development funding.
The completion of the TTH will greatly improve transportation conditions toward Taiping Lake
scenic site and promote the tourist industry. Because of the TTH, Anhui province has already
planned Taiping Lake as a state level tourist site. According to Anhui Province Tourist Master Plan
and the Two Mountains and One Lake Scenic Site Tourist Master Plan, the development of
141



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Taiping Lake scenic site will place the same weight on development and protection.
Environmental protection and pollution measures will be developed at the same time, with the
same capacity as the increase in tourist capacity. Any development programs at the scenic site will
be subject to vigorous environmental impact assessment before they can be approved in
accordance with the state and local laws.
5.6.2  Land occupation
Cultivated land, garden and forestland
The total area of land to be pernanently occupied by this project is 9365.56 mu, equivalent to 624
ha, including 8569.25 mu of cultivated land, tea garden and forestland, about 91.5% of total. The
details of land occupation are presented in Table 5-6-1-1.

According to the above table and also cross-referring Table 4-3-5-1 and Table 4-3-5-2, the
percentages of loss of cultivated land, garden and forestland, which shows the impacts of the loss,
may be estimated and the results are presented in Table 5-6-1-2.

It is clear that although the cultivated land, garden and forestland will suffer a loss of area, the
current land use would not be changed since the rate of loss id very small.
Economic loss of agriculture and forestry
After the site survey, the average yield of major agricultural crops is presented in Table 5-6-1-3,
which is based on a random sampling local farm households.

Note: The loss of forest output value is estimated on ration of equality, gross output/total forest area=lpss of
output/ occupied area
It is shown that, although the direct loss of economy in Qingyang County and Huangshan District
is relativey high, the loss only accounts for 0.43% and 0.31% of GNP of the two counties
respectively. The impact on local economy as a whole is not significant.
5.6.3 Induced Impacts
5.6.3.1  Impacts to local economy and tourist industry
The completion and operation of the TTH are expected to have the following induced impacts to
the economy and tourist industry in the project area:
*   The highway will provide convenient and efficient transportation to the project area,
enhancing the movement of people, goods and information, particularly the agricultural
produces towards outside markets, increasing the income of local farmers;
*   The highway will connect the abundant tourist resources in the project area, benefiting
further development of the tourist industry and tourist economy;
*   The project area has a beautiful environment and many scenic sites but the over-development,
or improperly planned development of tourist spots induced by the TTH would damage the
natural environment and cause adverse environmental impacts;
*   The increased tourist volume to the region, while bringing consumption and other tourist
143



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
money, will increase the environmental burdens to the area particularly the sensitive scenic
sites. Unless effective and sufficient control and mitigation measures and facilities are
developed at the same time, the increased burdens will bring damaging impacts to the
environment including the tourist resources.
o   The construction and operation of the TTH, including road maintenance and service areas
during operation will bring employment opportunities to the local area;
o   With the increased movement of people particularly visitors to the area, service industry such
as food, accommodation, etc. will be developed. Also there will be demands for souvenirs
and other hand made goods by the visitors, creating income opportunities to the farmers
along the highway;
o   The development of tourist industry and increased visitors to the currently rather isolated area
will bring in new ideas, values and way of living. This could change people's attitude and
correct some of the old, bad habits such as random dumping of solid waste, and thus improve
the environment, as well as the life style at the same time.
5.6.3.2 lImpact of interchanges and connection roads
The proposed TTH will have five interchanges with design provisions for one more, to be
constructed later. The siting of these interchanges have been carefully selected to minimize the
impacts to the socio-economic and natural environments. The present design locations for
Lingyang, Gantangchengbei and Tanjiaqiao interchanges need no resettlement. The limited
resettlement in other interchanges have been well considered in the Resettlement Action Plan
(RAP) of the project.
The interchanges in the TTH are the main connection modes with other roads and urban centers in
the project area. The locations of the interchanges connect all major transportation roads (G318,
S103, S325 and G205), major urban centers and townships and major scenic sites along the
highway. Therefore, the proposed TTH is expected to greatly promote the local economy, improve
the investment environment, and provide convenience to the people in the area.
However, while the interchanges and connection roads bring transportation convenience, they also
bring potential impacts at the same time. When the highway and the connection roads are
completed, there will be increased movement of people in the interchange and connection roads
areas, resulting in the following impacts:
o   Increased motor vehicles emissions and noise at these areas
o   Increased municipal solid waste, resulting in higher burdens to the local environmental
sanitary staff and handling/disposal facilities;
o   Spread of epidemic diseases and increased difficulties to control them; and
o   Increased traffic accidents.
These adverse impacts are difficult to avoid. They will be however mitigated through
environmental management plans and measures. In June 2002, the EA team has consulted with the
local governments in the interchange and connection road areas with the participation of local
144



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
environmental protection, transportation, and public health authorities. These government officials
were briefed of the above potential adverse impacts induced by the construction of the highway
and connections roads and were asked for their opinions for their concerns and mitigation
measures. The results of this consultation process are included in the Appendix.
5.6.4 Community severance
The fully fenced road will separate the villages (15 counties and 48 villages) along the route,
resulting in inconvenience to outings, access to the farmland and services, etc. However the
adverse impact has been carefully considered during the design phase. Following several public
consultations, the design team has included 16 grade separate, 139 pedestrian/agricultural
underpasses, 39 paths, and 11 overpasses along the route, total 200 highway crosses. There will be
one pathway in every 580 m of the TTH on average. And each village will have 4.1 pathways. The
daily life of the villagers would not be significantly affected by the project. However, some
villagers will still be separated by the highway. The following figures illustrate such impacts in
selected villages with typical situation:
Situation 1: the proposed TTH will go through a village in the middle and cut the village in half,
as shown in the figure below
This village will be divided into two parts.
Before the project, there is 3 roads. One of
them will be closed due to the project(the black
,_  ' ,  'circle). As a result, some villagers have to walk
up to extra 100 m, this is not overly serious.

Situation 2: the rural residence is separated from the farm field, affecting the production activity,
as shown in figure below.
This village will be separated from  its
"' -Q~  -     ..... farmland. During the design phase, the
v   pathways for vehicle and people (black

In addition, irrigation facilities have been taken care of in design. There will be 99 bridges and
304 culverts so that the demand for irrigation water and drainage would be met.
5.6.5  Impact of Construction
The major impacts of the construction activities on the residents nearby include:
o   The need for temporary access roads will occupy land including cultivated land. As a result,
the farners are to lose several seasons of crops and harvest. The access roads will also
general other potential impacts such as soil erosion particularly the access roads are usually
unpaved, traffic noise, air emission form vehicles, dust, traffic safety, water impacts if located
by water bodies, etc.
o   The construction vehicles will increase the traffic volume on the existing roads such as S103,
which will affect traffic flow particularly the construction vehicles a large and may make
road side stops for loading and unloading. The air-borne dust and noise on the existing roads
will also increase affecting the living environment of residents nearby.
o   The explosion operation could treat the safety of villagers and damage the properties if not
handled properly
o   The domestic wastewater and solid waste generated from construction camps could affect the
daily life of villagers and contaminate the environment. The contractors will be requested to
take measures against the problems. Details are discussed in Section 5.6.8.
5.6.6  Impact on the Planning of "Two Mountains and One Lake"
The objective of the "two mountains and one lake" master plan is to promote the tourism in the
"two mountains and one lake" sites, while at the same time protect the natural resource and
environment. Development of tourism would depend on transportation conditions. This proposed
146



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
TTH will improve the transportation conditions within the "two mountains and one lake" area,
helping promote the tourism and achieve the plan.
This project will cross part of the "two mountains and one lake" land, causing adverse impact on
the natural resources. Influx of vehicles will bring noise and air pollution problems. The impact
analysis and mitigation measures have been discussed in the Sections of 5.2, 5.3, 5.5, 5.7 and 5.8.
But these adverse impacts could be largely mitigated. In general, the ecosystems in the region
would not be significantly changed and the natural environment, degraded.
The actions and measures included in the master plan for environmental and natural resources
protection, have all been incorporated into this report, as well as in the EMP for this project.
5.6.7 Impact on Human Health
The project affected area is not in any epidemic disease alert region. In order to prevent the
construction workers from local diseases and protect local residents from diseases which could
brought in to the region by the mobile construction workers, preventive measure and procedures
must be taken.
Before the Project construction starts, the local health centers will be consulted for information on
local diseases and suggestions on preventive measures. In the iodine-deficient areas, iodine-salt
will be provided and iodo-potassium pills may also perscribed as supplements.
The major measures for the prevention of infectious diseases and snail fever are education, and a
good practice of personal hygiene while drinking and eating.
The main measure against AIDS are through public awareness and education of construction
workers in the construction camps through public bulletin boards and providing entertainment in
their spare time. Blood inspection will be compulsory prior to employment at the construction
sites, to monitor the employee's health status. At the same time, a ban on taking drugs and
prostitution must be strictly implemented and "safe sex" will be encouraged and practiced. After
the expressway opens to traffic, the movement of people to and through the now rather isolated
Project region will be increased, with increased number of hotels, restaurants and other
entertainment services expected. Certain negative impacts from such movement will appear, such
as the spread of diseases including AIDS. Once the expressway is in operation, local governments
along the road will put this issue on their agenda by making regular public education on AIDS
prevention via radio, newspapers and other public media. Heath and epidemic prevention stations
and hospitals shall inspect for AIDS rigorously. Public securities shall strengthen the registration
management system for migrant people and reinforce regular legal controls on night clubs, hotels,
beauty parlors and other entertainment places where AIDS exposure can be a high risk.
With regard to construction safety, explosion for stone and earth removal will produce serious
safety, as well as environmental, concerns. This will involve both the management, storage,
transportation and handling of explosives and the explosion operations themselves.
147



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Mis-management of explosive materials and lack of control during explosion operations could
result in serious injuries of not only construction workers but also local residents. In particular, the
local residents may not have the knowledge of explosives and explosive operations and lack self
protection awareness during such operations. The risks of being injured will be even higher.
Besides potential safety threats to people, explosion operation could also affect the structural
integrity and safety of houses. According to experience with other expressway projects, the
vibration impacts of explosion on mountains can extend to a 500 radius area centered on the blast
location. Houses, especially rural houses of brick, earth-wood and other simple structure within
this area, resulting in wall cracking, falling of ceiling or roof tiles and other damages. The impact
to the houses would not only cause property damage but also safety risks to people in the damaged
buildings as well.
Construction sites could also be a potential safety hazard for local residents, especially children
who do not have the understanding of such dangers on a construction site and knowledge for
self-protection. The unusual activities at the construction sites may be an attraction to the rural
residents and rural children. The safety hazard will be real and serious safety accidents could
occur if they are in the construction sites.
During construction, effective safety and warning measures will be taken to reduce and avoid
accidents. The explosion time, signal, and guarding will be regulated, and the people and vehicles
within explosion area will be removed following strictly designed procedures. Prior to explosion,
thorough inspection will be conducted and safety lookout will be built to prevent people and
vehicles from passing explosion affected areas. Explosion will not be carried out in hours which
may be busy for rural residents or local traffic. The usage and management of explosives will
follow strictly the relevant regulations issued by public security and other relevant authorities.
The construction sites will be fenced and sealed off from the general public where possible,
particularly children. A large board will be posted at the entrance, warning of the safety hazard and
the danger of unauthorized entry into the construction sites. In addition, the contractors and
construction supervision companies will be requested to visit the villages within their construction
areas, explain the construction activities including the safety hazard associated with them. The
contractors will be requested to conduct similar public education programs to the rural
communities of their contract section regularly, when a new type of construction activity is about
to start and prior to the most dangerous operations such as explosions.
5.6.8  Impacts to Cultural Relics
Among the nine cultural relics along the TTH alignment, Yangjialing and Shangjie relic sites have
poor conditions and some even have residential housing built on the top. These sites have low
cultural or historical values according to relevant provincial cultural relics authority. Furthermore,
the highway will not pass through the sites directly but only their boundaries. Thus the impact to
these cultural relics sites are limited.
148



Tongling-Tangkou Highwvay EIA
The Huangtuling dinosaur egg fossil site, through which the TTH will pass, may still have
dinosaur fossil in the deep layer red sandy rock layer. Although the fossil bringing layer is very
deep, highway construction activities may still damage such fossil if they do exist
The Jieshiting tomb groups, Wenjiachong kiln, and Huangnixiang tomb groups, to be passed by
the TTH, are relatively large and well protected relics sites. The TTH will occupy parts of these
sites.
Although protective excavation at these sites will be conducted prior to commencing the
construction, chances finds of ancient china, coins, daily utensils, etc. may still be a possibility
during construction. In addition, new cultural relic sites may be found underground during
excavation and other construction activities. If construction workers do not have the necessary
knowledge and awareness to protect such chance finds, valuable cultural properties may be
damaged.
5.6.9 Mitigation Measures
This section outlined the mitigation measures designed for potential impacts to socio-economic
environments as analyzed above. These measures are to be taken in the design, construction and
operation phases, respectively.
Design phase
*   The design team will improve the design of pathways for each village, taking into account of
the pathway access problem of scattered villagers, or the scattered villagers would be
relocated together with the majority.
*   The alignment selection will avoid or minimize the occupation of good farmland and  good
forest. The waste land, shrub land or farmland will be considered as the first priority for land
occupation.
*   The farmland will be re-cultivated immediately after temporary occupation. If the land is
deprived of productivity by the project, economic compensation sufficient to cover the loss
will be paid, or the use of land will be changed.
*   For the reserved farmland to be permanently occupied, following measures will be taken for
compensation: The sloping land will be cultivated as terrace and protected as reserved
farmland; While the economic compensation is paid, the available cultivated land will be
seek to compensate the lost reserved land.
*   The selected route will be changed to avoid the Yangjialing Relics site for by about 90 meters
and a protection stone will be erected.
*   The Huangnixiang Tomb Group of Shangjie Relics site will go through a protective
excavation prior to the start of the construction and all finds will be collected and preserved
in the county museum..
*   The Wanjiachong Kiln Relic site will go through a protective excavation prior to the start of
the construction and all finds will be preserved in the county museum.
*   The selected route will be changed to avoid the Wenchang pavilion by about 70 meters.
149



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
o   For Dongjiacun tomb groups, the borrow pit will be moved northwest bound by about 250
meters to avoid occupying this site.
o   Unearth the Jieshiting Tomb Group for salvage before the road construction. The excavated
area is about 3000 m2.
Construction phase
Existing Roads
o   The access road will be minimized, the existing road will be used as possible. The contractor
will at first cooperate with the road agency in development of road use plan, especially in the
case of S103. The construction activity will be scientifically scheduled to avoid the sensitive
time of villagers.
o   At the place busy of transportation, warning signs will be installed. The material
transportation route will be carefully selected to avoid populous area or villages.
o   Mitigation measures against air-bome dust and noise have mostly been included in Section
5.3.4 and 5.5.4 of this report
Cultural Relics Sites
o   The contractors are obligated to provide necessary training to its workers for basic
knowledge of cultural relics. Once a chance find is uncovered, the construction will be halted
immediately. Cultural relics authority will be called in and an investigation starts. The
construction on the same site can resume only after the contractors receive such instructions
from cultural relics authority.
o   Professional cultural relics specialists will be called during the construction at the
Huangtuling dinosaur egg fossil site to identify additional signs and start the protective
excavation immediately if new relics items are found
o   At the beginning of the No.3 borrow pit construction, investigative drilling will start first and
if a relics site is found, the borrow pit will be relocated to elsewhere.
o   The temporary siting of borrow pits and waste disposal sites will be carefully conducted to
avoid cultural relics sites.
Public Disturbance
o   The construction activity will not damage to service facilities along the road and any
accidental damages will be repaired and restored at the quickest way possible.
O   The contractors will be requested to have their own the equipment for temporary power
supply, communication and water supply.
o   A billboard will be installed at the entrance of construction site, indicating the names and
phone numbers of the contractor, supervisor and local EPB. The villagers therefore could
voice their complaints, if any, to govemment department as well as responsible for it.
Safety and Health
150



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
*   The construction workers will be educated with the basic knowledge about disease control,
especially the epidemics such as AIDS or hepatitis.
*   The construction workers will be provided with necessary personal preventive equipment,
such as helmet and earplug.
*   Effective safeguard facilities will be provided to the people living along the proposed road.
The construction site or other dangerous place will be fenced off to alert the villagers of the
dangers.
*   Transportation and storage of explosive will receive special attention. The place where the
explosive will be applied needs to be carefully examine to ensure a full compliance with the
procedures and regulations.
*   The houses within 500 m from the explosion place will be carefully examined prior to
explosion operation. The houses which are thought to be vulnerable to explosion operation
will be reinforced for explosion operation.
Temporary Access Road
*   Borrow pits and disposals will be sited as close to the construction site as possible so that the
need to access road can be minimized;
*   Transportation of construction will use the existing roads, e.g., S103, as much as possible;
*   Temporary access roads, if necessary, will be built within the acquired land to the highest
extent possible to minimize the need for temporary land acquisition;
*   The access roads will be selected to avoid sensitive receptors such as schools, seniors houses
and residential ares.
Construction Camps
*   Septic tank will be provided for construction tank, and needs to be cleared regularly.
*   Wastewater from the camp is banned from entering into waters;
*   The solid waste in construction site will be collected regularly and transported to designated
site for disposal.
*   The drinking water quality will be ensured to meet the national standard for drinking water.
Contractor Management
Contractors will be on the construction site at all time and their activities will be the sources of
adverse impacts during the construction phase. Therefore, contractors are the key for
environmental control and mitigation plan implementation and as such, environmental
management for contractors will be critical for successful mitigation. Most of the mitigation
measures designed above require contractors to implement. In order to ensure the mitigation
measures and environmental management plans become contractors commitments, the following
actions will be taken:
* During the contractor pre-qualification, environmental management of contractors will be an
151



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
integral part of the evaluation criteria
o   Under the same conditions, priority considerations will be given to those bidders who have
ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 certified;
o   Contractors will be requested to provide at least one full time environmental staff at the
construction  site  for environmental  supervision, environmental monitoring  and
environmental mitigation measures implementation;
o   All mitigation measures such as those listed above will be included in the bid documents so
that contractors will bid with the understanding of these environmental requirements and
prepare budget for mitigation measures in their bids where necessary. These mitigation
measures will then become contractual obligations for the winning contractors; and
o   Environmental training will be provided to the winning contractors prior to the
commencement of the construction. At least one senior manager and one full time
environmental staff from each contractor will be requested to attend the training, to be
delivered by experienced environmental specialists and local regulators. The training
program will be 2-3 days prior to signing of the contracts. The training programs will include,
but not limited to,
-   State and local environmental regulations and discharge standards,
-   Technical principles for relevant environmental control technologies
-   Project EIA and EMP,
-   Site monitoring requirements and monitoring techniques,
-   Reporting requirements and monitoring feedback,
-   Mitigation measures,
-   Environmental emergency and spills response,
-   Continued public consultation and handling of public complains, and
-   Contractors' contractual obligations for environmental protection.
In addition, construction supervision companies will also play an important role in environmental
management and pollution control. The requirements for environmental management for
construction supervision companies will also be included in the bid documents and later in the
contracts. At least two staff members one of whom being a senior manager from each winning
construction supervision company must attend the same training program for the contractors
described above.
Operation Phase
The socio-economic impacts are primarily to the Huangshan mountain scenic site and the
following mitigation measures are developed accordingly.
Increased tourists
The Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site Management Committee is fully aware and well understand
the impacts of construction and operation of the TTH on tourism burden to the site, and is now in
the process to revise Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site Master Plan to accommodate the effect
from the expected great increase in the number of tourists to the site once the TTH is open for
152



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
traffic. The revised master plan will be the principal guides to the development of Huangshan
mountain and avoid the disorderly construction and development, with the objective of promoting
the tourism and protecting the environment and resources at the same time.
One of the major issues at the Huangshan mountain scenic site is the even burden of the tourists to
the site in the difference months of the year. For example, the numbers of the tourists to the site in
2001 were:
*   January          23,066
*   February         15,733
*   March            63,248
*   April            141,634
*   May              230,600
*   June             106,220
*   July             175,023
*   August           187,224
*   September        127,645
*   October          183,383
*   November         67,810
*   December         22,593
Clearly, the tourists are heavily concentrated in the five months of the year including May and
October each of these months has a golden week, as well as July and August when schools are on
vacation and weather is suitable for travel. The tourist burden to the site is so uneven that the
busiest month, May is about 14.6 times higher than the quietest month, February. The daily tourist
burden also varies heavily with the highest up to 20 to 30,000 people while the quietest day the
site receives only 58 people. As a mitigation measure, the management authority plans to regulate
the door price in hope to adjust the tourist loads. Also, with the vacationing system gradually
established among the employers of China, the tourists may not always show up in the golden
weeks, which will also help spread out the tourist loads.
Other mitigation measures to be adopted at the Huangshan mountain tourist site include:
ï   Reasonably arrange the tourist routes and attract the tourists to different zones in order to
increase the tourism capacity at the site;
*   Gradually open up and pomote the Diaoqiao scenic zone at the west gate, Songgu scenic
zone at the north gate as well as other zones in different parts of the site to alleviate the
congestion currently occurring at the existing Beihai, Xihai and Yuping scenic zones.
*   Develop more scenic zones in the surrounding area of the Huanghshan mountain scenic site
which has abundant tourism resources (see Section 4.7.7). According to Anhui Provincial
Tourism Development Plan, the province will speed up the development and promotion of
the tourist attractions near the Huangshan mountain at the same time when the TTH and other
parts of the highway network are constructed, in order to share the tourist burden to
Huangshan mountain.
153



Tonghng-Tangkou Highway EIA
o   The tourist will be encouraged to tour the mountain but live off the mountain. The cable car
operation hours will be prolonged, from the current 8 am to 5 pm to 5 am to 10 pm daily.
This will allow tourists have sufficient time to tour the mountain site including the popular
tourist items of watching the sun rise and sunset on the mountain, without having to live on
the mountain.
e   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is funding an Acid Rain and Environmental Upgrading
project in Anhui province which includes a $14.6 million component plus RMB250 million
matching fund for Huangshan Mountain environmental upgrading. The program take the
future tourist grow, as well as the need to protect the environment, into considerations. In
total the program will build, new or upgrading, eight wastewater treatment stations in the
Huangshan mountain scenic site, with a total treatment capacity of 7470 m3/day, and upgrade
the sewer network including construction of 15 km of new sewers. Other pollution control
facilities in the scenic site include construction of municipal solid waste landfills and
incinerator, upgrading of seven public toilets and construction of four new ones. These
facilities will greatly help protect the environment in the scenic site, even with the much
increased tourist, thus environmental, burdens to the site following the construction and
operation of the TTH.
Surrounding Area
The Huangshan district government plan to take the following measures to mitigate the potential
impacts described above:
o   There will be no bus stop at Shacha village and tourists will be discouraged to leave their
vehicles in this area;
o   The tourist service facilities such as hotels, restaurants and other commercial vendors, will be
strictly controlled in this area;
o   The relocated residents will be moved to a collectively planned and built new houses which
are away from the interchange area and hiden in the woods
o   Shacha village development will be carefully planned, with particular consideration to
harmony. The construction materials, configuration, style, color, form, etc. will all be under
strict control in order to main the Huangshan or Wannan style. They will also have traditional
Anhui's architecture style reflecting Anhui's culture, so that the structures can be integrated
and harmonized with the natural and cultural scenery in the region, and maintain the good
quality of the Huangshan mountain surrounding environment.
o   Development of village level scenic zones will be banned. All tourist attraction site
developments will be under the master plan and strictly in compliance with state level scenic
site standards and requirements. All new scenic zone or attraction developments must go
through environmental impact assessment.
o   Enforce the jurisdiction and authority of the Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site Management
Committee. Although the state government has a specific degree on the scope of the
jurisdiction and authority for the Committee, the actual authority particularly that for
protection area have not always been clear and specific. This lack of clear management
authority has resulted in certain levels of disorderly development within the scenic site.
154



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Re-enforcement of the scope of the authority will help control and minimize the disorderly
development.
5.7 Soil Erosion and Mitigation
According to relevant government policies, this project needs to prepare a separate Soil and Water
Conservation Plan (SWCP). The project proponent has entrusted Highway Research Institute of
the MOC to prepare a SWCP and this section is a synopsis of the Plan.
5.7.1 Soil Erosion Impact
The HHT impacted area is mostly the key soil and waster conservation areas. The exiting soil
erosion in the project area is shown in Table 5-7-1.
Table 5-7-1 Existing Soil Erosion in the Project Area

district    Sankou, Tanjiaqiao   Surface and ditch       light           1800-2100
and Shacha           erosion
The table shows that soil erosion along the project area is mostly light and medium and not very
serious.
The vast majority of the project impacted area belongs to light to medium soil erosion regions and
soil erosion is not very serious. During highway construction however, the disturbance of the
surface vegetation will lower the anti soil erosion ability of the sites. If it rains at this time, soil
erosion may result. More specifically:
*   The highway construction will have a large volume of earth work (excavation and
transportation), and these activities themselves are erosions to soils. While during the
processes of excavation, filling, and transportation, part of the soil will lost in the process.
*   For the construction of road bed base, limited by various factors the earth work can hardly be
completely balanced. Some sections may need borrowed earth while others may generate
excessive materials requiring disposal. The spoiled materials typically have loose texture and
poor anti-erosion ability and are easy to subject to soil erosion.
*   The construction of the TTH will create large amounts of new slope sections These slopes
will change the original land terrain, damage the surface vegetation and soil layers, and thuse
155



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
reduce the anti-erosion ability. Such slopes will be potential areas for soil erosion.
Soil erosion would mainly occur in the construction phase, particularly the early days of the
construction phase, when the mitigation and protection measures are not in place yet. In contrast,
following the completion of the construction, as well as various protective structures, soil erosion
will be gradually reduced and ultimately to or below the original soil erosion levels.
Using analogy method to predict the soil erosion, considering the same types of construction
activities in the similar regions, including cut, fill, excessive materials disposal, slope making, if
no mitigation measures are taken, the incremental increase of soil lost during construction will be
1.256x106 tons. Although soil erosion may not be completely avoided during highway
construction, the amount of soil lost during this period can be reduced and minimized using
various preventive and mitigative measures, outlined below.
5.7.2  Soil Conservation Measunres in Early Constiruction Phase
The early days of highway construction involve mainly road bed construction. As at this time, the
protective engineering structures have not been constructed, temporary preventive measures will
be taken for areas easily subject to soil erosion (e.g., borrow pits, spoiled materials disposal sites,
road bed side slopes, etc.). These measures are:
o   Temporary protection at borrow pits: Most borrow pits for this project will be located at hilly
land and deserted land. Borrow pits operation will create exposed soil slopes which can result
in heavy soil erosion during strong rainfalls. Drainage interception ditches will be built
surrounding the borrow pits to prevent surface runoff from hills to flash the slopes.
o   Temporary protection at disposal sites: prior to the use of a disposal site, the lower end of the
site will be built with bank to prevent the flush of the spoiled materials in the piles into
nearby rivers or farmland. Interception ditches will be built at the upper side of the site to
divert the runoff away from the site. In some of the temporary piles of spoiled materials
where the above temporary measures cannot be taken, the piles will be covered by nylon
cloth or similar sheets to minimize the erosion of rainfalls.
o   Temporary mitigation for the road side slopes: at the edge of road willers where side slopes
are most vulnerable, a 0.2 m high by 0.5 m wide berm will be built. Then create a temporary
discharge ditch every 50 m to collect and then direct surface runoff to discharge ditch off the
road. A settling pond may be built downstream from the discharge ditch. For fill section
higher than 5 m, an earth berm will be built at the foot. For land slide, hill falling and soft
land sections, retaining walls, concrete piling, slope cutting or complete pavement with
stones may be applied to stabilized these section for construction safety as well as prevention
serious soil erosion.
5.7.3  Restoration of borrow pits and disposal sites
For those borrow pits and spoiled materials disposal sites which are of a temporary nature as they
156



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
will finish their intended function after the highway completion, once the construction is complete,
the areas will be leveled, covered and re-vegetated. As the surface soil layer is thin in the highway
area, it is difficult to find sufficient amount of soil for final borrow pits and disposal sites coverage
and restoration. Therefore, the contractors will be requested to keep the surface soil in reserve at
the beginning of the borrowing and disposal operation, which will be used during final coverage.
Furthermore, restoration and re-vegetation will need to consider harmonization with the
surrounding environment and to minimize any potential impacts to environmental aesthetics. The
restoration plan for each of the borrow pits and disposal sites, prepared by the EA team with the
above considerations, is listed in Table 5.7-2.

As the project will use soil banks/terms at borrow      pits and disposal sites, surface runoff
interception and discharge facilities, immediate restoration and reclamation, landscape and other
engineering at slopes, etc., the soil erosion during construction will be controlled to the minimum.
Most erosion will occur prior to the implementation of the preventive and mitigation measures. It
is predicted that the soil erosion modules can be mostly controlled the current levels during the
construction phase.
5.8 Assessment of Impact on Landscape and Mitigation Measures
As the TTH will go through or near some of the most beautiful scenic sites in the country, the
creation of a highway in such setting will affect the view, scenery and environmental aesthetics.
This section analyzes the adverse visual impacts of the TTH as well as develops effective
mitigation measures.
The proposed project will adversely impact natural landscape through the following:
157



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
ï   Separation of natural landscape and disconnection of continuity and damage to the natural
setting. In several sections of the TTH, the natural scenery has a high quality, stunning views
and little human activities thus far. The highway will create a distinct mark of human
activities in such a purely natural environment.
o   Occupation and damage of important natural landscape and scenery. In some of the valley
areas, the proposed highway cannot completely avoid the narrow sites and will have to use
high fill, deep cut, elevated viaduct, tunnels, etc. which will destroy the natural slopes of hills
or valleys and affecting the views of the area.
o   Conflict between image of the highway and the natural landscape. As a modem infrastructure,
the highway itself and affiliated structures (retaining walls, slopes, drainage, culverts, fence,
signage, boards, etc.) as well as supporting facilities (toll stations, service areas, parking lot,
etc.) are all artificial or man-made. If not designed or sited properly they could create a major
conflict to the natural setting in the surrounding areas.
5.8.1  Key impacting sections
Based on the general characteristics of expressway projects, the some highway sections that would
potentially create adverse impact on landscape and visual impacts. They are high fills, deep cuts,
interchange (toll station), service zone, bridge, elevated viaduct and tunnel, borrow pit and spoil
stockpile and material stockpile site, access roads, construction vehicle and construction camp.
In general, the proposed highway will have low adverse impact on the plain landscape, since
plains have limited environmental aesthetics quality, high threshold and low sensitivity. In contrast,
such sections as hills, valley, forest, lakes usually have high environmental aesthetics quality, high
sensitivity and low threshold, therefore more sensitive to construction works, and thus special
attention in impact assessment as well as mitigation planning.
5.8.1.1  High fill and deep cut sections
The locations of major high fill and deep cut road sections are shown in attached Appendix 7.
There are 20 high fill road sections along the highway, with the total length up to 8374 m, or 7.3%
of the TTH total length. In addition, there are nine deep cut sections and 38 deep-cut points, with
the total length of 8920 m, or 7.8% of the total. The detailed locations of the deep-cut sections and
points are shown in Figure 4-9-3-1.
For high fill sections, the highway structure will enter into the visual scope or block the view of
natural landscape of the people near the highway, creating a conflict in the visual scope between
this structure and natural landscape in the background and surrounding areas. Therefore the high
fill sections will be decorated to the highest extent possible during the design to minimize the
conflict, so that people will not just see an ugly concrete structure but something which can
harmonize with the surrounding setting to extent possible.
158



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Deep cut sections will mainly affect the view of the people who on highway. Demanded by the
geological and topographic conditions, deep cuts often require concrete or stone pavement of the
slopes on both sides, which create a conflict with the surrounding green and natural setting and
impact travelers' visual pleasure. Such visual impacts would be particularly strong in forest, and
valleys.
5.8.1.2  Service areas
There are three service areas, Yangtian, Taiping Lake and Changyuan Service Zones. Their
relations with the natural landscapes are shown in Table 5-8-1.

Lake      K149+550      32       the east is Taipinghu Township, At the  landscape combined, at
service zone                         nearest distance, it is I km from the  the edge of Taiping
Taiping Lake, and 600 m from S103  Lake landscape site.
In a narrow valley plain of Huangshan

service zone  K178+000     15      to the west is Ma River, surrounded by  landscape
farmlands
It is clear that the service zones of Taipinghu and Changyuan are within particularly sensitive
areas, in which the structures will be eye-catching and visual impact will be significant.
*   Taipinghu Service Zone: Currently, there are villas, resorts and villages and Taiping township
scattered along the southwest side of Taiping Lake. The continuity of the natural setting on
the shoreline has already been disrupted by these other developments. The service area, with
its structure, parking lot, roads etc. will further affect the surrounding landscape, although the
service area itself is not the major visual impacts source in the shore area On a positive side,
the service zone will become a very good platform for tourists and travelers to stop and
watch beautiful landscape of Taiping Lake.
*   Chanyuan Service Zone: Although it is not important landscape or scenic site in the
immediate surrounding area, the facility is located within the Huangshan mountain's narrow
corridor with a beautiful setting. Small, Anhui traditional rural housing are scattered among
the rolling mountains and thick forest. The large structure for the service area including
parking yard and road, could impact adversely on the natural view of such a setting. But
similar to the Taipinghu service area, this service zone can become a very good platform for
tourist to stop and see the beautiful landscape of Huangshan Mountains.
The impact on landscape will be limited through reasonably and careful design and layout of these
service zones. At the same time, these zones will become good places for tourists to watch the
beautiful landscape.

5.8.1.3  Interchange (including toll stations)
There are six interchanges along the highway (Figure 4-9-3). Except, Tianjiaqiao and Shancha
Interchanges which are located in hill and valley region, all others are located in plain and
connected with existing road network which is the major existing view of the area at present..
Therefore the interchanges at these locations have little incremental impacts to visual pleasure in
those plain regions, except Tianjiaqiao and Shancha Interchanges.
O   Tanjiaqiao Interchange is to the southwest of Tanjiaqiao Township: It is connected with S103
heading to the north gate of Huangshan Mountains. Although it is located in valley landscape,
there are existing villages surrounded by vast farmlands and signs of heavy human activities.
This interchange is therefore not going to have significant impacts to the existing view of the
landscape.
o   Shancha Interchange (including toll station): Occupying an area of 203.6 mu (13.6 ha), this
interchange and toll station is adjacent to Huangshan mountain scenic site. From the Yungu
scenic zone on Huangshan mountain, one will see clearly the structure of the interchange and
toll station. With the current beautiful natural landscape and scattered small rural housing in
the view, the creation of the interchange and toll station will cause a major visual conflict.
5.8.1.4  Bridge and tunnel
Impact of bridge
There are 10 super large bridges/elevated viaduct along the TTH, with four designed to cross
streams and lakes. These bridges will sever the view of the stream and lake landscape. In
particular, on the vast lake, the concrete structure (Shuiqiaohu Bridge and Taipinghu Bridge) will
be outstanding and eye-catching. However, Shuiqiaohu Bridge will cross the edge of the lake,
surrounded by fish ponds and unfinished villas without landcape views requiring special
protection. This bridge therefore will not create significant visual impact. Taipinghu Bridge will
sever Taiping lake into two parts, bigger on the east and smaller on the west. There is an existing
bridge 200 m downstream of the proposed bridge site. Therefore the water view severance effect
would not caused by this proposed bridge alone.
The existing bridge 200 m downstream of the proposed Taiping lake Bridge is designed to make a
shortcut to Huanshan Mountains. This bridge, built in 1996, is shaped like a white sailing ship, at
the entrance of the Taiping lake and has become an showplace of the area by itself. However there
will be visual pressure since the two bridges are too close with each other. And there could be
visual conflict if the color, shape and design or the two bridges differ significantly.
In summary, Taiping lake at the bridge area is very narrow and is already at its edge, the visual
impacts of the bridge will be limited to this area only and not to other landscape and views of the
Taiping lake.
The bridges crossing valley is designed to connect with tunnels. The impact to surrounding
160



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
landscape is small compared with high fill sections. This impact could be minimized by
harmonious design and appropriate colors with the surrounding environment.
Impact by tunnel
There are nine tunnels along the highway, with the total length of 7509 m. Tunnel is always
designed to minimize environmental impact in a road project.
The adverse visual impact of tunnels will arise from the entrances and exits which cut the original
landscape. Additionally, the concrete structure at the entrances and exits will not be harmonized
with the surrounding natural settings and greens, creating a visual conflict.
5.8.1.5  Borrow pits and spoiled materials disposal sites
The TTH construction site will have a total of six borrow pits and 16 disposal sites. The
surrounding environment of the borrow pits are flat/mild hill and borrow pits will utilize small
hills. Following the earth borrow operations, the small hills will be flattened and restored through
re-cultivation or landscaping. The restored sites will integrated into the surrounding environment
and is expected to have little visual impacts.
All 16 spoiled materials disposal sites are selected in depressed lands. If near a village, a site may
be filled, leveled, and then re-cultivated and if near an urban center, it will be used as urban land.
Disposal sites No. 13, 14, 15, and 19, 20, 21, 22 are located near the Shlishan protection reserve
and near Huangshan Mountain scenic site, respectively. These areas are well covered by
vegetation and green year round with very beautiful natural scenery. These seven disposal sites
will be carefully restored and landscaped with the appropriate plants to ensure that they will
harmonize with their surrounding views and environment.
5.8.2 Impact on landscape in construction phase
The construction activity in the key sections, such as Huangshan Mountains and Taiping Lake,
will last 1-2 years, when the construction workers will live on site. The material storage,
construction vehicles, access road, construction camps and random dumping of solid waste can
create visual impacts to the surrounding natural setting
5.8.3 Mitigation Measures
Design phase
*   The highway alignment will be smooth rolling along to the extent possible with the natural
terrain and topography and not to seek highway engineering at the expenses of damaging to
the natural landscape and scenery.
*   High fill and deep cut sections in the mountainous and valley araes will be replaced by
161



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
bridges or tunnels where possible.
o   The entrances and exits of tunnels will be designed as arch shaped and decorated with local
plants where possible.
o   The slope of deep cut section will be gentle where the natural vegetation cover is easily
restored. The slope will be created in such shapes that will match the surroundings and
appear to be natural slopes. Where possible, the slopes will use natural plants with strong
rooting and water fixation ability to stabilize and avoid using concrete and stone. The green
on the slope will alleviate the visual impacts on the travelers using the highway.
o   Service zons design will be harmonized with the surrounding area and avoid using any colors
with sharp contrast with that the area and where appropriate include areas for view watching.
The architecture style will be designed with the consideration of both modem and tradition as
well as harmonization with the other buildings, structure, and rural housing in the area.
o   The parking lots will be designed in areas which can be hide from the public view and visual
scope. At the perimeters of the parking lots, large and tall trees will be planted to further
reduce the visual impacts. The entire service areas will be well landscaped.
o   The Shancha Interchange and toll station design will give sufficient and careful
considerations to color, style, layout, and shape to harmonize with the surrounding area.
Trees will be planted around the interchange.
o   Bridge design will be consistent and harmonized with the surrounding setting through
configuration, style, and color. The Taiping lake bridge design will also need to consider the
style of the existing bridge in the same area. In areas where bridge construction could
potentially create a major visual impact, a special landscape design will be included to
minimize such impacts.
o   Drainage facilities will be under ground or hide under bushes where possible. The side
ditches will not be paved with cerements, instead, covered by vegetation.
Construction Phase
o   The construction activity in the section of high landscape quality (for instance, Huangshan
Mountains and Taiping Lake) will be scheduled in off-season for tourism. The construction
vehicles will operate at night to the extent possible. The vehicles will be kept clean and the
materials, particularly powered materials, transported will be covered.
o   The fencing walls will be constructed around the construction site near landscape sites, which
will be decorated with vegetation or other means to minimize the visual impacts created by
the construction sites.
o   The construction camps will be located in the nearest villages where possible. No
construction camps are allowed in forest, scenic sites, and other sensitive areas.
o   The solid waste from construction and domestic sources will be collected and disposed
regularly in engineered and designated facilities. Random dumping of solid waste will be
strictly banned.
o   The material storage and mixing stations will be located far away from river side and
landscape sites and not to be visible from major public areas.
o   The existing roads will be used as possible to access construction sites. If not possible, the
access roads will be selected in places that could minimize the damage to vegetation and to
162

scenic sites.
Operation phase
Huge billboards for advertisements and other purposes could create visual impacts and affect the
overall landscaping. During the operation, the traffic control signs will be carefully erected and
other billboards including advertisement will be strictly controlled.
5.9 Resettlement and Relocation
The content contained in this section comes mainly from Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), which
was prepared in accordance with relevant policies of China as well as one of the ten World Bank's
safeguard policies, OP4.12, Involuntary Resettlement. The RAP was prepared by East China
Exploration and Design Institute, following a detailed site survey, public consultation, information
release and action planning.
5.9.1 Scope and Quantity of Resettlement

5.9.2.2  Resettlement Objectives
The overall objective of the resettlement in the TTH is to resettle the relocated people, reasonably
re-employ the labors who lost their means to earn incomes to the Project, and to increase or atleast
maintain at par the standard of living of the relocated and resettled people. According to the actual
standard of living in 2002 for residents along the proposed expressway alignment, considering
county's (district's) ten-five plan development goals and long term goals for 2015, the resettlement
objectives are determined as follows:
*   The food will be basically self-sufficient. In areas where cultivated land is limited
agricultural system and crops will be re-structured to maximize the potential of the land
yields;
*   Ensure the relocated families will have the same net income as before relocation;
*   The public facilities, school, medical care, social welfare level, natural environment and
transportation conditions will be improved compared with the before relocation levels.
5.9.2.3  Resettlement Principles
According to the relevant state laws and regulations as well as World Bank's relevant policies on
involuntary resettlement, the resettlement in this project will adopt the following the principles:
Implement relevant compensation policies in order to achieve the objective of enhance or at
least re-store the standard of living of the affected residents;

Temporary land use compensation rates
According to the materials provided by the design institute, the TTH will use a certain amount of
land temporarily for up to four years (the constr-uction period) including cultivated land, vegetable
garden and woodland. The temporary land use compensation rates are RMB5964/mu for
cultivated land, RMB6800/mu for vegetable garden and RMB2400/mu for woodland.
Compensation rates for houses and accessories
In order to determine the appropriate compensation standards so that the affected families can
receive the compensation adequate for replacement of the houses lost, detailed investigation was
conducted for the replacement value of houses in the affected area, including the different
finishing and materials used. The compensation rates are then determined to be ranged from
RMB220-280/m2 for brick and concrete buildings and RMB150-220/m2 for brick and wood
buildings. the compensation rates for accessory facilities are based on relevant regulations of
affected counties/districts. In addition, the following rates will be applied for compensation:
o   Land preparation costs for new houses, RMB I 500/household;
o   water and electricity supply facilities compensation fee: RMB300/household;
o   Transition fee and temporary living compensation: RMB 120/person;
o   Moving cost compensation: RMB300/household;

*   Moving costs for collectively owned enterprises: RMB I5/m2 of relocated buildings.
Scattered mature trees and tomb relocation compensation
Scattered matured trees to be cut by the project will be compensated according to their species.
age and size. Based on the relevant policies of affected counties and districts, the compensation
rates are listed in Table 5-9-2-2.

The tomb relocation cost will be determined based on the number of coffins within the tombs:
single coffin: RMB180 and double coffins: RMB240. For budgeting purposes, RMB240/tomb is
used in this project.
Compensation to Business Interruption of Commercial Vendors
Since it is very difficult to obtain the accurate revenues from private commercial vendors, the
business interruption loss will be estimated based on the area of buildings in which they operate.
The compensation rate will be RMB20/m2.
Compensation of Production Loss of Industry
This Project will affect one wood processing mill which is a subsidiary of a construction company
in Huangshan District. The production loss due to mill relocation will be compensated by
RMB 100,000. The mill workshop relocation and moving costs will be compensated separately.
Compensation to Special Facility Relocation
The detailed relocation plan for affected specialty facilities have not be worked by relevant
authorities. The RAP team estimated the compensation based on the actual amount of the facilities
and unit cost for budgetary purpose (Table 5.9.2-3). The final compensation will be determined
following APCD's consultation with relevant authorities in charge of these facilities.

5.9.3  Resettlement linstitutions and Resettlenient Locations
Resettlement Institutions
The institutional organizations responsible for resettlement and relocation in this Project include:
o   Project Resettlement Leading Group
o   Project Resettlement Office
o   Relevant city resettlement leading groups
o   Relevant county/district resettlement groups
o   Relevant township resettlement leading groups
o   Village committees and villager groups
o   Project design institute
o   Independent external monitoring and evaluation groups
Staffing
In order for the resettlement in this project to proceed smoothly, all levels of the project
management offices (PMOs) have assigned dedicated staff to handle resettlement. This will create
an effective information transmission channels from the grass levels all the way up to the top
provincial project management authority. Resettlement staffing consists of professional and
administrative personnel with necessary technical and management skills as well as extensive
local resettlement work experience. All counties and townships involved in the project have
established resettlement organizations with dedicated professional staffing.
In addition, PMO from APCD will engage Transportation College of the Anhui University as the
independent resettlement monitoring and evaluation organization. The college has a group of
highly experienced specialists and technical staff. Many of them have involved in resettlement
monitoring and evaluation work in the past World Bank financed expressway projects, including
two who have attended World Bank sponsored training on resettlement monitoring and evaluation
training with completion certificates.
Institutional Strengthening
The following measures will be taken to strengthen the institutional arrangement for resettlement
management:
o   Staffing - resettlement organizations at all levels will consist of two groups, specialists and
administrative staff. All staff assigned to these organizations will possess a certain levels of
professional and/or management skills and experience.
o   Training - key staff in resettlement organizations of all levels will be trained for government
resettlement regulations and World Bank policies. In addition, the working staff at the county
and township levels will also be trained to increase their work and policy implementation
skills.
174



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
ï   Sufficient fund and facilities will be provided to the resettlement organizations
ï   A resettlement data base will be established, in order to strengthen the information collection
and analysis, effective communication from different levels of resettlement organizations as
well as for the Resettlement Leading Group to decide on major issues as may be necessary
*   Strengthen the reporting and internal monitoring system in order to identify and resolve
problems promptly.
*   Establish external monitoring and evaluation, as well as early-warning system.
Resettlement and Relocation Places
Residential areas
Resettlement management organizations will offer several places for affected households to select.
The candidate resettlement places will have the following conditions:
*   Belongs to the same community (if desired, within the same village) so that the affected
people can easily adopt;
*   Possesses good sanitary, environmental conditions without apparent pollution  and
inconvenience to production and living.
*   Minimize the occupation of agricultural land, if not contradicting to the affected will.
*   The residents at the relocation places are willing to accept the resettlement and can get along
well with the new comers;
*   Houses will utilize as much as possible the empty land and the procedures for construction of
new will be centrally managed at the land administrative and planning authorities.
Specialty facilities
The affected specialty facilities include mainly power and communication facilities. For these
facilities, the resettlement organizations will consult in detail with the power and communication
authorities and then determine the replacement costs as the compensation standards. The
resettlement will complete within short term ensure the minimum impacts to the users of these
facilities along the alignment.
For low voltage power line and communication cables, the contractors will be responsible for the
relocation at the time of construction with minimum effect to the construction work itself.
For higher voltage (10 V or higher) power lines, the facility owners will relocate according to the
relevant state technical standards.
Public buildings
Public buildings have the similar structural features as the private households in this area. When
relocate, considerations will be given to the functions of the public buildings and convenience of
the relocation places.
175



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
Accessories
Accessories will be relocated and re-built by their owners, together with the relocating houses.
Restoration of road and water supply systems.
State and provincial roads will not be compensated
For other roads, appropriate compensation will be provided and the road maintenance authority
will be responsible for restoration following the completion of the project
For roads not within the jurisdiction of the road authority, the contractors will be responsible for
maintenance and traffic management during construction. When construction completes,
appropriate compensation will be provided for restoration.
With regard to the irrigation system, the design team will consult closely with the local residents,
agricultural and hydrology authorities during the design stage and restore to the maximum
possible the functions of these systems while satisfying the expressway design at the same time.
During construction stage, temporary facilities may be built to ensure the agricultural and
irrigation needs.
lInformation Disclosure
Resettlement Offices will develop resettlement pamphlets for distribution, public meeting and
public notices to disclose such information as scope of resettlement, compensation rates and
compensation costs. The pamphlet will include the following information:
o   Project introduction
o   Resettlement policies and compensation standards
o   Affected people, scope, and compensation funds
o   The right and responsibility of the affected people
o   The address and hotline telephone numbers of the different lelves of the resettlement offices
5.9.4  Jl mpacts of the Resettlemeint
Housing conditions
As the compensation rate is based on the replacement cost and the re-built houses will be new, the
housing conditions following the relocation is expected to improve.
Community Environment
The relocated places will have good sanitary environment, no pollution and convenient to living
176



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
based on the selection criteria for relocation places. The residents currently in these places are
willing to accept the immigrants and to try to get along with them. Therefore, the community
environment will be no at least no worse than the places they left behind.
Education
The relocated places are mostly within the same villages and as such the education conditions will
not change.
Resettlement risks and mitigation
Risk 1- Mis-management of land and resettlement compensation funds
Measure 1- strict procedures for compensation funds allocation, administration, monitoring and
auditing will be established and followed. Resettlement organizations at the three levels of
governments (provincial, city and county) as well as the independent monitoring and evaluation
organization will conduct training of the staff from village levels and provide guidance to them on
planning for the development and fund utilization. The village compensation fund utilization plans
will be reviewed and approved by the county level resettlement office. Those without a fund
utilization plan will not be allocated with the fund until such a plan is developed and approved.
The provincial resettlement office will select randomly a village for monitoring and audit each
year. In addition the independent monitoring organization will supervise the fund utilization status
through investigation, site visits, interviews with the affected people, etc. This organization will
also provide consultation with villages and report to the township and county level resettlement
offices.
Risk 2-Affected residents are not satisfied with the relocation places
Mitigation 2- According to site survey, on average each village will have less than seven
households for relocation. All of them will be resettled within the same villages they are living
now. The unsatisfactory places are unlikely to be an issue to the affected residents.
Risk 3- Those households which are small with primitive structures may not receive sufficient
funds to re-build new houses
Mitigation 3- disadvantaged households will receive the following assistance: fund from project
proponent, labor for new house construction from villages, exemption of labor contribution to the
village activities for the year, preference in selection of new house places and cultivated land
re-distribution. The disadvantaged households may not participate in the village land
re-distribution to minimize the impacts to their crops in the fields.
5.9.5 Costs and Budgets
The TTH Project resettlement and relocation budgets include the following items:
*   Compensation to land acquisition;
*   Compensation to houses and accessory facilities;

OP 4.04 Natural Habitats - According to the definition in Appendix A-i-a of OP4.04, all of
Important Natural Habitat have been designated as Nature Reserve Zones in Wannan Region, as
shown in Figure 5-2-1-1. This project will not cross any existing Nature Reserve Zone. According
to the Section 4.3.1 of the report, this project will pass the peripheral area of Shilishan Nature
Reserve (K151-K160), Huangshan Mountains (K173+500-K194+350) and the valley plain of
Jiuhuashan Mountains which are the natural habitats as defined by Appendix A-i of OP4.04 (the
general natural habitat). The current status of these habitats is discussed in Section 4.3.3.2 and
Section 4.3.4.2. The potential impacts to be brought by the project are analyzed in section 5.2.1.2,
5.2.2.2, 5.2.3.3 and 5.2.4. And the mitigation measures are developed in Section 5.2.8.
OP 4.09 Pest Management - The forest pest problem is very serious in the project area, with
some areas under stringent protective measures against pine nematode. However this project will
not bring much pine nematode to this area. The plants for greening in this project are arbor tree,
shrub, bamboo and grass. Pine trees are forbidden from the project. Therefore pine nematode
disaster could not be triggered, and pesticide could not be widely applied. This project will not
fully apply OP 4.09. However protective measures have been developed for implementation in the
key areas (Huangshan Mountains). Section 5.2.2.4 has analyzed the impact and Section 5.2.8.1
proposed the protective measures.
OPN 11.03 (being converted to OP 4.11) Cultural Property - The Project has undertaken a
cultural property survey and assessment under the EA to determine if any project sites have
archeological, historical, religious, or unique natural values as required under the OPN. A cultural
property survey and evaluation report has been prepared by a team of professional archeologists
and cultural specialists. Section 4.8 presents the current status of cultural property, Section 5.7
discuss the impact, Section 5.73 proposes the protection measures which has been included in the
EMP.
OD 4.20 (being converted to OP 4.10) Indigenous Peoples - The surveys during the EA and
resettlement evaluation showed that there are no indigenous peoples with characteristics described
in 0D4.20 Paragraph 5 among the project affected groups and residents.
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement - The project will involve significant land acquisition and
involuntary resettlement. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of OP4.12. Section 5.9 summarizes the main findings and contents of the RAP.
OP 4.36 Forestry - The Project will cross artificial forest, natural secondary forest and bamboo
grove. This project will occupy 3603.5 mu forestland. This project will not cross virgin forest, nor
tropical rain forest. But commercial forestry center will be involved. In this report, Section 4.3.3
presents the current status of forestry, Section 5.2.2 analyze the potential impact, and Section 5.2.8
proposes mitigation measures.

Chapter 6 Analysis of Alternative
The analysis of alternative TTH alignments is prepared by the EA team following extensive
consultation and discussion with staff from the Highway design unit and the resettlement team,
information gathering and assessment, as well as extensive field investigation of all alternative and
sub-altemative alignment sites. On this basis, this chapter analyzes and compares the different
alternatives, focusing primarily on environmental and socio-economic factors. The recommended
option has been jointly agreed with other project teams and the Project owner, APCD.
The analysis of alternatives has been done in two stages: Four alternative TTH corridors were first
proposed, analyzed and compared. A preferred corridor altemative was then selected based the
least overall environmental and socio-economic impacts. At the second stage, the five
sub-alternatives i.e., five relatively short highway segments all within the preferred corridor
alternative were identified and analyzed. The final TTH alignment, on which Project Highway is
to be constructed, is selected among the sub-alternatives along the preferred corridor alternative
based on the least overall environmental and socio-economic impacts.
6.1 Identification of Corridor Alternatives
At the very early stage of the project planning and preparation, the project proponent APCD
worked together with the design institute in selecting Highway corridors on the basis of
preliminary site reconnaissance and review of available topography, geology, urban and village
distribution, and other site conditions. As this is a complex, large liner infrastructure project going
through different terrain and regions, numerous possibilities exist which could be used as the
Highway alignment. In order to find the optimal corridor and eventually Highway alignment,
several alternatives were first identified between APCD and the design team. The identification
process has adopted the following principles:
*   Compliance with the overall layout requirements of the national trunk highway network, as
this Project is a key part of a national trunk highway, Tianjing to Shanwei Highway, as well
as the middle section of the Hefei to Tongling Highway within the Anhui provincial highway
network.
*   Appropriate connections with the local roads, in order to achieve the objective of improving
transportation conditions and develop the local economy in the poverty region where the
Project is located;
*   Reasonable distance where possible to the scenery sites in order to protect the tourism
resources, while at the same time maintaining convenient connections with these scenery
sites for better transportation services to the tourists;
*   Compliance with the topography and site conditions, in order to avoid unnecessary
engineering work and elevated capital costs;
*   Diversion where possible from cultural and other environmentally sensitive sites;
*   Smooth alignments and minimizing excessive excavation, filling, and occupation of

agricultural and wood land;
o   Co-ordination with urban planning and demand for urban developments, "close but not into
the city, distant but not separate from the city", in order to avoid severance of the urban areas
and provide positive impacts to the urban development in the Project regions.
6.1.1  Description of Alternatives
Four corridor alternatives have been identified using the principles outlined above and then
proposed by the design team for further detailed comparison based on analysis of engineering,
environmental and social factors. In this EA, the alternatives 1, II and III have been analyzied in
qualitative and quantitative terms while only qualitative discussion is carried out for alternative IV.
The exact locations of the alternative corridors are shown in Figure 6.1.
Corridor alternative 1[
Alternative I starts from the end of Lutong Highway, crossing Panlong village and Hamaling,
before intersecting with the planned Highway along river. It then extends southeast bound,
crossing national highway S318, Yangtian and Dongpu, parallels roughly with national highway
S103 before reaching Lingyang. Finally it crosses the Taiping lake, Heping, Gantang and
Tanjiaqiao towns on by one before reaching the ending point at Shancha Village of Tangkou Town.
The total length is 114.7 km.
Corridor alternative 11il
From starting point to Panlong Village, Alternative 11 is identical to the Alternative 1. It then
crosses, in turn, Qingyang City, S318, Niujiaqiao Reservoir, Lingyang Town and Caojiawan,
before reaching the ending point at Shancha. The total length is 111.25 km, 3.45 km shorter than
Alternative 1.
Corridor alternative 11111
From the starting point to Yangtian, Alternative III is identical to the Alternative 1. From Yangtian,
it extends to southeast bound through Houan, Xinfeng, Taiping Lake and Yangchun before
reaching Gantang. Then it runs along the same Section As Alternative I to the ending point. The
total length is 108.95 km, 5.75 km shorter than Alternative 1.
Corridor alternative IV
From starting point to Taiping Lake, Alternative IV is identical to Alternative 1. Then it passes
through Jiao Village, Wubei, Lantian before connecting with Tunxi-Jingdezhen Highway at
Weiqiao. It does not cross Gantang Town and Tangkou Town, unlike Alternatives 1, 11 and III. The
total length is 143 kmn, much longer than each of the other three alternatives, described above.

potential impacts to natural vegetation, natural ecology and integrity of ecosystem. With regard to
potential impacts to wild life, Alternative I is mildly better than Alternatives 11 and III but
significantly better than Alternative IV. Clearly, from the ecological impacts perspective,
Alternative I is the preferred corridor.
Acoustic environment
The road sections for Alternative I and 11 are all located in plain or mildly hilly areas where there
are many sensitive receptors. There is a 40 km section of the Highway in parallel with the existing

road S103, along which mostly rural residential areas are located and impacted by the traffic noise
from S103. Therefore, there will be increased noise from the Highway but the incremental
increase in noise levels is expected to be limited, as the existing acoustic quality is poor.
Altemative III and IV will cross mostly mountainous region where is sparsely populated.
Therefore there are few sensitive receptors on the alternative roads, but incremental increase in
noise levels from the existing quiet mountainous region is expected to be high.
Although there are more sensitive receptors in Alternative I and II than Altemative III and IV, the
magnitude of impact is relatively small. There is a marginal difference of noise impacts when
Altemative I is compared with Alternative 11 or Alternative III is compared with Altemative IV.

Alternative 1      8            1724          will cross four rivers upstream of the lake, but are
seasonal nvers.
Altemative II      8            1804        Compared with Alternative 1, the project will cross less
one river upstream of the lake, but one river downstream.
The project will cross three rivers downstream of Taiping
Alternative III     7            2612        Lake and the middle section of the lake where the lake
surface is wide.
Alternative IV      6            1516        Compared with Alternative I, the project will cross less
two rivers upstream of the lake
According to the above table, Altemative IV will cross the least number of rivers and the least
width of the lake surface compared with the other alternatives. As such, Alternative IV is
considered to have the least impacts to surface water in both construction and operation phases
when compared with other alternatives.
Alternative I and Alternative II will cross the same number of rivers. But the Alternative II will
run through the edge of Niujiaqiao reservoir which is the drinking water resource and protective
area. Furthermore, Alternative I will cross less width of water than Altemative II. Altemative III
will cross the middle section of Taiping Lake where water body crossing is the largest compared
with other altematives. Therefore Altemative III would cause most serious impact on water quality
during both phases of construction and operation and would have the highest exposure of risks
resulted from traffic accidents involving hazardous materials. Clearly, Altemative I would have
the least impact on water quality compared with Altemative II and III.

6.1.3 Social Environment
Comparison between Alternative I and Alternative II
The alignments, as well as the site topography and geology of Alternatives I and 11 are similar,
except in the plain and light hilly region (Qingyang county) Alternative 11 is diverted toward the
west. The two alternatives may be compared in terms of their potential impacts on the
socio-environment as follows:
Main advantages ofAlternative I.
*   Comply with Qingyang county urban planning and urban development requirements and
utilize the land reserved for transportation;
*   Excellent conductivity with the local road network particularly G318 and S103;
*   Project site is relatively flat resulting in relatively lost construction cost;
*   Avoid the proposed Niuqiao reservoir site; and
*   Close to the existing roads which provide convenience for construction materials
transportation during Highway construction and minimize the needs for temporary access
roads.
Main disadvantages ofAlternative I
The alternative alignment is 3.45 km longer than Alternative Il;
Within the Yangtian to Lingyang section, the proposed alignment would have more crosses
with S103 thus higher inference to the traffic on the existing road.
Main advantages ofAlternative IT
Completely avoid the provincial road S103 and have no inference to the traffic on the
existing road;
*   About 3.45 km shorter than Alternative 1.
Main disadvantages ofAlternative II
*   Near the proposed Niuqiao reservoir site and as a result, there would be more channels and
elevated road sections; Impacts to the reservoir during both construction and operation
phases;
*   Topography  is relatively  more complex  requiring  higher capitals, especially the
Longkou-Lishuling section where the capital cost would be RMB400 million for the 7 km
section;
*   Higher amount of resettlement and relocation;
*   Interfere with urban planning of Qingyang county
*   Poor conductivity with G318 and S103 as well as the local road network;
*   Inconvenient transportation of construction materials as the alignment is farther away from
187



Tongling-Tangkou Highway project EIA
existing roads.
Comparison of Alternative I and IlI
As described earlier, Altemative III is relatively more straight and smooth, and thus, 7.25 km
shorter than Alternative 1. However, the alignment sites go through complex hilly terrain with
more tunnels, larger work quantity, resulting in higher capital costs and higher difficulties during
construction. More specifically, Altemative I and Alternative III may be compared as follows:
Main advantages ofAlternative I.
o   As Altemative I is located within the same corridor with the S103 where there is high
population density, abundant labor resources and relatively well developed economy.
o   Altemative I is closely connected with the existing local road network and connects directly
with S103 via Lingyang interchange. As such it would help maintain the road network
integrity and maximize the road network function.
o   Altemative I is located within the S103 corridor where it is relatively flat with wide vision
for drivers and thus better traffic safety conditions. With regard to outings of the local
residents, Altemative I is closer to many residential areas and crosses local roads repeatedly,
causing inconvenience for residents in their outing.
Main disadvantages ofAliernative I
o   The alignment is not straight enough resulting in longer distance and higher operation costs
o   High disturbance to S103 during construction, as well as residents living near S103.
Main advantages ofAlternative III:
o   Straight alignment, resulting distance 7.25 km shorter than Altemative I and less resettlement
work.
o   Away from S103 and thus no impacts during construction to the traffic on S103 as well as
residents nearby.
Main disadvantages ofAlternative III
o   According to relevant tourism development plans, Taiping Lake will be developed into state
level tourist site, with proposed development area involving the entire Taiping lake region.
The Altemative III will pass through the center of the Taiping scenic area, dividing the
Taiping Lake into two separate region and in-compliance with Taiping lake development
plans. Clearly, this altemative would have significant negative impacts to the Taiping Lake.
Although Altemative I also passes through Taiping lake but it the alignment would go
through a very narrow site of the lake where there is no tourist spots and thus minimum
impacts to the tourism development plans.
o   Altemative III goes through mountainous region with sparsely populated and limited
188



Tongling-Tangkou Highway project EIA
resources. Therefore, Alternative would benefit more people than Alternative 111, better
utilize the local labor forces and more effectively promote the local economy.
*   Alternative III is far away from the existing roads without connections with any of the major
roads, and thus less impact on improvement of regional road network.
*   Due to the complex terrain of the site for Alternative III and high difficulties, there would be
high construction safety risk for this alternative. During the operation phase, the large amount
of tunnels (longest one up to 6 km) would also create safety concerns for the traffic.
Comparison of Alternatives I with IV
Alternatives I and IV may be compared as follows:
Main advantages ofAlternative I
*   Alternative I has about 50 km within Huangshan District with three interchanges connecting
and shortening the distance between Huangshan and Taiping lake and thus improving the
tourism conditions. As such, it will help significantly the development of tourism in the
Huangshan-Taiping Lake area, as well as the local economy.
*   Furthermore, this alternative passes Gantang, Tanjiaqiao, and Shancha interchanges
connecting some of the important townships with the Highway which will also benefit the
local economic development. At present, the key road connecting Taiping Lake-Huangshan
District -Huangshan Mountains Scenic Site is S103 and G205. However in many road
sections, especially from Tanjiaqiao to Tangkou, the road condition is very bad. In the case of
flooding, the road from Tunxi-Huangshan Mountains-Hefei is often cut off by landslides.
Alternative I will significantly improve the transportation condition in Huangshan District,
which will provide guaranteed transportation conditions for all seasons including the flood
season.
*   Alternative I will shorten the transportation time for the tourists which will help attract more
tourists by the improved transportation condition.
*   Alternative will well connect with the existing road network, including S103 and G205,
improving local transportation conditions and help promote the local economic development.
Main disadvantages ofAlternative I
*   The expected large increase in tourists volume by the implementation of Alternative I would
increase significantly the environmental burden to the scenic site. If there is no effective
management and mitigation system in place to cope with the increased tourist volumes, the
Highway development could affect the environmental protection and sustainable
development at the Huangshan mountain scenic site.
*   Alternative I will be close to the Huangshan Mountain scenic site. While this will provide
convenience to the tourists to the scenic site, it is also will have the visual impacts and
impacts to the scenic environment.
Main advantage ofAlternative IV
189



Tongling-Tangkou Highway project EIA
o   Not to increase the tourist burden to the south gate area
Main disadvantages ofAlternative IV:
o   Alternative IV is far away from Huangshan District. There are few population settlements
along this alignment. Therefore Alternative IV is not expected to bring transportation benefits
to as many people as Alternative 1.
o   The attraction of tourists to the west gate area would result in a new round of development to
the site currently on a virgin state and thus increased impacts to the natural resources.
o   Altemative IV is located on more complex terrain which will result in difficulties in
construction and high capital cost.
o   Alternative IV is not connected with Huangshan and Taiping Lake and as such, cannot be the
tourist corridor towards these scenic sites.
o   Altemative IV has no connection with the existing road network. As a result, its role in
improving local transportation conditions and promoting the local economy will be limited.
6.1.4  Comparison Resu1lt
Based on the above comparison, with all factors considered, Alternative I is deemed to be the best
option compared with other alternatives in terms of potential impacts to the natural and social
environments. Alternative I is therefore selected as the preferred corridor alignment within which
the Highway will be constructed. APCD has agreed with this recommended Alternative for the
Project.
6.2   Anaiysis of Sub-aiternatives
As seen in the above section, Alternative I has been selected as the Highway alignment. Within
this alignment corridor, additional options/sub-alternatives, which consist of short road sections
diverted from the Alternative I alignment but still within the corridor, were proposed during
project planning stage to reach the optimal final Highway route. To avoid confusion in the
following discussion of comparison of sub-alternatives, sections on the current Altemative 1, as
well as all the sections corresponding to sub-alternatives, are re-named Section A, while the
sub-alternatives which are diverted from Alternative I (namely, Section A in their respective
sections) are named Sections B, C, D, E and F.
Following the initial comparison and analysis and final selection of Alternative A, environmental
management and mitigation measures have been designed and incorporated into the Highway
design, such as provision of more pathways for wild animals, avoidance of natuzral reserve zones,
compliance with the existing terrain to reduce the need for excavation and filling, minimization of
farmland and forestland occupation, etc. Although EA team's suggestions have been incorporated
into the design, some road sections are still not appropriate or optimal. As a result, eight short
190



Tongling-Tangkou Highway project EIA
alternative sections were proposed to address the inappropriate road sections which may not be
improved by the mitigation measures. Among the eight alternative sections proposed, three had
apparent major flaws and did not worth further analysis and comparison. The remaining of this
chapter will focus on the comparison of other five sub-alternative sections, named as Sections B,
C, D, E and F and their locations and relationship with Sub-Alternative I (Section A) as shown in
Figure 6.2-1.
6.2.1 Section B (Shuiqiao Lake Section)
Section B is proposed to shorten the length of the bridge on Section A. Section B is from
BK78+060.618 to K85+146. While the extra-large bridges will be shorter than Section A, the total
length is 273 m longer than Section A. Section A differs from Section B in the configuration of
their flyover over the railway and the locations of Shuiqiao Lake crossing. All other conditions for
both sections remain the same.

Impact on land occupation
Section B will occupy 60.5 mu land more than Section A, including 38 mu of cultivated land and
forestland. Clearly, Section B will cause more impact on agricultural ecology and economy than
Section A.
Impact on Shuiqiao Lake
Section A is in the east of Shuiqiao Lake, and three extra large bridge will be constructed to cross
the lake (combined length is 1234 m). Section B is in the west of the lake and aligned under the
mountains. Therefore the elevation of bridge is higher and the lake surface where the bridge is
located is wide. The combined length is shorter than Section A. Section B is also higher above the
lake water than Section A and thus less sensitive to flooding. Overall, Section A's impact to
Shuiqiao lake is higher than Section B.
Construction Safety
Although the bridge length of Section B is shorter than Section A over Shuiqiao Lake, the single
bridge is longer than Section A, resulting in difficult construction and higher possibility of safety
issue in construction.
6.2.1.3 Result of Comparison
The overall comparison between Section B and Section A on impacts on environment, society and
construction is summarized in Table 6-2-1-3.

Based on comparison on natural and social environments and engineering aspects, Section B is
slightly better than Section A. However, as Section B has disadvantages with the project cost,
operation cost and engineering conditions, both the EA and design teams select Section A as the
better option for this section and the conclusion has been accepted by APCD.
193



Tongling-Tangkou Highway project EIA
6.2.2   Section C (Hamaliing Mountain Section)
Section C is proposed because the corresponding Section A has poor geological conditions and
affected by S103. Section C is from K177+356-K182+220, and about 215 m longer than Section
A. Both of the sections are in plain and close to each other. The overall environmental conditions
are similar.

Impact on land occupation
Section C will occupy 552.75 mu of land, about 32 mu more than Section A, and thus higher land
impacts than Section A.
Impact on Qixing River
Section A will cross Qixing river and its tributary with the combined width of water surface under
the road of 210 m. While Section C is located downstream of Section A and the width of water
surface is only 70 m. Therefore Section C will have less impact on Qixing River in both phases of
construction and operation, as well as lower risks from traffic accidents involving hazardous
materials spills and releases.
lImpact on S103
Section C will cross S103 twice, causing higher impact on S103 during the construction phase
than Section A, which will not cross S103 at this section.
6.2.2.3  Comparison Result
The overall comparison between Section C and A of impacts on natural and social environments,
are summarized in Table 6-2-2-3.

Based on the above comparison, both the EA and design teams recommend that Section A be the
preferred option for this section fo the Highway and this recommendation has been accepted by
APCD.
6.2.3  Section D (Lingyang Section)
At this section of the alignment, Section A is zigzagged. Sub-alternative Section D is proposed to
follow an alignment along the existing S103 so that it can be smoother. Section D is located
between K124+18-K143+333 and the alignment is about 1777 m shorter than Section A.

Impact on ecosystem
There are secondary broad-leaf forest and mixture of coniferous and broad-leaf forest on a 6 km
section of the alignment near the valley of Jiuhuashan Mountains (K112-K143) The area is
located at the edge of reserve zone for Cervus nippon where there are relatively abundant wild life
resources. Section A will cross this area, cutting the ecologically sensitive area into two parts
(detailed analysis in Section 5.2). In comparison, Section D will be located along S103, beyond
the edge of the area and as such, Section D would not have significant impact on ecologically
sensitive areas. In addition, Section D will include two tunnels in this area which also help protect
the integrity of ecosystem in the area and minimize the disturbance to animal pathways. Therefore,
Section D will have smaller impact on the ecology than Section A.
Impact on Taiping Lake scenic site
About 3 km of Section D will be constructed along the lakeshore which can be clearly seen from
the Taiping Lake Scenic Site, resulting in significant visual impacts of the lake area. In
comparison, Section A is far away from the lake and there is a high mountain between Section A
and the lake. There is little visual impact on the scenic site of the Taiping lake from Section A.
Impact on land occupation
Section D will occupy 294 mu less land than Section A. However, Section D will occupy more
cultivated land (about 54 mu more) compared with that occupied by Section A, although it will
occupy less forestland than Section A. Overall, Section D will have higher impact on agriculture
than Section A, while Section A will have higher impact on ecology and forestland than Section D.
Impact on water environment
Section D will cross Lingyang River 5 times, and 1.5 km road will be constructed adjacent to the
river. Furthermore, Section D is near Taiping Lake. The long near-water construction site will be
difficult to control and could be a source of pollutant to the surface water body. In comparison,
Section A will cross Lingyang River twice, as well as the well field of Lingyang County water
purification plant. However, the wells produce low volume of water and are thus easy to relocate.
Impact on S103
Section D will cross S103 twice and there is long section near S103. The disturbance to traffic and
pedestrian safety on S103 will be a primary concern during the construction phase. While Section
A will be along the east side of S103 and diverted further away from S103 beyond K130.
Therefore Section A will have smaller impact on S 103 than Section D.
Impact on villages severance
Section D will cross S103 at DK125+100 and run along the west side of the highway. Most of the
199



Tongling-Tangkou Highway project EIA
villages on the other hand are located in the east side of S103. Therefore Section D will not cause
much impact on village severance. In comparison, Section A is basically on the east side of S 103,
and will run through Fenshi Village. As such Section A will result in severance impacts to the rural
communities in this area.
Impact on cultural relics
There is one cultural relic site on Section D while two on Section A. However Section D is closer
than Section A to the Dinasaur Egg Fossil Site which is of a high scientific value. The other site on
Section A is Wenchangge Building, which is small and easy to protect. Therefore Section D is
deemed to have higher impact on cultural relics than Section A.
Construction safety
Although Section D will cross S103 twice, it is easier to control a construction site far away from
villages than those close to villages. In comparison, Section A will go through many villages,
sometimes separate villagers from their farm land. As a result, it would have a higher safety
concern at the Section A construction sites than Section D..
Comparison Result
The comparison between Section D and Section A of impacts to natural and social environments
are summarized in Table 6-2-3-3.

The most significant difference between Section D and Section A is the impact on ecosystem.
Section A will affect the integrity of an ecosystem where part of a wild life reserve is located,
although the impact on wild life themselves is expected to be limited. The EA team believes
Section D is a better choice than Section A in terms of potential environmental impacts, and has
communicated its analysis results and the findings to the design team and APCD. However, the
project proponent still insists on selecting Section A for economic, cost and geology reasons. The
project proponent, APCD, agrees to take necessary mitigation measures proposed by the EA team
to minimize the expected impacts (discussed in details in Section 5.2.8 of this report).
6.2.4 Section E (Gangtang Section)
As Section A is zigzagged, Section E is proposed to smooth the alignment. These corresponding
Sections are located at K153+635-ZK173+157. Section E is about 956 m shorter than Section A.

Impact on ecosystem
There are two tunnels on Section E, with combined length of 4174 m, including one tunnel over 3
km long. It is thought that Section E would not impact the integrity of ecosystem or disturb
animals' activities. While Section A only has one tunnel of 2432 m in length. In comparison,
Section A will have higher impact on ecosystem than Section E. In addition, Section A will pass
through the valley when exited from the tunnel, impacting on the natural scenery in the area. As
both sections will build tunnels in this section, the ecological impacts are expected to be mild.
Impact on Shilishan Mountains Reserve Zone
Section A is only 500 m from the boundary of Shilishan Mountains Reserve while Section E is
about 3 km away. Although both Sections will not cause direct impact on the reserve zone, the
explosion during construction and motor vehicle traffic during operation could affect the wild
animals in the reserve. In comparison, Section A would have higher impact to the reserve than
Section E.
Impact on water environment
Both Section A and Section E will cross Puxi River. Section E will cross the river at its upstream
section, only 350 m from the water intake of Gantang Town, while Section A will cross the river
downstream, with smaller impact on water quality than Section E.
Impact on Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site
As Section E is near the north gate of the scenic site, the tourist flow will be diverted to the north
gate, help develop the north gate area. However Section E is so close to the scenic site that it can
be seen clearly from the scenic area, thus results in significant visual impacts to Huangshan
Mountain.
Impact on Land Occupation
Section E will occupy 355 mu less land than Section A, but 81 mu more cultivated land than
Section A. In view of small cultivated land per capita in this area, Section E will have higher
impact to agriculture and rural communities than Section A.
Impact on Gantang Town
Section E is located in the south of Huangshan District, separating Huangshan District from
Huangshan Mountains as well as separating Huangshan District from its economic development
area Such configuration does not comply with the District's development plan. In comparison, the
Section A is located in a narrow area between Huangshan District and Menshan, does not separate
the District with the development area.

The most significant difference between Section E and Section A is the impact on the development
of Huangshan District and the Huangshan Mountains scenic site. Based on the overall comparison
from environmental, socio-economic and engineering aspects, as well as the opinions of the local
governments, both the EA and design teams considered Section A as preferred section and this
conclusion has been accepted by APCD.
6.2.5 Section F
In order to reduce the number of tunnels thus to reduce the cost, Section F is proposed. The
corresponding Section A is located at K177+356-K182+220. Section F is 215 m longer than
Section A. Both options are in similar environments, with slight difference on impact on Machuan
River.

Impact on land occupation
Section F will occupy 36 mu more land than Section A, and higher impact to land uses than
Section A.
Impact on Machuan River
Section F will cross Machuan River twice and run mostly along the river. While Section A will be
aligned through mountains and far way from Machuan River. Therefore, in both construciton and
205



Tongling-Tangkou Highway project EIA
operation phases, Section F will have higher impacts on Machuan River.
Construction safety
There is one more tunnel on Section A than Section F, which is 758 m long. While Section F has
one more bridge than Section A which is 614 m long. In construction, tunnel is difficult to
construct than bridge and will cause more environmental impacts. Furthermore, safety risk is
higher tunnel construction and operation than bridges.

Based on comparison on environmental, socio-economic and engineering aspects, the EA team
considers Section A is the better choice. This conclusion has been accepted by APCD.
6.2.6  Comparison between this IProject and "SI03" Upgrading Plroject
About 20 km section of the Highway, from Yangtian (K 10) to Lingyang (K130), will be built
adjacent to exiting provincial highway S103. For the convenience of discussion and comparison,
the road section on S103 which corresponding to the parallel Highway is called Section G and
upgrading of Section G to the Highway grade can be another option. The difference between
Section G and Section A is:
o   Section G upgrading will occupy the only road in this area, which will result in difficult
access to transportation during construction by local people. More seriously, the upgrading
will result the existing road which is accessible to local residents will become a fully fenced
with only limited and controlled access. The residents in this 20 km section would not have
an effective means for transportation to outside as there is no adequate access in this region
and the Highway is off the limit to many agricultural vehicles.
o   On the both sides of Section G population is densely located. Upgrading involving road
206



Tonglng-Tangkou Highway project EIA
widening would cause more house demolition and resettlement than Section A which is to be
built on a carefully selected alignment, far away from most rural redential areas. . In addition,
most of the people near Section G are working for service sector and getting high income.
The house demolition and resettlement will cause significant impact on the people in terms of
life quality.
*    Section G (an old road upgrading) will occupy less land than Section A (green field project). .
*    Section G will not deteriorate significantly the rural communities and/or wild life habitats.
However, the Highway will cause more severe impact on taking effect than normal road.
Section G and Section A will cause impact at similar magnitude to the wild animals in
Jiuhuashan Mountains.
*    Section G will involve less excavation and spare waste transportation and disposal. It will
also have less impacts to the scenic site..
In summary, there are pros and cons in both options. However Section G will have higher impacts
on community severance and disturbance to the local residents through their sole transportation
road to the outside. Therefore Section A is considered to be preferred option.
6.2.7 With and Without Project Analysis
The existing highway S103 is the only transportation road between Tongling and Tangkou.
However the poor road conditions, such as uncontrolled road occupation, mixing traffic of motor,
non-motor and animal driven vehicles, and outdated service facilities, this road cannot provide
sufficient means for local transportation demand. The comparison of with and without project
scenarios is discussed in Table 6-2-7, which clearly demonstrate the urgent need of the Project.

6D3   Conclusions of Analysis of Alteirnlatives
The following are the main conclusions of the analysis of alternatives:
o    Based on the above analysis, the advantage of "with project" scenario is superior than
"without project". The increased environmental impacts associated with the "with project"
scenario can be mitigated to acceptable levels.
o    Based on the analysis of alternative Highway alignment corridors, Alternative I has the
overall least environmental and socioeconomic impacts and thus is the preferred alternative
alignment. .
o    Based on the analysis of sub-alternative road sections with the Alignment 1, Section A is
preferred in all sub-alternatives, except Section D based on environmental considerations and
least environmental impacts. However, Section A is still selected over Section D due to other
considerations from the APCD, who is willing to adopt all necessary mitigation measures
demanded by the EA team to offset the higher impacts associated with Section D.

Chapter 7 Environmental Management Plan
7.1 Anhui Highway I
The TTH is the second highway project in Anhui province which is funded by World Bank loans. Hefei to
Anyang (Hean) Highway is the first project, i.e., Anhui Highway 1, which is now completed and in trial
operation. During the preparation, construction and current trial operation, substantial environmental
studies, planning and mitigation work has been conducted under guidance of the SEPA, as well as the
World Bank's policies and assistance from the local and World Bank specialists. Through a complete
process of project preparation, design, construction and now operation, APCD and other relevant agencies
and institutions in Anhui province have accumulated substantial experience with environmental planning
and impact mitigation for highway construction. This previous experience with APCD who is also the
project proponent, owner and operator of the TTH, will be capitalized in the TTH environmental
management planning.
During the process of Anhui Highway I preparation and construction, environmental management
organizations have been set up, which is presented in Table 7-1-1.

The environmental management system includes the following elements:
All contractors are requested to prepare and submit to APCD environmental protection plans within
their construction organization design. The contractors are made liable for mitigation and
compensation costs, where applicable, for any damages they made to the environment during
construction activities.
*   According to the project EA recommendation, APCD engaged Anhui Provincial Environmental
Monitoring Center to conduct periodical monitoring;
*   The Project Construction Commanding Office has an environmental team which, together with the
site construction supervision companies conducted periodical supervision and included the
mitigation measure implementation performance into the overall contractor evaluation system.
With the above environmental management system, the Anhui highway I construction has completed
smoothly without major environmental incidents or major public complaints This project experience
shows that the above environmental organizations and system are effective in highway construction and
similar system will be adopted in this TTH project to ensure effective mitigation implementation and
environmental performance in the construction and operation of the TTH.

7.5.1   Objectives
Environmental monitoring is a critical part of the environmental management plan for the TTH,
both for the construction and operation phases. The objectives of the environmental monitoring
plan are to:
o    Verify the results of the Project EIA with regard to potential environmental impacts of the
Project;
o    Determine the actual impact levels;
o    Verify the effectiveness and adequacy of environmental mitigation measures;
o    Identify and assess the extent of any expected adverse impacts; and
o    Provide a basis for additional mitigation measures to address the expected impacts or impacts
exceeded the original predicted levels by the Project EA.

7.5.2 Responsible Institutions
Anhui Provincial Environmental Monitoring Station will be engaged to conduct the environmental
monitoring program. The Monitoring Station, which is a subsidiary of the provincial EPB, has
carried out environmental monitoring programs for the World Bank financed Anhui Highway I
construction. As such the Station is very experienced with environmental monitoring requirements
by SEPA and the World Bank, as well as well equipped with necessary equipment, instruments,
special vehicles and more importantly experienced environmental monitoring and chemical
analysis specialists. The proposed highway environmental monitoring will be provided by the
Monitoring Station.
7.5.3 Monitoring Program
Anhui Provincial Environmental Monitoring Station will carry out the sampling, preservation, and
analysis with the methods in accordance with relevant guidelines and standards issued by SEPA.
The responsible organization for the monitoring program in design and construction phases will be
the World Bank Financed Project Office of the Anhui Provincial Communications Department,
which is the executing agency of the Project. The Anhui Highway Administration Bureau is
responsible for monitoring in operation phase.
The monitoring program will cover noise, water quality, and ambient air quality and extend to
both the construction and operation phases. Details of the program, including time, frequency,
locations, and parameters are presented in Tables 7-5-1 to 7-5-3.

In addition to the formal monitoring by specialists from the professional monitoring institution
which may be used as a legal records of environmental performance at the construction sites for
compliance purposes, routine monitoring by contractors and construction supervision companies
will be conducted on a daily basis. The monitoring parameters and methods will include:
o   Noise at all construction machine side and sensitive receptors, to be measured by potable
noise meters;
o   Air bome dust at temporary access roads, stockpile of powering materials, disturbed soil, and
hauling trucks, to be measured through visual observations; and
o   Water quality up and downstream of bridge construction sites, rivers, creeks, irrigation
channels, lakes, and fish ponds which receiving discharges and surface runoff from the
construction sites and construction camps, to be measured through visual observations.
One of the major lessons leamt from environmental management of other expressway projects
which are also financed by the World Bank is that the contractors and construction supervision
must also be held accountable for environmental performance and monitoring and such
monitoring will be part of their contractual obligations. Therefore, the contractors and construction
supervision companies will be requested to report their daily measurements and observations for
environmental performance to WBFPMO on a monthly basis. They will be further requested to
report immediately any unexpected environmental pollution or impacts so that WBFPMO and/or
contractors can take appropriate actions to mitigate, including additional monitoring by the
professional monitoring station. All these requirements will be included in the bid documents so
that the contractor and construction supervision are aware of the requirements when they bid and
meets the requirements during construction as part of the contract requirements. APCD and other
environmental management and supervisory organizations can hold the contractors liable will they
not comply with the monitoring requirements.
Dedicated staff from every civil work contractors and every construction supervision companies
will be trained prior to the commencement of the construction to conduct the monitoring and
reporting. WBFPMO and its consultants will review the monthly reports and will visit the sites to
inspect the daily monitoring work. All the monitoring and reporting requirements will be included
in the contractors and construction supervision companies bid documents and later in their
contracts so that the requirements will be part of contractual obligations.

7.5.4 Monitoring Reports
The results of the monitoring program will be included in formal written reports twice a year and
submitted for review by WBFPMO (or provincial road administration bureau in the operation
phase) and its consultants, SEPA, EPO of MOC, provincial EPB and the World Bank. These
reports will be the basis for evaluation of site environmental performance and for developing
additional mitigation measures for impacts exceeded applicable standards.
The monitoring reporting system is outlined in Figure 7-2.

7.5.5 Estimated Monitoring Cost
The estimated cost for the monitoring program by PEMS in the construction phase is  RMB
150,000/a X 4 years = RMB600,000 And the estimated cost in the operation phase
is :RMB400,000X3 years=RMB 1,200,000. The operation phase monitoring will be conducted
for the first years of the operation, to determine the environmental performance and verify the
environmental impact prediction. Following the first three years, the monitoring program will be
revised and may become less intensive depending on the results of the first three years operation.
221



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EIA
In addition, a contingency of RMB80,000 is planned for the construction phase for any
unexpected need for additional monitoring work.
The cost for daily monitoring to be carried out by contractor and supervisor will be included in
contract price.
7.6   PersonneR llTragiming
The success of environmental management for the Project relies on the knowledge, and experience
of the personnel involved in environmental management. As contemporary methodologies and
approach towards environmental management for expressway construction and operation are still
relatively new to the Anhui agencies involved including the yet to be established hgihway
operation company for operation, personnel training, both abroad and at home will be needed. The
overseas training will take place at countries with well-established environmental management
systems for capital projects and expressway operations. The domestic training will be conducted
by environmental experts from universities, environmental institutions and professional
consultants. The overseas training will also be regarded as training of the trainers and personnel
who are involved in the overseas training will conduct training in domestic training program.
As a lesson learnt from the previous Bank financed projects, contractors and construction
supervision must be involved in self monitoring Even though such monitoring may not be
completely objective, it is nevertheless a permanent presence at the site, serves as a good reminder
of the environmental requirements, and allows better supervision by the environmental
management and supervision organizations. In order for contractors and supervision to conduct
the monitoring, the personnel training must include a training of contractor and supervision staff
and their senior management.
The details of the personnel training program is presented in Table 7-6-1.

Chapter 8 Public Participation
The proposed Project will stimulate the local economy and enhance the poverty relief through the
dramatic increase of the flow of people, goods and information. On the other hand, however, as in
any large-scale infrastructure project, the Project will disturb the daily live of people along the
route, including demolition and resettlement, road blocking, disturbance of agricultural activities
etc. during the construction phase and noise, air emission, community severance, etc. during the
operation. The Project proponent is highly concerned of the impacts to the public and the opinions
of the public. During the Project development, the EA has widely consulted with the public
through various means and this Chapter summarizes the public consultation process and public
opinions on the Project.
8.1 Methodology
8.1.1 Timing
Two rounds of public consultation have been undertaken in an organized manner:
*   Following the completion of the draft TOR, the EA team conducted the first round of public
participation, from April 5 to April 29, 2002, to introduce the project to the potentially
affected public and seek their initial responses, their general concerns and their demands for
detailed impacts analysis;
*   During the preparation of draft EA report. The second round of public participation was
carried out from June 17, 2002 to July 5, 2002 to present results of impact assessment and the
proposed mitigation measures to the public.
In addition, a dedicated hotline has been set up throughout the Project preparation period, for the
stakeholders as well as the general public to express their concerns. The information received
through the hotline has been recorded and incorporated in the EA and Project design process
where appropriate.
8.1.2 Stakeholders
The stakeholders which have been consulted during the public consultation process are:
*   Non-government organizations (NGOs), including primarily local people's congress, political
consultative committees and local associations;
*   People to be affected by the Project construction and operation, directly or indirectly,
including those involved in land acquisition, house demolition and resettlement and others
who live on the both sides of the proposed Highway as well as in areas to be indirectly
impacted by the Project; and
*   Various relevant government agencies, local governments and administrative organizations
(e.g., for the scenic zones) along the Project area.
225



Tonglng-Tangkou highway project EIA
8.1.3 Appiroach
The approaches to public consultation include public meetings, site visits, questionnaire surveys,
personal interviews, group discussion and opinion soliciting letters.
o   Public meeting: The EA team usually first informed the mayors of the villagers about the
timing, location, content and who will participate in advance and in turn the mayors made
necessary notices to the villagers one by one.
o   Personal interview and site visit: The EA team visited the villages affected and carry
interviews with the affected villagers for their concerns and opinions.
o   Questionnaire surveys: To expend the coverage of public consultation, questionnaires were
distributed among more villages along the proposed route. In addition, tourists to Huangshan
Mountain scenic have also been distributed with questionnaires.
o   Letters have been sent to specific agencies and administrative organizations to solicit their
opinions on the potential impacts of the Project within their jurisdictions and their
suggestions for mitigation.
o   Government meetings: To meet with key government agencies such as Tourism Bureau and
Forest Bureau, local governments whose jurisdictions covering the project area such as
township governments, and administrative authorities for the scenic sites.
In total, there were total 6 public meetings, 18 group discussions, 60 personal interviews, 1687
copies of questionnaires. There were a total of 2348 people participated in the public consultation
process.
8.2   Summary and Anallysis of iFindiungs from Public Participation
8.2.1  Summairy of findings firom public meetings
Six typical villages have been selected for public meetings, based on their locations (relatively
evenly distributed along the alignment), size, and degree of potential impact. The detailed
locations of these selected villages are shown in Figure 8-1.
In the public meetings, the relationship between the villages and the project, as well as potential
impact were introduced in an easily understandable language. The villagers expressed their
concerns as follows based on the drawings and information presented to them:
l[mpact on agricultural cultivation and daily work:
o   The highway will cross water ponds (for example, the pond at Panlong Group at
K84+100and the pond at Yuhe Village at K163+550). The ponds are the major water source
for irrigation to these villages and thus, filling or severance of the ponds would affect
agricultural cultivation.
o   A common concern (especially expressed in Xinzhong, Yuhe, Paixin and Fenshi Villages
which will be divided by the highway significantly) is whether the locations of pedestrian and
226



Tongling-Tangkou highway project EIA
agricultural vehicles pathways and culverts are properly located so that their outings and
daily work would not be significantly affected.
Concerns on the alignment of the road:
The villagers of Fenshi Village ask for redesign of the alignment section near their village
because the original alignment would result in large occupation of cultivated land and house
demolition. The villagers demanded the route be diverted to the west, passing through the
hills behind the village.
Noise impact:
*   In general, the villagers believe the noise would not affect their daily life significantly.
However, villages (e.g., Fenshi Village) which are located between the existing road and the
proposed highway, noise is a concern and the villagers demanded effective noise mitigation
measures.
Land acquisition and demolition:
An overriding concern of the villagers is on land acquisition and house demolition. Villagers
are widely concerned about insufficient compensation. The villagers further expressed their
hope to appropriately schedule house demolition activities so that they won't occur during
busy agricultural seasons.
Concerns in construction phase:
*   The villagers concern about the potential damage to the existing irrigation system and the
wastewater which could be discharged to farmland.
*   The access to the existing roads in the project would be affected, particularly the project sites
which intersect with the roads.
*   The construction activities particularly irresponsible construction activities would affect the
villagers.
8.2.2 Summary of Questionnaire Survey
The questionnaires have been designed for a survey of the potentially affected people along the
proposed route and for tourists of Huangshan Mountain respectively. In total, 1687 copies of the
questionnaire have been distributed and 1684 completed copies returned, with a response rate of
99.8%.
Questionnaire for the affected people along the proposed route
A total of 1587 copies of questionnaire have been distributed to the affected people along the route.
The gender ratio of the affected people received the questionnaire is 59:41 (male to female), the
ages of the people surveyed is from 28-63, the average members of family is 3-5, the average
cultivated land per capita is I mu (15 mu equal to I hectare), and the average annual income per
people is ranged from RMB500-3000. The people are largely dependent on farming with the
227

According to the above tables, most of the surveyed people support this project (90%), with the
consideration of significant economic and transportation benefits. Only 6.9% of the surveyed
people do not support this project for deep concerns of potential adverse impact. In summary,
this project is consistent with the interest of the majority of the people.
In terms of impact in the construction phase, the major concern of most people is about noise
from construction equipment and air-borne dust. In addition 41% of the people think the
potential soil erosion and temporary land occupation would significantly affect agricultural
activities.
In terms of impact in the operation phase, nearly half of the people surveyed believe the most
significant environmental impact will be vehicle noise. About 66.9% of the people think the
land occupation would significantly reduce the agricultural yield, and; nearly 70% of the people
think the road would affect their daily work and life.
For the proposed mitigation measures, most of the people (75.9%) think greening is the best way
for environmental protection.
Statistics for survey on tourists of Huangshan Mountain
A total of 100 copies of questionnaires were randomly distributed to tourists in Huangshan
Scenic site, with 80 to domestic tourists and 20 to foreign tourists. In total, 97 questionnaires
have been returned. The statistics of the questionnaires findings are in Table 8-2-2.

It is clear from the above table that 85.7% of the tourists think the transportation conditions
leading to Huangshan is not good. 81.4% of the tourists want a road straight to Huangshan
Mountain It Most tourists feel that the protection of Huanshan Mountain and good transportation
is equally important., and both can be achieved if proper protective measures are taken. More than
half of the tourists don't mind to see an highway winding through the mountain. Only 8.2% of the
tourists think the highway would be detrimental to the overall landscape and scenic view.
8.2.3 Summary of site visit
The project team has conducted personal interviews with various stakeholders during site visit,
especially focusing on villagers, people to be resettled, teachers, rangers of natural reserve and
showplaces. A total of 60 people were interviewed during this process:
I) Gao Changbao, a resident of Malong Group of Xinzhong Village, Hu Nansheng, from
oujiachong of Yuhe Village, and Lin Naxin from Pingtang Group of Yangmei Village have
expressed concern the effects of the highway to their outings.
2) Wu Lianggui, 60 years old, lonely old resident from Shangyuan Village and currently lives in
a very poor condition, expressed concern about the difficulty of resettlement.
3) Zhu Changgen, 50 years old, living on land cultivation and forest. The proposed road will
occupy most of his land, affecting his life significantly. He asked for redesign of the road that
would cross his land via a fly-over, or minimize the land occupation. Otherwise, he hopes that
the local government could allocate necessary production materials to him.
4) The teachers of Xinzhong Village and Dongpu Village are concerned about the noise from
both phases of construction and operation which is likely affect the students. In addition, there
is a potential risk to the safety of students since then proposed road is very close to school.
They asks for scheduling of the construction activities during the school vacations.
5) Management staff from Jiuhuashan Scenic site has expressed a strong support to this project,
on the ground that it would significantly promote the tourism and the natural landscape will
not be impacted.
6) Management staff of Taiping Lake Scenic site also support the project, but recommends the
mitigation measures be taken during the construction phase in order to minimize the impact
on tourism. The proposed bridge would be designed based on the coordinated consideration
with the existing bridge and the two bridge will become a new artificial landscape.
7) Management staff from Huangshan Showplace think the proposed project will promote
tourism, but are still concerned about the proposed Shancha fly-over to accelerate the
urbanization of Shancha Village and stimulate the unplanned development which would affect
the peripheral landscape.
8) Zhang Yong, the director the protection station for Shilishan Natural Reserve, thinks the
proposed highway would not affect the reserve, since it is far away from the reserve and cross
the area via tunnel. But he recommends that the timing of explosion operation be scheduled to
avoid the active time of wild animals (in dusk).
9) The rangers of Shibasuo Natural Reserve think the reserve would not be impacted since the
proposed road is quite far away.

8.2.4  Summary of Consultation with Goverrnment Ageneies
In total, eight township govermnents, seven township People's Congress, one Tourist Bureau
(Huanghua city), three Forest Bureaus (Tongling, Qingyang and Huangshan), two natural reserve
administrative authorities, and three scenic site administrative authorities have been consulted as
part of the public consultation process. The main approach with the government agencies
consultation includes personnel interviews (with key management staff) and group discussion.
The main government concerns raised during the consultation process may be summarized as
follows:
o   The project proponent will prepare sufficient funds for compensation of land acquired and
resettlement;
o   The pathways will be reasonably located to minimize the impacts of community severance;
o   Concerned about soil erosion during construction in the raining season;
o   Wondering whether there will be local roads near the Highway to provide outing convenience
and real benefit to local transportation
o   Hope to see more landscaping along the Highway;
o   Highway and bridge designs shall be harmonized with the surrounding environment,
especially in the scenic areas;
o   Any occupation of forest land shall apply to forest authority first and go through appropriate
review and appropriate procedures.
8.3   Co(nclusion of IPUblic IParticipation
From the public opinions collected by the project team, it is obvious that most of the people
surveyed strongly support the project in context of the national interest as well as the local
economic and transportation development. The people living along the proposed alignment do not
seem to be overly concerned of the change of water, acoustic and air environment due to the
project since the existing environment is very good and has the assimilative capacity. However the
daily life of the people will be significantly affected through community severance. Therefore the
location of the proposed under- and over passes will be critical in order to minimize the impact on
the daily work, farmland irrigation and children going to school.
8.4   Response to Public Opinions
8.4.1  Responses to opinions arising from the public meetings and questionnaire
Land acquisition and resettlement:
A resettlement group has been mobilized by APCD for site visit and investigation in the villages
involved in land acquisition and resettlement. The resettlement action plan (RAP) will be prepared
based on the relevant national policy and local regulations and the local specific conditions. The
concerns of adequate compensation to the affected, including the disadvantaged groups, will be
234



Tongling-Tangkou highway project EIA
fully and appropriately addressed in the RAP.
Community severance:
There will be three interchanges, 156 grade separate pathways for vehicle or people and 12
pedestrian overpasses. On average, there will be a pathway across the highway every 680 m and
each village will have 3.7 pathways. On the project drawings, a pathway on the major corridor of
each village are included in the design. It is therefore expected that the daily life, outings and
agricultural activities of villagers would not be affected significantly. The remotely located
villagers, i.e., those who are not located in the major village sites may be more affected as most
pathways are designed to be located close to the main bodies of the villages.
Farmland irrigation:
Care will be taken during to the design to avoid interruption to or disturbance of the hydraulic
facilities along the road. There will be 95 bridges and 304 culverts along the highway to ensure the
availability of water source for irrigation and drainage from the farmland. Any ponds occupied by
the project, if cannot be avoided, will be replaced by constructing new ones with equal size and
quantity of water supplies to minimize the impacts of the pond occupation.
Noise:
During the phase of construction, the noise construction activities would be scheduled to take
place only during the day time not the night time.
During the phase of operation, a series of mitigation measures will be taken, such as greening,
installation of acoustic insulation barriers and insulation windows. (for details please refer to
Mitigation Measures against Acoustic Environmental Impact)
Issues in construction phase:
The implementation schedule will extend over four years. Therefore even the minor impact during
the construction phase would become significant. The EA team has developed the following
measures to the contractors:
*   The contractor will be requested to sign an environment safeguard contract at the same the
main construction contract is signed.
*   The temporary road will be constructed in advance at the intersection with the existing roads.
*   The side ditch will be constructed to divert the wastewater from farmland nearby.
*   Construction activities will be scheduled in vacation time of school where the construction
activity is close to school. The fencing around the construction site will be set up with
warning signs.
8.4.2 Response to concerns from personal interview

Tongling-Tangkou highway project EIA
o   Additional pedestrian paths will be constructed at Malong Group and Pingtan Village. The
house of Hu Nansheng, from Oujiachong village, which is located on the paths, will be
demolished (already reached agreement with him) and relocated.
o   The old resident Jiangjia village will receive special care during the preparation of the
resettlement plan. He will be arranged to move in a seniors house once it is built in the future.
O   Sufficient compensation will be delivered promptly according to the related policies.
Farmland will be re-allocated under the coordination of the local governments.
o   Based upon noise forecast, the noise level at Xinzhong Village Primary School and Dongpu
Primary School would exceed the limit by 5 dB(A). The mitigation measures have been
designed including greening and increase of the height of school perimeter walls. Section
1.4.1 of this chapter includes the solutions to the noise and safety issues.
o   The mitigation measures developed in the sections for assessment of landscape and cultural
heritage cover the response to the opinions from rangers of Huangshan mountain and Taiping
lake scenic sites
o   The mitigation measures developed for the construction phase in the section for ecosystem
assessment cover the response to the opinions for Shiliashan Natural Reserve.

8.6 Information Disclosure
According to OP4.01, The project information will be disclosed to the public in a timely manner
throughout the EA process. The EA team has complied with this requirement.
At the first round of public participation, project information has been distributed to the people
along the proposed project, including the brief introduction of the project, concept for project
development, and the proposed alignment (see the annex). Meanwhile, the potential impact has
been presented to the people to be affected.
In addition, in order to distribute the project information to the broader public, the TOR
documents have been placed in public libraries of Qingyang County, Huangshan District and
Hefei City for easy access and review by the public. The project information also is presented
through TV, radio broadcast and computer network (see Table 8-6-1 and the annex for more
details).
In addition, the EA plans to further release the final draft of EA report and EMP in Anhui
provincial public library in Hefei, the public libraries in the counties/district along the Highway
and town/village halls in selected large townships and villages. Following the placement of these
documents in these libraries, an advertisement will be place in major local newspapers again to
inform the public of availability of these documents in these libraries/town halls for public access
and review.
To obtain further public input, particularly to the incorporation of mitigation measures in the
revised EA reports including those raised through public consultation, PMO has sent the final draft
237



Tongling-Tangkou highway project EIA
report to Qingyang county library, Huangshan district library for public review. The period of
report display is from November 30, 2002 to December 30, 2002. At the same time, the local
public broadcast systems will announce the availability, location and time of display of the EA
report in November 28-29, 2002. Considering the inconvenient access from some of the remote
places, EA summary has sent to Panlong, Hongshan, Dongbao, Fenshi, Yangmei, Sankou and
Shancha villages along the TTH, which includes the main conclusions of the impact assessment
during construction and operation phases, as well as mitigation measures and environmental
management plans.

Chapter 9 Conclusions
9.1 Alignment Selection
The Tongling to Tangkou Highway (TTH) was first included in Anhui provincial highway
construction plan in late 1990's. The TTH is an important north-south highway in Anhui, the key
transportation corridor in Wannan (south Anhui), as well as a component in the national trunk road
network. The TTH complies well with the master plan of the country in expressway construction
and the general framework for Anhui Provincial highway network.
From Tongling to Huangshan Mountain or Tangkou (north to south), four different transportation
corridors have been proposed and compared in the process to determine the optimal alignment
alternative. Following a detailed comparison and analysis of environmental and socio-economic
factors, the corridor which in most part goes within the same transportation corridor as the existing
highway S103. The selection is made based on the major considerations on the ecosystem of the
corridor area. As valley areas near S103 are relatively well built up with villages, townships and
cultivated land, natural ecosystem has mostly altered. The additional of the TTH into this corridor
is not likely to have significant impacts to the natural ecosystem. Furthermore, due to the
relatively high population living in the same corridor, the TTH construction will benefit more
people than the other corridor alternatives being evaluated. In summary, among the four
alternatives, the preferred alternative has the least potential damage to the natural ecosystem,
highest promotion for economic development and thus most reasonable and appropriate
alignment.
9.2 Environmental Baseline
The baseline environmental conditions and quality may be summarized and concluded as follows.
*   The project impacted area enjoys in general a quality ecosystem. In part of the TTH
alignment, there exists still well preserved natural ecosystem with abundant species of
various lives. However, there is no state protected species within the environmental
assessment (EA) covered areas or state protected wild life natural habitats during the EA's
investigation. It is possible however, that some state protected wild life may appear in the EA
covered areas.
*   Except a few villages which are affected by noise from S103, noise levels in most villages
and schools along the proposed TTH alignment can meet the Category I standards in the
Urban Area Environmental Noise Standards. The acoustic environment is therefore of a good
quality in general.
*   The surface water quality along the TTH alignment is good, in compliance with Category 11
and Category III water quality standards in the Surface Water Quality.
*   The ambient air quality in the EA covered is good. In those sections near scenic sites have
reached Class I standards and reminder sections can meet Class 11 standards in
Environmental Air Quality Standards.
239



Tonglng-Tangkou highway project EIA
o   There are extremely abundant tourism resources along the TTH alignment, including the
world renowned Huangshan Mountain scenic site, Buddhist holy mountain Jiuhuashan
Mountain and Taiping Lake scenic site.
o   Following a field survey, seven cultural relics sites have been identified. After the alignment
modifications, the TTH will by pass all but one cultural relics sits.
9.3   Environmental Impacts
9.3.1  Construction Phase limpacts and Mitigation
Main potential environmental impacts and corresponding mitigation measures are:
o   Borrow pits and spoiled materials disposal sites could cause soil erosion. Temporary
preventive measures including interception ditches, earth retaining walls, settling ponds,
slope pavement, etc. will be taken to minimize the erosion.
o   Temporary facilities occupy lands and damage surface vegetation. This impact is however
reversible and the site can be restored following well planned landscape at the end of the
construction.
o   Explosion, machinery vibration and noise, construction vehicle noise and tailpipe emission
will affect the birds and possibly other wild life. To mitigate the impacts, low noise
machinery will be selected and noise and vibrating operations will be carefully scheduled and
managed to reduce the impacts to the wild life to minimum.
o   The construction machinery noise at certain villages, schools and seniors houses which are
very close to the construction sites and have no barriers in between will exceed applicable
standards. The mitigation measures will include using low noise machinery, temporary noise
barriers, appropriately locating noise machinery and properly scheduling noise construction
activities.
o   With the use of effective mitigation measures such as settling ponds for surface runoff and
septic tanks for wastewater from construction camps, surface water quality is not expected to
be significantly affected by construction activities.
o   Air quality will be mainly affected by airborne dust and emissions from concrete mixing and
asphalt plants. The mitigation measures will include watering dusting sites several times a
day, using centralized mixing and asphalt plants which are carefully located and equipped
with emission control facilities.
o   Construction activities will have significant impacts to traffic on S103 which is the main, and
in most part, the sole transportation road linking the project area with outside. As mitigation,
the contractors will be requested to avoid peak traffic time on S103. When intersection with
S103 is to be constructed, contractors will be requested to consult the local traffic
management authority first to appropriately arrange construction schedule as well as
temporary construction site traffic plan.
o   Construction activities close to villages and schools will pose safety risks to local residents
particularly children. Safety warning boards will be erected at key locations and education
240



Tonghng-Tangkou highway project EIA
programs will be initiated during construction. Before any explosion operation, local
residents will be noticed well in advance.
The TTH will pass seven cultural relics sites which are of low cultural relics values, however.
As a mitigation, all cultural relics sites will be undertaken protective exvation. The TTH
construction may commence only after the protective excavation of cultural relics sites along
the highway is complete. Contractors will be trained to handle any chance finds of ancient
textile, coins, utensil, bricks, metals or other items are found during construction. The
construction activities will halt and local cultural relics authority will be noticed.
Construction may resume only after agreed by the cultural relics authority.
*   Due to the increased outside population for highway construction, certain epidemic diseases
includes AIDS may pose a certain risk to local population. The minimize the risk, education
programs will be launched for both the contractors and local residents.
Construction will pose visual impacts to Huangshan Mountain and Taiping Lake scenic sites.
As mitigation, heavy construction activities will be scheduled at the low tourist season to the
extent possible. Construction camps and sites will be requested to use temporary
fences/walls.
9.3.2 Operation Phase Impacts and Mitigation
Main potential impacts and their mitigation measures during the operation phase are:
Ecosystem impacts:
As most part of the highway will be built in areas with a long history of human activities, this
project will mostly cause the existing ecosystem more fragmented. Part of the TTH (Yangmei
village, Shilishan Mountain and Huangshan Mountain side) however will go through rather
integrated ecosystem resulting in severance and fragmentation of these ecosystem. This project
will not reduce bio-diversity through species extinction. The impact to bio-diversity is mainly
fragmentation of ecosystem which possibly causes reduced activity area of certain wildlife species
and possibly wildlife re-grouping. As mitigation, animal passage ways will be built in key
locations to re-connect their activity area; but such impacts cannot be eliminated completely even
with the mitigation measures.
Noise:
Operation of the TTH will deteriorate the noise environment along the highway. In several
sensitive receptors, noise levels are projected to exceed applicable standards. As mitigation, brick
walls for the rural houses, double glazed windows for schools and hospitals, landscaping,
relocation, etc. will be implemented to reduce the noises to below the applicable standards.
Water:
Domestic wastewater from one service area and two car washing operation will be discharged
only after the treatment during the highway operation. Car washing effluent will go through
241



Tongling-Tangkou highway project EIA
oil-water separators and sand filter before recycled for green irrigation. Sewage from service area
will be subject to secondary (biological) treatment and meet the Class 11 standards in the
Integrated Wastewater Discharge Standards. Sewage at the car washing operations will first go
through septic tank. The accumulated waste in the septic tanks will be removed periodically. With
these measures, the impacts to water quality is not expected to be significant.
Tourism resources:
The potential impacts to tourism resources are both positive and negative. The TTH construction
greatly improve the transportation conditions in the area which will boost local tourist industry.
On the other hand however, the increased tourists will cause high pressure to the scenic sites, both
in terms of their service capacity and pollution control capacity. Increased solid waste, wastewater,
air emission from increased motor vehicle traffic, if not appropriately handled will cause
environmental pollution. At the three major scenic site along the highway, a major environmental
upgrading program funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is being implemented which
will upgrade environmental control and waste disposal facilities in light of the upcoming increase
in the tourist volumes to these sites. These additional waste management facilities will mitigate
potential adverse impacts brought by the increased tourists to the minimum.
Visual impacts at the scenic sites:
There are abundant tourism resources in the project area with very beautiful scenes. The
construction of the TTH will affect the view at the scenic sites. As a mitigation, the designers will
be requested to site and design the highway so that it could harmonize to the maximum extent
possible with its surrounding environment.
Local economy impacts:
Although the highway will occupy land, relocate houses and disturb the life of some of the local
residents, the operation of the highway will greatly increase the transportation capacity of the
region, reduce transportation time and increase efficiency, reduce traffic accidents, increase
employment opportunities, improve investment environment, and speed up the movement of
people, goods and information. All of these will help promote the development of local economy.
9.3.3  Public Consultation
Two rounds of public consultation have been conducted during project EA, one at the EA TOR
stage and the other at the draft EA report stage. The public consultation covered directly affected
local residents, local governments, non-government organizations and randomly selected tourists
visiting Huangshan Mountaion at the time of consultation. The public consultation used effective
methods including public meetings, questionnaire surveys, key personnel interviews and small
group discussion. Important information, such as EA TOR, draft EA report, public consultation
programs etc. have been released to the public through key local media.
242



Tongling-Tangkou highway project EIA
The public opinions have been overwhelmingly supportive to the construction of this highway,
citing its important role in promote local economic development and tourism, as well as
convenience to local farmers for movement of people and agricultural produces. The issues with
the most concerns from the affected public include land occupation, resettlement compensation
standards, community severance and disruption to irrigation systems, and how these issues can be
mitigated.
9.3.4 Environmental Management
An environmental management plan has been developed to address environmental concerns and
potential problems. Environmental management responsibilities have been clearly determined and
assigned specifically to relevant government organizations, project proponent and other parties
involved in the project construction and/or operation.
A detailed environmental monitoring plan is developed covering both the construction and
operation phases. The monitoring plan is to confirm the results of environmental impacts
assessment and identify new environmental issues and public concern in a prompt manner so that
additional mitigation measures may be formulated to address these new issues. The monitoring
plan will also to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation measures to be taken in
construction and operation phases respectively.
The environmental management plan includes other components such as institutional
strengthening, personnel training, reporting and response and environmental management and
impacts mitigation budgeting.
9.4 General Conclusions
The proposed TTH will greatly improve the transportation conditions in the south Anhui areas,
help promoting economic development and tourism in the regions, as well as service as a major
component in the Anhui provincial and national highway network. The construction and operation
of the TTH will bring certain adverse impacts to the natural and socio-economic environments.
However, with appropriate mitigation measures and an effective environmental management plan,
the adverse impacts can be avoided, reduced to the minimum levels or otherwise compensated. In
general, the EA team considers the construction and operation of the TTH acceptable from the
environmental perspective.
