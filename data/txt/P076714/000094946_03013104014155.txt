Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Project Background
The proposed Tongling-Tangkou Highway Project (the TTH or the Project) is located in the Wannan
(south Anhui) mountainous and economically disadvantaged region in Anhui Province, P. R. China.
The TTH is roughly oriented from north to south, starting from Tongling at the south bank of the
Yangtze River and ending at Shacha village in Tangkou at the foot of the Huangshan Mountain. The
entire highway region is within a region bordered by east longitude 117°46'to 118017' and north
latitude 30052' to 30°05'. The TTH will go through Tongling county of Tongling city, Qingyang and
Shitai counties of Chizhou city and Huangshan district of Huangshan city, as shown in Figure I -I for
detailed location. The construction and operation of the TTH is expected to greatly improve the
transportation network in the Wannan region, accelerate the economic development in the poverty
region and promote the tourism of Anhui Province.
The THH of trend is shown in Figure 1-2, The total length of the TTH is 116.146 km, with tow
connecting roads totaling 5.15 km. The main highway is four lanes with controlled access
expressway with design speed of 80-100 km/hr. Along the highway, there are six interchanges, 16
flyovers, 283 culverts, 34 paths, 139 pedestrian/machine underpasses, 11 overpasses, 13
extra-large/elevated viaducts, and 53 large and medium bridges. The connection roads will be built
with Grade 2 standards.
The Environmental Assessment (EA) is an important part of the project preparation process, in order
to predict potential impacts to social and natural environments and the prepare plan to mitigate the
impacts. This Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared as part of the EA. During
the high planning and EA process, several corridor alternatives and sectional alternatives have been
considered for the highway, and a preferred alignment is finally selected, and accepted by Anhui
Provincial Communication Department (APCD), the highway proponent, based on the least
environmental impacts as well as considerations in engineering, cost and other factors. This EMP has
been prepared for this preferred alignment.

1.4 Environmental Management Plan Components
The EMP will consist mainly of the following components:
*   Environmental management organizations which will be responsible for organizing and
implementing the various mitigation measures and other environmental management
programs;
*   Environmental mitigation measures, which are a series of specific measures developed on
the basis of the understanding of future impacts of the highway construction and
operation. The Mitigation measures are designed to mitigate these potential impacts to
acceptable levels which are essentially defined by applicable standards where
appropriate;
*   Environmental supervision programs are prepared to supervise the mitigation measures
implementation and overall environmental performance of the highway construction and
operation; and
*   Environmental monitoring program will provide a periodical monitoring provide the
specific data indicating the actual levels of the impacts, which will be an important tool
for environmental supervision and management.

Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
The detailed impacts assessment has had the following main findings.
Alignment Selection
The TTH was first included in Anhui provincial highway construction plan in late 1990's. The
TTH is an important north-south highway in Anhui, the key transportation corridor in Wannan
(south Anhui), as well as a component in the national trunk road network. The TTH complies
well with the master plan of the country in expressway construction and the general
framework for Anhui Provincial highway network.
From Tongling to Huangshan Mountain or Tangkou (north to south), four different
transportation corridors have been proposed and compared in the process to determine the
optimal alignment alternative. Following a detailed comparison and analysis of environmental
and socio-economic factors, the corridor which in most part goes within the same
transportation corridor as the existing highway S103. The selection is made based on the
major considerations on the ecosystem of the corridor area. As valley areas near S103 are
relatively well built up with villages, townships and cultivated land, natural ecosystem has
mostly altered. The additional of the TTH into this corridor is not likely to have significant
impacts to the natural ecosystem. Furthermore, due to the relatively high population living in
the same corridor, the TTH construction will benefit more people than the other corridor
alternatives being evaluated. In summary, among the four alternatives, the preferred
alternative has the least potential damage to the natural ecosystem, highest potential for
economic development and thus most reasonable and appropriate alignment.
Environmental Baseline
The baseline environmental conditions and quality may be summarized and concluded as
follows:
*   The project impacted area enjoys in general a quality ecosystem. In part of the TTH
alignment, there exists still well preserved natural ecosystem with abundant species of
various lives. However, there is no state protected species within the environmental
assessment (EA) covered areas or state protected wild life natural habitats during the
EA's investigation. It is possible however, that some state protected wild life may appear
in the EA covered areas.
*   Except a few villages which are affected by noise from S103, noise levels in most
villages and schools along the proposed TTH alignment can meet the Category I
standards in the Urban Area Environmental Noise Standards. The acoustic environment is
therefore of a good quality in general.
*   The surface water quality along the TTH alignment is good, in compliance with Category
II and Category III water quality standards in the Surface Water Quality.
*   The ambient air quality in the EA covered is good. In those sections near scenic sites
have reached Class I standards and reminder sections can meet Class II standards in
Environmental Air Quality Standards.



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
*   There are abundant tourism resources along the ITH alignment, including the world
renowned Huangshan Mountain scenic site, Buddhist holy mountain Jiuhuashan
Mountain and Taiping Lake scenic site.
*   Following a field survey, seven cultural relics sites have been identified. After the
alignment modifications, the TTH will by pass all but one cultural relics sits.
Major Environmental Impacts
Construction Phase
Main potential environmental impacts and corresponding mitigation measures are:
* Borrow pits and spoiled materials disposal sites could cause soil erosion. Temporary
preventive measures including interception ditches, earth retaining walls, settling ponds,
slope pavement, etc. will be taken to minimize the erosion.
* Temporary facilities occupy lands and damage surface vegetation. This impact is
however reversible and the site can be restored following well planned landscape at the
end of the construction.
* Explosion, machinery vibration and noise, construction vehicle noise and tailpipe
emission will affect the birds and possibly other wild life. To mitigate the impacts, low
noise machinery will be selected and noise and vibrating operations will be carefully
scheduled and managed to reduce the impacts to the wild life to minimum.
* The construction machinery noise at certain villages, schools and seniors houses which
are very close to the construction sites and have no barriers in between will exceed
applicable standards. The mitigation measures will include using low noise machinery,
temporary noise barriers, appropriately locating noise machinery and properly scheduling
noise construction activities.
* With the use of effective mitigation measures such as settling ponds for surface runoff
and septic tanks for wastewater from construction camps, surface water quality is not
expected to be significantly affected by construction activities.
* Air quality will be mainly affected by airborne dust and emissions from concrete mixing
and asphalt plants. The mitigation measures will include watering dusting sites several
times a day, using centralized mixing and asphalt plants which are carefully located and
equipped with emission control facilities.
*   Construction activities will have significant impacts to traffic on S103 which is the main,
and in most part, the sole transportation road linking the project area with outside. As
mitigation, the contractors will be requested to avoid peak traffic time on S103. When
intersection with S103 is to be constructed, contractors will be requested to consult the
local traffic management authority first to appropriately arrange construction schedule as
well as temporary construction site traffic plan.
*   Construction activities close to villages and schools will pose safety risks to local
residents particularly children. Safety warning boards will be erected at key locations and
education programs will be initiated during construction. Before any explosion operation,
12



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
local residents will be noticed well in advance.
*   The TTH, including its two connection roads, will pass nine cultural relics sites which are
of low cultural relics values, however. As mitigation, all cultural relics sites will be
undertaken protective excavation. The TTH construction may commence only after the
protective excavation of cultural relics sites along the highway is complete. Contractors
will be trained to handle any chance finds of ancient textile, coins, utensil, bricks, metals
or other items are found during construction. The construction activities will halt and
local cultural relics authority will be noticed. Construction may resume only after agreed
by the cultural relics authority.
*   Due to the increased outside population for highway construction, certain epidemic
diseases includes AIDS may pose a certain risk to local population. To minimize the risk,
education programs will be launched for both the contractors and local residents.
*   Construction will pose visual impacts to Huangshan Mountain and Taiping Lake scenic
sites. As mitigation, heavy construction activities will be scheduled at the low tourist
season to the extent possible. Construction camps and sites will be requested to use
temporary fences/walls.
Operation Phase
Main potential impacts during the operation phase are:
Ecosystem impacts.
As most part of the highway will be built in areas with a long history of human activities, this
project will mostly cause the existing ecosystem more fragmented. Part of the TTH (Yangmei
village, Shilishan Mountain and Huangshan Mountain side) however will go through rather
integrated ecosystem resulting in severance and fragmentation of these ecosystem. This
project will not reduce bio-diversity through species extinction. The impact to bio-diversity is
mainly fragmentation of ecosystem which possibly causes reduced activity area of certain
wildlife species and possibly wildlife re-grouping.
Noise
Operation of the TTH will deteriorate the noise environment along the highway. In several
sensitive receptors, noise levels are projected to exceed applicable standards. In general, the
impacts to residents are limited and in most of the sensitive receptors, the noise levels will
exceed the noise in the medium (2014) to long (2022) terms. In all except one schools and
seniors houses however, the noise will exceed the standards in the first the highway is in
operation.
Water
Domestic wastewater from one service area and two car washing operation will be discharged
13



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
only after the treatment during the highway operation. Car washing effluent will go through
oil-water separators and sand filter before recycled for green irrigation.
Tourism resources:
The potential impacts to tourism resources are both positive and negative. The TTH
construction greatly improve the transportation conditions in the area which will boost local
tourist industry. On the other hand however, the increased tourists will cause high pressure to
the scenic sites, both in terms of their service capacity and pollution control capacity.
Increased solid waste, wastewater, air emission from increased motor vehicle traffic, if not
appropriately handled will cause environmental pollution. At the three major scenic sites
along the highway, a major environmental upgrading program funded by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) is being implemented which will upgrade environmental control
and waste disposal facilities in light of the upcoming increase in the tourist volumes to these
sites.
Visual impacts at the scenic sites
There are abundant tourism resources in the project area with very beautiful scenes. The
construction of the TTH will affect the view at the scenic sites. Major impacts will be in
mountainous and valley region where highway require special structure such as deep cut and
high fill and elevated viaducts and where the view is more sensitive. Shacha village which is
the end of the TTH located at the foot of the Huangshan mountain, the visual impact will be
most significant.
Local economy impacts:
Although the highway will occupy land, relocate houses and disturb the life of some of the
local residents, the operation of the highway will greatly increase the transportation capacity
of the region, reduce transportation time and increase efficiency, reduce traffic accidents,
increase employment opportunities, improve investment environment, and speed up the
movement of people, goods and information. All of these will help promote the development
of local economy.
Public Consultation
Two rounds of public consultation have been conducted during project EA, one at the EA
TOR stage and the other at the draft EA report stage. The public consultation covered directly
affected local residents, local governments, non-government organizations and randomly
selected tourists visiting Huangshan Mountaion at the time of consultation. The public
consultation used effective methods including public meetings, questionnaire surveys, key
personnel interviews and small group discussion. Important information, such as EA TOR,
draft EA report, public consultation programs etc. have been released to the public through
14



Tongling-Tangkou Highway END
key local media.
The public opinions have been overwhelmingly supportive to the construction of this highway,
citing its important role in promote local economic development and tourism, as well as
convenience to local farmers for movement of people and agricultural produces. The issues
with the most concems from the affected public include land occupation, resettlement
compensation standards, community severance and disruption to irrigation systems, and how
these issues can be mitigated.

Chapter 3 Mitigation Measures
3.1 Feasibility Study Stage
The primary environmental protection work during the TTH feasibility study stage is this
environmental assessment, including a detailed and thorough environmental impacts
assessment and environmental management planning. Since December 2001 when the project
proponent APCD engaged the Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute (SSSRI) for the
EA, the EA team has visited the highway sites several times for field investigation,
environmental baseline monitoring, information collection and two rounds of public
consultation. Back in the office, all collected data have been evaluated and assessed, modeling
work for impacts on noise, air and water quality conducted, mitigation measures designed and
an environmental management plan developed. In addition, the EA team has worked closely
with the APCD and highway design engineers to analyzed and compared different alternative
alignments of the highway and provide recommendations based on the least environmental
impacts.
An environmental impact assessment report is prepared in this stage which summarizes the
main findings of the impact assessment. Also prepared as part of the EA documents are an
Environmental Management Plan (the EMP or this document) and an EA Summary. The EA
is critical to the environmental management, impacts identification, assessment and mitigation,
and assurance that the highway construction and operation be conducted with the least and
acceptable impacts to the social and natural environments.
3.2 Design Stage
The following mitigation measures have been designed for the design stage of the ITH
project.
3.2.1  Mitigation Measures for Ecosystem Impacts
Minimization of land occupation
During the preparation of preliminary design, the planned land occupation will be minimized.
The best effort will be given to the selection of alignment to avoid well cultivated land and
valuable or otherwise sensitive forest. Instead, waste land, shrub, hilly area or dry farmland
will be given the first consideration when it comes to alignment selection and land
occupation.
16



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
During the preparation of construction drawings, the temporary occupation of land will be
largely limited to roadbeds. Sensitive forestland, especially the secondary broad-leave
forestland will be avoided when planning temporary occupation of land. (Distribution of
secondary forest is shown in Figure4-3-3-1 )
When the proposed highway crosses the farmland with high yield, the road bed will be
installed with retaining wall and the excavation width and stockpiling of the spoil will be
minimized.
Use of local tree, shrub and grass in greening
The trees, shrub and grass will be planted at the land permanently occupied. In order to
prevent the intrusion of exotic species, all bare soil resulting from various construction
activities will be landscaped with local species of plants. In the flat area where the population
settlements are dense, the greening and landscaping will be created at the two sides of the
highway to mitigate the potential impact of the project during operation phase.
For the road sections which cross forest, the greening plan will be designed against the forest
background to harmonize with the surrounding environment. Alternatively, the forest edge
landscape will be restored. For the road sections to be greened, it is recommended that only
the plants from local species will be used.
The structure of greening is based on the mixture of arbor, shrub and grass, the mixture of
evergreen tree and deciduous trees, broad-leave trees and coniferous trees. All of the plants to
be used in the road side landscaping must use indigene species.
Greening buffer areas
The lighting from moving motor vehicles and the road lamp could impact animals active at
night. To mitigate this potential impact, dense shrubs will be planted at the both sides of
K138-K160 and K173+500 sections. The shrub wall will be 1.5 m -2 m wide in order to
prevent the light from penetrating through it and into the forest. At the ends of tunnels, dense
buffer belts also will be developed in order not only to prevent adverse impact caused by the
vehicle lighting and noise to wild animals, but to prevent accidental falls of wild animals. The
safety of vehicle and wild animals can be safeguarded at the same time.
Animal paths
At each road section, there will be bridges, tunnels and/or culverts that could also serve as
animal paths/crossings to the other side of the highway (see details in Table 5-2-3-1). There
are 21, 18 and 5 large paths in the outside area of Huangshan Showplace, Shilishan Nature
17



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
Reserve and Yangmei Village, respectively. The EA team recommended the design engineers
to re-design a road section between the film production base (Kl 88) and Shancha village. One
tunnel and three large bridges have been added as a result in the revised design in order to
provide sufficient paths for large animals.
As it may take several years before wild animals can adapt the artificial paths, the natural
vegetation covering the land at the end of tunnel and under bridge will need to be particularly
protected during construction phase. After the construction, the land near paths will be
replanted with local arbor and the signs of human activities will be cleaned up to the highest
extent possible.
Camouflage building
On both sides of the highway especially both ends of the animal paths, spatial greening will
be designed to form a landscape similar to that in the natural background. The piers of
elevated viaducts, bridges and interchanges, spatial greening also will be carried out. At the
same time, several support stands, about 20-30 cm long and 5-15 cm wide, will be installed
on the pier at various height. These supporting stand would help to attract birds and help wild
animals to adapt the new environment as quickly as possible.
3.2.2 Mitigation for Noise Impacts
Mitigation measures for noise impacts focus primarily on sensitive receptors located a long
the highway. The principle is that as some the sensitive receptors are predicted to have noise
levels exceeding the applicable standards, mitigation measures are designed to be taken to
reduce the noise levels to the applicable standards levels. These measures will be included in
the engineering design and bid documents for contractors. Table 3-1 summarizes the measures,
their locations, estimated cost and time when these measures will be implemented and Figure
3-1 shows the locations of sensitive receptors where the mitigation measures are to be taken.

In addition, noise levels in 22 more receptors are predicted to exceed the applicable standards
by 2014. Noise levels will be closely and regularly monitored at these locations during the
operation phase and noise isolation windows will be installed by 2014 to mitigate the impacts.
However since it is about 12 years from now and 6 six years from the time when the 7TH first
opens to traffic, the conditions such as house reconstruction at the village, as well as the cost
of mitigation measures, may change, this is EMP does not include the specifics for those
sensitive receptors. The future monitoring program will help the TTH operator in planning
and designing the specific mitigation and associated costs when the time comes.
3.2.3 Mitigation to Water Environment
The following design provisions will be incorporated into the engineering design of the TTH
as mitigation measures for potential water impacts:
19



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
*   The side ditches of highway will not directly connect with streams, fish ponds and
farmlands to provide certain holding capacity and allow reaction times;
*   Except the Shuiqiaohu extra large bridge, there will be no requirement for in-water
construction for any other bridges in the TTH;
*   Drainage systems will be designed for Lingyang River Bridge, Taiping Lke Bridge,
Yangxi River Bridge, Puxi River Bridge and Machuan River Bridge, to allow collected
road run-off wastewater to be drained into settling/holding tanks near the bridges first.
The settling tanks also could function as a storage and holding facility in case of
accidental spills involving motor vehicles accidents and hazardous materials. Such
facilitiesthere would provide a buffer time to allow emergency measures.
*   Strong guard rails will be installed on Shuiqiao Lake Bridge and Taiping Lake Bridge to
prevent trucks, especially the trucks transporting toxic materials, from falling into the
water in case of a traffic accident.
* Wastewater treatment facilities will be provided to the service station, and two parking
yards. Flow diagrams of the treatment processes are shown in figure below. The
car-washing wastewater which contains oil will be treated with an oil separation process
before flowing into tertiary treatment process for in preparation for re-use. Domestic
wastewater will be treated with a biological treatment process and the effluent will meet
Class 1 standards in the "Integrated Standard for Wastewater Discharge" (GB8978-
1996), before discharging into the environment. The "Quality Standard for Irrigation
Water" (GB5084-92) will be applied for any effluent to be used for irrigation.
I Reused  as   waein3
3.2.4 Mitigation to Air Pollution
The major mitigation measure for air quality during the design stage is to reasonably and
carefully select the locations of borrow pits, disposal sites, and asphalt mixing stations such
that they will avoid the concentrated residential areas or other air quality sensitive receptors.
As a principle, all asphalt mixing plants will be located in sites which is at least 300 m
leeward to the wind direction (dominant direction) from the nearest residential areas. No such
plants will be located within the Taiping Lake and Huangshan mountain scenic sites.
In addition, the garbage collection and storage facilities for the service zones and parking lots
will be given consideration of the odors and will be located away from restaurants and other
20



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EhP
sensitive spots. Wastewater treatment will use the pre-packaged plants which are fully
enclosed with maximum control on odor emission. Areas surrounding such waste disposal
facilties will be well landscaped, with thick buses and tall trees.
3.2.5 Socio-economic Mitigation
Mitigation of Impacts to Scenic Sites
Huanghshan mountain scenic site has a series of environmental programs being or already
planned. These programs will be reviewed and implemented prior to the TTH is open for
traffic. Although they are not part of this project, the implementation of these programs are
directly relevant to the mitigation of the TTH induced impacts to Huangshan mountain. In fact
because of these existing programs, this Project does not have to have similar ones as
mitigation. The main such programs include:
* For the total of 600,000 t/y of domestic wastewater generated within the scenic site, the
management authority has invested RMB13 million since 1989 in 15 treatment facilities.
As a result, about 90% of the wastewater is treated and discharged within the applicable
standards;
*   The management authority has invested a total of RMB6 million since 1991 to renovate
22 public toilets within the tourist areas of the scenic site. The current facilities are
adequate for the demands of 20,000 tourists per day.
*   The management authority has invested a total of RMB8 million since 1985 to set up five
municipal solid waste disposal facilities and over 600 garbage collection bins along
tourist routes within the scenic site. The scenic site now has 154 environmental sanitary
workers responsible for garbage collection, transportation and disposal at site. The
municipal solid waste generated within the site is first separated and the non-recyclable
portion of the waste (mostly organic waste) is disposed of through incineration,
composting and sanitary landfill. The recyclable and non-disposable waste is manually
transported down the mountain daily.
*   A laundry center is set up outside the scenic site, which is responsible for bed sheet, table
cloths laundry from the hotels and restaurants from the mountain. Such a setup reduces
the water demands as well as wastewater generation with the scenic site.
*   There is a vegetable processing center outside the scenic site which provides the service
to the site itself. The center reduces the waste generation from raw vegetable preparation.
*   At the Yupinglu wastewater treatment facility within the scenic site, an effluent tertiary
treatment and recycling facility is added to reduce the demands and conserve the water
resources on the mountain.
* Within the scenic site, coal and firewood burning is banned. The major fuel and power
sources are liquified petroleum and electricity. The ban helps control air pollution within
the scenic site area.
*   There are six transportation brigades within the scenic site, responsible for transportation
21



Tongling-Tangkou Highway ENV
of goods in and out of the mountain.
* The key scenic zones are in rotary moratorium to provide time and opportunity for the
ecosystem in these zones to take a break and rest from tourist pressure.
For Jiuhuanshan mountain scenic site, the following will be implemented:
*   Move the management organization off the mountain and leave more scenic sites to
tourists. It is planned that by 2005, all management organizations will move out and by
2010, all residents wthin the core area will be moved out.
*   Revise the 1988 Jiuhuashan Master Plan, expected to complete in 2002. The Plan will
take an integrated approach towards development and environmental protection
*   Anhui province is currently implementing an ADB funded "Acid rain control and
environment improvement" project which includes nearly US$10 million plus matching
fund from local government of RMB 160 million for Jiuhuashan Mountain environmental
improvement. The funding will be used primarily to expand water supply capacity within
the scenic site from the current 3000 t/day to 20,000 t/day, one wastewater treatment
plant with a capacity of 15,000 t/day and construct a new solid waste disposal site. These
pollution control facilities have given adequate considerations to the increase in tourist
volume in the future.
Community Severance
*   The design team will improve the design of pathways for each village, taking into
account of the pathway access problem of scattered villagers, or the scattered villagers
would be relocated together with the majority.
*   The design will include 16 grade separate passes, 34 under roads, 139 pedestrian and
vehicle under paths, and 11 over passes, averaged 1.72 per km of the highway. On
average, the local farmers will need to walk at maximum of 570 m before finding a pass
to cross to the other side of the TTH. Since most of the passes are concentrated in villages
and other rural communities, most rural residents will only need to walk a much shorter
distance.
*   Add one more tunnel and three more bridge in the section from K188 to the end of the
highway for animal pass.
Land occupation
*   The alignment selection will avoid or minimize the occupation of good farnland and
good forest. The waste land, shrub land or farmland will be considered as the first priority
for land occupation.
*   The farmland will be re-cultivated immediately after temporary occupation. If the land is
deprived of productivity by the project, economic compensation sufficient to cover the
loss will be paid, or the use of land will be changed.
22



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
* For the reserved farmland to be permanently occupied, following measures will be taken
for compensation: The sloping land will be cultivated as terrace and protected as reserved
farmland; While the economic compensation is paid, the available cultivated land will be
seek to compensate the lost reserved land.
Cultural Relics
*   The selected route will be changed to avoid the Yangjialing Relics site for by about 90
meters and a protection stone will be erected.
*   The Huangnixiang Tomb Group of Shangjie Relics site will go through a protective
excavation prior to the start of the construction and all finds will be collected and
preserved in the county museum..
*   The Wanjiachong Kiln Relic site will go through a protective excavation prior to the start
of the construction and all finds will be preserved in the county museum.
*   The selected route will be changed to avoid the Wenchang pavilion by about 70 meters.
i   For Dongjiacun tomb groups, the borrow pit will be moved northwest bound by about
250 meters to avoid occupying this site.
*   Unearth the Jieshiting Tomb Group for salvage before the road construction. The
excavated area is about 3000 m2.
Access Roads
*   The transportation will be planned to use as much existing road (e.g., S103) as much as
possible so that the need for temporary access roads will be minimized;
*   Borrow pits, excessive materials disposal sites, concrete mixing stations, asphalt plants,
etc. will be located to be near either the existing roads and/or the construction sites, to
minimize the distance for transportation and need for temporary access roads, and traffic
on the access roads;
*   Temporary access roads will be designed to avoid going through or near villages,
forestland, wildlife habitats and other sensitive receptors, to the extent possible;
*   The dirt temporary road, if too dusty, may be paved with gravel or crushing stones to
minimize the potential for airborne dust; and
*   Following consultation with the villages nearby, some of the temporary roads may be
designed with purpose of long term, permanent rural roads, which may turn to the
villagers following the TTH construction. If there is such desire, the location, alignment,
and other technical specifications will be designed following close consultation with the
villagers who will be the permanent users of the roads.
Construction Camps
At the design stage, the construction camps locations will be carefully selected. Efforts will be
23



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
given to locate such camps in villages and using existing rural housing to avoid occupation of
farmland or sensitive forestland. Within the Taiping lake and Huangshan mountain scenic
sites, no construction camps will be allowed.
3.2.6   Soil Erosion
The early days of highway construction involve mainly road bed construction. As at this time,
the protective engineering structures have not been constructed, temporary preventive
measures will be taken for areas easily subject to soil erosion (e.g., borrow pits, spoiled
materials disposal sites, road bed side slopes, etc.).
For those borrow pits and spoiled materials disposal sites which are of a temporary nature as
they will finish their intended function after the highway completion, once the construction is
complete, the areas will be leveled, covered and re-vegetated. As the surface soil layer is thin
in the highway area, it is difficult to find sufficient amount of soil for final borrow pits and
disposal sites coverage and restoration. Therefore, the contractors will be requested to keep
the surface soil in reserve at the beginning of the borrowing and disposal operation, which
will be used during final coverage. Furthermore, restoration and re-vegetation will need to
consider harmonization with the surrounding environment and to minimize any potential
impacts to environmental aesthetics. The restoration plan for each of the borrow pits and
disposal sites, prepared by the EA team with the above considerations, is listed in Table 3.2-1.

Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
3.2.7  Scenic Sites
*   The highway alignment will be smooth rolling along to the extent possible with the
natural terrain and topography and not to seek highway engineering at the expenses of
damaging to the natural landscape and scenery.
*   High fill and deep cut sections in the mountainous and valley areas will be replaced by
bridges or tunnels where possible.
*   The entrances and exits of tunnels will be designed as arch shaped and decorated with
local plants where possible.
*   The slope of deep cut section will be gentle where the natural vegetation cover is easily
restored. The slope will be created in such shapes that will match the surroundings and
appear to be natural slopes. Where possible, the slopes will use natural plants with strong
rooting and water fixation ability to stabilize and avoid using concrete and stone. The
green on the slope will alleviate the visual impacts on the travelers using the highway.
*   Service zones design will be harmonized with the surrounding area and avoid using any
colors with sharp contrast with that the area and where appropriate include areas for view
watching. The architecture style will be designed with the consideration of both modern
and tradition as well as harmonization with the other buildings, structure, and rural
housing in the area.
*   The parking lots will be designed in areas which can be hide from the public view and
visual scope. At the perimeters of the parking lots, large and tall trees will be planted to
further reduce the visual impacts. The entire service areas will be well landscaped.
*   The Shancha Interchange and toll station design will give sufficient and careful
considerations to color, style, layout, and shape to harmonize with the surrounding area
Trees will be planted around the interchange.
*   Bridge design will be consistent and harmonized with the surrounding setting through
configuration, style, and color. The Taiping lake bridge design will also need to consider
the style of the existing bridge in the same area. In areas where bridge construction could
potentially create a major visual impact, a special landscape design will be included to
minimize such impacts.
3.3 Construction Stage
3.3.1  Impact Mitigation for Ecosystem
Re-landscaping of occupied land
The land temporarily occupied by the project would be re-cultivated immediately after the
construction. The mellow soil layer, about 30-40 cm thick, will be first collected and stored.
25



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
When the construction activities at the site terminate, the soil will be returned to cover the
temporarily occupied land and then landscaped on the top. The deep borrow pits that cannot
be restored for cultivation for economic reason will be converted into fish ponds, for
landscaping or recreation.
In the hilly area, tall arbor trees will be retained as much as possible in the land temporarily
occupied. For area requiring complete disturbance, the surface layer of soil will first be
removed and stored, which will then be used for restoration, reclamation and landscaping
after the construction.
Minimizing impact on wild life
Forestland is the key section for ecological protection. The construction activities will be
scientifically scheduled to minimize the construction period on forestland and the explosion
operation also will be minimized in order to minimizing the disturbance to wild animals in the
area.
The contractor will be requested to cooperate with the forest agency to locate construction
sites, camps and temporary access road. The construction camps will not be allowed to build
in forestland and the construction of the camps will be controlled to minimize damage to soil
and vegetation.
After determining the exact location of forestland to be occupied by the project, the contractor
will be requested to invite the technical staff of local forestry station to identify and label the
plants under the national protection lists. (See Annex I). The labeled trees will be transplanted
to the nursery of Shilishan Reserve or to a nearby unaffected place.
In order to protect forest ecosystem and reduce the forest edge effects, in the highway sections
crossing forestland (K138 to Kl6 0 Kl73+500 to Shancha), a protection line/protection zone
will be defined and drawn jointly by local forestry agency and contractors. At the early stage
of construction, guarding wall or bank may be constructed to prevent vehicle and people from
entering tin the protected zones.
The construction activities will be carefully scheduled to avoid the peak time of for wild
animals activities. Explosion operation will be prohibited in the morning, dusk and night since
such time frames are the peak active time for wild animals. From the end of autumn to the
next early spring is the reproduction period for neofelis nebulosa. Explosion operation will
not be allowed from November to the next March at the section from Shilishan to Shancha.
Borrow pit and disposal site
The borrow pit will be selected at hills, waste land, or bare land. The quality farmland will not
26



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
be used for borrow pits. In addition, the soil profile will be surveyed in order to determine the
depth of the borrow pit. The surface clay layer will be retained at the borrow pit for the
purposes of prevention of soil degradation and also for future opportunity of development.
The waste materials will not be allowed to dump in any stream or at the riverside.
The slag stockpile will be selected at the valley plain where soil erosion potential is very low.
Retaining dams will be constructed around such sites.
Screening the exotic timber
According to the Clause 11 of Method for Pine Nematode Management in Anhui Province,
host plants of Pine Nematode are prohibited from entering into the area under stringent
prevention and protection against pine nematode, such as the Huangshan District. In order to
prevent pine nematode from entering into this area, it is recommended that the foreign pine
timbers that are prone to pine nematode will be banned for use in the project. The materials
for package will be clearly explained in contractors' bidding documents. Timber materials
either for construction or package in this project will be those from the local market or foreign
timber only after pre-treatment.
Education and training
The public and contractor education bill boards for environmental protection will be erected
around the construction sites before ground breaking. Seminars on environmental protection
and bio-diversity will be provided to contractors. The construction workers will be organized
to study relevant ecological protection regulations, technology, and method for identification
and protection of sensitive wildlife.
Incentives will be provided to the workers who are active in environmental protection. At the
same time, any damages to the ecosystems, such as wild animals killing and protective plant
species cutting without proper procedures, will be punished.
Construction supervision
Full-time environmental staff from the construction supervision companies and the project
proponent will be assigned as the ecological supervisors during the construction phase. The
local environmental agency and forestry agency will carry out site inspection regularly, to
examine the implementation of ecological protection measures and quarantine the pine
benatode.

3.3.2  Noise
The following measures will be taken during construction to mitigate the noise impacts:
*   The low-noise equipment is to be used for construction. The construction equipment will
be first tested for noise compliance before moving to the site. All the equipment that do
not meet the requirement for noise control will not be allowed to be used in this project.
The maintenance will be carried out regularly to ensure constant compliance of the
equipment.
*   The noise will cause short-term impact compared with that in the operation phase.
However, the impact of noise will significantly disturb the residents in the night time.
Therefore the noise equipment will be prohibited for operation from 22:00-6:00 each day.
The construction schedule will be carefully developed for the section near the schools in
which the construction activity will be concentrated on the school vacation or after
classes to the extent possible, or temporary facilities to reduce noise, such as wood
acoustic insulation barriers, will be installed.
*   The construction site boundary will be carefully defined according to the "Noise Limit
for Boundary of Construction Site" in order to avoid residential area within the site.
*   The temporary access road will be designed away from villages or schools where
possible. The transportation of construction materials on the existing roads will be
carefully scheduled to avoid any disturbance to the local traffic. At night, construction
vehicles will be requested to operate at low speeds and banned for any homing.
*   The workers on site will be provided with personal protective appliances such as earplug
and helmets.
* The construction management and supervision will be enforced, particularly for the road
sections near schools, seniors' houses and villages, as well as the scenic sites.
3.3.3 Water Mitigation
In order to protect water quality and irrigation facilities in the project area, the following
mitigation measures will be taken during the construction phase:
*   The water intake of Lingyang County Water Purification Plant near Lingyang River
Bridge will be relocated to 500 m upstream of the bridge.
*   The construction materials, such as asphalt, oil and chemicals will not be allowed to
stockpile at the river sides, or near fish pond, lake and water wells. The stockpiles will be
covered with canvas sheet.
*   Side ditch will be constructed prior to road construction, to prevent the muddy water
flowing into streams, canal or farmland.
*   The temporary canals will be provided to replace the existing canals to be temporarily
28



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
occupied. Culvert pipe will be laid under the road prior to road bed construction. The
diameter of pipe will be sufficiently large to acccommodate the local conditions and
rquirements for irrigation and/or flood discharge.
*   Retention walls and/or interception ditches will be provided at the river side when
construction is taken near the river.
*   Construction camps will not be located at the Taiping Lake Bridge. The camps for bridge
construction will be located in the villages nearest to the bridge site.
*   The construction period for bridge is long and a lot of workers will be involved in and
this will generate wastewater. In addition, the many of the streams are seasonal with large
variation of water flow in the streams. Bridge construction, particularly those activities
which must be in-water or near water, will be conducted during the dry season when the
flows in the rivers are smallest. In addition, further measures will be taken during bridge
construction, described as follows:
-Advanced technology will be applied in the construction of Shuiqiao Lake Bridge,
such as cofferdum methods for the construction of piers and others which must go
in-water.
-Septic tanks will be provided for construction camps and construction site. The
wastewater from dinning rooms will be at first treated with oil separation process
before discharge to the septic tank.
-The domestic and construction solid waste will be separated and collected for reuse
as possible. The remaining will be transported for landfill in timely manner.
-The spoil will be transported to the designated site by local environment agency for
stockpile.
-The equipment and operation ship will be examined to ensure free of leakage of oil.
3.3.4 Air Quality
*   Water spray vehicles will be provided by contractors to unpaved road and other disturbed
soil. The water spray operation will be carried out in the dry or windy day, at least twice
per day (morning and afternoon). The frequency of water spray at sensitive receptors,
such as village, school and seniors houses, will be increased.
*   Some real powdering and dry materials will be covered, especially in the windy days to
prevent the materials from air borne.
*   Trucks carrying powder materials, such as cement, sand and lime, will fully be covered.
3.3.5  Socio-economic Impact Mitigation
Existing Roads
* The access road will be minimized, the existing road will be used as possible. The
29



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
contractor will at first cooperate with the road agency in development of road use plan,
especially in the case of S103. The construction activity will be scientifically scheduled
to avoid the sensitive time of villagers.
* At the place busy of transportation, warning signs will be installed. The material
transportation route will be carefully selected to avoid populous area or villages.
* Mitigation measures against air-borne dust and noise have mostly been included in
Section 5.3.4 and 5.5.4 of this report
Cultural Relics Sites
*   The contractors are obligated to provide necessary training to its workers for basic
knowledge of cultural relics. Once a chance find is uncovered, the construction will be
halted immediately. Cultural relics authority will be called in and an investigation starts.
The construction on the same site can resume only after the contractors receive such
instructions from cultural relics authority.
*   Professional cultural relics specialists will be called during the construction at the
Huangtuling dinosaur egg fossil site to identify additional signs and start the protective
excavation immediately if new relics items are found
*   At the beginning of the No.3 borrow pit construction, investigative drilling will start first
and if a relics site is found, the borrow pit will be relocated to elsewhere.
*   The temporary siting of borrow pits and waste disposal sites will be carefully conducted
to avoid cultural relics sites.
Public Disturbance
* The construction activity will not damage to service facilities along the road and any
accidental damages will be repaired and restored at the quickest way possible.
*   The contractors will be requested to have their own the equipment for temporary power
supply, communication and water supply.
*   A billboard will be installed at the entrance of construction site, indicating the names and
phone numbers of the contractor, supervisor and local EPB. The villagers therefore could
voice their complaints, if any, to government department as well as responsible for it.
Safety and Health
*   The construction workers will be educated with the basic knowledge about disease
control, especially the epidemics such as AIDS or hepatitis.
*   The construction workers will be provided with necessary personal preventive equipment,
such as helmet and earplug.
* Effective safeguard facilities will be provided to the people living along the proposed
road. The construction site or other dangerous place will be fenced off to alert the
30



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
villagers of the dangers.
*   Transportation and storage of explosive will receive special attention. The place where
the explosive will be applied needs to be carefully examine to ensure a full compliance
with the procedures and regulations.
*   The houses within 500 m from the explosion place will be carefully examined prior to
explosion operation. The houses which are thought to be vulnerable to explosion
operation will be reinforced for explosion operation.
Construction Camps
*   Septic tank will be provided for construction tank, and needs to be cleared regularly.
*   Wastewater from the camp is banned from entering into waters;
*   The solid waste in construction site will be collected regularly and transported to
designated site for disposal.
*   The drinking water quality will be ensured to meet the national standard for drinking
water.
Land Occupation and Resettlement
A certain amount of the land will be occupied temporarily during construction. The following
mitigation will be taken to minimize the impacts as well as the impact due to resettlement and
relocation:
*   The top 15-30 cm of the native soil will be scraped before the land is occupied. This soil
will be used again during restoration and reclamation after the temporary land occupation
is over.
*   Large trees and other large and valuable vegetation will be saved to the maximum extent
possible on the temporarily occupied land.
*   Strict procedures for compensation funds allocation, administration, monitoring and
auditing will be established and followed. Resettlement organizations at the three levels
of governments (provincial, city and county) as well as the independent monitoring and
evaluation organization will conduct training of the staff from village levels and provide
guidance to them on planning for the development and fund utilization. The village
compensation fund utilization plans will be reviewed and approved by the county level
resettlement office. Those without a fund utilization plan will not be allocated with the
fund until such a plan is developed and approved. The provincial resettlement office will
select randomly a village for monitoring and audit each year. In addition the independent
monitoring organization will supervise the fund utilization status through investigation,
site visits, interviews with the affected people, etc. This organization will also provide
consultation with villages and report to the township and county level resettlement
offices.
*   According to site survey, on average each village will have less than seven households
31



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
for relocation. All of them will be resettled within the same villages they are living now.
The unsatisfactory places are unlikely to be an issue to the affected residents.
Disadvantaged households will receive the following assistance: fund from project
proponent, labor for new house construction from villages, exemption of labor
contribution to the village activities for the year, preference in selection of new house
places and cultivated land re-distribution. The disadvantaged households may not
participate in the village land re-distribution to minimize the impacts to their crops in the
fields.
Contractor Management
Contractors will be on the construction site at all time and their activities will be the sources
of adverse impacts during the construction phase. Therefore, contractors are the key for
environmental control and mitigation plan implementation and as such, environmental
management for contractors will be critical for successful mitigation. Most of the mitigation
measures designed above require contractors to implement. In order to ensure the mitigation
measures and environmental management plans become contractors commitments, the
following actions will be taken:
During the contractor pre-qualification, environmental management of contractors will be an
integral part of the evaluation criteria
*   Under the same conditions, priority considerations will be given to those bidders who
have ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 certified;
*   Contractors will be requested to provide at least one full time environmental staff at the
construction site for environmental supervision, environmental monitoring and
environmental mitigation measures implementation;
*   All mitigation measures such as those listed above will be included in the bid documents
so that contractors will bid with the understanding of these environmental requirements
and prepare budget for mitigation measures in their bids where necessary. These
mitigation measures will then become contractual obligations for the winning contractors;
and
*   Environmental training will be provided to the winning contractors prior to the
commencement of the construction. At least one senior manager and one full time
environmental staff from each contractor will be requested to attend the training, to be
delivered by experienced environmental specialists and local regulators. The training
program will be 2-3 days prior to signing of the contracts. The training programs will
include, but not limited to,
-State and local environmental regulations and discharge standards,
-Technical principles for relevant environmental control technologies
-Project EIA and EMP,
-Site monitoring requirements and monitoring techniques,
-Reporting requirements and monitoring feedback,
-Mitigation measures,
32



Tongling-Tangkou Highway ENP
-Environmental emergency and spills response,
-Continued public consultation and handling of public complains, and
-Contractors' contractual obligations for environmental protection.
In addition, construction supervision companies will also play an important role in
environmental management and pollution control. The requirements for environmental
management for construction supervision companies will also be included in the bid
documents and later in the contracts. At least two staff members one of whom being a senior
manager from each winning construction supervision company must attend the same training
program for the contractors described above.
3.3.6 Soil Erosion Mitigation
Temporary protection at borrow pits: Most borrow pits for this project will be located at
hilly land and deserted land. Borrow pits operation will create exposed soil slopes which
can result in heavy soil erosion during strong rainfalls. Drainage interception ditches will
be built surrounding the borrow pits to prevent surface runoff from hills to flash the
slopes.
Temporary protection at disposal sites: prior to the use of a disposal site, the lower end of
the site will be built with bank to prevent the flush of the spoiled materials in the piles
into nearby rivers or farmland. Interception ditches will be built at the upper side of the
site to divert the runoff away from the site. In some of the temporary piles of spoiled
materials where the above temporary measures cannot be taken, the piles will be covered
by nylon cloth or similar sheets to minimize the erosion of rainfalls.
* Temporary mitigation for the road side slopes: at the edge of road bases where side slopes
are most vulnerable, a 0.2 m high by 0.5 m wide retaining wall will be built. Then create
a temporary discharge ditch every 50 m to collect and then direct surface runoff to
discharge ditch off the road. A settling pond may be built downstream from the discharge
ditch. For fill section higher than 5 m, an earth retaining wall will be built at the foot. For
land slide, hill falling and soft land sections, retaining walls, concrete piling, slope cutting
or complete pavement with stones may be applied to stabilized these section for
construction safety as well as prevention serious soil erosion.
3.3.7 Visual Impacts Mitigation
* The construction activity in the section of high landscape quality (for instance,
Huangshan Mountains and Taiping Lake) will be scheduled in off-season for tourism.
The construction vehicles will operate at night to the extent possible. The vehicles will be
kept clean and the materials, particularly powered materials, transported will be covered.
* The fencing walls will be constructed around the construction site near landscape sites,
which will be decorated with vegetation or other means to minimize the visual impacts
33



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
created by the construction sites.
*   The construction camps will be located in the nearest villages where possible. No
construction camps are allowed in forest, scenic sites, and other sensitive areas.
*   The solid waste from construction and domestic sources will be collected and disposed
regularly in engineered and designated facilities. Random dumping of solid waste will be
strictly banned.
*   The material storage and mixing stations will be located far away from river side and
landscape sites and not to be visible from major public areas.
*   The existing roads will be used as possible to access construction sites. If not possible,
the access roads will be selected in places that could minimize the damage to vegetation
and to scenic sites.
3.4 Operation Stage
3.4.1  Mitigation to Ecosystem Impacts
During the operation phase of the TTH, the following mitigation measures will be taken:
* Erect warning signs about the forest pest and applicable bans to certain materials from
entering into the sensitive area. The signs will be located at the highway entrances and set
a forest diseases and insect pests prevention station along the road before the Huangshan
section to prevent pine nematode.
*   Enhancement of environmental management and regulate the construction activities. At
the both side of the road section which cross the animal active area (K138-K142,
K151-160, K173+500 to Chancha), dense tree fencing will be planted. At the both end of
the section, a explosion ban sign will be installed.
*   Emergency capacity building for ecosystem safety will be implemented. Cooperation
with the Wannan First-aid Center for Wild Animals is critical to the protection of wild
animals on construction site.
The project area is very rich in bio-diversity. Good ecological protection may not be possible
by single agency or organization, but rather will be based on multi-agency and
multi-disciplinary cooperation effort, such as the follows:
Protection measures for Wannan ecosystem
The protection, compensation and recovery of bio-diversity may also be supported by
mitigation measures taken outside the affected area
34



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
From the analysis of ecosystem integrity, the area covering Huangshan Landscape Showplace,
Shitai   County,   . Qimen    County    and     Qian     County,   particularly
Jiulongfeng-Wuxishan-Dahongling-Shitai-Laoshan, is remote from human active area. The
ecosystem intactness in these regions is good. Thus these areas will be the core of the south
mountainous ecosystem where the precious species may take as habitats. This project will
contribute effort to the protection of the reserves in order to provide better opportunity for
development and growth of precious species. These measures are also critical components of
the mitigation measures.
Proper planning and comprehensive decision-making process
The planning for various sectors will be based on inter-institutional and multi-discipline
cooperation between forestry, environment, transportation, hydrology and land agencies, in
order to avoid conflict between these planning. Such planning and decision making process
will be taken particularly when it comes to activities which could potentially affect the
ecosystem of the region
Wannan Wild Life Foundation
The protection of wild life needs significant funding resources. Currently most of the fund for
protection and preventive programs come from government grants or donation from
international organizations. Still, in many economic disadvantaged regions, wild lives have
not been effectively and properly protected due to short in funding. With the rapid growth of
the economy and income among the people of China, personal or company donation can be
expected to increase along with the growing environmental concerns and awareness among
the general public. Govemment will consider to initiate a Wannan Wild Life Foundation by
inputting a base fund to stimulate more donation from individuals and companies.
3.4.2 Noise
Proper highway maintenance and operation management can be effective in controlling noise
pollution. The motor vehicles in poor condition will be rejected from entering the highway
and the road surface will regularly maintained to keep in good conditions. Signage for speed
limit and control and hom banning will be erected on the road sections near major sensitive
receptors (school, rest home and population settlements).
In order to further mitigate the noise levels at the sensitive receptors to the levels in
compliance with applicable standards, specific measures have been designed and developed
for each of the sensitive receptors. These measures will be taken prior to the time when noise
impacts will exceed the standards according to the modeling. Table 5-3-4-1 presents the
35



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
mitigation measures at the sensitive receptors, implementation time and estimated costs.
In future reconstruction of houses, schools and other facilities which may be sensitive to noise,
the local governments will require the locations be sufficiently far from the highway. The
projected noise level will be considered for new planning of rural development and new
settlements in order to avoid the noise impact. Based on the modeling results, any new noise
sensitive houses, including residential housing, will be located at least 200 m from the central
line of the highway, to prevented such facilities impacted by the highway noise.
For those sensitive receptors where no specific mitigation measures have been taken due to
the fact that predicted noise levels will meet the applicable standards, a well structured noise
monitoring program will be implemented periodically. If the actual noise levels during the
operation are higher than predicted and exceed the applicable standards, new, effective and
appropriate mitigation measures will be designed and implemented in these sensitive
receptors.
3.4.3 Water Impacts
The following measures will be during the operation phase:
*   The effluent from Taiping Lake Service Station will meet Class I standard in the
"Integrated Standard for Wastewater Discharge" (GB8978-1996), before discharging
into the receiving streams. The "Quality Standard for Irrigation Water" (GB5084-92) will
be applied for effluent to be used for irrigation. The effluent from Yangtian Parking Yard
could be discharged after the treatment into the ponds in the Zucun village nearby in
which the effluent will be further treated through natural purification processes. Selected
vegetation will be planted in the bonds such that it can act as an oxidation pond. The
treated effluent from Changyuan Parking Yard will be discharged into Machuan River
(the river section at Changyuan Parking Yard is not used for drinking water sources).
*   Because the TTH will go through many large and small water bodies along its alignment,
some of which are very sensitive, a tight control of motor vehicles using the highway will
be exercised. Visibly leaking and dripping vehicles will not allowed to enter into the
highway and the control may be taken at the poll stations on both ends.
* An emergency system against major pollution accidents involving toxic materials will be
established. It basically has the following elements
-   Emergency telephone sets will be installed near Shuiqiao Lake Bridge and Taiping
Lake Bridge. The telephone line will connect directly with the monitoring and
control center.
-   An emergency team will be established including members from environmental
agency, road management, and monitoring and control center. In case of
catastrophic accidents, the team will control the accident site. At the same time the
team will report to senior governmental departments for proper actions
36



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
The management system for trucks transporting toxic materials will be based upon
the requirements of driving license, hazardous materials transportation license and
transportation permit. The warning signs will be marked on all such trucks.
3.4.4  Mitigation of Impacts from Increased Tourists
The Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site Management Committee is fully aware and well
understand the impacts of construction and operation of the TTH on tourism burden to the site,
and is now in the process to revise Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site Master Plan to
accommodate the effect from the expected great increase in the number of tourists to the site
once the TTH is open for traffic. The revised master plan will be the principal guides to the
development of Huangshan Mountain and avoid the disorderly construction and development,
with the objective of promoting the tourism and protecting the environment and resources at
the same time.
One of the major issues at the Huangshan mountain scenic site is the even burden of the
tourists to the site in the difference months of the year. For example, the numbers of the
tourists to the site in 2001 were:
*   January         23,066
*   February        15,733
*   March           63,248
*   April           141,634
*   May             230,600
*   June            106,220
*   July            175,023
*   August          187,224
*   September       127,645
•   October         183,383
*   November        67,810
*   December        22,593
Clearly, the tourists are heavily concentrated in the five months of the year including May and
October each of these months has a golden week, as well as July and August when schools are
on vacation and weather is suitable for travel. The tourist burden to the site is so uneven that
the busiest month, May is about 14.6 times higher than the quietest month, February. The
daily tourist burden also varies heavily with the highest up to 20 to 30,000 people while the
quietest day the site receives only 58 people. As a mitigation measure, the management
authority plans to regulate the door price in hope to adjust the tourist loads. Also, with the
vacationing system gradually established among the employers of China, the tourists may not
always show up in the golden weeks, which will also help spread out the tourist loads.
37



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
Other mitigation measures to be adopted at the Huangshan mountain tourist site include:
*   Reasonably arrange the tourist routes and attract the tourists to different zones in order to
increase the tourism capacity at the site;
*   Gradually open up and promote the Diaoqiao scenic zone at the west gate, Songgu scenic
zone at the north gate as well as other zones in different parts of the site to alleviate the
congestion currently occurring at the existing Beihai, Xihai and Yuping scenic zones.
*   Develop more scenic zones in the surrounding area of the Huanghshan mountain scenic
site which has abundant tourism resources (see Section 4.7.7). According to Anhui
Provincial Tourism Development Plan, the province will speed up the development and
promotion of the tourist attractions near the Huangshan Mountain at the same time when
the TTH and other parts of the highway network are constructed, in order to share the
tourist burden to Huangshan Mountain.
*   The tourist will be encouraged to tour the mountain but live off the mountain. The cable
car operation hours will be prolonged, from the current 8 am to 5 pm to 5 am to 10 pm
daily. This will allow tourists have sufficient time to tour the mountain site including the
popular tourist items of watching the sun rise and sunset on the mountain, without having
to live on the mountain.
*   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is funding an Acid Rain and Environmental
Upgrading project in Anhui province which includes a $14.6 million component plus
RMB250 million matching fund for Huangshan Mountain environmental upgrading. The
program take the future tourist grow, as well as the need to protect the environment, into
considerations. In total the program will build, new or upgrading, eight wastewater
treatment stations in the Huangshan mountain scenic site, with a total treatment capacity
of 7470 m3/day, and upgrade the sewer network including construction of 15 km of new
sewers. Other pollution control facilities in the scenic site include construction of
municipal solid waste landfills and incinerator, upgrading of seven public toilets and
construction of four new ones. These facilities will greatly help protect the environment
in the scenic site, even with the much increased tourist, thus environmental, burdens to
the site following the construction and operation of the TTH.
3.4.5 Surrounding Area
Besides the Huangshan Mountain scenic site itself, the proposed TTH will also affect the
surrounding area, primarily from the following two aspects:
* Following the operation of the TTH, there will be a great increase in flow of people to
Shancha village at the foot of the Huangshan Mountain, resulting in local economic
development and urbanization. If not properly planned and controlled, disorderly
development may occur including disorderly development of the tourism zones which are
not easily accessible without the TTH, seriously impacting environmental and tourism
resources quality in the area.
38



Tongling-Tangkou Highway EMP
*   The relatively massive construction of the TTH ending point at now quiet and
undisturbed Shacha village, including interchange, toll station and management center,
will damage the natural setting and the environment at this village. These facilities will
also be visible from one of the major tourist zones on the Huangshan mountain causing
visual impacts to the tourists, although about half of the tourists hold positive view of the
facilities in terms of their visual impacts, according to the EA team's survey at the site.
The Huangshan district government plan to take the following measures to mitigate the
potential impacts described above:
*   There will be no bus stop at Shacha village and tourists will be discouraged to leave their
vehicles in this area;
*   The tourist service facilities such as hotels, restaurants and other commercial vendors,
will be strictly controlled in this area;
*   The relocated residents will be moved to a collectively planned and built new houses
which are away from the interchange area and hiden in the woods
*   Shacha village development will be carefully planned, with particular consideration to
harmony. The construction materials, configuration, style, color, form, etc. will all be
under strict control in order to main the Huangshan or Wannan style. They will also have
traditional Anhui's architecture style reflecting Anhui's culture, so that the structures can
be integrated and harmonized with the natural and cultural scenery in the region, and
maintain the good quality of the Huangshan Mountain surrounding environment.
*   Development of village level scenic zones will be banned. All tourist attraction site
developments will be under the master plan and strictly in compliance with state level
scenic site standards and requirements. All new scenic zone or attraction developments
must go through environmental impact assessment.
*   Enforce the jurisdiction and authority of the Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site
Management Committee. Although the state government has a specific degree on the
scope of the jurisdiction and authority for the Committee, the actual authority particularly
that for protection area have not always been clear and specific. This lack of clear
management authority has resulted in certain levels of disorderly development within the
scenic site. Re-enforcement of the scope of the authority will help control and minimize
the disorderly development.
39

Chapter 4 Environmental Supervision Plan
All work related to the TTH, whether in the preparation, design, construction and operation
stages, will all subject to environmental supervision. The actual organizations responsible for
the supervision, contents of the supervision and objectives of the supervision are presented in

Chapter 5 Environmental Monitoring Plan
Objectives
Environmental monitoring is a critical part of the environmental management plan for the
TTH, both for the construction and operation phases. The objectives of the environmental
monitoring plan are to:
*   Verify the results of the Project EIA with regard to potential environmental impacts of the
Project;
•   Determine the actual impact levels;
*   Verify the effectiveness and adequacy of environmental mitigation measures;
*   Identify and assess the extent of any expected adverse impacts; and
*   Provide a basis for additional mitigation measures to address the expected impacts or
impacts exceeded the original predicted levels by the Project EA.
Responsible Institutions
Anhui Provincial Environmental Monitoring Station will be engaged to conduct the
environmental monitoring program. The Monitoring Station, which is a subsidiary of the
provincial EPB, has carried out environmental monitoring programs for the World Bank
financed Anhui Highway I construction and operation, as well as many other routine or on
demand environmental monitoring around the province. As such the Station is very
experienced with environmental monitoring requirements by SEPA and the World Bank, as
well as well equipped with necessary equipment, instruments, special vehicles and more
importantly experienced environmental monitoring and chemical analysis specialists. The
proposed highway environmental monitoring will be provided by the Anhui Environmental
Monitoring Station.
Monitoring Program
Anhui Provincial Environmental Monitoring Station will carry out the sampling, preservation,
and analysis with the methods in accordance with relevant guidelines and standards issued by
SEPA. The responsible organization for the monitoring program in design and construction
phases will be the World Bank Financed Project Office of the Anhui Provincial
Communications Department, which is the executing agency of the Project. The Anhui
Highway Administration Bureau is responsible for monitoring in operation phase.
The monitoring program will cover noise, water quality, and ambient air quality and extend to
both the construction and operation phases. Details of the program, including time, frequency,
locations, and parameters are presented in Tables 5-1 to 5-3.

In addition to the formal monitoring by specialists from the professional monitoring
institution which may be used as a legal records of environmental performance at the
construction sites for compliance purposes, routine monitoring by contractors and
construction supervision companies will be conducted on a daily basis. The monitoring
parameters and methods will include:
*   Noise at all construction machine side and sensitive receptors, to be measured by potable
noise meters;
*   Air borne dust at temporary access roads, stockpile of powering materials, disturbed soil,
42

and hauling trucks, to be measured through visual observations; and
* Water quality up and downstream of bridge construction sites, rivers, creeks, irrigation
channels, lakes, and fish ponds which receiving discharges and surface runoff from the
construction sites and construction camps, to be measured through visual observations.
One of the major lessons learmt from environmental management of other expressway projects
which are also financed by the World Bank is that the contractors and construction
supervision must also be held accountable for environmental performance and monitoring and
such monitoring will be part of their contractual obligations. Therefore, the contractors and
construction supervision companies will be requested to report their daily measurements and
observations for environmental performance to WBFPMO on a monthly basis. They will be
further requested to report immediately any unexpected environmental pollution or impacts so
that WBFPMO and/or contractors can take appropriate actions to mitigate, including
additional monitoring by the professional monitoring station. All these requirements will be
included in the bid documents so that the contractor and construction supervision are aware of
the requirements when they bid and meets the requirements during construction as part of the
contract requirements. APCD and other environmental management and supervisory
organizations can hold the contractors liable will they not comply with the monitoring
requirements.
Dedicated staff from every civil work contractors and every construction supervision
companies will be trained prior to the commencement of the construction to conduct the
monitoring and reporting. WBFPMO and its consultants will review the monthly reports and
will visit the sites to inspect the daily monitoring work. All the monitoring and reporting
requirements will be included in the contractors and construction supervision companies bid
documents and later in their contracts so that the requirements will be part of contractual
obligations.
Monitoring Reports
The results of the monitoring program will be included in formal written reports twice a year
and submitted for review by WBFPMO (or provincial road administration bureau in the
operation phase) and its consultants, SEPA, EPO of MOC, provincial EPB and the World
Bank. These reports will be the basis for evaluation of site environmental performance and for
developing additional mitigation measures for impacts exceeded applicable standards. The
monitoring reporting system is outlined in Figure 5-1.

Estimated Monitoring Cost
The estimated cost for the monitoring program by PEMS in the construction phase is RMB
150,000/a X 4 years = RMB600,000. And the estimated cost in the operation phase
is :RMB400,000 X 3 years=RMB    1,200,000. The operation phase monitoring will be
conducted for the first years of the operation, to determine the environmental performance
and verify the environmental impact prediction. Following the first three years, the
monitoring program will be revised and may become less intensive depending on the results
of the first three years operation.
In addition, a contingency of RMB80,000 is planned for the construction phase for any
unexpected need for additional monitoring work.
The cost for daily monitoring to be carried out by contractor and supervisor will be included
in contract price.

Chapter 6 Personnel Training
The success of environmental management for the Project relies on the knowledge, and
experience of the personnel involved in environmental management. As contemporary
methodologies and approach towards environmental management for expressway
construction and operation are still relatively new to the Anhui agencies involved including
the yet to be established hgihway operation company for operation, personnel training, both
abroad and at home will be needed. The overseas training will take place at countries with
well-established environmental management systems for capital projects and expressway
operations. The domestic training will be conducted by environmental experts from
universities, environmental institutions and professional consultants. The overseas training
will also be regarded as training of the trainers and personnel who are involved in the
overseas training will conduct training in domestic training program.
As a lesson learnt from the previous Bank financed projects, contractors and construction
supervision must be involved in self monitoring. Even though such monitoring may not be
completely objective, it is nevertheless a permanent presence at the site, serves as a good
reminder of the environmental requirements, and allows better supervision by the
environmental management and supervision organizations. In order for contractors and
supervision to conduct the monitoring, the personnel training must include a training of
contractor and supervision staff and their senior management.
The details of the personnel training program is presented in Table 6-1.
