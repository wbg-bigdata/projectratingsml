Environmental Assessment
Executive Summary
1   Introduction
This document is the Executive Summary of Environmental Assessment (EA) for the World
Bank financed Anhui Highway II project (the Project) which consists of Tongling to Tangkou
Highway (the TTH) to be constructed on green field and upgrading of five pieces of rural roads.
The document provides a general summary of the findings in the Project Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP), including legal and policy
framework and applicable environmental standards, environmental baseline major potential
adverse impacts to the physical, ecological and socio-economic environments in the Project area,
analysis of alternatives, mitigation measures designed, public consultation programs, and
environmental management plan for the Project. This Executive Summary could serve as a
concise environmental report to environmental administrators, Project decision makers, project-
affected groups, non-government organizations and the general public, as well as to the executive
board of directors of the World Bank.
1.1  Project Background
The proposed TTH is located in the Wannan (south Anhui) mountainous and economically
disadvantaged region in Anhui Province, P. R. China, connecting via Hefei to Tongling highway
the provincial capital with the world renowned tourist attraction, the Huangshan Mountain region.
The TTH is a section of the national trunk highway, the Tianjin to Shantou expressway. Designed
as a trunk north-south road transportation corridor in the Anhui Provincial highway network, the
TTH is expected to improve the regional transportation network, accelerate the economic growth
and poverty alleviation in the region and promote the tourism of Anhui Province. The five rural
roads are also located in the same region servicing directly the rural communities in the relatively
isolated and poverty striking region.
A feasibility study for the Project was completed in December 2001 and preliminary engineering
design, August 2002. The final detailed engineering design is expected to complete in early 2003.
Over the same period, Environmental Assessment (EA) for the Project has been conducted by
Shanghai Ship and Shipping Research Institute (SSSRI), for the TTH and Hefei Design and
Research Institute (HDRI) of the Ministry of Coal Industry for the rural roads. EA Terms of
Reference (TOR) were compared by SSSRI and HDRI, for the different components respectively,
in February 2002 which were reviewed, revised and approved on April 30, 2002 by the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA). The first draft Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) report was prepared in August 2002 which was pre-appraised by World Bank
in September, 2002. After revision accordingly to the Bank's pre-appraisal comments, the final
draft of EIA, together with Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and EA Summary (this
I



Tongling toTangkou Highway                                  E4 Executive Summary
document) will be complete in December 2002 and submitted to SEPA for its final review and
approval, and to the Bank for its appraisal in early 2003.
The Project is classified as a Category A project since it involves major expressway construction
on new alignment, and grade highway construction or upgrading on the exiting roads. The
construction and upgrading of expressway and rural roads would result in increased noise, motor
vehicle air emission, occupation of fertile and barren land, disturbance to the ecosystem, visual
and induced impacts to major scenic sites, community severance, soil erosion and resettlement.
1.2  Basis of the EA
Regulatory, policy and administrative requirements for environmental assessment of development
projects in China were followed during the preparation and evaluation of EA, as were the Bank's
safeguard policies. Major laws and regulations applied to the EA are as follows:
*  Laws of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China;
*  Law of Water and Soil Conservation,
*  Law of Air Pollution Control of the PRC;
*  Law of Water Pollution Control of the PRC;
*  Law of Environmental Noise Pollution Control of the PRC;
*  Law of Forest Protection of the PRC;
*  Law of Wildlife Protection of the PRC;
*  Circulation on Strengthening EIA for Construction Projects Receiving International
Financing;
*  Technical Specifications for Environmental Impact Assessment;
*  Scenic Sites Management Guides;
*  Construction Projects Environmental Management Guides of Anhui Province; and
*  Huangshan Mountain Scenic Site Management Guildes.
Of the ten World Bank safeguard policies, Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP4.01),
Involuntary Resettlement (OD4.30), Cultural Property (OP4.1 1), Forestry (OP/GP4.36), Natural
Habitats (OP/BP4.04), Pest Management (OP4.09), and Indigenous People (OD4.20) are applied
in the EA first as a screening and, where triggered, included in the full assessment. Since there are
no project components that would involve international waterways, dams or construction in
disputed areas as defined under the World Bank's OP7.60, safeguard policies related to these
subjects are not applied in the EA. Relevant international environmental agreements in which
China is a signing party have also been included where applicable as a basis for the EA.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 EA Executive Summary
2   Project Description
The TTH is located in the south of Anhui province in southeast China. The highway starts from
Dujiachong village of Tongling county, extends south bound through Qingyang county and ends
at Tangkou town of the Huangshan District, Huangshan city (Map 1). The TTH Project has three
major components: the main highway, connecting roads linking key urban centers in the Project
areas with the highway and rural roads connecting villages with townships and counties. The
connecting and rural roads are located within the above mentioned three counties/districts which
are the directly impacted/serviced areas by the TTH. The TTH will be constructed completely on
a new alignment, whereas the connecting roads will mostly on new alignment.
The rural roads are in the same (Wannan) region as the TTH, going through Jingde county,
Huangshan district, Jingxian county, Ningguo city, Shitai county, Qimen county and Qingyang
county (Map 2). The upgrading will involve primarily exiting roads upgrading, including
hardening/pavement and widening of the existing roads for better usage for higher expected
traffic volumes in the region and access in all weather conditions.
Key specifications of the components are summarized in Table 2-1 and Table 2-2 respectively.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                    E4 Executive Summary
3   Baseline Environment
Physical Setting
The Project area is located in the north semi-tropical region with a continental monsoon climate
and distinct seasons. The average annual temperature ranges from 16.1°C, and average annual
precipitation from 1600 mm, concentrated mostly in the spring and summer. The predominant
wind direction is northeast to south, changing with the seasons. The terrain configuration changes
from the north of plain and mild hills of generally below 200 m above the sea, to the south of
mountainous region with elevation of higher than 200 m in general. In the south area of Anhui
have high mountains of about 1700 m above the sea level.
Nature Reserves and National Parks
Several significant nature reserves, scenic sites and forest parks are located in the project region.
The natural reserves would be the focus of impact assessment on ecosystems while the scenic
sites are more sensitive to increased visitors and visual impacts from the roads. They are
summarized in Table 3-1.

In addition, one of the rural roads is going through the test area of the Guniujiang nature reserve
which is a forest ecosystem at the state level. No new alignment will be needed in the reserve for
the Project, only the upgrading of the existing road with slight widening and new pavement.
There are many Scenic sites in south Anhui(see pic. 1), such as Huangshan mountain and
Jiuhuashan mountain, are world renowned scenic sites and tourist attractions. Each year,
Huangshan mountain receives a large number of tourists from around the world and in 2001, the
tourists reached 1.34 million, including a certain amount foreign tourists. Tourism is a major
natural resource and source of income in the largely poverty and plays an important role in the
development of local economy.

Ecosystem
The ecosystem in the project is primarily forest based, with 70% forest coverage in most part of
the project region. Based on the analysis of remote sensing images and site investigation by
biodiversity specialists during this EA, the vegetation coverage kin th project includes artificial
woodland of 15-20 years masson pines, firs and deciduous trees mostly in low elevation areas and
second growth (secondary) forest of much diversified species mostly in areas above 400 m or
steep lope areas. Other vegetation coverage includes bamboo, bush, tea garden and agricultural
crops, with bamboo and tea as the major cash vegetation in the region. There are twelve
endangered vegetation species listed in the Class II state protective plants but they mostly grow in
higher altitude in the mountain while the HHIT will go through mostly valley and low elevation
areas. Within the area I km from the HHT alignment, except one tree found in Huangshan
District near the end of the highway, there is no protective vegetation species.
To determine the wildlife baseline, a larger area is selected which includes the entire area of
Qingyang county, Shitai county and Huangshan District. A site investigation during the EA
shows that within this area there are eight species of amphibians, 15 species of reptiles, 85 species
of birds, and 72 species of mammals. Among these wildlife, there are two provincial protective
species of amphibians, six provincial protective species of reptiles, one Class I and five Class II
state and 22 provincial protective species of birds, and three Class I (Neofelis nebulosa,
Muntiacus crinifrons and Cervus nippon), nine Class II state and nine provincial protective
species of mammals. Most of the wildlife are found in higher altitude mountainous areas, away
from area with active human activities.
The cultivated land is limited within the project area. The cultivated land is about 22% of the total
land area in Tongling county, 17% in Qingyang county and only 0.08% in Huangshan District.
The primary agricultural growths are tea, fruit, rice, bamboo and vegetables.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                   EA Executive Summary
Noise Baseline and Sensitive Receptors
Along the TTH alignment, a total of 64 villages/townships, five schools and two senior houses
are identified through field investigation as sensitive or otherwise vulnerable to changes in the
environment which surrounds them, such as air pollution, increased noise, construction dust, etc.
In addition, there are 33 schools, 4 clinics and 23 villages along the five rural roads. These
sensitive receptors are located about 20 to 80 m from expressway central line to the nearest points
in these sensitive receptors. To understand the noise baseline, a monitoring program was
conducted covering representative sensitive receptors. The results from the monitoring program
for the TTH area are presented in Table 3-2.

13       Shanchahedong village    K194+050 to K194+240      50.7        41.0
The above noise monitoring results show that both day and night time noise levels are mostly
below the applicable standards, except one village and one primary school, where noise levels
exceeded slightly the standards. This indicates the high acoustic quality in the high area,
including those areas near the existing provincial highway S103 because of the low traffic on
S103 and the absence of other noise sources in the area. The noise monitoring at three connecting
roads and four country roads also show high acoustic quality.
A similar noise monitoring program was also conducted for the rural roads. The results show that
all recorded levels are below to far below the applicable standards. If fact, most of the noise
levels monitored are below 50 dB(A) for day time and below 40 dB(A) at night, indicating a high
quality acoustic environment in these rural areas.
Surface Water Quality
The proposed TTH will intersect with several major surface water bodies including Shuiqiao lake,
Taiping lake, Puxi river and Machuan river, as well as several other smaller water bodies. The
field investigation shows that there is a water intake near the Lingyang river highway bridge and
two more on Puxi and Machuan rivers but about 4.5 km upstream from the proposed bridge sites
Surface water quality is monitored in Shuiqiao lake in a location near the TTH bridge in July
2002 and previous water quality data for other lake/rivers are used in baseline assessment.
Several major surface water bodies to be affected by the connecting and country roads are also
monitored between July 2002. The monitoring results are presented in Table 3-3.

Compared with the applicable standards, which are different for the above surface water bodies
based on their functional and quality zoning, water quality mostly complies with the standards
except permanganate index in Puxi river. Typically, permanganate index is high in the dry season
while SS is high in the flood season when soil erosion is at its worst. Within the project area,
there is no major industry or industrial discharge. Domestic wastewater from local residents is the
primary source of pollutant to the local surface water bodies.
The rivers intersected by the existing rural roads are of a high quality. In the 10 streams
monitored during the EA, COD was below 10 mg/L, BOD below 3 mg/L and SS below 24 mg/L,
except at one Xijing river at provincial highway S323, where SS is 99 mg/L
Air Quality
Existing ambient air quality was determined using data from monitoring station supplemented by
a monitoring program during the EA (July 2002). Three representative monitoring points were
selected for the air quality baseline: one (Taiping lake area) representing scenic sites and two
(Fenshiwu and Shachahedong villages) representing residential areas. The air quality data are
presented in Table 3-4..

The above results show that total suspended particulate (TSP), NO,, or NO2 measured at these
locations were all bellow applicable standards (Class I in the Air Quality Standards for scenic
sites and Class II for other sites), indicating high existing ambient air quality and high
assimilative capacity at the Project areas. Similar monitoring results were also obtained from the
connecting roads and rural roads. All measured air quality parameters met applicable standards,
confirming the high ambient air quality of the existing environment.
Cultural Property
A survey by a professional archeology and cultural relics institute was conducted between May to
June 2002 and again in October 2002, covering the main highway alignment, the alternative
alignments proposed and evaluated, connecting roads and all proposed borrow pits and waste
disposal sites. The survey included data collection and evaluation, walk-through of the entire
alignment, visual observation and sub-surface investigation through drilling. Local cultural relics
specialists visited sites proposed for borrow pits and disposal areas to conduct cultural relics

screening through primarily visual observations. A total of nine cultural relics were discovered,
including seven from the highway alignment and one each from a borrow pit and disposal site,
respectively. These sites may primarily be divided into following types: a dinosaur egg fossil site,
residential sites, a kiln site, a cultural temple and several tomb groups. While these relics sites are
from the New Stone Age to Qing Dynasty (1728 to 1911), none is significant enough to be
classified as state, provincial and city level protective cultural relic site. In three of these cultural
relics sites, the proposed TTH will go through the sites in the middle. Among these sites, only
one, the Wenchang Pagoda, is above ground and all others are underground and belonging to
archaeological finds.
There is only one above ground county level relics site (Wenchang pagoda) along one of the five
rural roads according to a field investigation by the same institute.
Socio-economic Baseline
The total population in the area crossed and serviced by the highway (Tongling county, Qingyang
county Shitai county and Huangshan district) is approximately 783,015 including 664,942 or
about 85% of the total. The total area in these three counties/district is 3841 km2, including only
less than I million mu (66,000 ha.) of cultivated land. Other key socio-economic indicators of the
project area are presented in Table 3-5.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 EA Executive Summary
4   Analysis of Alternatives
Four altemative highway corridors were first proposed, analyzed and compared. A preferred
corridor altemative was selected based on the overall least environmental and socio-economic
impacts. Then, five relatively short highway segment sub-alternatives were analyzed within the
preferred corridor alternative. The final expressway alignment, on which the TTH will be
constructed, is selected among the sub-alternatives along the preferred corridor altemative based
on the overall least environmental and socio-economic impacts. The four alternative expressway
corridors and five sub-alternative segments are shown in Map 3 and Map 4.
The four corridor altematives analyzed at the first stage are:
Alternative I: starting from the Tongling Changjiang bridge of Tongling county city and ending
at the Tongkou township of Huangshan District with a total length of 114.7 km (preferred
alternative).
Alternative II: Altemative II diverts from Panlong village and goes through the west of
Qingyang county, continues along a corridor west of the Altemative I and
eventually re-merged with Altemative I at Caojiawan township. The total length
of Altemative !! is 111.25 km, of which 46.6 km departs from Altemative I.
Alternative III: Altemative III diverts from the Altemative I alignment from Yangtian township,
goes through the east side of Taiping Lake and re-merged with Altemative I at
Gantang township. The total length of Alternative III is 108.95 km, of which 55
km departs from Altemative I alignment.
Alternative IV: Altemative IV differs from Alternative I at the south end. Instead going around
east of the Huangshan Mountain scenic site as in all other three altematives,
Alternative IV goes around from the west and has a different ending point. The
total length of Alternative IV is 143 km.
Alternative I is selected based on the relative low impacts to the major senic sites, low impacts to
the ecosystem including natural vegetation, ecosystem integrity and wildlife, low incremental
increase in noise levels although it has more sensitive receptors along its alignment than
Alternatives III and IV, least impacts to surface water body except Alternative IV, better
compliance with urban development plans, better topography and geological conditions, and
better connection to Huangshan mountain scenic site for effective promotion of tourism in the
region. Alternative I also received the support from the local governments and selection of this
alternative has been approved by APCD. Mitigation measures have been proposed and included
in the engineering design where appropriate as well as in the Project EMP for mitigating adverse
impacts expected to be caused by Altemative I, particularly in areas where Alternative I has
higher impacts than other altematives.
Within the preferred corridor alternative, five sub-alternatives are proposed in an attempt to
further optimize the highway alignment. These sub-altematives are analyzed against the preferred
alignment already selected through the corridor alternative analysis. In the following description,
the sub-altematives on the original Alternative I is re-named Sub-alternative A while other sub-
9



Tongling toTangkou Highway                                   EA Executive Summary
alternatives are named Segments B, C, D, E and F, respectively (see Map6-2 in the main EIA
report for details). The segments are:
Segment B:   BI is proposed against Segment A (original Alternative I) to shorten the Shuiqiao
lake bridge at the north end of the highway alignment. Compared with Segment
A, Segment B will go through less sensitive receptors, have lower impacts to
Shuiqiao lake, and less relocated houses, but it will occupy more cultivated land
be more difficult to construct and require higher capital cost. With all factors
considered, particularly the opinion of APCD and the difficulties expected during
construction, Segment A is still selected. Effective mitigation measures,
particularly noise control measures in sensitive receptors will be implemented to
mitigate the impacts.
Segment C:   Segment C is proposed in the Hamoling and Qixi river section of the highway
near the north end, with the consideration of better engineering conditions.
Compared with Segment A, Segment C will have more sensitive receptor,
occupy more land, higher potential construction safety concern, and higher
impacts to the existing highway S103, although it will have less impacts to Qixi
river. With all factors considered, Segment A is selected.
Segment D:   Segment D alignment, located from K124 to K 143, will be smoother and 1777 m
shorter than Segment A. The comparison of the two segments are mixed:
Segment D will be go through less sensitive receptors, have less impacts to the
ecosystem near the Jiuhuashang mountain area, less construction safety concern,
less community severance, support of the local county government; while at the
same time, it will have higher impacts to Taiping lake, agriculture, S103,
resettlement, and cultural relics. Based on the overall environmental impacts, the
EA team concluded that Segment D is a better alternative, but this conclusion
was rejected by APCD primarily on the ground of construction cost and
opposition of villages along the alignment. APCD is however, willing to adopt all
necessary mitigation measures developed by the EA team to addressed the
potential impacts associated with Segment A.
Segment E:   Segment E is proposed also based on the considerations of alignment orientation
and configuration. Compared with Segment A, Segment E will have higher
impacts on sensitive receptors, cultivated land, surface water, Huangshan
mountain scenic view, and the strong opposition from Huangshan district
government and Huangshan Mountain Management Committee, although it will
have less impacts to ecosystem particularly in the Shilishan mountain area,
resettlement and cultural relics. With all factors considered, Segment A is
considered to have the overall less environmental impacts than Segment E and is
selected.
Segment F:   In order to reduce the number of tunnels thus to reduce the cost, Section F is
proposed. Compared with Segment A, Segment F will have higher impacts on
cultivated land, surface water and ecosystem, although it will have less impacts
to sensitive receptors, resettlement and construction safety. With all factors
considered, Segment A is considered to have the overall less environmental
impacts than Segment F and is selected.
The connecting roads are partially on the existing roads and partially new. The selection of the
road alignments is based on the need for upgrading which will significantly improve the road

conditions, as well as engineering considerations. The rural roads are mostly upgrading of the
existing roads which conveniently link the villages. The alternative would be build the road on
green field which would occupy more land, and affect more people with regard to resettlement
and relocation.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                   E4 Executive Summary
5   Environmental Impacts
5.1   Ecosystem
The TTH alignment has been carefully selected along the valley with elevations no higher than
350 m to specifically avoid occupying or close to sensitive ecosystems such as those nature
reserves and habitats for valuable vegetation and wildlife such as the high altitude mountainous
regions. However, complete avoidance of adverse impacts of this large infrastructure project
construction and operation to the ecosystem is not possible. The potential impacts could affect the
vegetation, wildlife, nature reserves and bio-diversity as described as follows.
The TTH will occupy a total of 297 ha of woodland or 43% of the total land occupied and cut
7310 trees including 4410 non-fruit trees. The highway may also affect the under-wood in the
project area resulting in adverse changes in vertical vegetation structure. Furthermore, the
highway will separate previously continuous woodland, forming a "forest gap" and change the
species along the road side. The construction activities and traffic of materials and people to the
area could also bring the risk of diseases and pest to the forest.
Both construction and operation could affect different species of wildlife, including amphibians,
reptiles, birds, mammals, as well as aqua-life. Activities affecting the wildlife include tree cutting,
earth work, explosion, machinery and vehicles noise, exhaust emission, lighting at night, traffic
on the roads, and severance, resulting potentially in reduced numbers, lowered re-productivity,
severed habitats, dis-orientation, confused or dis-ordered life cycles, etc. Some of such impacts
are reversible and will be recovered after mitigation or natural re-distribution such as occupation
of habitats of amphibians and reptiles. Others will be more permanent, such as habitat severance
to relatively large mammals.
The nature reserves are by themselves complete ecosystems. As the TTH will not pass through
these reserves, but only to go by the side, the direct impacts to these ecosystems are expected to
be limited. The impacts are however, more towards the visual and induced aspects, which will be
summarized in a separate section below.
Top specialists in bio-diversity in the country have been consulted and some of them retained
directly working on the EA. The bio-diversity assessment results show that the forest system
functions will not be significantly affected and those parts which will be, can be restored and
recovered through remediation and reclamation. The integration of the ecosystems in the project
areas will largely be intact following the highway construction and wildlife is not expected to
suffer major and permanent impacts. The major concerns about bio-diversity are however,
focused on induced or indirect impacts from highway construction and operation such as tourism
facilities, increased mobile population, invasion of foreign species and pest calamities.
In summary, the TTH avoid going through directly the integrated natural ecosystems and thus
will have limited impacts to the bio-diversity in the region. It will not cause extinction of any
species and any impacts to bio-diversity will primarily show as habitat fragmentation or species
community deformation and re-grouping, forest gaps, foreign species invasion, and habitat
occupation and/or severance.

The rural road component will be completely on the existing alignment involving only minor new
cut with no new cuts. The primary impacts to the ecosystem will be during the construction phase
the potential disturbance to animals by construction activities, illegal hunting of construction and
forest fire by carefree behaviors.
Pic.3 Forest Ecosystem
5.2  Noise
Construction Phase
Construction noise will be primarily from construction machinery. Based on the noise intensity
and compounded effect of simultaneous operation of multiple machines, an noise attenuation
model predicts that at approximately 40 m from construction machines ior day time and 200 m at
night, the noise levels will be reduced to below the applicable day time noise standards. It will
take about 200 m for the noise to meet the standards at night. There are only very small of
residents who live within 40 m from the construction sites so the impacts will be very limited.
There are, however, much more people within the 200 m area from the construction sites. There
would be a significant noise impacts if construction machines operate at night. In addition,
residents living on both sides of access roads will be impacted by the elevated noise levels from
increased traffic of construction transportation vehicles.
Operation Phase
Noise levels for the 71 villages, schools and seniors houses which are located near the proposed
highway are predicted for the years 2008, 2014 and 2022 for short, medium and long terms. The
results show that noise at all villages will be within the applicable day time standards but 19 will
slightly exceed the night standards in the short term. Six villages will exceed the day time
standards slightly and that number will increase to 28 for the night time in medium term. For long
term at 2022, 20 will exceed the day time standards while 41 will at night by up to 9.2 dB(A). For
the five schools and two senior houses, noise levels will exceed the standards in all but one such
facilities, starting from 2008. The exceedance will be significant starting from 5-12.6 dB(A)
above the standards in the short term to 9.8 to 17.6 dB(A) over the long term (2022).
In the rural road component, nine schools and two clinics will exceed the applicable noise
standards slightly. Some of these exceedance will occur only over long term (2020).

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                   EA Executive Summary
5.3  Impacts on Water Environment
Construction Phase
This project will include 39 large and extra-large bridges and construction of these bridges and
other construction activities could impacts surface water quality. The impacts may occur through
oil leaking/dripping which then enter into the water bodies, re-suspension of sediment during in-
water construction, surface runoff contaminated with waste and/or materials piles, increased
suspended solids from surface runoff from construction sites near water and sewage from
construction camps. If not handled properly these activities will result in pollution of surface
water bodies near the construction, camps, or waste disposal sites. The area affected will
generally be a short distance downstream from the bridge or other near water construction sites
and the impacts will last the time of construction to shortly after construction activities cease.
Operation Phase
Wastewater sources from the operation phase will include sanitary sewage from service stations
and parking lots, car washing effluents and pavement runoff of the first flush in a rainfall event.
The wastewater from point sources, totaling 101,178 m3/year, will be treated biologically to the
applicable standards before discharge so the impacts will be limited. The surface runoff are very
small compared with the receiving river flows and as such the impact, in term of the incremental
increase in major water pollutants from such sources, such as SS and petroleum oil, is expected to
be insignificant, based on modeling result (all less than 0.2%).
The transportation of hazardous materials could pose a risk of water contamination from traffic
accidents occurring near the rivers which involve vehicles loaded hazardous materials and result
in major spills. Based on the frequencies of occurrence of such severe accidents, the prediction
results indicate that there exist a very small probability (from 0.1% up to 1.9%) of water
contamination from this source. The probably will increase over years as traffic increases
according to the forecast, from the above figures in the opening year of 2008 to 0.2-2.5% in 2014
and 0.9-3.3% in 2022. If these accidents do happen, catastrophic consequence may result to water
quality, aquatic life, ecosystem including birds and other wildlife who depend on these surface
water bodies, health and safety of the people living downstream from the accident locations.
5.4   Air Impact
Construction Phase
Airbome dust will be a primary air contaminant during the construction phase. The sources of the
dust will primarily be unpaved access roads, disposal areas, materials storage areas and
transportation. The factors affected dust airbome will include climate conditions, mainly wind
speed and directions and moisture in the ambient air, and type of construction activities. The
impact area can be 150 to 200 m from the source of dust based on construction site and road side
tests. Another source of air emission is asphalt and concrete mixing stations. The impacted area
can be 100 m leeward from the source according to a MOC study in 1999.
14



Tongling to Tangkou Highway                                EA Executive Summary
Operation Phase
An motor vehicle emission model and air pollutant dispersion model are used in the EA to
forecast the impact of exhaust emission of motor vehicles on the TTH. The modeling results
indicate that in Taiping lake section and a high mountainous section where dispersion conditions
are among the poorest, NO2 concentrations are expected not to exceed the standard (Class I) in all
forecast years (2008, 2014 and 2022). However, the concentrations will increase over the same
period along with the increase in motor vehicle traffic on the highway. Similarly, projected data
show that air contaminant concentrations will be well below the applicable standards in the rural
road areas, indicating no significant impact to ambient air quality from this component.
The TTH is expected to contribute to the reduction of global warming gases when compared with
the same traffic on other existing highways in this transportation corridor. Compared with the
without Project scenarios, it is expected that more NO2 (by 67%) but less CO (by 41 %) and THC
(by 36%) will be generated. This is due to the significantly increased motor vehicle speeds on the
highway and smoother motor vehicle speeds (less acceleration, deceleration and idling) over
motor vehicle traffic on the existing S103 and partly on state highway G205.
5.5  Socio-economic Impact
Maior scenic sites
Construction of the TTH will greatly improve transportation conditions and as such more tourists
are expected to visit Huangshan mountain, Jiuhuashan mountain and Taiping lake, as well as
other scenic sites within the project area. Compared with the forecasted increase in tourists and
available receiving and service facilities in the three major scenic sites, all will have sufficient
service capacity to cope with the future increase to about 2014 for Huangshan, and 2024 for
Jiuhuashan. Taiping lake has not been a well developed tourist site yet as it is hardly known
among tourists.
The receiving environment will have increased burdens from the increasing tourists brought in
large by the completion of the TTH. This will mainly include increased domestic wastewater
from tourists and hotels, increased garbage generation and potential littering, motor exhaust gas
in parking area, construction of new operation and service facilities which will occupy lands, cut
trees, and obstruct the views. If not handle properly such induced impacts will result in pollution
of the valuable and often sensitive natural and tourist resources at these scenic sites.
Land occuDation
The TTH will occupy a total of 9365 mu (624 ha) of land, including 4441 mu cultivated land,
4052 mu of wood land and 76 mu of tea garden. To demonstrate the level of impacts, the land
occupied by the highway represents about 0.24, 1.1 and 1.2% of the total cultivated land in
Tongling, Qingyang and Huangshan respectively, 0.03, 0.15 and 0.14% of the total woodland and
0, 0.07, 0.43% of the total tea gardens in these three counties/district. The land impacts from the
regional perspective are insignificant. The rural roads will be basically upgrading of existing
roads with little occupation of new land.
15



Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 E4 Executive Summary
Local economy
The TTH will greatly improve the transportation conditions in the project region, speed up the
movement of people, goods and information, help the flow of the local agricultural produce to the
outside, and increase the income of local residents through sales of their products and
employment opportunities from highway construction and operation. The highway will also
provide much improved transportation conditions to the tourist attraction sites in the area bringing
increased tourists who will consume locally. The improved infrastructure conditions in the
regions will also render the area more attractive to outside investment. All of these will help
promote the local economy and reduce the poverty in the region.
Interchanges and connection roads
Through several interchanges and ramps/connection roads, the TTH will connect with area roads
and urban centers. Such as G318, S103, S325 and G205, as well as all major urban areas and
scenic sites. While such connections provide the convenience to residents and visitors alike, they
could also bring adverse impacts to the local areas including increased motor vehicle emissions
and noise, increased solid waste, potential spread of epidemic diseases, and traffic accidents.
Communitv severance
Because the highway will be fully fenced with only limited access, it will separate farmland and
rural communities from one another on both sides of the highway. In total, 15 townships and 48
villages including will be affected for access to farmland, services, schools, markets, and/or other
parts of the communities. In the highway design, some 156 pathways and 12 overpasses have
been included, averaged one in every 680 m. IN the affected villages, such pathways will be
about 100 to 200 m each. However, rural houses located away from the villages may not always
be benefited from the pathways and severance impacts could be significant to these farmers. The
separation of irrigation channel and other hydraulic facilities have been minimized through the
inclusion in the design of some 297 culverts and 104 overhead bridge channels.
Cultural Relics
According to the report prepared by of Anhui Provincial Relics and Archaeological Research
Institute during the Project EA, the proposed highway will go through seven cultural relics sites.
Some of these sites will be partially occupied by the highway but none of the sites are of high
cultural or archaeological values as there is no state, provincial or county level sites among them.
Preservative excavation will be conducted at the sites which will be partially occupied prior to the
start of the construction. Besides the existing sites, chance finds during construction, if not
properly and promptly protected, could also be impacted or damaged.
Health and Safety
Health risks are primarily related to increased transit population during construction (construction
workers) and operation (visitors) in the regions. The increased mobile population could
potentially bring and spread infectious diseases in the Project area. The in-hygiene and un-healthy
life style of the workers could spread diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS to local residents as
well as among themselves.
The safety risk is primarily in the construction phase with the local residents, particularly children
who have little awareness of construction site safety in a linear construction sites with virtually no
16



Tongling toTangkou Highway                                   EA Executive Summary
access control along the expressway alignment. The explosion operation for deep cut and
materials borrowing and the resulting flying stones, as well as explosive handling, will be among
the most dangerous activities on the construction sites which pose risks to residents. The
explosive operation could also affect the safety and structure integrity of houses in a 500 m radius
area through strong vibration of the explosion as well as possible damaging to roof tiles and
windows from flying stone and dibris from explosion.
Huangshan mountain region
Besides Huangshan mountain itself, areas near Huangshan mountain could also be adversely
impacted. Such impacts include mainly dis-ordered development of service facilities and senic
sites, and impacts on Shacha village which, as the end of the TTH will be the location for a major
interchange, toll station and management center. The small village will see much higher
permanent and visiting people affecting their daily life as well as the surrounding environment.
5.6   Soil Erosion
Soil erosion will occur during the TTH construction phase when surface vegetation and soil are
damaged or disturbed. The primary area of potentially increased soil erosion includes deep cuts,
high fills, earth borrow pits, construction waste/excessive earth disposal sites, temporary
construction sites, treatment of special geological conditions and other areas where surface soil
will be disturbed. According to the modeling result, the soil erosion intensity will reach
1.256x106 t for the whole construction period in the entire project affected area, higher than the
current level of soil erosion over the same number of years if there were no project. The increased
soil erosion will also occur in the early of the operation phase in areas where vegetation planting
is applied for rehabilitation of disturbed soil. According to research result of the Academy of
Sciences of China, soil erosion reduction may be reduced 80-100% only after the first three years
of appropriate vegetation planting. Within the first three years, the efficiency of soil holding and
erosion control by the newly planted vegetation will be limited. However, the soil erosion will be
fully controlled immediately in areas where disturbed soil is paved by concrete or stone.
5.7   Visual Impacts
The TTH could potentially generate visual impacts to scenery particularly those well known and
beautiful scenic sites through disrupting the continuity of the natural landscape, occupying and
damaging the scenic sites and creating a conflict between the highway image and natural scenery.
In particular, the impact could come from high fills and deep cut which seriously alter the natural
topography and terrain, bridges, disposal sites, borrow pits, service areas, toll stations and
management centers whose large buildings and structure could cause striking visual effects to the
otherwise completely natural setting. Some of these impacts are of a temporary nature such as
borrow pits and disposal sites which can be restored through well planned landscaping. Others are
more permanent and may only be mitigated or reduced through careful design to avoid eye
catching effect and to harmonized into the background landscape to the maximum extent possible.

5.8  Resettlement and Relocation
The resettlement and relocation of the proposed TTH will occupy permanently 9365 mut or 624 ha
of land, involving four counties/district, 15 townships, and 48 villages. The total directly affected
households who will lose their houses will be 191 with 723 people, who will lose their land will
be 2611 with 9963 people and who will lose both houses and land will be 279 with 1092 people.
The total house areas to be dismantled to give a way to the highway will be 86,614 m2. In
addition, the highway will also occupy yards, water wells, walls, tombs, trees, irrigation systems,
country roads, utilities and a factory within the project are. The impacts will also include mis-
management of land and house compensation funds, unsatisfactory with land re-assignment and
insufficient compensation for house replacement. However, in general, the new houses following
the relocation are expected to be better and bigger than the houses they replace with using the
resettlement and relocation compensation funds, representing an improvement of housing
conditions and the standards of living.
The total cost of resettlement and relocation, including compensation to all affected, is estimated
to be RMB 158.9.5 million.
5.9  Safeguards Policies Assurance
The EA team conducted a screening for ten safeguard policies of the World Bank and, when
triggered by the Project conditions, full assessment. The safeguard policies which are
incorporated in the EA include Environmental Assessment (OP4.01), Natural Habitat (OP4.04),
Cultural Property (OP4.1 1), Involuntary Resettlement (OP4.12), Forest (OP4.36) and Public
Disclosure (BP 17.50). Those safeguards which have gone through an initial screening but found
not warrant a full assessment include Pest Management (OP4.09), and Indigenous Peoples
(OD4.20). The remainder safeguards are not applicable because the Project does not have any
components involved these safeguards issues. These include Safety of Dam  (OP4.37),
International Waterways (OP7.50) and Disputed Areas (OP 7.60).

Tongling to Tangkou Highway                                  EA Executive Summary
6   Mitigation
For the adverse environmental impacts of the TTH, the EA team has developed a series of
measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate or otherwise compensate the adverse impact from the
project. These mitigation measures are summarized below.
6.1   Design Phase
Bio-diversity
The following mitigation measures will be incorporated into the highway design:
The, highway alignment will be carefully selected to avoid occupying the core of or otherwise
sensitive ecosystems;
Carefully selecting vegetation species during landscaping planning;
At the highway sections K138-K160 and K173+500-K193 where wildlife may be active, 1.5-2 m
of thick bush will be planted to avoid the impacts of motor vehicles lighting at night;
At Huangshan mountain, Shilishan mountain and Yangmei village areas, 21, 18 and 5 animal
pathways will be constructed respectively; and
"Vertical plantation" at the interchanges (planting hanging from top), bridges and other buildings
and structures to the extent possible.
Noise
A number of measures to minimize noise have been incorporated into the design for sensitive
receptors at which the noise level is predicted to exceed the applicable standards. These measures,
and the proposed implementation time, are summarized in Table 6-1.
__________________ Table 6-1 Noise Miti gation Measures
Implementation Times   Estimated cost
Mitigation Measures  Implementation Places  (year)                 (RMB x1O00)

I senior house         Prior to 2008           400
In addition, in several villages where no mitigation measures are planned because the predicted
noise levels are below the applicable standards, increased noise monitoring will be implemented
to ensure the actual noise levels after expressway operation comply with the predictions.
Mitigation measures will be taken if the monitored data show noise levels exceed the standards.
Noise insulation windows will be installed to the first row of impacted houses. The
implementation time is determined based on the noise prediction results. Basically the measures
19



Tongling toTangkou Highway                                   EA Execunve Summary
will be implemented prior to the noise levels exceeding the standards at the application locations.
Similar measures and application principles will also be taken at sensitive receptors along the
connecting roads and rural roads where noise level is predicted to exceed the applicable standards.
Water
To minimize the impact on water quality, wastewater treatment facilities will be designed and
built at the service areas, including motor vehicle maintenance and repair shops, car washing
operations, as well as other domestic facilities at the service areas along the highway. Two
separate treatment processes are to be applied: for car washing water, the processes include
sedimentation, oil/water separation and filtration and the final effluent is to be recycled for car
washing operation again. For domestic sewage, the treatment process will be sludge bed reactor
(SBR) and then discharged to the environment. These processes are based on mature and reliable
technologies and capable of meeting the applicable discharge standards.
Community Severance
To minimize the impacts of community and farmland severance in 15 townships and 48 villages
directly impacted, a total of 173 vehicle and pedestrian underpasses, 11 overpasses and 16 grade
separate crossings have been included in the project design. On average, there will be one
crossing for every 580 m of highway which is in theory the maximum distance the rural residents
have to walk before finding a pass to cross the expressway to the other side. On village basis,
there are 4.1 crossings per village. The provisions in the crossing design have been provided to
allow various farm vehicles to use as well as for future expansion.
Cultural Relics
Two sets of the mitigation measures will be taken during the design stage to minimize the
impacts to the cultural relics sites already identified. For Wanjiashong and Huangnixiang sites,
preservative excavation at the cultural relics sites will be conducted and completed prior to the
commencement of expressway construction. During this process, all valuable archaeological and
cultural articles from the sites will be uncovered, studies and kept by the county museum. The
excavated sites will be photographed, measured, documented or modeled if necessary before
handed over to contractors for expressway construction. For all other sites, the highway
alignment will be altered to avoid going through the site directly. Warning and public notice
boards will be erected in those sites to alert the public for site protection during construction and
operation of the highway.
Scenic sites
The construction of the TTH will induce an increase in tourists to the scenic sites in the project
regions. There are several environmental programs in these scenic sites including a major
environmental upgrading program for Huangshan mountain and Jiuhuashan mountain, funded
partially by the ADB. Furthermore, pollution control and environmental protection are major
components in the master plans for the scenic sites. These programs will be implemented, mostly
prior to the opening of the TTH in 2008. The specific mitigation measures will include locating
motor vehicle parking lot at 300 m away from the scenic sites, providing sufficient garbage bins
and washroom facilities, careful designing and siting the tourist facilities such as hotels,
encouraging tourists to have accommodation off the mountains, and moving pollution generation
operation such as laundry down the mountains.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                   EA Executzve Summary
Soil Erosion
To control soil erosion, permanent engineering works such as concrete and stone pavement on
deep slopes and other cut and fills areas are included in the design completely stabilize the soil
surface. Other works include interception ditches and landscaping. The borrow pits will be
rehabilitated through conversion all six borrow pits into landscaping following completion of
earth borrowing operation. For the 16 excessive construction waste disposal sites, retaining walls,
settling ponds, and drainage systems will be built. The stockpiles of the waste will be finally
covered with soil and landscaped. The same measures will be taken at all borrow pits and
disposal sties used for the connecting and rural roads.
Visual Impacts
The design of highway will follow the natural terrain as much as possible and will avoid deep cut
and high filling. For areas where deep cut or high fills cannot be avoided, mild slopes will be
adopted in the design so that they look natural. The channel entrance and exits will be shaped to
match the surrounding environment. For the service, the structure color will be selected such that
it will be melted into the background colors. For outstanding and eye-catching structures such as
interchanges and bridges, the architecture should have local characters and configurations which
harmonize with the surrounding scenery and landscape.
Resettlement and Relocation
All relocated residents will be properly compensated and received training for new employment.
Special consideration will be given to the elderly, illiterate and farmers in terms of compensation.
For people whose sources of well water will be disrupted by the construction by the construction
of tunnels, additional water wells and other water supply sources will be developed.
6.2   Construction Phase
Bio-diversity
The temporary land uses will be re-stored promptly following their uses. For the most sensitive
construction activities, i.e., those in the woodland or near natural habitats (e.g., K138-K160 and
K173+500-K193 sections), forest authority will be noticed first. Where necessary, protective
zones will be first defined or protection walls/slopes built. Noise construction such as explosion
will be avoided at night when wildlife are most active. Other mitigation measures during
construction include careful selection of borrow pits and waste disposal sites, strictly control of
uses of wood products from outside, contractors education and training, and close supervision and
monitoring.
Construction Noise
Large and noisy construction activities will kept away from populated areas (150 m minimum).
Operation of loud construction machinery and major construction activities will strictly restricted
to the day time. Temporary noise barriers will be constructed to protect the sensitive receptors
from the impact of construction noise. Construction traffic will be directed to avoid sensitive
locations and completely banned at night time.
21



Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 E4 Executive Summary
Water
To minimize adverse impacts to surface water during construction, cofferdam techniques will be
used in bridge column construction with complete isolation of work areas. River crossing
construction activities will be scheduled to the extent possible during the low flow periods. The
discharge from construction camps will be a potential source water contamination. To mitigate
the potential impact, no sewage from construction camps will be allowed to discharge without
treatment. The sewage will be either held at the site and empties to treatment facilities regularly
or through on site treatment such as septic tank to meet the irrigation discharge standards.
Air
Unpaved access road and construction sites will be water sprayed twice a day (once in the
morning and once in the afternoon), or more frequent on dry and windy days to suppress airborne
dust. The mixing stations and other point sources of air emissions will be located leeward far
enough from sensitive receptors (300 m minimum). Trucks loaded with soil and other dusty
materials, as well as materials stockpiles will be covered with canvas. Temporary access roads
will be located away from residential areas to the extent possible and exits to truck parking places
will be covered with bamboo sheet or straw sheet if necessary to prevent the dust from airborne.
Cultural Relics
A procedure for handling "chance finds" will be prepared and provided to the contractors, who
will be requested to halt construction until the chance finds have been studied by professional
archaeologists. Contractors may resume work at the site only if so instructed by authorities and
cultural relics specialists following their on site investigation. Contractors will be educated to
strictly follow the procedures during the construction. In fact, the requirements will be included in
the construction contract so that they will be contractors' contractual obligations. The procedure
calls for immediate halt of construction activities and contact relevant authorities. All contractors
and construction supervision companies will receive training on the basic knowledge of cultural
relics identification and protection, as well as the procedures when encounter chance finds during
construction.
Contractor Management
Experience with previous World Bank financed highway projects in China, including the Anhui
Highway Project I in this same province, have indicated that high awareness and full participation
of contractors in environmental management during the construction phase are critically
important to ensure environmental performance and pollution control at the construction sites.
Environmental protection will start from pre-qualification of contractors when environmental
awareness and management systems will be an evaluation criterion. The environmental mitigation
measures, management and monitoring plans will be incorporated into bid documents to ensure
there will be sufficient funding prepared by the bidding contractors for these activities and the
environmental management will be contractual obligations to the contractors. Finally, short
course training will be provided to all winning contractors and construction supervision on
environmental policies and regulations, potential impacts, mitigation measures, daily monitoring
and reporting, and emergency handling.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 EA Executive Summary
6.3  Operation Phase
Ecosystem
Pest management station will be built on both ends of the highway and motor vehicles suspended
of carrying forest pest will be inspected and controlled. Vehicles homing will be banned in
sections where wildlife are frequented. The highway operators will be requested to establish
contacts with Wannan (South Anhui) Wildlife Emergency Center, to exchange information and
save wildlife during incidents involving wounded animals along the TTH.
Noise
No new school, hospital or other sensitive facilities will be allowed to build within 200 m from
the central line of the highway or 37 to 50 m from the central line of the connecting roads to
prevent noise impacts to these facilities in the future. Traffic management will be enforced and
motor vehicles will not be allowed to speed or horn while going through sections near sensitive
receptors such as schools, seniors houses, etc. These bans will be informed to drivers through
traffic control boards/signs along the highway as well as along all five rural roads.
Air emission
Motor vehicle air emissions control requires integrated approach from numerous government
agencies as well as private sector stakeholders. The province will enforce applicable standards for
motor vehicles and fuels and implement the motor-vehicle inspection programs to minimize the
air emissions from the increased motor vehicle traffic on the highway.
Water and transportation of hazardous materials
Leaking vehicles, whether from their fuel tanks or from the containers they carry, will not
allowed to use the highway as it will go several sensitive and ecologically valuable surface water
bodies. The province will set up a leading group involving relevant government agencies to
handle transportation of hazardous materials and emergency response in an event of a traffic
accident involving trucks located with hazardous materials, particularly in sensitive locations
such as bridges or other places near surface water bodies. Licensing and permitting procedures
will be strictly enforced to control the traffic involving hazardous materials on provincial
expressway, connecting road and rural roads network.
Monitoring
Extensive environmental monitoring programs will be implemented during both construction and
operation phases (details below) to ensure that adverse environmental impacts are as projected
during the EA and the mitigation measures proposed will be implemented and effective. In
adequate mitigation or new adverse impacts emerged beyond the EA prediction will be detected
by the monitoring programs promptly and appropriate new actions will be taken to address them.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 EA Executive Summary
7 Environmental Management Plan
An environmental management plan (EMP) has been developed in a separate and stand alone
document. The EMP includes policies basis and applicable environmental standards,
environmental management system, mitigation measures and monitoring plans for both the
construction and operation phases.
7.1  Objectives
The EMP provides a framework for the implementation of mitigation measures and
environmental management and monitoring during the Project implementation. As such, it
represents the commitment of Project proponent as well as the govemments of the Project area
for environmental protection, pollution control and impact minimization. More specifically, the
EMP is to:
* Set out the legal and policy framework as well as applicable environmental standards with
which the Project will be compliance;
* Identify and design with sufficient details and specifics of mitigation measures for adverse
impacts of the Project;
* Specify institutional roles and responsibilities for mitigation measures implementation and
environmental management during Project;
* Outlines the requirements for environmental monitoring programs and reporting needs; and
 Provides a stand alone document which may be used during Project implementation for
Project supervision.
7.2  Management and Supervision Organizations
There will be two layers of organizations who will be responsible for environmental performance
of the Project. The first is environmental management organizations including the Environmental
Office of the Ministry of Communications, the Anhui Provincial Communications Department
(APCD), the Project Management Office (PMO) which is the Project proponent, the highway
company to be established which will be responsible for the expressway operation and various
technical groups for environmental monitoring and design. The other group is the environmental
supervisory organizations which include SEPA and Environmental Protection Bureaus of
different levels of govemment in the Project region.
7.3  Environmental Monitoring
The EMP includes environmental monitoring programs for both construction and operation
phases. The parameters to be monitored include resettlement, soil erosion, noise, dust,
degradation of water quality, stream sedimentation, solid waste disposal, and electromagnetic
radiation. During the construction phase, environmental monitoring will be conducted in two
approaches: daily and routine monitoring consisting of mainly visual observations and limited
equipment measurements such as hand-hold noise meters; and periodic monitoring by
24



Tongling toTangkou Highway                                      EA Executive Summary
professionals using standard methods recognized by regulatory authorities. Monitoring reports
will be compiled at intervals of once every three to four months, summarizing the findings of the
monitoring. The reports will be submitted to project proponent as well as relevant agencies and
the World Bank. During the operation phase, noise levels will be monitored once a month for the
first six months and once every six months thereafter. Soil erosion will be monitored once every
six months, while air and water quality will be monitored once a year. The specific monitoring
programs for air, noise and water are summarized in Table 7-1 through Table 7-3.

7.4  Institutional Strengthening and Training
To ensure the environmental performance of the Project, the EMP emphasizes the institutional
building and strengthening. Besides an organizational structure involving various management
and supervision organizations for environmental decision making, monitoring, reporting and
further mitigation planning and implementation, the EMP includes detailed programs for
personnel training. The programs involve training aboard and domestically for professional,
managerial and technical personnel from the governments, project proponent and operation units,
environmental institutions and contractors and construction supervisions.
The environmental training for contractors and construction supervisions will be held prior to the
commencement of construction. The objective is to ensure that each contractor and construction
supervision unit will have staff on site full time for environmental monitoring on a daily basis.
The training will cover the basic knowledge of environmental protection and pollution control,
the result of EIA and requirements of EMP, methodology of site environmental management and
monitoring, and reporting requirements. The training for APCD, PMO, the expressway company,
and environmental institutions will cover environmental management, regulatory framework,
applicable environmental standards and their implications to the Project, mitigation planning,
environmental decision making and pollution control technologies. Some of this training will be
carried out overseas.
7.5   Estimated Cost for Environmental Management
The cost for environmental management and mitigation measures have been estimated and
included in the Project budget. The estimated cost is summarized in Table 7-5.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 E4 Executive Summary
8   Public Consultation and Information Disclosure
Two rounds of public consultation have been carried out during the EA: the first round at the
preparation of EA terms of reference (TOR) between April 4-29, 2002 and the second round at
draft EA reports between June 17 to July 5 2002. Various techniques have been used in public
consultation, including public opinion surveys through questionnaires, public meetings at villages
and with local people's representatives, and interviews with affected groups and individuals. The
people consulted included mainly those who will be affected directly by the project. Relevant
government and non-government organizations and experts on various environmental and socio-
economic issues have also been consulted. In total, 2348 people have participated in public
consultation program.
The public consultation was also extended to tourists who will also be affected by the projects. In
total, 100 copies of a questionnaire were randomly distributed to tourists in Huanghshan
mountain, including 20 foreign tourists. The EA team received 97 completed copies. Among
those surveyed, only 17.5% came to the site through the highway corridor (using S103) and many
felt the transportation is inconvenient or very inconvenient (57.7% and 28.% respectively). The
majority of the tourists wished to see the highway constructed (81.4%) and considered protection
of Huangshan mountain and provide convenient transportation are equally important (78.4%).
The EA team interviewed 60 people including relocated persons, teachers, management staff
from the scenic sites, etc. In addition, they consulted eight township governments, seven local
People's Congress, local tourism bureau, forest bureau, nature reserve management authority, etc.
These individuals and groups expressed their views on the highway construction and suggestions
for mitigation.
In addition, the EA team also consulted the affected public along the five rural roads in May 10-
31, 2002. In total, 291 affected local residents, local government officials and local school
teachers participated in public meetings, 211 in interviews and 245 in a questionnaire survey. The
primary concern raised through the public consultation is increased noise and impact to traffic
during construction.
The EA team has responded the public concerns including setting up land acquisition and
resettlement offices under APCD to develop, supervise and implement resettlement action plan
(RAP), constructing underpasses and over-crossings with provisions for farm vehicles and future
expansion to mitigate community severance impacts, install fences at the sensitive sections of the
connecting roads to provide safety protection to students, residents and livestock, install noise
insulation windows, add the height to perimeter walls and plant trees to minimize the impacts of
noise from the expressway and connecting roads, and provide full consideration to local economy
and transportation needs such as appropriately locating access ramps/exits and interchanges,
employment opportunities during construction, etc.
In compliance with EIA process requirements of Chinese govemment and the World Bank, the
completed draft EIA and EMP reports as well as part of the public consultation records were
distributed in public places along the highway, such as libraries, townships, etc. The concerned
public can have the access to and review of the reports at these places. In addition, the Project
information and availability of the reports were advertised in Anhui Daily, the provincial wide
newspaper and two of the most popular internet web sites in the province (one of which is a
nation wide website). The public consultation and information disclosure are summarized in the
tables below. The EA team plans to disclose the final EA reports in public places to the general
public once the final version is completed.

Tongling toTangkou Highway                                 EA Executive Summary
9   Conclusions
The Tongling to Tangkou highway or the TTH, as well as the five rural roads in the South Anhui
region, will play an important role in alleviating transportation bottleneck between provincial
capital Hefei and world renowned tourist site Huangshan mountai, promoting regional economic
development, improving access to market and services, and the standard of living, and assisting in
poverty alleviation. As a segment of a major transportation trunk road in China, the TTH will also
contribute to the China's massive expressway network. The connecting roads provide a better link
between some major urban areas in the Project regions to the expressway. The rural roads will
significantly improve the access of remote rural areas to market, services and townships and
counties in all weather conditions.
The construction and operation of the highway will result in a number of adverse impacts to the
physical and socio-economic environrment in the Project regions. These impacts include damages
to the ecosystem, permanent occupation of land, vegetation and agriculture, increased soil erosion,
increased noise and air emissions along the highway alignment, particularly in the
environmentally sensitive receptors, community severance, increased burdens to Huangshan
mountain and other scenic sites, health and safety of local residents, water quality and irrigation
systems, and resettlement and relocations. Some of these impacts can be significant. The
construction and operation of rural roads will generate similar impacts to the extent although to a
much lesser extent as the rural roads will not occupy new land/alignment and have much less
traffic.
However, with the mitigation measures designed specifically for the adverse impacts, the impacts
will be prevented, reduced, minimized or otherwise compensated. Furthermore, an environmental
management systems involving environmental management and supervision organizations,
environmental monitoring, institutional strengthening and personnel training will be established
to ensure the environmental performance of the Project. The appropriate implementation of the
mitigation measures, as well as the environmental systems, the adverse impacts will be reduced to
acceptable levels. The Project is environmentally acceptable and feasible when mitigation
measures and EMP are implemented effectively.
