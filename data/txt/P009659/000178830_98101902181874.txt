REPORT AND RECOMMfiDATICN OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUIVE DIRMCTORS (N A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE GOVERNIMEN T OF fINDLK
FOR THE MAHARASHTRA AGCULTIRAL CREDIT PROJECT
1. *I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed Credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to
US$30 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an agricultural
credit project in Maharashtra State, Tndia.
PART I - INTRODUCTICN
2.        Since 1949, the Bank has made 40 loans amounting to US$1,111
million and the Association 40 credits amounting to US$1,696 milliom
both net of cancellations to India. Of these amounts, US$512 million
has been repaid and US$662 million is undisbursed. In keeping with
the importance of agriculture in the economy of India and with the
need to improve agricultural productivity, 23 loans and credits
(totalling some US$421 million) have been for agricultural or agricul-
ture related projects. In the last two years, there has been a
particular emphasis an agricultural credit. Six recent IDA operations
(US$186.9 million) were to finance agricultural credit projects in the
States of Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and
Mysore. The project now proposed in the State of Maharashtra would
be one more in this series. Similar projects in other States are to
be appraised this year and next. IFC has also supported agriculture
in India* Of the 11 caumitments since 1959, amounting to US$42.3
million, the two largest, Indian Explosives, Ltd. (US$11.5 mllion)
and Zuari Agro-Chemicals, Ltd. (US$1859 million)have been for ferti-
lizer production. A mmary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits
as at January 31, 1972 and IFC investments as at December 31, 1971 is
in Annex I.
3.        Of the undisbursed loans, the longest outstanding is
Loan 307-IN of 1961 to the Indian Iron Steel Corporation (IISCO)
for the development of its collieries0  My memorandum to the Executive
Directors of July 9, 1970 (R 70-135) proposing to postpone the Closing
Date to June 30, 1974 explained the technical and other problems which
beset this project. Since then, a consultant has been paying regular
visits to assist IISCO and there iserery reason to believe that dis-
bursements will be completed by June 1974.
4.        It was agreed in 1970 that the balance.of Credit 89-IN
(Beas Equipment ProJect) should be allocated to Stage II of the
project and major purchases will be made in 19720 Ih the Kadana
Irrigation Project (Credit 176-IN) the suspension of the main con-
tractor, long delays in submitting withdrawal applications in respect of
costs incurred  on canal constructim, rejection by IDA of bid awards and i

request for revision of the list of goods have all contributed to
slow disbursement. However, the supervision mission which visited
the project in November 1971, reported that work on the dam has
been resumed with departmental force account labour, agreement has
been reached on bidding procedures for additional equipment and
requests for reimbursement of civil works expenditures are now
being submitted.
5.        Gujarat (Credit 191-IN) and Punjab (Credit 203-IN), are
showing slower progress than anticipated. In Gujarat, however, dis-
bursements are beginning to pick up and show a recent acceleration
in lending for minor irrTigation. Disbursements will be made shortly
in respect of the first tranche of tractors ordered and arrangements
for the supply of the second and final tranche are well in hand. In
the Punjab project, which consists entirely of mechanizatiom, the
orders for the first 4I,000 tractors are expected to be plwaced in
March with substantial disbursements following within thre months.
These agricultural credit projects in India are new and rather
complex. As experience is gained with them, I fully expect that
progress will steadily improve.
6.        Disbursements of the Bank's recent loans to ICICI have not
kept up with original forecasts. The closing date of the Sixth
(414-IN) ICICI loan has been postponed twice; from December 31, 1969
to June 30, 1971 and again to June 30, 1972. The Seventh (515-IN)
ICICI loan has also had to be postponed by one year. These loans
were affected by the 1966-68 recession, which meant a substantial
lengthening of the interval between ICICI's approval of sub-projects
and the actual comitbment and disbursement of Bank funds. However,
the current outlook is better and more rapid disbursement is expected
in future. In fact, the Eighth loan to ICICI approved in June 1970
(Loan 683-IN) has been fully committed half a year ahead of schedule.
The loan for the Tarai Seeds Project (614-IN) is some nine onths
behind schedule in disbursing but tenders for all the machinery
required have now been approved (technical considerations in this
regard had caused some delay).
7.        The Maharashtra project vas prepared jointly with FA -under
the Cooperative Program and appraised in March/April 1971. Negotiations
were conducted in Washington during the week of January 17, 1972.
The Borrower was represented by Mr. M. A. Quraishi, Additional Secretary,
Ministry of Agriculture and by Mr. G. Venkataramanan, Deputy Secretary,
Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance. The Agricultural
Refinance Corporation was represented by its Chairman, Mr. P. N. Danry.
Mr. N, G. Abbyankar, Development Commissioner, Dr. V. M. Joshi,
Secretary, Finance Department, Mr. D. G. Tungare, Deputy Secretary,
Finance Department, Mr. R. J. Oak, Joint Director of Agriculture and
Mr. R. Venkataraman, Joint Director, Groundwater Survey and Development
Agency represented the Maharashtra Government. The Maharashtra Land
Development Bank was represented by its Managing Director, Mr. G. P.
Bhave.

PART II - THE ECONCMY
8.       An economic report entitled "Economie Situation and
Prospects of India" (SA-25a) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 24, 1971 (R 71-120) and a memorandum entitled
"India: Major Economic Issues" (R 71-249 datled November 9, 1971)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 9, 1971.
A country data sheet is attaohed as Annex II.
9.        Since the recessian of 1966-68, the Indian eoonaoa  has
grown at an average anmual rate of about 5 percent, largely reflecting
the encouraging progress of agriculture. Foodgrain production in
the last crop year reached 108 millm tons, which is 8.5 percent
above the level of the preceding year. This is due in part to
substantial investnent in irrigation and also to the increased and
more effective use of current inputs, such as improved seeds,
fertilizer and pesticideso But weather remains an important factor
both in agriculture and - because agriculture contributes nearly
half of India's GNP - in deternining overall economic growth.
10.       Manufacturing naw contributes about 20 percent of GNP.
India's current Five-Year Plan  (1969-74) aims at an annual growth
rate of 5.5 percent for the econonr as a whole, and an increase in
manufacturing output by about 8 to 10 percent a year in both the
organized and the small-scale industrial sectors. Medium and large-
scale industrial production rose by about 7 percent in both F! 1968
and FY 1969, by just over 5 percent in FY 1970 and remains low in FY
1971. The main reasons for this disappointing performace appear to
have been shortages of raw materials, especiaUly steel and cottan,
and also inadequate demand for investment goods reflecting the
shortage of financial resources. In contrast, small-scale fines seem
to have benefited directly from the advance of agriculture and have
made considerable gains.
11 .     The Government has followed strict budgetary and monetary
policies in recent years and net foreign exchange reserves are now
just over one billion dollars, During 1967-71 imports (especially
of food) came dawn sharply and, as a result, India's trade deficit
decreased from US$1.3 billion equivalent in Fr 1967 to US$130
million equivalent in F! 1971.
12        A major cause of concern has been the low rate of invest-
ment. Net investment was 12 percent of national income In FY 1970
against nearly 15 percent in F! 1966. Among the reasons for the low
level of investment is the sharp decline of net aid receipts frm
US$800 milIion in 1966/68 to about US$300 millon in 1 970/71.
13.      At the beginning of this fiscal year (April) the basis was
laid for substantial expansion of investment activity through the
introduction of additional taxes and an expected inoreased level of



- 4 -
public savings. However, events intervened before economic
development could benefit from these efforts. Large numbers of
refugees started coming across Indi4a s eastern border requiring
food and shelter. From December 3 to 16, there was open conflict
in the sub-continent. The majority of the 10 million refugees have
now returned to their homeland but the Indian Government is providing
substantial financial support for their resettlement and to the
econonm of Bangladesh.
14.       According to preliminary estimates, the net budgetary cost
of refugee support in the current Tndian fiscal year may be in the
order of US$285 million equivalent. By December 31, 1971, the
Government had incurred direct expenditures of about US$400 million
and estioated that a further US$40 million would have been spent by
Marc 1972. vI addition, repatriation of the refugee    is expected to
cost about US$40 nilion. Total budgetary expenditures may, therefore,
reach US$1480 aillion equivalente Against this figuPe, initernational
contributims received and pledged, excluding US$25 amillon eazizarked
by voluntary agencies for use in their own programs, amounted to
US$195 million. The financial burden imposed by the war on the
Government's budget is more difficult to estimate. About Rs. 12.5
billion or 3 percent of GNP was budgeted for defense expenditures for
this year* No supplementary appropriations for defense were sought
but some contingency funds may have been used. Direct expenditures
related to the hostilities may be roughly estimated at 5 percent of
the defense allocation, or about US$250 million equivalent.
15.       Special taxes for meeting refugees'costs were imposed in
October and may yield approximately US$45 million. Further taxes to
cover expenditures incurred during the emergency were introduced in
December and may yield a similar amount. The bulk of the funds
required to meet expenditures related to the refugee progt'& and the
armed conflict were apparently raised through recourse to deficit
financing. In fact, there are indications that the biidg6t deficit for
the fiscal year will substantially exceed the planned aibiit of
Rs. 2.3 billion.  Increased inflationary pressure would thus seem to
be the most serious economic problem arising from the refugees and
the war, and to the extent it cannot be contained, the effects will
be diffused throughout the economyi, affecting the level of real con-
suption as well as of real investment.
16.       In real ter3s food made up by far the largest Indian contri-
butiom to aid to refugee; but since India's stocks of foodgrains have
been and remain ample, the impact on the econamy has been deferred.
The disruption of trasport and ccmmmnications due to rmlitary
operatiAns was confined to the border areas and the dislocation of
productien has been minor.



-5-
170       Public sector investment has not been cut in monetary
terms   On the. other hand, the large increase in dficit financing
may well mean that the planned increase of investment will not
materialize in real terms. Futhermore, the additional taxation
introduced at the beginning and in the course of the fisoal year
may well reduce the level of private savingo and investment.
18.       The agricultural sector plays a predominant, crucial role
in the Indian econamy, accounting for about 50 percent of India's
aNP and absorbing 70 percent of the total labor force. Since almost
60 percent of total household consumption and 85 percent of household
coamuodity consumption is accounted for by agricultural products or
manufactures based principally on agricultural raw materials, the
achievement of growth in real income is eosentially dependent on the
growth of agricultural production. The requisiterate of expansion
in agricultural output in order to stay ahead of the demand for farm
products during this decade is estimated at slightly more than 5
percent per annum. For this reason, the Indian Fourth Five-Year
Development. Plan allocations for agrioultural, irrigation and flood
control investment are budgeted to average a little more than US$1
billion a years or roughly 24 percent of total plan outlay targeted
for the public sector plan. Although substantial progreos has been
achieved in recent years in foodgrain production, output of most
other cmmwdities has beea stagnating and strenuous efforts are needed
if India is to reach her agricultural denelopment targetas both in
terms of production for the domestio market as well as for agricul-
tural exports. A critioal input is agricultural oredit. The Reserve
Bank of India has estimated that credit institutions wl1 require to
finance an annual average agricultural investment of US$400 million
during the Fourth Plan period, ompared with lses than US$100 million
so invested in FY 1966. Short-tern credit requiremento needed are
projected to increase by 11 percent per year to a total of more than
US$2.5 billion in FY 1974.
PART III -   TE PROJECT
19.       A report entiled "Appraisal of Maharashtra Agrioultural
Credit Project"l (PA- 11l6(a) dated February 14,1 972) will be distributed

210       Under the project, wells and lift irrigation to be
provided are expected to irrigate some 100,000 ha, while land
development would be carried out on six major irrigation schemes
with a coamand area of 175,000 ha. In all, some 45,000 farmers
would be able to expand their output of food and commercial crops.
The annual increase in production is estimated at full development
at about 247,000 tons of foodgrains, 50,000 tons of seed cotton,
23,000 tons of groundnuts, 400,000 tons of sugarcane and 215,000
tons of bananase At current prices the annual value of this
additional production at fall development is about US$23 million
equivalent.
22.       The total project cost is estimated to be US$51.9 million,
of which the proposed Credit of US$30 mdllion would finance about
58 percent (minor irrigation US$22.7 million, land dd*l66e6t
US$2.7 million  equipment US$4.4 million and consultancy ' eS6irices
US$0.2 milli4m. IDA financing is based on: (a) the f6ilign exchange
cost of the project equipment and consultancy services and (b) the
foreiga exchange cost and one-half of the local cost of minoi'
irrigation and land development investments. IDA finaiicing of
foreign exchange items would amount to about US$9 million (or 31
percent of its total contribution), whilst local currency financing
would total about US$21 million. This substantial financing of local
costs is necessary if the Bank Group is to make an effective contri-
bution to agricultural development in India, which, characteristically,
involves a small foreidg exchange component. The more general case
for local.expanditure financing has been discussed in recent economic
reports, including Chapter X of the economic report distributed on
May 24, 1971 (R 71-120)0
23.       Most of the proceeds of the credit would be ie&t to farmers
in Mabarashtra for on-farm investments in minor irrigatidni and land
development throagh the Agricultural Refinance Corporation (ARC),
whioh would refinance the Maharashtra State Cooperative Land Develop-
ment Bank (LDB) and its federated Primary Banks as well as selected
commercial banks lending to farmers under the project. As in earlier
credits, the participating commercial banks would be required to
accept the same terms and conditions of lending as the LDB. In
addition, the project would include financing for well-drilling,
earthmoving and hydrological equipment, and for consultancy services
to assist in the proper exploitation of groundwater resources.
24.       Farmers' contributions, in the case of loans from the LDB,
would be 10 percent of the cost of their individual investmnmts,
(except that small farmers Would not be required to make a down-
payment for minor irrigation investments) and a share contribution
to LDB capital equal to 10 percent of the amount of their loans.
The remaining finance needed would be provided in the first
instance by the LDB or participating commercial banks; ARC, in turn,
would refinance 90 percent of LDB and commercial bank lending for
minor irrigation and 75 percent for land development. The Credit
would supply about 66 percent of ARC support for the project.



-7
25.       Approzdmately, US$4.6 million of the proposed Credit
would be made available to the Maharashtra State government to
finance the well-drilling, earthmoving and hydrological equipment
required for the project, as well as a cmtributimn to consul-
tancy services. Approximate3,y, US$25.4 illimn would be onlent
to ARC in support of the credit program. ARC would repay at the
end of nine years at an interest rate of 5-4 percent in the case
of loans to ultimate Borrowers not exceeding this period, and the
balance after fifteen years at 6 percent in the case of the longer
maturities. These are-the rates which have applied to GOI lending
since June 1971* In each case, the interest rate would be reduced
by 1/4 percent for prompt payment. ARC, which is already acting
as the supervising and refinancing agency for the other six
agricultural credit projects and an agro-aviation project, would
refinance loans by the LDB and the participating commercial banks
at 6-1/2 percent per annum. These banks would lend to individual
farmers at 9 percent per annum.
26.       Drilling rigs, land reclamation machinery and hydrological
equipment are to be procured under the usual arrangements for
international competitive bidding, with Indian suppliers receiving
a margin of preference of 15 percent or the existing level of
import duties, whichever is less. The prevailing customs duty is
30 percent for drilling rigs and earthmoving machinery for agricul-
tural purposes.
27.       The economic rates of return are estimated to range from
33 to 55 percent for minor irrigation and 39 percent for land develop-
ment. Financial rates of return to farmers would also be high, being
estimated at current producer prices to range from 40 to 73 percent
for minor irrigation investments and about 60 percent for land
development.
28.       The first five of the agricultural credit projects were in
states with comparatively strong institutions, but with the sixth
(Mysore) substantial rehabilitation of the LDB system was required
in order to make it a suitable channel for IDA funds. A similar
situation exists in Maharashtra, where a background of poor lending
practices and weak collection discipline has resulted in a serious
overdues position going back over many years. In 1970/71, this was
exacerbated by a severe drought in the State. As of June 30, 1971,
54 percent of total payments due to Primary Banks r uined uncollected.
About one-third of these overdues were attributable to the drought.
To meet this situation, the State government and IDB in consultation
with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and ARC prepared a rehabilitation
program. This program, comprising a financial isorganization of the
21 primary banks which would be involved in project lending (out of
26 in the LDB system) and a number of administrative measures designed
to recover past overdues and ensure future collections at satisfactory
levels, is now being implemented and is expected to be campleted by
September 30, 1972.



- 8 -
29.       The immediate objective of tbe financial reorganization
is to redace overdwe to not more than 25 percent of the amounts
due and payable  as  of   June 30, 1971, after deducting overdues
attributable to the drought. To the exztnt that this cannot be
achieved by June 30, 1972 through improved collections, the State
goveromt is obligated to cantribute additional funds to the
capital of the Primary Banks, to be repaid as collections of
overdues are received. Before the credit would be declared
effective, the reorganization of at least 15 of the 21 Primary
Ranks in the project would have to have been satisfactorily
completed.
30.       The LDB system is undertaking an aggressive collection
program aimed at recovering all overdues on a scheduled program as
well as ensuring a satisfactory repa7ment performance in future.
The State has agreed to provide full cooperation in -this-etfort,
includiug additional recovery staff where needed andiva,rious
collection procedures are being speeded up. ARC will    view the
recovery performance of each Primary and would, upon..agreement by
the Association, withhold refinancing under the project from.any
Primary Which failed to make satisfactory progress on recovering
amounts overdue on June 30, 1971 or which incurred overdues of more
than 25 percent of total payments due for any subsequent year.
31*      'Where the situatimn warrants, the boards of directors of
Primaries will be reconstituted and the management replaced.
Training courses are being established for managers and staff of the
system to introduce new appraisal and lending techniques.
32.       These arrangements represent a realistic approach to the
general problem facing many agricultural credit instit-dtions in India.
Given the cooperation of State governments, of the RBIs, and of ARC,
the treatment of the problem as developed for this'and`the'Mysore
project could be applied elsewhere and permit broadening:the
geographical spread of agricultural lending by the Association in
IndiA.
33.       There is a need to safeguard groundwater in the State to
ensure its opti,m utilizatione   In the absence of legislation to
control over-exploitation of groundwater resources, the Project
Agreement lays down criteria relating to the density and spacing of
wells. These are not a substitute for effective legislation (model
legislation has been prepared but it will take same time before
being adopted in individual States), but they go some considerable
way to achieving the objectives shared by the State and the
Association.
