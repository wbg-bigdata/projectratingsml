                               Special Accounts
1.      For the purposes of this Schedule:
        (a)    the term "eligible expenditures" means expenditures
in respect of the reasonable cost of goods required during the
execution of the Program and to be financed out of the proceeds
of the Loan in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 1 to

equal to: for the USD Special Account, $17,000,000; for the DEM
Special Account, DEM 13,500,000; and for the FRF Special
Account, FRF 10,000,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account
and deposited into a Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3 (a).
2.      Payments out of the Special Accounts shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule.
3.      After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it
that a Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of the
Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to replenish
such Special Account shall be made as follows:
        (a)    For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for
deposit into such Special Account of an amount or amounts which
does or do not exceed the aggregate amount of the Authorized
Allocation. On the basis of such request or requests, the Bank
shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
Account and deposit into such Special Account such amount or
amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
        (b)    (i)      For replenishment of such Special Account, the
                        Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests
                        for deposits into such Special Account at such
                        intervals as the Bank shall specify.
               (ii)     Prior to or at the time of each such request,
                        the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
                        documents and other evidence required pursuant
                        to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the
                        payment or payments in respect of which
                        replenishment is requested. On the basis of
                        each such request, the Bank shall, on behalf
                        of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan
                        Account and deposit into such Special Account
                        such amount as the Borrower shall have
                        requested and as shall have been shown by said
                        documents and other evidence to have been paid
                        out of such Special Account for eligible
                        expenditures. All such deposits shall be
                        withdrawn by the Bank from the Loan Account in
                        the respective equivalent amounts, as shall
                        have been justified by said documents and
                        other evidence.
4.      For each payment made by the Borrower out of any Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.      Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Page  14
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into a Special Account:
        (a)    if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement;
        (b)    if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 3.03 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for such Special Account;
        (c)    if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or
        (d)    once the total unwithdrawn amount of any Loan
Tranche, minus the total amount of all outstanding special
commitments entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions with respect to such Loan Tranche,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
corresponding Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the respective Loan Tranche shall follow
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to the
Borrower.  Such further withdrawals shall be made only after
and to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that
all such amounts remaining on deposit in such Special Account
as of the date of such notice will be utilized in making
payments for eligible expenditures.
6.      (a)    If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any payment out of any Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into such Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into such Special Account shall
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
        (b)    If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any amount outstanding in any Special Account will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures,
the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund
to the Bank such outstanding amount.
        (c)    The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to
the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in any
Special Account.
        (d)    Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6
(a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
