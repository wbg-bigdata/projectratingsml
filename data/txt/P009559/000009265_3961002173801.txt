MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMiDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH
FOR A SIXTH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed development credit to Bangladesh for
SDR 18.3 million (equivalent of US$25.0 million), on standard IDA terms with a
maturity of 40 years, to help finance the Sixth Technical Assistance Project.
This Credit will support preparation of investment projects and strengthen
project implementing agencies. Cofinancing of US$5.0 million as grant funding
is being provided by UNDP. A Country Economic Memorandum entitled
'Bangladesah Selected Issues in External Competitiveness and Economic
Efficiency," (Report No. 10265-BD) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on March 16, 1992.
2.        Background.    Bangladesh is,highly dependent on external
assistance for its economic .and social development. Foreign aid disbursements
have corresponded to almost 85Z of public investment during recent years. On
average, 92 of overall aid flows have been devoted to different forms of
technical assistance (TA), whether for project preparation and implementation,
for institutional development, for training, or for other purposes. During
recent years, the amount of TA from all sources has been on the order of
US$130-150 million per annum. Investment-related TA and freestanding TA have
each accounted for about one-half of the total TA investment. Major grant
funding sources have been UNDP, bilateral donors and ADB. Lending for TA has
been provided by IDA through TA components of investment projects and through
freestanding TA Credits. Loans for TA have also been provided by ADB and
bilateral agencies. Five IDA freestanding TA projects providing total funding
of US$62.5 million have been made available to the Government of Bangladesh
(GOB) since the country's independence in 1972.
3.        The new Government that took office in March 1991 is committed to
undertaking an ambitious development program and has taken steps to revitalize
the economy. A major requirement in this regard is to improve the utilization
of donor assistance, as slow project implementation in recent years has
resulted in a growth of the pipeline of outstanding aid commitments to US$5.8
billion by mid-1991.   GOB bears the main responsibility for preparing the
public investment program.  The lack of absorptive capacity and the weaknesses
of GOB's project implementing agencies, together with the cumbersome project
approval procedures practiced by'the previous Government, have been identified
as major reasons for the slow preparation and implementation of the Annual
Development Program. This also resulted in slow utilization of the funds
under the Fifth Tecbnical Assistance Project (Credit 1440-BD).
4.        GOB has recently taken various steps to address this problem.  A
revised Technical Assistance Policy was adopted in early 1992 based on
recommendations of recent studies and dialogue with donors. The process of
planning, selection and implementation of TA projects will be streamlined.
The main features of the TA Policy reform are (i) use of credits in the
financing of TA when grant sources of TA are either not suitable or nor
readily available (ii) a maximum time limit of three months for the processing
of TA approvals and (iii) decentralization of approval authority to the



2
ministerial level. The Public Resource Management Adjustment Credit (PRMAC),
approved by the Board of Executive Directors on May 5, 1992, is addressing the
broader issues of aid utilization in Bangladesh. The Sixth Technical
Assistance Project vould support the efforts made under PRMAC to streamline TA
approval procedures and would provide a mechanism for monitoring improvements
in the preparation and implementation of TA projects. Close coordination
between the two IDA projects will facilitate addressing key institutional
deficiencies among the implementing and supporting agencies. In addition,
support to enhancing the local consulting profession, which was initiated
under IDA TA V, will be expanded under the proposed project.
5.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. As the Chairman of the Bangladesh
Aid Group, IDA plays a significant role in coordinating the efforts of donors
to improve the quality of project preparation. Deficiencies in the planning,
implementation and supervision capacities of the key GOB agencies have caused
delays in project implementation and adversely affected their quality.
Enhanced project preparation is critical for a high-quality public investment
program and to reduce the backlog of outstanding aid commitments. The
proposed project would also make available to GOB financing for institutional
development which would help overcome some of the most acute human resource
bottlenecks of key GOB agencies. Additionally, the proposed cofinancing by
IDA and UNDP would offer an important complementary, untied funding source for
project preparation.
6.        As noted above IDA has provided five TA Credits to GOB. PCRs for
the first four credits indicated the need to improve TA processing procedures
and the implementing capacity of ERD. The ongoing Fifth Technical Assistance
Project (Cr. 1440-BD) has been effective since February 1984 and will close on
June 30, 1992 after four one-year extensJons of the Closing Date. The slow
implementation of the ongoing TA V Project can be mainly attributed to two
reasonss the centralized approval authority previously exercised by the
President's office for all TA from credit funds, and the cumbersome TA
processing procedures within GOB. To address these concerns, a simpler
procedure and more delegation of approval authority similar to the process
followed under The Third Technical Assistance Project (Cr. 872-BD) would be
applied under the new project. An enhanced role for the Economic Relations
Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance in supervising agency project
implementation is also necessary to avoid delays in consultant selection,
procurement, and supervision. OED evaluations of IDA/Bank freestanding TA
projects have pointed out that TA activities and subprojects should be more
fully prepared prior to the launching of new TA credits in order to avoid
delays in commitment of funds. The relatively strong, already identified,
pipeline of suitable subprojects addresses this problem. On the other hand,
the availability of modest funds as a flexible source of funds to support new
subprojects is a strong feature of current TA projects. For this reason, an
unallocated portion has been retained.
7.        Project Obiectives.  To assist with the preparation of the project
pipeline, GOB has requested IDA's support for the funding of a Sixth TA
Project (TA VI), the prlmary objective of which would be to provide GOB with
continuing, flexible funding for the preparation of the investment groiects in
general, and, more especially, for that part related to IDA's lending program.
Secondly, the project would provide support to GOB in strentthenint key
agencies responsible for implementation of investment projects. Special
attention would be given to improved project planning, management and



supervision capability of the agencies. Thirdly, the project would contribute
to the attainment of a sound investment program through financing of training
and the undertaking of other related TA activities identified by GOB.
8.        Prosect Descriotion.   The project would finance TA for
(a) project preparation, (b) implementation support for IDA-financed
investment projects, (c) institutional strengthening, (d) studies and
(e) other TA activities related to IDA's program in Bangladesh. As was the
case with previous IDA financed TA projects in Bangladesh, approximately one
half of the TA subprojects would be for project preparation, one third for
institutional development, and the rest for other types of TA. The project is
expected to provide funding for some 30-35 subprojects in the following
categoriess (i) Carry-over program from TA V (thirteen ongoing subprojects
totaling US$4.9 million); (li) New institutional development subprojects
(four subprojects, totaling US$5.3 million); (iii) Subproiect proposals
already under consideration (thirteen proposed subprojects, totaling US$14.9
million); and (iv) Subproiects to be identified during project implementation.
Categories (i) and (ii) have already been fully prepared and appraised and
will be approved as project components under this credit.
9.        GOB has requested UNDP to cofinance the project with US$ 5.0
million. The existence of grant cofinancing facilitates addressing
institutional development and training needs by broadening the spectrum of
implementation options. Participation of UNDP also makes it possible for
GOB, IDA and UNDP to better coordinate TA at an early stage of subproject
processing and strengthening of the key GOB agencies, especially in areas
where the operational objectives of IDA and UNDP run parallel. The UNDP
cofinancing would be extended to the various subprojects to complement IDA
financing according to eligibility criteria consistent with the priorities of
the UNDP Fifth Country Program (1991-95) and the pre-approved credit-grant
blend criteria. According to these criteria, grant funds would be directed in
larger proportion to social sector, environment and related fields as well as
to training, whereas credit funds would be used more for preparation of
projects in infrastructure and similar sectors as well as for TA required
during the project implementation stage. However, no cross-conditionalities
are being sought since the project is viable independent of UNDP financing.
The attached Technical Annex (and Schedule 1: Key Project Activities; Schedule
2: List of Indentified Subprojects and Illustrative List of New Subprojects;
and Schedule 3s Modalities for Subproject Approval) describes the project's
institutional context, implementation features, subproject eligibility
criteria and creditlgrant blend as well as procurement, disbursement and
management arrangements. The project cost and financing plan, procurement and
disbursement arrangements and timetable for key project processing events are
given in Schedules A, B and C. A map is also attached.
10.       Proiect Implementation. Project implementation and administration
would be carried out by ERD, with responsibility for individtual subproject
implementation delegated to the respective line ministries and agencies. To
limit delays in subproject implementation, the enhancement of ERD's
supervisory capacity and greater involvement of EPD in critical phases of
project implementation are essential for the successful execution of the
project. A separate subproject has been designed for this purpose.
Similarly, TA will be provided to strengthen project planning, management and
supervision capabilities of line ministries and agencies in key sectors of the
economy. The transport sector would be addressed first on a pilot basis.



4
Also, GOB project audit capabilities would be enhanced. Each subproject would
be submitted for approval by IDA anudor UNDP, as appropriate, after screening
by ERD according to the eligibility criteria. IDA approved procedures would
be applied for the procurement of consultants, equipment and civil works
financed by IDA. In the majority of cases IDA financing would be passed on as
grant to the user agencies. Departu-es from this principle will be agreed
upon on a case by case basis, between IDA and GOB. The proposed UNDP
cofinancing would be administered through a GOB-executed UNDP project
(BGD/911029). The UNDP funds would be disbursed, according to agreed
procedures, from a special account at Bangladesh Bank, administered by the
ERD's World Bank TA Cell. The use of grant and credit funds would be decided
upon by ERD, IDA and UNDP according to criteria agreed to during negotiations
and as outlined in Schedule 3. GOB would fund the domestic tax and customs
portions in local procurement and civil works, as well as provide for
counterpart costs.
11.       Monitoring.  The ERD World Bank Cell has a central role in ensuring
the timelktess and quality of the overall project implementation. The
streamlined TA and subproject approval process is the first prerequisite for
success. The TA Cell has been designated as the focal point within GOB to
monitor the approval process, reporting to senior officials and to donors the
actual performance. The key target is to limit the total time of TA
subproiect processing to three months. Recurring departures from this
timetable would give rise to further adjustments and streamlining. IDA will
supervise the performance of GOB in this respect both under the Public
Resource Management Adjustment Project and under this project. The
operational monitoring of the performance of the subproject agencies (15 to 20
are expected) would require increased resources and attention on the part of
the TA Cell. A Project Manual would be developed to assist the line agencies
in the Important steps of project processing and implementation.
12.       Agreed Actions.  Agreed actions under the Credit include: a)
Issuance of a manual on the planning and implementation of TA projects under
the credit, intended for the use by the line agencies; b) Establishment by
June 30, 1994 of a revised audit system, acceptable to IDA, for foreign aided
projects; and c) Preparation and Implementation of a program to develop the
local consulting industry by June 30, 1994. Project progress reports would be
provided to IDA by June 30 and December 31 of each year. A mid-term review of
the project will be carried out by June 30, 1995. The project accounts would
be audited annually by the Directorate of Audit, Foreign Aided Projects.
13.       Environmental Aspects. This project is not subject to an
Environmental Assessment because the respective subprojects would be reviewed
separately for environmental impact. However, project funds may be used for
environmental assessments and related studies in connection with project
preparation. In addition, a proposed subproject would provide TA for the
strengthening of the Department of Environment.
14.       Project Benefits.  The project would provide a readily available
source of untied credit and grant funds to undertake preparation of investment
projects and provide TA for their implementation in order to guarantee higher
quality and timely implementation. The project would also strengthen GOB's
ability to prepare and implement the investment program through institutional
development, TA and training.

15.       Project Risks.  There is a risk that project implementation could
be delayed due to delays in processing TA approvals within GOB. The
requirement for simpler, streamlined procedures is therefore essential and
GOB has agreed to a realistic, yet accelerated schedule of subproject
processing, which the TA Cell would closely monitor (see para 10 above).
Performance would also be monitored under IDA's Public Resource Management
Adjustment Credit, where the conditions for tranche release include
streamlining of the processing of technical assistance projects. There is
also a risk of under-utilization of credit funds, because of availability of
alternative grant funds. This risk would be mitigated through the proposed
UNDP cofinancing, together with GOB's revised TA policy that recognizes the
validity of the use of IDA credit funds for TA.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve it.

BA{GLADESH
SITM TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
Technical Annex
1.        Given the need to upgrade the technical and administrative
capabilities of many agencies in Bangladesh, technical assistance (TA) is an
important element of the extensive external aid received by Bangladesh. Over
one-half of the TA has been investment related, i.e. channeled to support
preparation and implementation of the Public Investment Program; and has been
required to ensure satisfactory and timely preparation of investment projects.
Five freestanding IDA TA Credits have been important funding sources for
helping the Government address the country's development needs, particularly
in the area of investment planning and preparation. However, the need to
strengthen the developmental capabilities of key ministries and agencies
through TA has increased in recent years as Government tries to upgrade
national capabilities. This proposed project was prepared during an IDA
preparation mission in June 1991, and pre-appraisal missions in October 1991
and in February 1992. The project was negotiated between GOB and IDA in May
1992.
2.   Proiect Obiectives and Description
Against the background noted above the objectives of the project ares
(a) to strengthen the Government's capacity to prepare investment projects,
(b) to strengthen the Government's institutional capacity and (c) to provide
an assured and flexible source of financing for technical assistance and
training to achieve (a) and (b) above. The proposed project would finance
already identified TA subprojects and would finance new TA subprojects in
project preparation, investment project implementation support, institutional
strengthening, as well as for studies and TA activities related to IDA's
program in Bangladesh. The project consists of four subcomponents: (i)
thirteen subprojects carried over from the Fifth Technical Assistance Project
(Cr. 1440-BD) (with an estimated cost of US$ 4.9 million); (ii) four fully-
prepared new institutional development projects (with an estimated cost of US$
5.3 million); (iii) thirteen subprojects already identified for possible
funding under the project (with an estimated cost of US$ 14.9 million); and
(iv) projects yet to be identified and proposed for financing during project
implementation.
3.   Carry-over Program from the Fifth TA Project Cr. 1440-BD
(US$ 4.9 million)
Thirteen of the 27 operational subprojects approved under Cr. 1440-BD
would have activities continuing beyond the June 30, 1992 Closing Date of the
Credit. At that time the estimated undisbursed allocations of US$ 2.4 million
would be cancelled. These continuing subprojects are: (i) Jamuna Bridge: The
consultancies for embankment construction supervision would be finalized
during FY93 (estimated remaining cost USS 420,000); (ii) TA to Public Service
Commission, Phase I: Foreign training and equipment procurement would be
finalized (estimated cost US$ 70,000); (iii) Second Road Rehabilitation and



12
Maintenances Feasibility Study for the Bonpara-Hatikamrul road would be
finalized during the first half of FY93 (estimated cost US$ 480,000); (iv)
Institute of Biotechnologyt Feasibility study would be finalized (estimated
cost (tuS$ 110,000); (v) Oceanographic Institutes Study work would be finalized
(estimated cost tS$ 110,000); (vi) Computerization of National Board of
Revenue Systemst Equipment procurement and consulting inputs would be
finalized (estimated cost US$ 280,000); (vii) ?A to the Tariff Commissions
Equipment procurement and consultant inputs would be completed (estimated cost
US$ 350,000); (viii) Urban Development: Construction futervision of the Dholai
Rhal Improvements The construction has been postponed to FY93 (estimated cost
US$ 1.2 million); (iz) Chittagong WASA: Unaccounted for Water Study: Study
would be completed within PY93 (estimated remaining cost US$ 820,000);
(x)Preparation of Ehulna WASA Proiect: Feasibility Study would be finalized
within PY93 (estimated cost US$ 280,000); (xi) T&T Commercial Accountings
Consulting services will be completed (estimated cost US$ 330,000); (xii)
Strengthening Planning Academys Consulting services will be completed
(estimated cost USS 300,000) and (xiii) Procurement Training: Training will be
finished in early FY93 (estimated cost US$ 40,000)
4. Fully Prepared Institutional Development ProJects (US$ 5.2 million)
In view of the lack of GOB's absorptive capacity, which limits its
ability to deliver the Public Investment Program, the delays encountered in
preparation and implementation of investment projects, the insufficient
quality of project preparation and particularly, the ambitious development
program that the new Government has adopted, it is important to give greater
attention to institutional development needs In Bangladesh to make sure that
the agencies which implement the public investment program are equipped to
carry out their task in an efficient manner. Free3tanding technical
assistance credits have traditionally offered Bangladesh a flexible means to
finance institutional development TA requirements in a wider context than has
been possible within a single investment project. However, recent studies on
the effectiveness of technical assistance in Bangladesh and on related GOB
policies have shown that effective use of TA requires streamlined processing
of procedures, enhanced project planning and improved supervision capabilities
within the key GOB implementing agencies. Thus a focussed and sustained
effort is required to (a) assess the capabilities of institutions critical to
development and public sector management; (b) identify the factors which would
improve the overall institutional environment; and (c) facilitate the
development of individual institutions through specific project-level efforts.
Three types of institutional development subprojects would be included: (i)
subprojects which help improve implementation of the proposed project e.g.
further strengthening of the Economic Relations Division (END) World Bank TA
Cell, and TA to the Directorate of Audit; (1i) subprojects that strengthen the
planning, management and supervision capability of implementing agencies e.g.
strengthening of the Roads and Road Transport Division of the Ministry of
Communications; and (iii) freestanding institution building and development
.ubprojects e.g..TA to the Public Service Commission and Establishment of the
Judicial Training Institute. In the event that cofinancing will be extended
to these subprojects by UNDP or other sources, the IDA fianmced portion will
be reduced in proportion, and these released IDA funds can be used to support
other subprojects.



13
S.   Further Strengthening of the ERD World Bank TA Cell (US$ 0.2 million)
The Economic Relaticns Division (ERD) of the Ministry of Finance which
coordinates all foreign aid would have overall responsibility for the
implementation of the proposed project. To assist it in doing so, the
responsible unit, the VWorld Bank TA Cell' (so named by GOB) would have
enhanced responsibilities. This would include a more decisive role in
subproject selection and approval. The Cell would review requests received
from line ministries and agencies for the use of TA funds, prioritize the
requests and participate in the final selection of subprojects, ensure speedy
processing of subprojects through the GOB internal approval system and forward
to IDA those found suitable for financing. At the implementation stage, the
main responsibility for the execution of subprojects would rest with the line
ministries and agencies.  The TA Cell would participate, when necessary, in
consultant selection, evaluation of proposals and contract negotiation. It
would reach agreement with the line ministries and agencies on the
implementation schedule and performance indicators. The line ministries would
procure consultants and equipment and technically supervise the consultants"
performance, reporting the progrees periodically to the TA Cell, which would
prepare overall project progress reports.
6.  In view of the enhanced role of the TA Cell in the overall
administration of the TA VI project and supervision of subprogram
implementation and the increased workload that would be involved, it is
essential for the success of the project to further strengthen the TA Cell.
Accordingly, it is proposed to include a subproject for this purpose. During
implementation of the two previous TA projects the Cell has consisted of the
Project Director (Deputy Secretary), Deputy Director, an Assistant and
secretarial support. Under the proposed subproject a computer-aided
Management Information System (MIS) would be established within the TA Cell,
performance indicators would be developed for guidance to the implementing
agencies in terms of time, physical or technical targets, milestones,
expenditure targets and an early warning system. In addition, ERD would be
provided assistance in establishing data bases on the subprojects as well as
the recently revised directories of local consulting firms and individual
consultants, in updating the system, and in the dissemination of information
to the relevant users. The subproject would also provide assistance to the TA
Cell In identification of implementation constraints, and providing assistance
to line agencies in overcoming them. The follow-up action on the
*         recomuendations of the Study on the Development of Local Consulting Industry
completed under Cr. 1440-BD would be initiated by the TA Cell. This would
entail the preparation and obtaining of GOB approval for an action program to
*         develop the local consulting profession through various policy measures,
establishment of a national association of consultants together with a code of
conduct, and preparing training programs in various fields of specialization.
The action program would be implemented within a new separate subproject. The
subproject budget would provide for five consultant-months, training and
studies, and computer and office equipment.
7. TA to the Directorate of Audit (US$ 1.3 million)
The large number of development projects funded by various donors has
led to the need for GOB to meet a wide range of specific accounting and audit
requirements. The establishment of a separate Directorate of Audit of Foreign
Aided Projects in 1983 signified a step in the right direction. Despite



14
considerable efforts made by the Directorate, it has not been possible to
overcome all the problems encountered in clearing the backlog of audited
accounts and audit reports, in developing and maintaining good quality of
project audit standard, and in meeting the different requirements of the
donors and GOB. Altogether 50 audit teams (150 persons) are carrying out the
audits under the Directorate. For IDA alone, more than 150 project components
are being audited annually. Currently, the audit reports under IDA projects
are being submitted to IDA with a six to twelve months' delay and in a format
that does not always meet IDA's requirements.
8.   The proposed subproject's scope and terms of reference have been
prepared with the help of TA financed under Cr. 1440-BD. The main objective
of the subproject would be to improve the financial and accounting discipline
in Investment projects and to build a sustainable system for timely audit
including performance and management audit. The TA would assist in bringing
about systematic improvements through staff training and development and the
preparation of required manuals (e.g. Foreign Aid Accounting Manual, Project
Audit Manual). In addition, expatriate and local consultants would help
develop and introduce a comprehensive system including program and performance
audit, management accounting and audit, as well as computer-aided audit
techniques. The staff would also be trained in English. The subproject
inputs consist oft 26 consultant-months of expatriate and 26 consultant-months
of local consultants, staff training, computer and word processing equipment
with accessories, and other local and operating costs.
9.   Strengthening of the Roads and Road Transport Division of the Ministry
of Coumunications (USg 2.6 million)
The roads sector represents an important and critical sector of the
economy and development programs of Bangladesh. The Transport Sector Review
carried out by IDA in 1990 has identified a number of policy and institutional
issues requiring immediate attention. Among these, the need for sector
planning, road sector development strategy, road investment planning and
prioritization, strengthening economic and financial analysis and monitoring
capabilities and study of special problems, e.g. deregulation of road
passenger transport, review of road user charges, divestiture of Bangladesh
Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) and consolidation of the rural road network,
have been highlighted in the review. Several of these issues are being or
will be addressed within the current and forthcoming IDA transport sector
lending program and the UNDP financed Transport Sector Study Project
(BGD/861037), but further TA is required especially in the institutional
development field. The Roads and Road Transport Division (RRTD)
of the Ministry of Communications plays a central role in the efforts to
resolve the above mentioned issues. It is responsible for overall policy
formulation and advice on national strategies and program development,
assessment, review and approval of programs and projects submitted by line
agencies and corporations, as well as for monitoring and evaluation of
programs and projects. However, RRTD does not have sufficient qualified staff
to carry out these functions in an efficient manner. Therefore, coordinated
follow-up action has not been taken on many of these issues. Weaknesses have
also been identified in the Planning and Development Wing of the Roads and
Highways Department (RHD) and in the regulatory capacity of the newly
established Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA). The subproject would
address these institutional deficiencies by providing TA to RRTD, RED and BRTA
over a period of five years. The activities under the subproject would



15
include the establisbment of a Policy Planning Cell at BRTA, provision of
consulting services and on-the-job training in maintenance and investment
planning, economic and financial analysis, and project management and
supervision for the staff of IHD, and further studies to be made by RRTD on
prioritization and planning of investment projects. The subproject would
provide for 160 consultant-months of expatriate and 200 consultant-months of
local consultants, for additional national staff (local component), computer
equipment and local training.
10. TA to Bangladesh Public Service Commission, Phase It (US$ 1.1 million)
The process of strengthening the country's public administration
represents a major challenge to GOB. Since the country's independence
successive Governments have made efforts in this regard.  However, a
comprehensive program for the strengthening of administration systems and
civil service reform is still lacking. Initial TA has been provided under the
Cr. 1440-BD to the Public Service Commission (PSC) to strengthen its capacity
to examine and select appropriate civil service candidates by improving its
recruitment and testing methods. As a result, some action was taken by PSC
including an organizational review and restructuring of the PSC, examination
reform, staff training and establisbment of a computerized system for
Information processing. During the implementation of the present TA
subproject, it was recognized that institutional improvement of the PSC
required a more comprehensive approach and a phased program of action. The
proposed second phase subproject would provide further TA on examination
reform, supporting the planned regrouping by GOB of civil service tests. A
new Civil Service examination system would be developed together with the
required internal standard manuals. To create capacity for the system
development, two new Units would be established within PSCs one for staff
training and development and the other for research and analytical work. The
subproject would provide consultant services, training and further equipment
for strengthening internal communication, personnel accounting and
administration systems and a Management Information System (MIS). In
addition, a computer-based offset printing unit would be established and the
required equipment procured. The duration of the subproject activities is
four years, consisting of 57 consultant-months of expatriate and 65
consultant-months of local consultants, study tours aborad for 24 officers,
studies and equipment, as well as local additional staff inputs.
11.  Subprol.cts Under Consideration (US$ 14.9 million)
During the course of project preparation thirteen additional subproject
proposals (Schedule 2, page 2) have been identified which would be considered
for funding under the project. Ten of them would provide TA to various GOB
agencies for consulting services and training in financial management,
accounting and audit, and in the strengthening of institutions in other
respects.  Three of the subproject proposals would provide consulting services
in engineering and design as well as construction supervision to support the
preparation, finalization and implementation of IDA financed investment
projects.

12. Subgroiects to be Identified During Proiect Implementation
Project funds would also be available to finance eligible TA which is
identified during early project implementation. Although the ongoing and
identified indicative subproject program would commit four-fifths of the
available funds, it is ezpected that some of the latter may not be funded from
the proceeds of the Credit either because they are funded by other donors or
because it is decided not to proceed. This is a normal process, and other
subprojects would be submitted for consideration. The eligibility criteria
for proposed new subprojects are set forth in Schedule 3.
Proiect Implementation
13. Implementation and Administrative Arran-ements. The project would be
administered and coordinated by the World Bank TA Cell of ER, Ministry of
Finance. The personnel assigned to the project are the Project Director
(Deputy Secretary), full time Project Coordinator (Director), Accounts and
Computer Assistant and the necessary secretarial support. Upon receipt of the
funding request from the line ministry the TA Cell is responsible for the
preparation of the subproject proposal file and for the processing of the
required GOB approval according to the procedures agreed between 60B. IDA and
UNDP. The key GOB decision makers in the approval process of new subprojects
and allocations would bet (a) the Project Director, for the general
eligibility of the proposed subprojects as well as for their source of
funding, (b) Xinister of Finance for funding allocations. The line agencies
and ministries are responsible for the preparation of the required terms of
reference, Technical Assistance Project Proformas (TAPP) or Project Proformas
(PP) if approval is processed within the context of a specific investment
project. The agencies would process TAPPs (PPs) for GOB approval, as
sanctioned under the GOB current processing guidelines acceptable to IDA
and/or UNDP as applicable. An agreement in principle would be sought
concurrently from IDA and UNDP at the time of submission of the TAPP (PP) for
GOB approval. After the receipt of general GOB approval for a subproject, ED
would seek final approvals from IDA and/or =UDP. A streamlined approval
procedure would be used when the proposed TA Involves preparation of
investment projects already approved and included in the Public Investment
Program.
14.  The TA Cell as the coordinating agency would have general responsibility
for the implementation of the project on a timely basis, according to the
subproject eligibility criteria and processing schedules of the subprojects to
be submltted for approval together with the overall project and would be
specifically responsible fors (a) the processing of subproject proposals for
GOB approvals, (b) submission of subproject proposals to IDA and/or IDP, (c)
monitoring supervision, and assistance in the implementation of subprojects,
(d) interventions when necessary to ensure timely implementation, (e) periodic
(semi-annual) progress reporting to IDA and UNDP, (f) administration of and
disbursements frou the IDA Special Account as well as from the MDP funds
deposited separately, and (g) ensuring timely submission of withdrawal
requests by the agencies.
15. To carry out these functions efficiently, it is vital that the World
Bank TA Cell be given a more distinct role and mandate vis-a-vis the
impleeanting agencies. To ensure this, the TA Cell would also have the right
to participate in the critical steps of the project implementation process



17
(e.g. shortlisting of consultants, consultant selection process, etc.) which
have previously caused delays in subproject implementation. ERD vould compile
a project manual which can be utilized to provide guidance to the line
agencies on subproject processing and implementation. In addition, the
project would include a TA component to further strengthen the capabilities of
the TA Cell in project management, administration and supervision (see paras
5-6 above).
Proiect Cost
16. Proiect Cost and Disbursement Profile. Total project cost is estimated
at US$ 3S5.0 million with a foreign exchange component of US$ 26.0 million and
a local cost component of US$ 9.0 million (Tk. 340 million). The cost is
based on previous experience in Bangladesh and the funding needs of the
identified subprojects. Disbursement estimates (MOP Schedule B) are based on
the standard IDA profile for technical assistance projects, adjusted to take
account of the program of subprojects that are fully processed and ready to
start disbursing upon Credit effectiveness.
17. Financing Plan. The project would be financed by a Development Credit
of SDR 18.3 million (US$ 25.0 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms with
40 years' maturity, a grant of US$ 5.0 million from UNDP, and a GOB
contribution of 11S$ 5.0 million equivalent. The Credit and grant funds would
be used in parallel to finance various subprojects and specific components of
subprojects on a case-by-case basis according to the criteria set forth in
Schedule 3.
Procurement and Disbursement
18. Procurement Arrantements (Schedule B). Consultants would be engaged
according to the procedures consistent with the World Bank Guidelines for the
Use of Consultants. Contracts for equipment valued at less than US$ 100,000
equivalent and not exceeding US$ 1,500,000 equivalent in the aggregate could
be obtained following Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) or other normal
Government procedures acceptable to IDA. Goods could be procured locally
based on prudent comparative shopping for contracts of less than US$ 25,000
each up to an aggregate of US$ 300,000. For larger contracts, International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) would be followed. For Civil Works contracts the
above lImits and procedures will also be applied.
19. Disbursements. The proposed IDA Credit would be disbursed over six
years, closing on June 30, 1998, as follows: for consultant services 10OX, for
overseas and local training 1002, for equipment and supplies 1002 of foreign
expenditures, 1002 of local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 752 of local
expenditures for other items procured locally, and for civil works 80S of the
costs. All disbursemaents ould be made against full documentation. To
facilitate disbursements from the Credit proceeds, a Special Account in US
dollars with an authorized allocation of US$ 1.3 million representing four
months' average project expenditure to be paid from the Special Account to
local suppliers of services and equipment would be established at Bangladesh
Bank. Disbursement requests for funds from the IDA Special Account would be
disbursed and administered by the World Bank TA Cell. For all other payments
the Implementing agency would submit the appropriate withdrawal request to IDA
- with copy to ERD - according to the established guidelines and procedures.
Payments for foreign expenditures would be made through separate Withdrawal



18
Applications. The Special Account would be replenished according to an agreed
schedule of payments adjusted by the actual disbursement flows, and disbursed
to suppliers of goods and services according to procedures acceptable to IDA.
20. Account and Audit Arrangements
The project accounts and the IDA Special account would be maintained by
the TA Cell. The subproject project accounts as well as the IDA Special
Account would be subject to an annual audit by the Comptroller and Auditor
General or an external auditor acceptable to IDA. The Audit Report on the use
of the Special Account would be submitted to IDA within four months of the end
of the GOB fiscal year, and subproject audit reports within nine months of the
said date. The project would provide support to GOB to improve the audit
content and streamline the process to better comply with the donors'
requirements (see paras 7-8 above).
21. Monitoring and Progress Reporting
Each agency participating in the project would designate a staff member
as its lead contact with the Project Coordinator at ERD, who in turn would be
responsible for the contacts with IDA. The ERD Project Coordinator would
report on the progress of the subproject activities on a scheduled basis, and
would promptly report any deviations from the agreed schedule of activities
and disbursements. Further, the TA Cell would install through the proposed
subproject (paras 5 & 6 above) a Management Information and Monitoring System,
enabling a more efficient subproject monitoring against set timetables and
performance criteria agreed upon at subproject approval stage. The TA Cell
would submit to IDA semi-annual progress reports of all operational
subprojects, and provide all necessary information during IDA supervision
missions, and upon request by I1A. Three years after effectiveness a Mid-term
review of the project would be carried out to assess progress against the
project objectives as well as those set for the individual subprojects.
Corrective action would be taken thereafter by ERD, if required.

Motalities for Subgrolect Funding pproval
I. Atgroval Procedures
1.       Upon receipt of a request from a line ministry, ERD will check the
general eligibility of the project under the criteria of this facility.
Simultaneously, ERD will check with the line ministry and the planning
commission on the procqssing status of the TAPP (PP).
2.        If the proposal qualifies for support under this facility, ERD will
suggest the source of financing (UNDP and/or IDA) for a subproject or, where
applicable, the source of financing for each component of a subproject and
obtains from that source(s) agreement in principle.
3.        ERD submits its recommendations for approval by the appropriate
authority.
4.         For all subprojects, a fact sheet covering the financing plan and
the proposed funding source, together with the draft TAPP or TOR, is submitted
within one week from receipt of approval from the appropriate authority to
UNDP and/or IDA for final approval.
5.       UNDP and IDA will review and respond expeditiously.
6.       Upon approval, ERD informs the concerned agency and gives
instructions on subproject administration and disburseament procedures.
Contracts and subcontracts will clearly indicate source of funding in order to
facilitate correct billings. The line agency will initiate project activities,
consultant solections and procurement. ERD retains right to participate in
critical phases of project Implementation (shortlisting, proposal
evaluation, contract negotiations, etc.).
7.        Procurement of equipment, the hiring of consultants, and contracting
for civil works will follow IDA guidelines when IDA funds are used.
Shortlists, evaluation results and draft contracts will be submitted to IDA
for non-objection comment when IDA funds are used, with copy to UNDP.
Subprojects and subproject components wholly funded by UNDP will be submitted
to UNDP for approval with copy to IDA.

II. General Funding Criteria
8.        The funds available for this project from both the IDA credit and
the UNDP will be approved and disbursed under various subprojects and, in some
cases, by separate components under the sAme subproject. This procedure of
parallel and distinct financing facilitates clarity in disbursements and
control in auditing.
9.        ERD, in making its recommendations for source of funding, will take
into account the 2references of M2NI  to have its funds identified with:
(a) Feasibility, sector studies and other activities
leading towards the preparation of Investment projects;
(b) Programes and projects establishing and strengthening
institutions responsible for or supporting project planning,
preparation and implementation;
(c) Technical assistance which supports the finalization of
investment and/or technical assistance projects and their
implementation;
(d) Up to 100l of components covering institutional assessments,
training needs analysis and the provision of training;
(e) Activities in the above categories will be considered
favorably by UNDP, especially as they relate to:
- Vocational and technical education
- Non-formal education
- Female Secondary Education
- Nutrition and health
- Population and Family Planning
- Rural development and land use
- Environment, forestry and fisheries, energy
- Decentralization
- Industry and enterprise reform/privatization; and
- Poverty Alleviation.
10.       IDA fnding will be available for all of the above, as needed, as
well as for other technical assistance needs, including: preparation and
implementation of infrastructure, energy, industrial, human resources and
other investments;and for privatization, enterprise reform, and institutional
development. IDA resources would be usea to fund equipment costing over
US$10,000 per subproject.
11.       ERD will assign funding sources roughly in proportion to total
financing so that UNDP and IDA remain funding partners throughout the
implementation of this project. Should UNDP funds be withdrawn before
completion of the project GOB would reduce the scope of the project. Because
the credit would finance a series of subprojects for TA and the project is
viable without UNDP financing, it is not considered appropriate to seek cross-
conditionality with UNDP.
