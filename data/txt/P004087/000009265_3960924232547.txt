(Loan 1851-O)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Agricultural Products Processing Project in Korea, for which Loan 1851-KO
was approved on June 27, 1980 in the amount of US$50.0 million. The loan
was closed about nine months behind schedule on June 20, 1985 with a
cancellation of US$2.7 million on March 1, 1985.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture and Fisheries Development
Corporation (AFDC) and is supplemented with an Overview prepared by the
Asia Regional Office. The Report is based upon a review of (i) Staff
Appraisal Report; (ii) The President's Report; (iii) Loan and Guarantee
Agreements; (iv) Project data complied by AFDC; (v) supervision reports;
and (vi) various project-related files. Field visits to the project area
and to various sample industries were last made in December 1984.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report (Attachment 1).

PROJECT CO-MLETION REPORT
KOREA
SECOND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PROCESSING PROJECT
(Loan 1851-RO)
EVALUATION SUWARY
Introduction
1.       The Second Agricultural Products Processing Project was financed
under Credit 1851-10, approved In 1980. The project ained at upgrading the
the agro-fishery processing Industry by providing funds through the
Agriculture and Fisheries Development Corporation (AFDC). Total projact
costs were estimated W 48,600 million (US$83.8 million), against which an
ZBRD Loan of US$50.0 million was negotiated. It was expected that the
project would be completed by September 30, 1983 and the Loan would close
on September 30, 1984.
iI.      Implementation began in 1980 after a short delay.  Because of much
higher investment costs and much higher burdens to small and medium sized
borrowers than estimated at appraisal, the project's financial and economic
success wa considerably lover than anticipated. After one extension, the
loan was closed on June 20, 1985, with a balance of US$2.7 million that was
cancelled.
Objectives and Rationale
III.     The project objectives were tot  support a high priority
Government effort to increase income and employment in rural areas by
augmenting the value added; expand production and exports from the
agriculture sector; and increase the supply and quality of processed foods
to consumers by supporting agri and fisheries processing subloans which
vouldt
(a) reduce wastage of farm produce from spoilage and loss, especially
of perishables, through the provision of additional processing
capacity, including freezing and cold storage, and Improved
efficiency of processing;
(b) increase supplies, better quality and larger variety of processed
foods throughout the year which would meet domestic and export
demand, assist in dampening the significant supply and price
fluctuations of farm produce, especially fruits, vegetables and
other perishables during the off season periods. The supply of
processed products at generally lower costs would be an additional
benefit to consumers;
(c) raise productivity of labor involved in processing by about 16-322
by upgrading the level of technology;



(d) create S,000 jobs in the processing industry atd raise farmers and
processed workers incomesl and
(e) increase value-added, total employment, export earnings and Import
substitution for the economy.
iv.      In addition, the project was to strengthen the institutional
capacity of AFDC, especlally by providing financial and technical
assistance for developmei.: of agro-processing for small and medium
vrocessors.
Implementation Experience and Results
v.       The Project was approved by the Board on May 5, 1980.  The legal
documents, comprising a Loan Agreement with the Agriculture and Fisheries
Developmeut Corporation (AFDC) and a Guarantee Agreement with the Republic
of Korea, were signed on June 27, 1980, and became effective on
September 20, 1980. The Appraisal Report (2849a-XO) was completed on
April 18, 1980. The President's Report (P-2799-X0) was completed on
April 20, 1980. The Project Completion Report date was September 30, 1983
and the Closing Date was September 30, 1984. The Loan Account was closed
on June 20, 1985, nine months after the original date. The funds were to
be relent to agro-processing enterprises, with repayment periods to be
determined by their individual cash flow estimates, and interest at not
less than 12S p.a. Sub-borrowers were to bear the foreign exchange risk.
AFDC was to expend about US$0.5 million for technical assistance and
training to strengthen its Project Department.
vi.      The Agricultural Fishery Development Corporation (AFDC) began to
lend under the Project in July 1980 and by the closing date had 128
sublosas been processed. Out of the Loan of US$50.0 million total
disbursements of US$47.3 million were completed in June 1985 and US$2.7
million was cancelled. A total of W 4,375 million was disbursed or 91.3S
of the amount committed. Loans to cooling and cold store facilities
accounted for a relatively large part of the credit. Of the 128 subloans,
30 subloans were for freezing and cold/chilled stores, amounting to W
14,366 million, or 32.42, which in the Appraisal Report it wss anticipstcd
to be only 281. This critical change of investment strategy and the low
utilization (less than 401 of capacity) of these cold stores along with
over a 661 increase in construction costs, caused individual investors much
hardship, resulting in some default and sales of those facilities. As a
result, the return on inwestment, and the financial and economic rates of
return were much lower than anticipated during the Appraisal of the
Project. Nevertheless, all key covenants were completed, mostly on
schedule, and without any major effect on the project.
vii.     The appraisal process at APDC ran into a number of snags,
including carrying out the process by inexperienced technicians and under-
experienced agri-business and marketing professionals. There was some
Impropriety on the part of a few individuals at APDC. Part of the problem
was the parastatal's inability to pay for competence by contracting for
experience either for full time staff or for short tenm consultants. The
financial Irregularities have now been resolved.



- vi -
Vitt.   The project did not have a system to measure whether the
objectives were attained. Nevertheless most of the subborrowers are small
and medium entrepreneurs. About 13 subloans were made to large cmpanies
to a total amount of about W 15,t44 million, or 341 of the total amount
committed. A large number of different types of agro-businesses bave been
financed. The main categories aret rice milling (17 subprojects), drying
of fish and vegetables (16 subprojects), chilled storage for fruits and
vegetables (15 subprojects), cold stores for fish and meat (15
subprojects), fish meat processing (14 subprojects) and preservation of
vegetables (12 subprojects). AFDC gained some valuable but costly
experience in appraising agri-fishery processing loans. AFDC continues to
have only marginal in-house competence to take on sophisticated technical
and financial analysis. It is not clear that the project upgraded the
level of technology. In the Republic of Korea efficient and modern cold
storage facilities provide iced fish and frozen fish to all regions by
refrigerated vans. While the countries agri-fishery industry has
developed, there is not any Indication fosm the draft PCR what upgraded
technology was adopted. T1he Project however, increased the cold store
facilities to about 160,000 metric tons. While this was thought to be too
high In 1983, this has had an effect on holding back 1984185 prices on
onions and satisfied consumer demand.
Sustainabillty
IX.      Of ¶.ie 128 subloans, 77 companies are In *peretion; 27 are under
foreclosure due to long overdue payments, or bankruptcy; 21 companies were
under financial reorganization; and two subloans have been caneolled. Out
of the 27 subprojects under foreclosures, 12 are related to chilled stores
and cold storages, and of the other 15 subprojects dealing with food
processing in general, 7 are related to fish processing. The average
subloan under foreclosure is U 348.0 million (US$0.5 million), hilch is
close to the average of the total loan portfolio which is W 365.0 million
(US$0.52).
Findings and Lessons
X.       While there were broad benefits of providing linkages from food
production to consumer, short term standard measures of success were only
marginal. It is estimated that about 3,500 new jobs were created from the
project's loans sad will obtain direct benefits through the incremental
increase in agri-fishery business financed In this project. At appraisal
the financial rate of return (FRR) for the project was based on model agro-
pcocessing units and was estimated at 241. The re-estimated FAR after
financing using the same model approach was about 14S. The estimated
overall economic rate of return (ERR) at appraisal was about 211. The re-
estimated ERR after financing calculated In the same manner as the SAR Is
112, largely due to exchange rate difficulties, high investment and
operating cost, reduction in expected benefits, and overt expectations for
esports of agri-fishery products without ample market research. The
appraisal report clearly discussed the risks and that with an increase of
costs by 202 "investment and operating costs would reduce the overall FRR
from 241 to Q9 and the ERR from 211 to 151." In fact, Investment costs



- vil -
increased by 40-66Z, particularly in the cold stores which was about 32.4%
of the portfolio under the project. With 662 Increase in costs, an
estimated 10-121 FRR for the three typos of cold stores is a more realistic
calculation, if the full capacity was utilized. However, capacity
utilization wes far less, about 402, which would further drag-down the FRR
calculation to 8-9Z, instead of the optlistic 21Z estimated in the
appraisal report and 12-152 in the PCR for cold stores.
xi.      While the yearly export earnings was- stated at US$35.0 million,
subloans to the industries that exported thevo items were a very smll
percentage of the portfolio (an optImistic estimation of exports would
encompass about 7.82 of the portfolio). Nevertheless, exports do not
appear to be calculated for either the financial or economic rates of
return in the appraisal; and as a result and according to our own
standards, cannot be used in the calculation or a re-estimated PRR or ERR.
xii.     Using FRR and ERR In any agri-business in the a.ort period is not
always the best gauge. In the early years with a very slow start-up
whereby the cashflow Is negative or only just positive, the FPR or ERS will
always be negative; agribusiness are subject to climate and other natural
factors and thus are slower to mature or become profltable. In a longer
period, eight to ten years, PRR and ERR are much more reliable.
xiii.    The passing on of the foreign exchange risk to Individual
borrowers has likely caused undue hardship to most small and medium size
borrowers.  This Is particularly true for equipment that w-as Imported, e.g.
the cold stores, and the food processing lines, where actual costs were
from 40-662 higher than anticipated at appraisal. In addition prior to
appraisal the Korean exchange rate was W 484; when the initial loan were
made the exchange rate was about V 580 to the US Dollar, and within a short
period before repayment, the exchange rate nearly doubled to W 870 vo the
US dollar. Borrowers, thus had to pay nearly double the Won if, as It
certainly was In the case of all equipment and some building materials, it
was imported. In addition, whilst the nominal lnterest rate for the loan
wa 8.252, cross-currency risk raised this to 13.72 or 8.52 above Libor,
this effect compounded the effect of the won-dollar exchange rate
movements. This placed undue hardship on the Indlividual small and medius
borrowers. This hardship was compounded if the borrower was processing or
cold storing a non exported crop vhere both kinds of projects gave low
returns on Investment. It is clear that passing foreign exchange risks to
small ov medium slse borrowers particularly In a volatile or a high
inflationary economy, are too much of a risk, particularly because these
borrowers are only in the domestic market and there is no way to keep up
with earning foreign exchange directly and thus to reduce the Impact.
xiv.     The princigal lessons learned revolve around issues concerning:
appraisal of the subprojects, supervision of the subprojects, technical
assistance to the subborrowers, training, financial and legal aspects:
(a) A&2raisal of the SuboroJects. Evaluations of manageumnt
capability should be made for each proposal. Often the
subborrowers had little, or no experience in the particular
agribusiness. APDC s4ould consider requiring a higher equity



- vill -
contribution from 202 to 302 by the borrowers. In same cases AFDC
should or could be asaisting in tb financing of new and important
and high cost industry; more care has to be made of the high
Investment costs through close supervision by AFDC; market
analysts must be strengthened, as AFDC's efforts were minimal and
went no further a calculation of priea different1als which
resulted in failure of a number of enterprises; adequate and
timely raw material supply is critical to any agro-in'ustry
project and the profitability Is sensitive to changes in raw
material, making it critical for AFDC to make a thorough Analysis
of the micro availability of raw materials; and many tchnical
issues were not addressed. AFDC must either have the in-house
capability or be able to hire consultants to resolve technical
issues;
(io) Sugervision of the Subgrolects. Appraisal and supervision of
subprojects were carried out by different divisions, provision
should have been made for closer coordination. Moreover,
supervision by competent professionals should be required at least
once every three months in the first two years of a subproject and
at least twice a year up to year four; supervision should be
carried out by appraisal and supervision staff, as well as local
competent consultants. Audited statements should be required for
all subprojecti and supervision missions by the lending
institution should insist on their completion;
(c) Technical Assistance. The agri-fishery lending Institution should
take a more active role In the provision of technical assistance
to the subborrovers; if necessary by competent consultants.
Technical advise must be precise, e.g. cold or dry stores should
handle more than one product; advise should be given to minimise
loss in cold storages, owners of cold stores should have close
contact with producers to enhance quality and quantity;
procurement of equipment sbould be monitored, so that the project
will be upgraded to obtain optimal technical solutions with
acceptable prices; market evaluations should be supported by the
agri-fishery lending institution by providing information on
market trends and possible now market outlets to the subborrouers
(d) Training. APDC and, similarly, many agri-fishery lending
Institutions, or departments are not properly trained In
evaluation of the main issues of this subsector. Standard manuals
on appraisal are not enough, analysis of sector specific issues is
critical to their successt
(e)  Financial Asgects.  Repayment of Interest and principal should
take place more frequently than twice a year. It is recommended
that payment Is made at least four times a year; and
(f)  Leaal Asoects.  Projects early In ths project cycle should develop
legal procedures to hasten the legal process to recover the
outstanding loan amount to prevent deterioration or non
maintenance, as well as disappearance of plant equipment.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
SECOND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PROCESSING PROJECT (LOAN 1851-RO)
OVERVIEW
1.       The Second Agricultural Products Processing Project (Lu 1851-O)
was a continuation and expansion of the development program for
agroprocessing financed under the Integrated Agricultural Products
Processing Project (Loan 994-RO). It provided medium and long-torm loans
to the private sector through the Agriculture and Fisheries Development
Corporation (AFDC). The project supported a lending program which was part
of a high priority Government effort to incroase income and employment in
the rural areas by augmenting the value added, expand production and
axports from the agriculture sector, and increase the supply and quality of
processed foods to consumers. A loan of US$50 million for the project was
extended to the Government of Korea under a loan agreement signed on June
27, 1980. The project became effective on September 3, 1980 and was closed
on June 20, 1985, about nine months behind schedule, with cancellations of
US$2.0 million on March 1, 1985 and US$0.6 million on the closing date.
2.       AFDC has prepared the attached Project Completion Report whlch has
been reviewed by the divilsion and found to be a fair and thorough account
of project implementation. The Bank became well-acquaLited with AFDC
through the two projects, the Agricultural Sector Survey in 1983, and a
proposed third project whilch was to be part of an Agricultural Sector Loan
in 198415. This overview supplements AFDC's PCR with basic information on
the agroprocessing sector, the borrower, and previous agricultural projects
in Korea. In addition, comments are made on project implementation and
conclusions.
The Asroprocessina Subsector
3.       The agroprocessing subsector was studied in the context of the
agricultural sector In a survey undertaken by the Bank in 1983 and is
described in the Agricultural Sector Survey (Report No. 4709-XO), dated
April 23, 1984. In summerys
About 4,6000 commercial firms are engaged in processing food,
beverages and tobacco.  These firms, accounting for 16S of the
manufacturing sector's gross output, employing 175,000 workers,
and providing 6S of the country's exports, are mostly small-scale
processors. They are characterized by obsolete equipment,
unsophisticated technology, low levels of capitalization and
capacity utilization ranging from 10 for fish canning to 471 for
freezing and chilled storage and 802 for flour milling. Some 62
of the firms (255) employ more than 100 v rkers and account for



801 of production. Almost half the firms employ fewer than 10
vorkers. The smallest firms are engaged In producing bean curd,
marine products, and potato starch, and the largest firms are
those insolved in processing milk, sugar flour, edible oils,
coffee and taa. Additionally, there are some 10,000-12,000
processor  .at have fewer then five employees and are, therefore,
not included In the Government's manufacturing sector statistics.
These firms, primarily involved In rice milling. employ an
estimated 30,000 workers.
About 50 meatprocessors use modern technology and facilities of
international standard, but the National Livestock Cooperative
Federation estlmates that about 140 slaughtorhouses need to be
renovated or replaced and plans to provide financial assistance
through the Livestock Development Fund. Grain processing,
particularly flour milling and corn starch processing, is capital
intensive, but with the exception of eight companies engaged in
baking and confectioneries, most of the processors use outmoded
technology and obsolete facilities requiring substantial haad
labor. The processing technology employed for horticultural and
marine products is mainly limited to dehydration, froezSing,
canning and bottling. Drying of fish and seaweed by sunshine and
coal heat has been a tradit- mal method of processing; canned
foods were introduced in the 1950s, frozen fruits and vegetables
in the mid-1970s. Except for hot air drying and canning, the
technology for processing fruits and vegetables is still in the
development stage, and many of the small processors produce low-
quality, high priced products. Most processors face shortages of
funds, both for operation and facility expansion. The Government
finances less than 302 of the sector's total borrowings. The
shortage of operating funds for fruit and vegetable processors is
aggravated by the custom of making advance payment to producers
and buying a standing crop in order to have an assured supply of
raw materials. In addition, the sector has to cope with
seasonally unstable supplies of raw materials; the pipeline for
imported materials is long and customs procedures cumbersome. The
marketing of production is hampered by lack of transportation
equipment, inadequate advertising efforts and a traditional
distribution system that relies on commission agents to
merchandise the processed goods.
Previous Prolects
4,       Bank assistance to Korea's agriculture sector has been in support
of specific projects through 18 loansicredits totalling US$780 million. Of
this amount, about 68S has been for irrigation and rural development, 141
for storage, processing, and marketing, 141 for farm credit; 31 for
livestock development and 1S for seed improvement. In the storage,
processing and marketing category, the Agriculture and Fisheries
Development Corporation (APDC) has implemented two projects using Bank
loans (Loans 994-K0 and 185 1-D) and Seoul Metropolitan Government another
(Loan 2111-KO for construction of a municipal wholesale market).



- xi -
5.       AFDC's first Bank loan for the Integrated Agricultural Projects
Processing Project (Ln. 994-R0) provided long-term funds for onlending to
private firms developing on-farm production of asparagus, mushroom, and oak
mushroom; and processing and cold storage facilities for these crops as
well as ocher specially vegetables and fruits. It also included technical
assistance to help AFDC Improve its operations. Total project costs were
estimated at US$20 million, of which the Bank financed US$13 million.  In
all, AFDC provided 44 subloans for modernization, expansion and new
construction of a wide spectrum of agroprocessing facilities, and 583
subloans for farm development, expending 72Z of the funds intended for this
purpose.  APDC's appraisal of Individual subloas indicated financial rates
of return ranging from 18-632.  The PPAR for the project estimated an
overall economic rate of return of 352. The project had significant
institution-building effects, particularly with regard to the quality of
appraisal and strengthening of AFDC's accounting and financial management
Systems.
The Borrowe:
6.       AFDC was chartered as a state corporation in 1967 to contribute to
increased farmers' incomes and a balanced supply of food products by
assisting and promoting the development of the agroprocessing subsector.
These original objectives were widened through legislation in 1978 and 1983
which entrusted AFDC with management of the Agricultural Products Price
Stabilization Program (APPSP) and improvement of wholesale and retail
markets and agrlcultu .1 marketing services. To achieve these broad
objectives, AFDC maintais subsidiaries and provides loans to private firms
for construction and operation of facilities for storing, processing, and
marketing agricultural and fisheries products. It also provides nrnagerial
and technical assistance for such firm; procures agricultural and
fisheries products for the purpose of supply management and price
stabilization; performs research and extension on storage and processing
technology; and develops domestic and export markets for processed
products.
7.       Although it Is a separate legal entity under the direction of an
Independent Board, AFDC comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries. Its policies and certain important operational
matters, e.g., annual operating plans and budgets, number of professional
staff and their compensation, are subject to MNF approval. The Board of
Directors is chaired by a Presidential appointee and has three ex-officio
positions: the Director General of the Agricultural Policy Bureau (MAF),
the Executive Secretary of the Public Enterprise Management Council (EPB),
and the President of AFDC. Six other positions, by law, may be filled by
persons from research or academic institutions, public enterprises,
consumers' organizations, or other associations related to AFDC operations.
AFDC facilities include its headquarters in Seoul, five branch offices
(Seoul, Taegu, Pusan, Kwangju and Daejon), the Food Research Institute
(FRI) in Suwon, and the Agricultural Marketing Training Institute (ANTI) in
Suwon.



- xii -
8.       APDC's staff has grown from 407 in 1979 (238 professional and
2,169 suppcet staff) to 420 In 1984 (282 professional and 138 support
staff) to 588 (495 professional and 183 support) in August 1986. The
profes.sional staff comprise lawyers, economists, financial analysts, food
techntologists, engineers and marketing specialists. Some 218 staff were
employed at headquarters, 261 at branch offices, 83 at FRI, and 26 at AMTI.
Overall, the quality of the senior atd middle-level management is high.
However, because the salary range authorized by MAP for new employees does
not attract mid-career professional staff, recruitment activities are aimed
at recent university graduates. Consequently, AFDC's technical personnel
are academically well-trained, but generally lack outside experience in
their specialties.
9.       In Its early years (1968-72), AFDC*s financlal support to
agroprocessors was mailay in the form of equity participation, which was
considered then to be casential for stimulating private investment. AFDC
made equity investments totaling W 8,800 million in 26 agroprocessing
firms, most of which proved to be unprofitable and w"ich were sold to
private investors. In order to sell them, it was necessary for AFDC to
convert its equity Into long-term loans at zero Interest. AFDC still
retains total ownership of two subsidiariess Korea Cold Storage Co.,
successfully operating in Seoul, and Hankuk Trading Co., which imports and
exports agricultural and fishery products, mainly to Japan. In addition,
it holds 40S stock ownership in Kortec, Ltd., which dries and processes
tobacco under Government monopoly, and 402 in Maeil Dairy Industries Co.,
which received Bank Group assistance totaling US$22.0 million (Cr. 234-RO
and Ln. 1193-KO). AFDC's equity investment in its subsidiaries amounted to
W 4,409 million and earned dividends of W 659.9 million in 1983.
Prolect Desizn and Imalementatlon
10.      Prolect Desins:  The project design addressed the main issues
which had arisen during implementation of the first project (see PCR for
Loan 994-KO). The scope of the project was widened to include a variety of
agroprocessing activities, conditions of effectiveness were set as those
that could be realistically met, the requirement for international
competitive bidding for subprojects over the free limit was eliminated, and
the types of lending activity to be undertaken were those for which AFDC
had clear responsibility.
11.      Lending to large comDanies:  Even though covenants set the limit
on lending to large companies at less than 402 of Bank funds, this was
recurrent theme in the dialogue between AFDC and the Bank during project
implementation. The Bank's position was that financially attractive
subprojects should be able to obtain funding from alternative sources such
as the Korea Development Bank (RDB) and Krea Long-Term Credit bank (XLB)
especially if the owners of the subprojects were well-established companies
In Korea. The Bank frequently urged AFDC to accelerate lending to small
and medium scale processors so that AFDC would achieve the lending target
set in the Loan Agreement (602 of total funds should be extended to small
and medium sized processors). AFDC's argument was: (1) some types of
sgroprocesslng require sophisticated technology and high-priced modern



- xi i -
equipment necessitating a heavy investment costs that small processors
cannot afford; (2) although there are several institutions able to finanee
the agroprocessing subsector, funds for fixed investments were very limited
in terms of amounts available and lending priority wa given to
manufacturers of export products. AFDC did hold their loans to large
processors within the limit Imposed by the Loan Agreement (13 subloans were
extended totalint W 15.650 million or 35Z of proiect funds). In
retrospect, many of the agroprocessore promoted by the Bank loan were poor
credit risks. The Bank's Inflexibility on this issue is clearly a factor
in AFDC's present financial difficulties; Implementation of Bank projects
has caused the organization to incur losses of W 2,869 million in 1985.
12.      Lendint for cold storaRe facilities: A second recurrent theme in
the dialogue was lending for cold storage. A study financed under the
project (carried out by Samil Company, a local accounting firm) has
estimated regional requirements for additional cold storage facilities
based on existing facilities and projected needs. AFDC argued that of the
existing facilities, those that were more than ten years old were obsolete
and should be considered for replacement of capacdty. From 1981 on, the
Bank urged AFDC to curtail its lending for cold storage. With few
exceptions, AFDC agreed to this position. In retrospect, the cold storage
facilities financed by AFDC are among its successful subloans (plants in
operation without financial difficulties). Whether the Bank was able to
hold expwansion to the financially and economically viable limits or whether
further expansion could have been supported is questionable.
13.      Bad debts:  In January 1984, it became apparent that a number of
APDC's subborrowers were experiencing financial difficulties, as evidenced
by the number of loans in arrears (many of whom were still in the grace
pteriod and only obligated to pay interest). By the end of the year, the
situation had worsened with 27 subprojects under foreclosure proceedings
and repayment of another 42 subloans in arrears. The Bank's supervision
mission in December 1984 focussed on AFDC's policies and procedures and
made a number of recommendations to strengthen AFDC's appraisal,
supervision and loan recovery procedures. In March 1982, the Bank agreed
to permit AFDC to relieve certain subborrowers of the foreign exchange risk
associated with subloans by denominating those subloans in local currency.
However, AFDC's financial situation was imperiled to the point that it
withdrew from the proposed Agricultural Sector Loan then being processed in
the Bank.
14.      AFDC (in their document Proposed Prepayment of Loan 1851-KO,
September 1986) cited the following as the major reasons for bad debts:
(a) The foreign exchange risks borne by the sub-borrowers were too
great.
(b) Lending priority was given to small and medium processors
characterized by:
(i) lack of working capital to expand their operations;



- xiv -
(il) low capacity utilization rates due to unstable supplies
of imported raw materials or the lI ited seasonality of
domestic production;
(ii) difficulty in market development in competition with
large-scale processors having well-established marketing
channels; and
(iv) low profitability resulting from overcompetition among
poor and small-scale processors.
(c) The stable growth of the economy in the 1980s made it more
difficult for newly established companies than during the
period of higher inflation.
(d) Operational difficulties encountered by particular types of
processing:
(i) Chilled storage - low profitability resulting from the
Government's price stabilization policy;
(it) Fish meat processing - production of major raw materials
(such as Alaska pollack, corvenia) decreased and market
development also proved difficult due to medium-quality
of the products;
(Cii)  Drying and pickling - basically low in profitability due
to little value added through simple processing and
(iv) Rice milling - reduced profits due to cessation of rice
Import, rapidly decressing barley production, etc.
15.     Prepayment of the Bant. Loans APDC estimated that the amortization
of the Bank loan when convertad into domestic currency increased by a
weighted average of 34S in 1985 and 14X in the first half of 1985, as a
result of the adjustment factor calculatod from the currency pooling
system. Because of this, the AFDC and the Government requested to
partially prepay the Bank loan without prepayment penalty. The Bank agreed
to waive the penalty and $15.4 million equivalent was prepaid on November
10, 1986. AFDC expects to repay the balance in two installments of US$4.3
million equivaleut in 1987 and in 1988.
Conclusions
16.     To meet the project's objectives:  (a) to support a high priority
Government effort to increase income and employment in the rural areas by
argumenting the value added, (b) to expand production and exports from the
agriculture sector and (c) to increase the supply and quality of processed
foods to consumers, the following might have been dones
(a) More emphasis might have been placed on location (favoring
rural and small city sites), type of facility, and introduction



x v -
of technology rather than on sixe of the subborrower. This
would hAve tended to exclude from project financing small
agroprocessors relying on such traditional methods as drying
and pickling and chilled storage, which account for a large
portion of APDC's bad debts.
(b) More careful analysis of the government's agricultural policies
by the Baik at appraisal and during supervision would have
Indicated the -profitability of financing onion storage, in
the context of the Government's price stabilization program,
which was shown to have national (but not regional)
overcapacity. Also, it is interesting to note that although
the Beak refused to participate on economic grounds in a
program to finance the renovation of the rice milling industry
(for milling of government-procured grain), this project wa
being used to accomplish the same purpose.
(c) Bank funds could have been placed with one of the large
development fianmce companies (such as XDB), which have
received Bank support, and earmarked for agroprocessing.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOEA
SECOND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS PROCESSING PROJECT (LOAN 1851-KO)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The major thrusts of the Government's agricultural development
strategy in the 1970's aimed at expanding farm mechanization, increasing
the output and productivity of agriculture production, mainly the
diversification and expansion of high value foods, and developing storage,
processing and marketing facilities for agricultural products. The
Government encouraged development of the agroprocessing industry to
increase income and employment in the rural area, expand the supply and
quality of processed foods to meet rapidly rising consumer demand, and
increase exports of processed products. In this connection, AFDC initiated
the first Bank-financed project long-term funds for onlending to private
firms to develop and moderniset (i) on-farm production of asparagus,
mushroom and oak mushroom, and ({i) canneries, drying plants and cold
storage facilities for the processing of these crops as well as other
specialty vegetables and fruits. The project became effective in March
1975 and funds were fully disbursed by June 1980. The Second Agricultural
Products Processing Project (Loan 1851-KO) was planned as a follow-up to
the first project with an expansion in scope to provide long-term loans to
a wide variety of agroprocessing enterprises. The project formed part of
the Government's program for development of the sgroprocessing subsector
under the Fourth and Fifth Five-Year Economic Development Plans (1977-81
and 1982-86).
I$. PROJECT FORMULATION
Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     AFDC employed a consulting firm in January 1979 to undertake an
agroprocessing facility study which was completed in May 1979. The scope
and size of the proposed project was based on the above study which
projected the investment needs of the agroprocessing subsector during the
period 1980-1985, the loan demand for such investments indicated by
potential subborrowers to AFDC, and the lending program proposed by AFDC
taking into account its loan processing capacity. During the four-year
project period 1980-1983, the subsector's investment needs were estimated
to be about W 242 billion (US$ 375 million), of which the project would
finance about 15X. Projected lending by six financial intermediaries other
than AFDC indicated that they would finance about one-third (332) of the
investment needs, with the remaining 52Z expected to be financed by the
private sector.



- 2 -
2.02     APDC'o project preparation report ws submitted to the G6vernment
and the Bank in July 1979. The project was appraised by the Bank in
SeptemberlOctober 1979. The project was intended to come on stream so as
to provide an interrupted continuity with the first project.
Proiect Descrb_tion
2.03     The project, as planned at appraisal, supported long-term loans
for the entire agroprocessing subsector.  The agroprocessing enterprises
eligible for financing under the project included freezing and cold
storage, canning, drying, pickling and other preservation of fruits,
vegetables, meat and fisheries products, oil seed extraction, grain based
foods (e.g., noodles), fruit juice based beverages, dairy processing and
non-food processing. All of these enterprises had been identified by the
consultant study as having good prospects for expansion. The project
financed improvements to existing facilities and the construction and
equipping of new facilities. Investments were to be undertaken by the
private sector.
2.04     The project also provided funds for training abroad of the AFDC
Project Department'. technical staff and employment of short-torm foreign
consultants to resolve specific agroprocssing processing problems, carry
out market studies, and support the introduction of nw technology.
2.05     AFDC anticipated about 110 - 120 subloas, ranging from about
US$150,000 to US$1.0 million. Project covenanto set a celling of US$2.0
million on individual subloans, unless agreed by the Bank, and a limit of
40% of the total project funds for loans to large processors.
III. IHPLEKKNTATION
Overvie
3.01     The Loan and Guarantee Agreements were signed on July 27, 1980.
The Loan becam effective on September 3, 1980 after the Bank accepted
evidence submitted by APDC in fulfillment of conditions included
establishment of a department-level unit responsible for the preject.
Project funds vere fully financed by June 10, 1985 and loan disbursement
from the Bank ws completed on June 20, 1985, about nine months after the
closing date originally scheduled In the Loan Agreement.
Oreanization and Manatement
3.02     The AFDC Project Unit, established as a division to Implement the
first project, wEa expanded and upgraded to a Project Department for the
second project in view of the wide range of processing facilities to be
financed and the need to provide adequate technical extension and market
support to processors, mainly small- and medium-size industries. The
Department was headed by a manager and consisted of three division-
-Appraisal, Technical Assistance and Credit Administration--with a total
staff of 30, comprising 26 professionals and four support staff.



-3-
3.03     The Appraisal Division, responsible for appraisal of the
subprojects, had a total of 14 staff, comprising five agroproessaing
specialists, five financial analysts, three marketing specialists sud one
economist. The appraisal procedures Included undertaking field
$nvestigations to assess the capability and financial standing of the sub-
borrowers and competence of their technical staff, suitability of the sub-
project sites in terms of their adequacy for the processing plants and
location, availability of raw material Input, and other related matters.
Project investments were evaluated in terms of their technical feasibility
and financial viability.
3.04     The Technical Assistance Division, comprising two agroprocessing
experts, two processing engineers and a marketing specialist, undertook
regular field visits to supervise processing facilities financed by the
project, including the provision of technical extension and market support
to subborrowers and other processors. Technical extension and market
support included assistnce to processors tot  (i) raise the productivity
of their processing facilities througe better teebAques and methods of
production, utilization of machinery and plant layout, (it) Improve quality
control of both the raw material input and processed output, (III) resolve
processing problems, and (iv) market their output.
3.05     The Credit Administration Division consisted of seven professional
staff and four support staff. The professionals were responsible for
subloan proceeds, collection of subloan repayments, preparation of progress
reports, and liaison with the Bank.
3.06     Of the 26 professionals required, 12 staff were assigned to the
Project Department (PD) in April 1980 at its establishment and nine
positions were filled in July 1980. However, a number of staff did not
have academic or professional qualifications acceptable to the Bank. In
January 1981, the PD was strengthened by outside recruitment of ten staff,
of whom six were suitably qualified for their positions. In spite of
AFDC's efforts to appoint qualified staff through both recruitment and
internal transfer, the results were not particularly successful chiefly due
to various Institutional constraints imposed on state-owned enterprises,
particularly low salaries.    AFDC advised the Bank that efforts to select
better qualified staff to fill the remaining vacant positions would be
concentrated on AFDC Internal sources rather than recruitment outside AFDC.
As a result, the four unqualified staff were replaced in July 1981 and.
vacant positions were filled over the next two years.
Project Lending
3.07     In the first full year of  implementation after loan effectiveness
in September 1980, the project was not far behind the schedule envisaged at
appraisal. However, a significant share of the lending was for frozen and
cold storage rather than other food processing, and large processors
accounted for the majority of subloans. Increasing subloan demand for the
cold storage reflected the good profitability of the cold storage industry
in late 19709, while depressed demand for food processing was attributable



- 4 -
largely to frustrated investment desire affected bys (i) economic
recessions prevailing throughout the world at that time, and (it) food
prices Increasing in 1980 and 1981 at a faster rate than income, Which
resulted in reduced demand for many foodstuffs. The Bank requested that:
(i) further lending for freesing and cold storage be deferred to the latter
part of the project period and total lending for these components not
exceed the amount indicated in the Bank's Appraisal Report (371 of total
lending amount) and (Ui) AFDC accelerated its efforts to lend to medium and
small scale processors to achieve the project objectives.
3.08     AFDC Increased prouotion activities by newspaper advertisements
and other means to: (i) finance medium and small processors hidch were the
principal recipients of the project funds, and (ii) to seek ouLt potentially
profitable investments covering a wide range of food processing eligible
for financing under the project. As a result, the project continued to
progress satisfactorily, and especially the rate of lending picked up
momentum so that total lending, which had been lagging In early 1982 was
again on scheduled at the end of 1982. The project made a; s3gress of 74Z
and 52X in terms of the approved subloan amounts and reimbursements from
the Bank, respectively. Medium and small processors accounted for 602 of
the subloans approved and of these, food processang accounted for 631 and
cold storage 371. These were in compliance with the project target
envisaged under the Loan Agreement and in the Appraisal Report.
3.09     As of June 30, 1984, the project funds were fully committed for
the original target amount of US$63.0 million, including the Government's
contribution of US$13.0 million. Since a portion of the approved subloan
amount would be cancelled due to subborrowers' savings of the project
costs, lack of collateral, etc., AFDC had to receive additional loan
applications to complete disbursements under the project. Therefore, AFDC
proposed to the Bank that the project period be extended to February 28,
1985. The Bank agreed to the proposed extension. A total of 156 subloan
applications were received, of which 128 subloans amounting to W 46,854
million were approved. Another 28 subloans amounting to V 17,826 million
were withdrawn or rejected due to the applicant's weak financial standing,
change of project plan, or proposed type of business outside the scope of
project lending.
3.10     The loan account was closed on June 30, 1985.  Disbursements by
AFDC amounted to W 44,375 million, comprising W 44,103 million to 128
processors and W 272 million for technical assistance. Reimbursement from
the Bank was US$47,304,298.10 and the balance of the loan (US$2,695,701.90)
was cancelled. Annex 2 contains a list of subborrowere, their current
operational status and the amount of subloan; Annex 3 shows the subloan
distribution by region and type of processing.

3.12     To avoid a significant concentration of large subloans and help
finance the investments needs of medium and small processors, lending to large
processors was limited to less than 40S of the project funds with the
remaining 6(% or more earmarked for lending to medium and small processors.
The Government's definition of large and medium/small processors based on
total assets or employment size was used for this purpose. Firms with more
than W 500 million total assets or employment exceeding 300 were conside- d
large, and those with lesser amounts of total assets or number of employees
were medium/small enterprises. Actually, the definition was far from the
reality of the food industry.1 Therefore, AFDC mad a request from changing
the size of eligible subborrowers (expressed in terms of the value of their
total assets) from W 500 million each to W 1 billion each, which was accepted
by the Bank in Marc), 1982. In terms of size, numbers and amounts, 891 of the
loans and 652 of the available funds were made to medium and small scale
enterprises.

Bank's prior approval. Subloans above the APDC free limi.; number 14 or 10I
of the total subloans. At appraisal, these were estimated at about one-
third of the total subloans. All subloan appraisals above the free limit,
Including an economic rate of return analysis, had to be sent to the Bank
for Its review and approval. In the Initial stages of the project
implementation, the market and financial analysis In the subloan appraisal
was not fully satisfactory and took a long time, largely because of the
relative inexperience of Appraisal Division staff in project analysis. In
this connection, copies of subloan appraisals below the free limit were
sent to the Bank for its comment and guidance until an appraisal standard
satisfactory to the Bank was achieved in July 1982.
1   In the case of the food and beverage Industry, firms with more than V 6
billion total assets had been classified as large enterprises under the
Small and Medium Business Act. The size was raised to W 20 billion in
July 1986.

Subloan Terms and Conditions
3.14     The lending rate to subborrowers was determined by the welghted
average cost of AFDC's borrowings from the Bank and the Government plus
minimum 32 interest spread required by AFDC to cover its administrative
costs. An lnterest rate of 122 under the vrolect has been hilher than that
charted by other financial institutions for similar tvIea of loan g10 -
11.52). The subloan repayment period was determined up to 12 years,
including three years grace by AFDC's cash flow estimate of each
subproject. Actually, AFDC granted an average repayment period of nine
years including two years grace.
Subloan Recoverv and Impact on AFDC's Financial Situation
3.15     Payment of subloans is made twice yearly.  If a subborrower falls
to make payment, AFDC sends a letter to request prompt payment. If there
Is no response, a staff member visits the plant and checks out the
operational status. Based on the results, AFDC begins the legal procedures
to have collaterals or guarantees for subloans utilized. Public auction is
held by judiciary courts. If no buyer Is found, AFDC takes possession of
the subproject In order to find any other possible way to recover its
fundst to sell the plant to any buyer offering some funds (five year
repayment with an interest of 11.51) or to integrate It Into APDC's own
operations. During project Implementation, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund
provided the interim collaterals. The Cradlt Fund has rejected seven
claims submitted by AFDC on subprojects foreclosed during construction.
AFDC had to bring lawsuits against the Credit Fund to recover subloans. As
a result, two subloans were recovered. Five claims are currently under
consideration by the courts.
3.16     Subborrowers have Increasingly faced financial difficulties since
the latter half of 1984. Of the 1000 subloans outstanding at the end of
1985, 82 were in arrears, including 29 subprojects under legal proceedings
(Table 3.4).  Increasing foreizn ezchanLe risk o  subloans wa one of the
major reasons for increasina bad debts. In 1986, AFDC took measures to
avert the prospect of further subproject failures. Subloans for 65 small
and medium processors were converted into local currency loans which
relieved them of foreign exchange risks. As a result, sublouns in arrears
were reduced to W 5,222 million for 26 processors In December 1986.

3.17     Over the past five years (1980 - 1984), AFDC's operations resulted
in before tax profits of W 1,979 million despite great losses (W 2,816
million) on lending under the Back-financed projects (Annex 1, Tables 1 and
2). In 1985, AFDC recorded a lost of V 313 million due to increased losses
on Bank projects (W 2,869 million).
Technical Assistance and Trainina
3.18     Originally, the Loan Agreement provided financing for 1002 of
foreign expenditures for technical assistance, market studies and overseas
training. In August 1980, AFDC requested, and the Bank agreed to, an
amendment to the Loan Agreement whereby 1002 of foreign expenditures or 802
of total expenditures for technical assistance would be financed. Funds
allocated for technical assistance components were US$500,000 but
US$323,004 was reimbursed as shown In Table 3.5.

(US$323,004)
3.19     To estimate the investment needs for agroprocessing facilities,
two studies were conducted with the consent of the Bank as part of the
technical component of the project. O-e of them was the rezional cold
storaRe study completed in June 1981. The study report analysed freezing
and cold storage capacity requirements by area. These requirements were
compared with existing capacities, again on an area basis. AFDC's lending
for freezing and cold storage facilities was guided by the findings of the
study on the future investment needs for such facilities. There was an
atroprocessina study in 1983 for pro1ected investment needs in the entire



atrouroceos in  subsector.  Future demand for agroprocessed products was
estimated on the basis of the recent trends In consumption, projected
increases in population and per capita incomes, and the estimated Income
elasticities of demand for the products concerned. Then additional
capacity to meet the project demand for the various processed products was
estimated. AFDC felt obliged to conduct such a study to determine the
direction of lending for agroprocessing facilities in the latter part of
the project.
3.20     AFDC employed foreign experts in agroprocessing, marketing and
processing engineering too (i) assist the Project Department staff In
strengthening subloan appraisal capability, technical extension to
processors and preparation of proper staff training programs, and (it)
prepare a recommendation report for future development of Korea's
agroprocessing industry. Two experts (one agroprocessing expert and one
marketing specialist) were employed by AFDC for six months each in 1982.
Originally AFDC was to employ three experts. However, since one
agroprocesslng specialist had accepted other eomitments imediately before
his assignment to APDC, It was lpossible to assign an alternative expert
in his place. The consultants contributed to increased capability of the
Project Department technical staff in somQ respects, particularly in
project appraisal, and organized preparation of technical design and
reports, but they did not show great competence in carrying out the terms
of reference under the consultant contract, partly because theor working
experiences were limited to some specialized areas, and partly because it
required time for them to familiarize themselves with the real features of
Korea's agrophocessing Industry. Since the foreign experts worked through
their local counterparts, their effectiveness also depended on the quality
of the counterparts.
3.21     AFDC management and staff participated in two to three week study
tours abroad. A loan management team visited promotional institutions in
the agroprocessing subsector in the U.S., Japan and Taiwan for three weeks
In 1983. A marketing management team was sent abroad for three weeks in
July 1984, mainly for observation of marketing chain activities in the same
three countries. Two agroprocessing engineers visited agroprocessing
companies and food research institutions in the U.S. and Denmark for two
weeks in October 1984. The short-term observation tours were not able to
meet the need for specialized on-the-job training to broaden the experience
of technical staff to enable them to anticipate and solve design and
operational problems their subborrowers would encounter. Attendance at
technical short courses abroad would have been more effective.
Cost and Financing
3.22     The total project cost wa estimated to be W 48,600 million on
which 601 would be foreign exchange costs (Table 3.6). Directly imported
equipment accounted for 7S of project costs, because civil works could be
supplied locally and there were many local suppliers of agroprocessing and
.ilated o  iApment, including facilities to service them.  Imported
equipment was limited largely to sophisticated, fully automated processing
lines to produce uniform and high quality products as adopted by large-
scale plants. Modern equipment and methods for processing meat and dairy
products, snack foods, fish meat paste, etc. were introduced for this
purpose.

3.23    At appraisal the subborrowers were expected to finance 252 (US$21
million) of the total project cost of US$84 million, APDC 152 (US$13
million) and the Bank 602 (US$50 million), which was equivalent to the
foreign exchange cost. APDC genorally provided 75Z of eligible project
costs which included cvil works, equipment, design and contingencies.
Actually the Bank finanaing amounted to US$47.304 million and tie
Government's contribution, equivalent to US$13.0 million, was wholly
provided to AFDC. The subborrowers' contribution increased to 322, while
the Bank and AFDC share declined to 54Z and 141, respectively. However,
the proportion botween the Bank and APDC share remained unchanged on local
currency basis (79:21).

Procurement
3.24     AFDC's procurement procedures and arrangements were in line with
those of other financial institutions in Korea. The procedures were
designed to ensure that procurement would be performed with due regard for
economy and efficiency. Borrowers were required to procure through local
competitive bidding (LCB) or prudent shopping using the three-bid method,
depending on the type of items and amounts involved:
(a) For subprojects requiring only ciiil works, procurement was
subject to the three-bid method for contract amounts up to
US$500,000 and LCB for amounts over US$500,000;
(b) For subprojects requiring only equipment, procurement was made
through the three-bid method for contracts up to US$100,000 and
LCB for amounts exceeding US$100,000; and
(c) For procurement of both civil works and equipment under a
single contract, LCB was applied to contract amounts exceeding
US$600,000.
Purchase off-the-shelf was also permitted where appropriate, normally for
smnor items or if it wes cost effective. The final award of the contract
was subject to AFDCs approval. Under the project, procurement by
subborrowers was generally economical and efficient.
Disbursement and Allocation of Loan Proceeds
3.25     After the first year of the project's implementation period, the
disbursement rate increased slowly, but disbursements lagged behind
appraisal estimates in spite of APDC"s endeavors to achieve the lending
target (para. 3.09 and 3.09).

IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION
4.01     The project has attained the following economic benefitas
(a) establishment of 128 agroprocessing facilities including
improvements in five existing plants;
(b) creation of 3,500 jobs in processing at an estimated cost of
US$24,800 per job;
(c) temporary employment for about 2 million manday. annually,
excluding employment of workers for construction the processing
facilities;
(d) freeinsg, cold storage and processing of a wide variety of
agricultural, livestock and fishety products valued at W 210
billion In 1985;
(e) yearly export earnings of US$35 million (e.g., frozen
strawberries, processed chestnuts, snack foods, fish meat
paste);
(f) reduced wastage of farm produce from spoilage and loss through
the provislon of additional processing and cold storage
capacity, and improved effici.ency of processing; and
(g) non-quantifiable benefits such as improvements to public health
through increased supply of better quality and larger variety
of processed foods and other agricultural products processed at
more hygienic facilities.
The table below shows the project achievements in comparison to those
envisaged at appraisal.

Financial Rate of Return
4.02     At appraisal the overall financial rate of return (FRR) for the
types and numbers likely to be financed was estimated at about 24X, based
on typical models of each of the subprojects. The estimated overall
economic rate of return (ERR) was about 212. The financial rate of return,
after financing was less than anticipated at appraisal, ranging from IIZ to
171 with an overall FRR of about 141. These are based on the typical
processing plants now in normal operation (Annex 4, Tables 1-8).

Operational Status of the Subborrowers
4.03     At the end of 1986, 108 subprojects or 84X of the 128 cold storage
and processing facilities financed under the project were In operation.
Another 17 subprojects (132) were closed down, mainly for financial
difficulties and the remaining three subprojects (3Z) were being used for
purposes other than processing (Table 4.3). Pro^essors in freezing and
cold storage, canning and meat processing are in normal operation. Success
In freezing and cold storage operation lies in the fact that such
facilities are situated in large production areas like Busan or in the
vicinity of large consumption areas.  Subloans for canning and meat
processing were disbursed to large processors or much experience companies.
4.04     Meanwhile, processors engaging in chill storage, fish meat
processing, drying and vegetable preservation have not shown good
operational results. Since most chill storage operators depend on the
storage of onions, their business success is affected by the production and
price trend of onions. For the past five years, Government price
stabilization schemes for this crop have not been in favor of storage
operators. Especially in 1981 and 1982, when most subborrowers were in
their first or second operating year, their operating loss in onion storage
was too great to sustain. Low operating performance in fish meat
processing is attributable to difficulty in market development and
decreasing rw material production like Alaska pollack and corvenia. Since
aubborrowers are mostly medium sized processors producing relatively high
prices, medium quality products, they have to compete with poor and mall-
sized processors' low priced, low quality products and the large
processors' high quality products. Drying and vegetable preservation
industries are in low capacity utilization due to the seasonality of raw
material production and overcompetition among small processors.

4.05     As compared with large processors, small and medium processors,
accounting for 892 of the subloans, encounter many operational problems In
carrying out their business due to lack of working capital and competent
personnel, relatively slow response to changing market conditions, market
development requiring higher cost with one product or a few products,
increasing market entry by foreign brand grocessed foods, consumers;
preference for famous brands, large processors' participation In producing
prospective intermediate products, etc. However, in recent years,
subborrowers have tot into severe financial difficulties In vart because of
the foreian exchante risk on t1he Bank loan. Large processors financed
under the project have till now no problems, while few small firms have the
resources to sustain losses during the downturns in their business cycles.
4.06     To date, ownership of 36 subprojects or 282 of the total subloans
has already been transferred to other processors apparently because of
operational problems enumerated above. Some part of subproject failure
would be found in superficial evaluation of subprojects to achieve the
lending target. Especially, subloan appraisal for inexperience, newly
established companies should have been more prudent.
4.07     The follow measures have been taken to assist subborrowers,
especially small and medium processors, in improving their operating
status$
(a) The Government made a local currency loan to AFDC in the amount
of W 17.1 billion so that AFDC could refinance 65 still
operating small and medium size subprojects that had received
subloans from the Bank loan. The lending rate to subborrowers
is 122 p.a.2 and the repayment period has been extended to one
to four years from the previous commitment period, based on the
foreism exchange loss of each subyro1ect. By refinancinz these
subloans with local currency, the subborrowers were relieved of
the foreign exchanze risk.
(b) For chill storage operators, electricity charges account for
about 372 of their chill storage costs. On the recommendation
of the Chill Storage Operators Association, the Government has
reduced their electricity charges by some 40S by applying
farming purpose electricity charges (basic W 1,019lkW,
additional W 35/kWh). Previously, lidustrial use charges were
applied (basic W 3,495/kW, additional W 52/kWh).
(c) Working capital financing has been Increased. Especially, the
list of commodities eligible for financing under raw material
procurement loans has been expanded (i.e., potatoes, carrots,
ginger).
2   The lending rate was reduced to 112 on January 1, 1987.



- 16 -
(d) AFDC provided market outlet arrangements for small and medium
processors. Their products are distributed to AFDC's direct
sales stores. Their lntermediate goods like fish meat paste
are supplied to AFDC's subsidiary company or other large
processors; and
(e) Technical extension and training for processors are provided by
AFDC's Food Research Institute. Technical assistance provided
includes instant food packaging, oil extraction techniques, and
storage methods for natural pine mushroom.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
5.01     The project helped AFDC to strengthen its capability to carry out
its role as a development finance organization, i.e., to select viable
enterprises and provide the financial, managerial and technical assistance,
as needed, for implementation of agroprocensing subprojects which generate
non-farm jobs for rural workers and offer alternative market outlets for
farmers' production. To Improve the effectiveness of its appraisal,
supervision and technical assistance, AFDC upgraded training programs for
its Project Department staff which Included on-the-job training by senior
staff and short-term overseas study tours. APDC supplemented, from time to
time, its technical capability by recruiting both local and foreign
consultants when needed for appraisal, market studies or other activities.
5.02     In the course of the implementation of the Bank-financed project,
AFDC has been gradually realized as the agency exclusively responsible for
development of the agroprocessing Industry. Under the rural industry
promotion program implemented in 1985, the Government is planning to
establish 150 rural industrial complexes throughout the country. AFDC
assumed responsibility for financial and non-financial support to the
agroprocessing subsector under the program. The lending target ln 1986 was
W 20 billion and the comparable volume in 1987 is expected to be V 30
billion, of which some 201 will be for agroprocessing facilities (cold)
storage and rice milling is not eligible for financing under the program).
5.03     AMDC was created as a development agency to support and engage in
measures designed to contribute to increased farm income and a balanced
supply of food products. These measures have been expanded over time to
include development and promotion of the agroprocessing industry,
administration of the Agricultural Products Price Stabilization Program
(APPSP), research on food processing technology, and improvement of
agricultural marketing, including marketing training at its Agricultural
Marketing Training Institute. AFDC's activities would bo widened under the
proposed Agriculture and Fisheries Marketing Corporation (AFNC), which
would substitute for AFDC. The proposed APMC is now under consideration by
the National Assembly.3 AFDC's future activities would involve:
(i) specializing in import of agricultural and fishery products for price
3 AFHC was approved by the National Assembly on December 31, 1986.

stabilization and policy purposes, (li) taking over marketing support
services (i.e., informstion, training, food research and developments) as
Its own operation from currently governmont-sponsored operations,
(III) promoting development of the flower industry, (iv) strengthening
overseas market information services Including establishoment of a branch
office, (v) gradual expansion of barter trade to export surplus produce
such as apple, pear, garlic and onion, and (vi) export market development
for prospective Items like tomato, cucumber and strawberry,
(vii) controlling the direct operstion of the APPSP, and (vili) transfer of
some items (i.e., sesame, red bean), under buffer stock operation Into
AEDC's own operation.
VI.  AMN  PE1RFMlANCE
6.01     In all there were six supervision missions during project
lmplementation. Through supervision missions and review of subloans, the
Bank has made a significant contribution to institutional development of
AFDC as a stronger and truly development-oriented organization. The Bank's
assistance ranged from review and comments of subloan appraisal reports to
the selection of consultant candidates, suggestions on market studies and
proeurement procedures, end upgraded training program. In early 1584 the
project showed evidence that a number of subborrowers were experience
financing difficulties. The Bank pointed out some specific areas to be
focussed in subproject appraisal, including creditworthiness of the
borrower, reliability and completeness of his financial statements, the
sensitivity of the financial analysis to product price decreases or raw
material price increases, and the accuracy of market projections. This
helped AFDC to select more financial responsible borrowers and more viable
projects for the next lending activities. In particular, the December 1984
supervision mission focussed mainly on the issue of subproject
foreclosures, paying particular attention to APDC's policies and procedures
for appraisal, supervision, loan administration, and technical assistance.
The mission's findings and recommendations were helpful to AFDC as it works
out a solution to the problem of foreclosures. Bank supervision of the
project was also adequate in terms of frequency of supervision missions.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01     Development of the agroprocessing industry was an objective of the
Government's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1982-86). Justification fro adopting
the objective rested on satisfying consumer demand for processed
agricultural, livestock and fisheries products, and increasing rural
incomes and creating additional employment. The project played an
Important role In achieving this, resulting in increased rural income and
employment, although it did not reach the levels anticipated at appraisal.

7.02     The main lessons to be learned from the second project ares
(a) Proiect desian. The project design addressed the main Issues
that had arisen during implementation of Loan 994-KO (discussed
in the overview of the Project Performance Audit Report), such
as project scope, project organization, effectiveness
conditions and project procurement. Those ame issues did not
arise again during the second project.
(b) Larne agrovrocessors. Since the scale of operations in the
agroprocessing industry was getting larger in line with the
growth of the economy and certain types of agroprocessing
business vould be bighly capital Intensive requiring
Introduction of advanced foreign technology and equipment,
AFDC proposed more subloans to large companies. The number of
bad debts might not have been so great If the Bank had agreed
to a greater portion of the loan being extended to large
agroprocessors.
(c)  Cold st,rare.  The loan could have supported more cold storage
companies since cold stores located in large fishing ports have
enjoyed comparatively high utilization rates. AFDC proposed
subloans for cold storage facilities, especially around the
Busan area, and the lank continuously urged AFDC to hold down
on the number of such subloans to prevent overcapacity. Cold
storage companies in these areas are doing well.
