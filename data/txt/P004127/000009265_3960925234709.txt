MEMORANDUM TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS AND THE PRESIDENT
SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on Korea
Urban Land Development Prolect (Loan 2704-KO)
Attached is a copy of the report entitled "Project Completion Report
on Korea - Urban Land Development Project (Loan 2704-KO)" prepared by the East
Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The Borrower did not provide Part II.
The project exceeded its targets in terms of supply of serviced land.
Institutional development was successful: the required studies were completed and
new procedures established based on their conclusions, and the related training
program was implemented. However, the administrative capacity of the project
entity did not keep up with the rapid growth of its activities. Furthermore, the
project achieved little in relaxing the restrictive regulations which stand in
the way of effective private sector involvement in housing and the provision of
an adequate supply of serviced land.
On balance, the project is rated as satisfactory, its institutional
development impact as partial (due to its limited impact on broader sectoral
objectives), and the sustainability of its policy approach as uncertain, although
the direct benefits of the project are sustained.
No audit is planned.

URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2704-KO)
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Korea Urban Land
Development Project, for which Loan 2704-KO in the amount of US$150 million was
approved on May 29, 1986. The last disbursement was made on June 8, 1990 and the
loan was closed earlier than the scheduled closing date of December 31, 1990.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure operations Division of the
East Asia and Pacific Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The
Government did not provide Part II.
Preparation of this PCR was based , inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the Loan Agreement, supervision mission reports, correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
KOREA
URBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (LOAN 2704-KO)
Evaluation Summarv
Introduction
I.          This project was one of a series developed and implemented since 1980
to address th. problems of the Korean housing sector. Bank involvement in this
area began with the National Urban Land Development and Housing Loans I (1980-KO)
and II (2216-KO) of 1981 and 1982, which supported the activities of government
land development and housing production agencies. A later evaluation of the
projects found that while they had met their physical goals, they had set and had
met only limited goals for orienting the country's housing policy. Their impact
on the housing sector was judged to be minimal. A broader sectoral focus was
reflected in two subsequent loans intended to deal with the perceived
"bottlenecks in the housing sector. This project was to deal with the shortage
of serviced land while the Housing Finance Sector Project of 1987 (Loan 2853-KO)
addressed the shortage of housing finance. A final project, the Housing Sector
Loan (3329-KO) of 1991, addresses housing policy as a whole.
Obiectives.
ii.         The project was intended to increase the supply of serviced land in
Korea by assisting KLDC in fulfilling its role under the Sixth Economic and
Social  Development  Plan  (1987-1991).    Thus,  the  project  supported  the
Government's housing sector policy which relied on direct intervention in the
sector. The project had four main objectives:
(a)   strengthening KLDC's management and administration;
(b)   establishing corporate goals for serving the low-income population;
(c)   improving KLDC's  project  evaluation procedures,  and  its  cost
allocation and pricing policies; and
(d) supporting KLDC's urban land development program.
iii.        These objectives were pursued in the project through two major
components. First, an investment component would finance a time slice of KLDC's
land development program. Secondly, an institutional strengthening component
would improve KLDC's site selection and pricing policies as well as its internal
financial management.
iv.         Investment Component. The Project would partially finance a four year
time slice (1986-89) of KLDC's land developmnt activities.  K.DC's program
required the acquisition of about 2,700 ha of land for housing and 1,000 ha of
land for industrial sites.  A total of 3,700 ha of serviced land over 120 sites



- iii -
would be supplied. The total cost of KLDC land development activities during
this period was estimated at appraisal as US$1,849 million; Bank financing would
supply US$150 million, or 8% of project costs.
v.          Institutional ComDonent. The institutional strengthening program was
intended to deal with a number of deficiencies in planning and internal financial
management identified during the previous projects.   The *pecific goals of the
institutional strengthening program were set forth in the Institutional
Development Program which was to be fully implemented by December 31, 1987. The
major goals of this Program were new long-term planning procedures, improved
criteria for physical planning and site selection, improved cost allocation and
pricing policies, computerized accounting and information systems, and a training
policy. To achieve these ends, KLDC financed studies of current practices and
engaged consultant services to improve accounting and management.
ImDlementation ExDerience.
vi.         KLDC was more than successful in meeting the goals of the investment
component.   Soon after appraisal, KLDC's land development goals under the
Government's housing program were increased. As a consequence, both the area of
land acquired and the investment in land acquisition grew at a more rapid pace
than predicted. By the end of 1989, KLDC had acquired 71,435 Ha., rather than
the 44,853 predicted. While the land development process proceeded at a slower
pace than anticipated, by the end of 1989 both the area developed and the
investment in land development were approximately equal to the original
estimates. By the end of 1990, the area developed was 30% over the predicted
level over the period and expenditures on land development were nearly twice
appraisal.
vii.        The cost of KLDC activities was, however, underestimated. The price
of acquired land rose rapidly and averaged Won 348,000 rather than the predicted
Won 264,000. Total expenditure on land acquisition was Won 2,488 billion rather
than the appraisal value of Won 1,183 billion. Although the development process
ran more slowly than expected, costs per ha. were higher, bringing expenditure
on land development during the period to the appraisal estimates. The total cost
of the program rose to US$3,936 million, over twice the original appraisal
estimates.
viii.       RLDC also fulfilled all the requirements of the institutional
development program as set forth in both the Policy statement and the Appraisal
Report. The required studies were performed on a timely basis and new procedures
were based on them. Implementation of some systems took longer than anticipated,
but were completed by the end of the project.
Proiect Impact.
ix.         KLDC was projected at the time of appraisal to be a major contributor
to the housing goals of the Sixth Economic and Social Development Plan. However,
because of additional responsibilities given to it, KLDC quickly became a more
important institution in the housing sector than anticipated. Between 1986 and
1989, KLDC accounted for 40% of all land development activities in Korea. In



- iv -
1989, KLDC was responsible for half of all land development investment.
x.          KLDC was notably  successful  in implementing  its institutional
development program. Bank staff played a central role in achieving this result,
providing substantial assistance to the institution on selection of computer
systems and the design of financial  procedures.   However,  the  increased
responsibility placed on KLDC in the Government's expanded housing program
strained the institution's managerial and financial capacity. As a consequence,
the performance indicators set to test the success of the program deteriorated.
Administrative costs and staff per ha. of developed land rose as did the level
of inventories.  The institution was also forced to become dependent on debt
financing to launch the expanded development program.   Nonetheless, KLDC was
extremely profitable during the project period.  However, the institution's
profitability was largely due to the continued increase in land prices during the
project period.
xi.         KLDC's notable succeso in implementing its institutional development
program and fulfilling its role in the Sixth Economic and Social Development Plan
began to show results by the end of the 1980s. Both the real rate of increase
of land and housing prices and the ratio of housing prices to income have
moderated. In the early 1990., house and land prices began to decline. These
results suggest that the institution has been somewhat successful in reducing the
pressures in the housing sector though not sufficiently to bring prices or sector
conditions to their levels in the 1970s.
xii.        However, KLDC's success in fulfilling the objectives of the project
ultimately did little to solve the problem's of the Korean housing sector; the
institution's massive land development program served primarily to counter the
restrictions on the land and housing markets created by the Korean regulatory
environment.  These restrictions, which reduced the ability of private land
developers to respond to demand, forced the institution to take on a dominant
role in the land market. But KLDC's declining efficiency under these demands,
despite the good performance of its management in improving procedures and
systems, casts serious doubt both on the ability of one institution to
efficiently fulfill the needs of the Korean housing market and on the general
direct intervention approach.   Thus, the regulatory environment forced the
Government to pursue a strategy which was ultimately unsustainable.
Lessons Learned.
xiii.       Bank staff can olay an important role in Institutional DeveloDment
Prorams. This project benefitted considerably from the input of Bank staff with
a strong background in managerial and computer systems. It is likely that in
other environments, where such skills are even more rare, such assistance will
be of even greater value.
xiv.        The imiact of Institutional Develooment Proorame will be limited in
a counterproductive policv environment, While this project achieved noteworthy
success in improving the managerial capability of the client institution, that
institution operates in a policy environment which forces it to take on a
dominant sectoral role. Such an environment not only makes it difficult for the



client institution to increase its managerial efficiency, but also is ultimately
unsustainable an a solution to sector problems. KLDC will continue to make a
sizeable contribution to the Korean housing sector, but relying on it as the main
actor in a direct intervention strategy places undue burdens on the institution.
Reducing regulatory distortions, as is contemplated in the Housing Sector Loan
approved in 1991, will both reduce the burdens placed on KLDC and set the stage
for sustainable improvements in the Korean housing sector.

A. Introduction
1.   This project was one of a series developed and implemented mince 1980 to
address the problems of the Korean housing sector. Bank involvement in this area
began with the National Urban Land Development and Housing Loans I (1980-KO) and
II (2216-RO) of 1981 and 1982 which supported the activities of Goverinnt land
development and housing production agencies. A later evaluation of the projects
found that while they had met their physical goals, they had set and had met only
limited goals for orienting the country's housing policy. Their impact on the
housing sector was judged to be minimal. A broader sectoral focus was reflected
in two subsequent loans intended to deal with the perceived 'bottlenecks in the
housing sector, the Urban Land Development Project of 1986 (Loan 2704-KO) and the
Housing Finance Sector Project of 1987 (Loan 2853-KO). A recent project, the
Housing Sector Loan of 1991 (Loan 3329-KO), addresses housing policy as a whole.
B. Proiect Backargund
2.    The Housino Sector and the DOvloment of Korean Housino Polisv.  The
portfolio of housing projects cited above is a reflection of the evolution of the
Government of Korea's housing policy and the Bank's role in it. Korean housing
policy has evolved from neglect of the sector through the early 19709 to an
emphasis on direct provision of housing. By the early 1980s, Government policy
had shifted to direct provision of important "inputsm in the construction of
housing, namely, serviced land and long-term finance.  The  Urban Land and
Housing Finance projects were intended to contribute to this effort.  Only
recently has the integral role of policy in the housing sector been given direct
attention in both the Government's and the Bank's strategy for addressing housing
sector problms.
3.   Korean development policy has always entailed a high degree of direct
intervention in the economy. During the 1950e and 1960s, economic growth was
financed by steering resources to export industries through directed credit
programs and other mechanisms After a period of rebuilding war damages during
the 1950s, housing was largely neglected until the 1970s.



-2-
4.    At that time, the consequences of years of neglect of the housing sector
began to be soon.   Economic growth was accompanied by a rapid rate of
urbanization; the urban population grew at an average annual rate of 5.4% from
1960-88, a rate nearly three times that of the total population. By 1988, the
nation was over three quarters urban. However, low investment in urban housing
led to rapid increases in crowding and housing prices. As a response, a housing
policy was formulated in a ten year housing plan and specific sectoral goals were
set in economic planning.
5.    These goals were pursued through a large degree of direct Government
intervention in the production of housing and its major inputs. Several major
institutions were created to finance housing (the Korea Housing Bank, KHB), to
develop serviced land (the Korea Land Development Corporation, KLDC) and to build
and finance low income housing (the Korea National Housing Corporation, KNHC, and
the National Housing Fund, NHF). Under the Third Five Year Economic and Social
Development Plan (1972-76), 30% of new housing was created by both national and
local public agencies. In the late 1970s, an effort to "cool' the housing sector
restricted private housing development, thereby giving public institutions a
still more important role.
6.    The Bank began discussions with the Korean Government on the possibility
of a housing loan in the late 1970s. By the early 1980s, two loans financing
land developm nt activities of KLDC and housing construction and mortgage lending
through KNHC and NH? (Loans 1980-KO and 2216-KO) had been approved. These two
loans attempted both to improve the operations of the two institutions and to
demonstrate through the Bank-financed portion of their programs the feasibility
of lower plot size and building standards. Later evaluation of these projects
found that while they were largely successful in meeting these goals, they had
little ultimate impact on the housing sector.V
7.    Despite the increa-sd emphasis on improving conditions, the Korean housing
sector still displayed signs of a large level of excess demand. By 1985, the
Korean housing price index had reached a level almost eight times its 1974 level
while an index of both construction material and general consumer prices grew at
only half that rate.  Thus, housing costs grew at an average annual rate of
approximately 20%--a real rate of increase of 6.53% per year. Evidence suggests
that these trends had a significant impact on affordability despite wage
increases during the same years.  The ratio of single family house prices to
incomes, a common measure of housing affordability, doubled during the 1970s from
2.31 in 1976 to 5.64 in 1980. Despite a decline in the early 1980s the ratio
remained high at 4.66. Preliminary research suggests that this problems may have
been even more acute among low-income households.V

8.    By the mid 1980s, the Government had launched a major program to increase
the supply of housing. Two million houses were to bo built during the latter
part of the decade. As attempts were made to formulate a response to housing
sector problems, two factors were identified as the major constraints on housing
supply: inadequate supply of serviced land and housing finance. Both public
land development agencies and housing finance institutions were given ambitious
goals to complete as part of this program. Under the Sixth Plan (1987-91), KLDC
was to provide 4,700 ha of serviced land in 50 municipalities with total
investment of $3,300 million (W 2,750 billion). This constituted an increase of
over 30% over the goals of the Fifth Plan (1982-1986), of 3,540 ha of land in 40
municipalities. It should be noted that the actual investment under the Fifth
Plan-$2,054 million-fell short of this goal.
9.    This project (Loan 2704-KO) participated in the expansion of Government
housing programs by supporting the expansion of serviced land development while
the Housing Finance Project (Loan 2853-KO) addressed the deficiencies in the
housing finance system.
C.    Proiect Obiectives and DescriDtion
10.   This project was intended to increase the supply of serviced land in Korea
by assisting KLDC in fulfilling its role under the Sixth Plan. Thus, the project
supported the Government's housing sector policy which relied on direct
intervention in the sector. The project had four principle objectives:
(a)   strengthening KLDC's management and administration;
(b)   establishing corporate goals for serving the low-income population;
(C)   improving KLDC's  project  evaluation  proe dures,  and  its  cost
allocation and pricing policiese and
(d)   supporting KLDC's urban land development program.
D.    Prolect Desian and Oraanization
11.   These objectives were pursued in the project through two major components.
First, an investment component would finance a time slice of KLDC's land
development program. Secondly, an institutional strengthening component would
improve KLDC's site selection and pricing policies as well as its internal
financial management.
12.   Investment Comioonent.  The Project would partly finance a four year time
slice (1986-89) of KLDC's land development activities. KLDC's program required
the acquisition of about 2,700 ha of land for housing and 1,000 ha of land for
industrial sites. A total of 3,700 ha of serviced land over 120 sites would be
supplied. The total cost of KLDC land development activities during this period
was estimated at appraisal as US$ 1,849 million; Bank financing would supply US$
150 million, or 8% of project costs.



-4-
13.   To simplify loan administration, disbursements would be made only against
civil works contracts of more than US$ 5 million each and 60% of the cost of such
contracts would be reimbursed.
14.   Institutional Strenathenina Comoonent.  Bank experience with KLDC during
previous projects had identified a number of deficiencies in planning, marketing
and internal financial management. A technical assistance program was degigned
to help the institution improve its *ite selection process, its land pricing
policy, financial planning procedures, and accounting system.
15.   During Project Appraisal, it was apparent that there were several problems
in the way land development mites were chosen for development and sold after
development.   First, there were several technical deficiencies in the site
selection process. Sites were selected on a "least cost" basis, where cost was
primarily dependent on land acquisition. Little attention was paid to the market
demand in the particular sites. As a result, very large mites were selected in
locations where land was cheap, i.e., far from city centers or in cities were
growth was low. Since there was little demand in these locations, sales were
slow and the inventory of unsold developed land was large. KLDC's site selection
policy had been a source of conflict with other agencies in the previous project
(Loan 1980-KO).   In particular, KNHC frequently complained that the KLDC
developed sites in locations where it was difficult to find buyers.
16.   Several deficiencies were also noted in the manner in which the selling
price for developed land was calculated.   First,  development  costs were
underestimated; financial expenses of land development, such as the cost of
capital over the development period, were excluded from the selling price
calculations. Second, sale prices did not reflect market values. All land was
sold at the same price, with no differentiation for land in better locations or
with better access to services.  These factors contributed to the inventory
problem, since land with a lower market value was effectively overpriced and sold
slowly.
17.   Finally, weaknesses were noted in KLDC's long-term financial planning and
accounting systems.
18.   The project sought to improve KLDC's management and administration.  The
specific goals were set forth in the Institutional Development Program which was
to be fully implemented by December 31, 1987. This program included:
(a)   The strengthening of KLDC's financial management
(b)   The establishment of improved criteria for physical planning and
site selection;
(c)   A review of cost allocation and pricing policies;
(d)   The establishment of information systems for project planning and
financial management, and the annual updating of short- and medium-
term corporate plans, including development programs and financial
projectionsl



- 5 -
(-)   The establishment of training programs and the construction of a
training center; and
(f)   The establishment of computerized accounting and payroll systems.
19.   To achieve these ends, the Bank mandated and KLDC financed studieu of the
institution's current practices and consultant services to improve accounting and
management, etc. The specific services identified for financing at appraisal
were studies of land pricing and financial management, implementation of long-
term financial planning and new site evaluation procedures, computerization of
the payroll and accounting systems, and the establishment of performance oriented
goals and a training center.
E.    Proiect Imolementation
20.   Investment Component.  The level of KLDC investment quickly exceeded the
estimates at the time of appraisal. Now activities, such as the industrial land
development activities of the Korea Water Resources Corporation were transferred
to the institution. Moreover, after appraisal the Government of Korea launched
an ambitious program to build 2 million houses, thereby increasing the pressure
on KLDC to supply serviced land. As early as 1987, KLDC's level of activity
exceeded appraisal estimates by some 40%.
21.  As a consequence, both the amount of land acquired and the investment in
land acquisition grew at a more rapid pace than predicted.   By the end of 1989,
KLDC had acquired 71,435 ha., instead of the 44,853 predicted. However, the land
development process took longer than expected. The rate at which land area was
developed from 1986 through 1988 fell 30% below the prediction at appraisal.
However, in 1989 and 1990, the area developed displayed a rapid expansion. By
the end of the project in 1989, both the area developed and the investment in
land development were approximately equal to the appraisal estimates. By the end
of 1990, the area developed was 30% over the predicted level over the period and
expenditures on land development were nearly twice those of appraisal estimates.
Land sales also lagged behind the original estimates, not reaching the appraised
level until the end of 1989, though exceeding that prediction in 1990.
22.   The cost of KLDC activities was also underestimated. The price of acquired
land rose rapidly and averaged Won 348,000 rather than the predicted Won 264,000.
Total expenditure on land acquisition was Won 2,488 billion rather than the
appraisal value of Won 1,183 billion. Although the development process occurred
more slowly than expected, costs per ha were higher, bringing expenditure on land
development during the period to the appraisal estimates. The total cost of the
expanded land development program rose to Won 3,381 billion, over twice the
estimate at appraisal.
23.  Loan disbursements proceeded smoothly.  While KLDC had little problem
complying with Bank procurement requirements, minor adjustments were made in
disbursement procedures to help the institution smooth cash flow. The loan was
totally disbursed by June 1990, six months ahead of schedule.

24.   Institutional Development Proaram. KLDC fulfilled all the requirements of
the institutional development program as set forth in both the Policy Statement
and the Staff Appraisal Report. The required studies were performed on a timely
basis and new procedures were based on their conclusions. However, despite these
new procedures, KLDC still had some difficulty reaching the ambitious goals of
the institutional development program.
25.   Physical Plannina and Site Selection. A study setting forth new procedures
for site evaluation was completed in 1986 and its recommendations were tested in
1987. KLDC now considers market potential, costs, and expected profitability in
selecting sites.  A Project Feasibility Deliberation Committee was formed to
analyze the financial return on projects and a computer program to evaluate the
financial return in various sites was created. However, as of 1989, the program
was still available only in English, thereby limiting it. applicability.
Consequently, market analysis was still under-emphasized in site evaluation.
26.   Land oricina policy.  A consultant report on plot pricing policy was
presented in early 1987 and its recommendations were adapted to and implemented
in KLDC operations.   Sale prices are now based on estimates by certified
appraisers. Thus, land prices should implicitly reflect both locational factors
and local market conditions. The amount of discount given to land sold to other
public agencies also varies by location.  However, within projects, there is
still little price differentiation according to location or access to services
for residential plots. Industrial and commercial plots are sold at auction, and
can be assumed to fully reflect such factors.
27.   Analysis of development costs have also improved. KLDC cost estimates now
include a financial opportunity cost for carrying land. However, this cost is
calculated using the current rate on 3 month certificates of deposit. This rate
has been controlled since 1985 and is now negative in real terms. By comparison,
the corporate debt market, which would better reflect KLDC's opportunity costs,
is currently paying 18%. Moreover, the continued increase in land prices (until
recently) was sufficient to overcome any carrying costs, and KLDC financial
calculations therefore tended to give less emphasis to such factors.
28.   Financial Manaaement.  A detailed financial model for planning cash flow
and financial management was prepared in 1986 and implemented in 1987. Long-term
financial plans were being prepared every two years. A study was completed in
1987 providing recommendations on accounting for projects, land, accounts payable
and cost allocation.
29.   Computerization. Significant efforts were made by KLDC staff in this area,
though progress was somewhat slower than expected. The computerized accounting
system was not available until 1990. The principal problem encountered was the
difficulty in finding computer equipment and developing software that could be
used in the local language (Hangul).
30.   Trainina.  A local and overseas training program was established almost
immediately. The training center was established in 1988.

F.    Maior Results of the Proiect
31.   Contribution to *uoolv of land develop,ed.   LDC was projected at the time
of appraisal to be a major contributor to the houuing goals of the Sixth
Development Plan. However, because of the additional responsibilities assigned
to it (see para. 20), it quickly became a more important institution in the
housing sector than anticipated. Between 1986 and 1989, KLDC accounted for 40%
of all land development activities in Korea. In 1989, KLDC was responsible for
half of all land development investment.
32.   Institutional  Develooment  Proaram.   KLDC wan notably  successful  in
implementing its institutional development program.   However, the increased
responsibility placed on KLDC in the Government's expanded housing program
strained the institution's managerial and financial capacity. This factor makes
a clear evaluation of the institutional development program difficult.
33.   KLDC's management was strained by the rapid expansion of activities during
this period. Staff and administrative expenses increased substantially under the
ambitious program. Administrative expenses on sales were twice the estimate at
appraisal and in 1989, the number of employees per ha of land under development
was 50% above projections. Inventories of unsold land remained large, although
KLDC officials ascribe this trend to the business cycle of land sales rather than
badly chosen projects. Financial management suffered as well. To finance the
rapid rate of expansion, KLDC had to leverage itself to a greater extent than
predicted. By the end of the project, the debt to equity ratio was well over the
"maximum" permitted at the beginning of the project.
34.   Nonetheless, KLDC was extremely profitable during the project period. Net
income on sales averaged over 30% betwaen 1986 and 1989 v Profits were in fact
so high that a public relations campaign was launched to explain the source of
such high income. However, this high rate of profitability was primarily due to
the increase in land sale prices.  Gross profits (after administrative and
operational expenses but before interest payments and taxes) remained
substantially above the original estimates, suggesting that the rapid increase
in land prices cushioned the impact of increased managerial and financial
inefficiency.  Net income (after interest payments and taxes) was only slightly
greater than that predicted at appraisal, reflecting the increased debt loan of
the institution.
3/    It should be noted that standard accounting practices do not contemplate
the opportunity cost of carrying land, which can be high in the case of a
land development company such as XLDC.



-8-
35.   Under such circumstances, evaluating the success of the institutional
development program is difficult.  While many of the indicators designed at
appraisal to measure the success of the project worsened, the original
projections did not contemplate the kapid expansion of KLDC's program. It could
also be argued that the institution could not have withstood this rate of growth
without improved managerial capabilities. What is clear, however, is that KLDC
did not benefit from any economies of scale in expanding the size of its
operations.
36.   Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of return on sites partially
financed by Bank funds reflects the high profitability of KLDC. To some extent,
this calculation remains an estimate rather than a true ox post calculation.
Although most of these sites were begun the year before final loan approval, by
the end of 1990 some 35% of the developed land remained unsold. However, if the
remaining land is assumed to be sold in 1992 and only a financial charge on the
value of investment in this land and its development is charged during that year,
the subprojects would yield a rate of return, after inflation, of 17.4%Y Such
a high rate demonstrates the profitability of KLDC.
37.   Imoact on Housing Sector.  KLDC's notable success in implementing its
institutional development program and fulfilling its role in the Sixth Economic
and Social Development Plan began to show results by the end of the 1980s. Both
the real rate of increase of land and housing prices and the ratio of housing
prices to income have moderated. In the early 1990s, house and land prices began
to decline.   These results suggest that the institution has been somewhat
successful in reducing the pressures in the housing sector though not
sufficiently to bring prices or sector conditions to their levels in the 1970.
38.   However, the ultimate impact of the project on the sector is less obvious.
Korean land policy continues to pursue a course which makes it difficult for the
land development system to respond to market demand.  Korean land policy is
heavily regulated to achieve a number of economic and social goals,    Most
regulations stem from a general conception of land as a "scarce" resource in
Korea, which therefore must be regulated to ensure that it be available for
important uses (such as agriculture) or so that the total population rather than
a few benefit from its development, sale, and use. As the demand for land and its
price have increased, government policies have increasingly been directed towards
blocking "speculative" land transactions. Thus, land policy is based on a series
of goals, each commendable individually, but counterproductive when taken in
combination.
39.   The National Land Use Planning Act gives the Ministry of Construction the
power to estimate the amount of land needed for various use categories based on
spatial population and economic trends. It then prepares a national land use
plan which establishes the designated use for nearly all the land in Korea. 
4/    A detailed explanation of these assumptions and the calculations is given
in Annex 1.
j/    See Kim, Kyung-Hwan, Ibid.



40.   Residential land development requires conversion from an agriculture use
designation, to urban.   In practice, HOC issues conversion permits almost
exclusively to Government agencies except for small projects, reportedly to
prevent private developers from reaping large profits from their land development
activities." (Kim 1991) Land surrounding many major cities may also be subject
to a further level of control if its is designated part of a "greenbelt," that
is, an area in which construction is strictly controlled to contain the growth
of urban areas. The total land area inside the greenbelts was 5,397 sq km as of
1988, or about 5.5% of the total land area of Korea.
41.   Finally,  fear of excessive returns from speculation has led Korean
authorities to put restrictions on land transactions. Permits are required for
large land transactions. The Government has the power to intervene over prices
when a transaction has been judged "speculative."   As a consequence, the
Government exercises considerable control over the price, location, and timing
of land development.
42.   The net result of these regulations has been a significant barrier to entry
for private land developers. The creation of KLDC has to some extent functioned
as a partial corrective for the extent of regulatory barriers.  Since most
permits must be obtained from a Central Government institution in Seoul, KLDC has
a comparative advantage in surmounting regulatory barriers. Thus, the regulatory
environment has been a major factor in KLDC's emergence as the dominant force in
land development. However, even KLDC has encountered difficulty in dealing with
the extent of land regulation. Half of the sites proposed by KLDC since 1980
have been rejected by other agencies.
43.   The final irony of Korean urban policy is that regulations designed to
protect land may actually be increasing its scarcity. Regulations impeding the
redevelopment of inner city land have slowed the production of high-density
housing in cities such as Seoul, thereby increasing the pressure to expand into
suburban and rural areas. KLDC itself operates in a manner which does not use
land "efficiently," since the agency sets aside 40% of each development project
for roads and public spaces, a high percentage by international standards. Thus,
not only in the supply of regulatory land restricted by the regulatory
environment, but the number of housing units created per sq km developed is also
restricted.
44. By the end of the project, the importance of the regulatory environment as
the chief problem in the land and housing market had become increasingly obvious
to both Bank staff and Korean officials.
45. The Government of Korea has now demonstrated its growing recognition that
regulatory complexity may become a barrier to land development by introducing
some measures to streamline the permit process. Bank staff have participated in
this process through the policy dialogue in the Housing Sector Project (Loan
3329-KO), which seeks to deal with the total regulatory environment.

G.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
46.   KLDC performed well in the role assigned to it by the Government as the
primary supplier of serviced land. However, the strains which have shown in its
management during the course of this project make the sustainability of the
current approach doubtful. Under the 2 million houses program the Government hag
been able to arrest the rate of growth of land and housing prices seen over the
past 20 years.   Nonetheless, these trends have yet to be reversed.   The
performance of KLDC during the 1980. suggests that, even if the Government could
find the resources to finance greater expansion of its housing program, even a
well-managed institution like KLDC could not single-handedly manago the level of
land development needed.   Ultimately, the direct intervention approach is
unsustainable.
H.    Bank and Borrower Performance
47.   Bank  and  KLDC  staff  collaborated  closely  during  the  design  and
implementation of this project. KLDC achieved noteworthy results in pursuing its
institutional development program.  Bank staff were closely involved in the
implementation of the managerial and computer systems, often displaying
considerable skill as "adjunct consultants" to the project. Staff aided KLDC in
overcoming the problems associated with translating software into Hangul and
finding appropriate computer equipment. Staff also helped evaluate the financial
models developed for KLDC. Thus, Bank staff were extremely useful in helping the
institution evaluate and implement consultant recommendations.
I.    LESSONS LEARNED
48.   Bank staff can olav an important role in Institutional Development
Proaram   This project b-nefitt-d considerably from the input of Bank staff with
a strong background in managerial and computer systems. It is likely that in
other environments, where such skills are even more rare, such assistance will
be of even greater value.
49.   The imoact of Institutional Dev*loam=nt Pro rams will be limited in a
counteroroductive oolicv environment,  While this project achieved noteworthy
success in improving the managerial capability of the client institution, that
institution operates in a policy environment which forces it to take on a
dominant sectoral role. Such an environment not only makes it difficult for the
client institution to increase its managerial efficiency, but also is ultimately
unsustainable as a solution to sector problems. KLDC will continue to make a
contribution to the Korean housing sector, but relying on it as the main actor
in a direct intervention strategy places undue burdens on the institution.
Reducing these regulatory distortions, as is contemplated in the Housing Sector
Project (Loan 3329-KO) approved in 1991, will both reduce the burdens placed on
KLDC and set the stage for sustainable improvements in the Korean housing sector.

Annex I
Rate of Return Calculations
Calculations of the rate of return was based on the actual costs and sales
price, associated with Bank-financed subprojects.   Both the costs and the
benefits (i.e., sales prices) associated with the subprojects were deflated by
the CPI. These data are detailed in the attached table. Since approximately 25%
of the land developed in these sites remained in inventory at the end of 1991,
it was assumed that the remaining unsold land would be sold on Dec. 31, 1992.
A financial cost, calculated by applying a 3% real interest rate to the
investment in inventory, was applied over 1992. These calculations yielded an
estimated return of 17.4%.222
