ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
EAST DELTA AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:           Arab Republic of Egypt
Implementing
Agency:             Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation
Credit Amount:      IFAD: US$25 million equivalent
IDA:  SDR 11.1 million (US$15 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard IFAD/IDA with 35 years maturity
Service Charge:     0.75 percent
Project Objectives:  The project objectives are to provide support services to facilitate the settlement
and increased agricultural production of about 26,000 low income families settling
on about 130,000 feddans of recently developed lands in the East Delta.
Project Description:  The project would provide: (i) agricultural support services, including extension,
adaptive research and community development; (ii) on-farm infrastructure
including tertiary irrigation and field drainage; (iii) drinking water supplies;
(iv) financial services including short-term, medium-term and long-term credit;
and (v) project management and monitoring services.
Environment:        The project has been described as Category B for the purpose of OD 4.01. An
environmental and social assessment has been completed and its results are
incorporated into project design. The project also supports environmental
monitoring.
Poverty:            The project is classified under poverty category "Program of Targeted
Interventions" (PTI), since project beneficiaries have average incomes well below
the rural poverty line for Egypt.
Benefits:           Project benefits would comprise: (a) increased agricultural and livestock
production, resulting both from higher yields and a more rapid build-up of
production as a result of project activities. Increased production would lead to
increased incomes for project beneficiaries. The project would also lay the basis
for broader development of the regional economy including creation of off-farm
employment. The second benefit is: (b) improved drinking water supply for the
project population.
Risks:              Delays in establishing effective project management and coordination, leading to
delays in undertaking project works and delays in realizing project benefits are the
main risks. This risk has been taken into account by planning for a slow project
start-up and a seven-year disbursement period. IFAD has also provided funds for
start-up activities in the period between negotiations and effectiveness, and the
project director and national coordinator have already been appointed.

EAST DELTA AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Sector Background
1.01      The agricultural sector accounts for about 38 percent of employment in Egypt, 20 percent
of GDP and 20 percent of exports. More broadly it provides the basis of the economy in the late
1980s of rural Egypt, home for 54 percent of the population. Following decades of heavy state
intervention, the government embarked on a program of economic reforms, including liberalization of
prices, input supply and marketing. Although more remains to be done, these reforms have provided
the basis for market-based growth in the sector, and the initial response has been favorable. Soils are
fertile, almost all land is double-cropped and with irrigation yields are among the highest in the world
for most crops. Though there are water quality and management issues, water resources are less of a
constraint than elsewhere in the region. Egypt has a clear comparative advantage especially in cotton,
horticultural products and wheat, and if the reforms remain in place the sector is well-placed for
continued increases in productivity.
1.02      With a population in 1995 of approximately 58 million, growing at 1.9 percent per annum,
Egypt has one of the poorest man/land ratios in the world. Its agricultural land (almost entirely
irrigated) represents some 7.5 million feddans (3.5 percent of the total land area) or only 0.13 feddan
per person. Average farm size is 2 feddans and 50 percent of the farming population is landless. The
Egyptian government has supported both agricultural intensification and expansion of irrigated area,
within soil and water constraints, for centuries. Modern land reclamation dates back 200 years;
irrigated area expanded from 2 million to 5.2 million feddans during the 19th century. Government
started a new program of reclamation in the 1950s, and lands reclaimed before that time are generally
known as the "old lands". Since 1952, over 2 million feddans of new lands and "old new lands" have
been developed, and newland reclamation has accounted for about 40 percent of sector investment in
recent years.
1.03      Studies have indicated that new lands developed 30 to 40 years ago have attained similar
yields to the old lands. Lands developed more recently, however, have been slow to realize their
potential. A recent Bank study "Land Reclamation Sub-sector Review 1990" concluded that while
physical reclamation was relatively straightforward, agricultural services (research, extension, farmer
training, water management), adequate social infrastructure and credit were essential to achieve
reasonable yields and returns to investment.  If these services were adequately addressed, then
newlands development could be economically viable, since investment and operating costs are
relatively low, given the flat, rather uniform terrain and minimal pumping lifts.  There are
environmental issues to be addressed, as with most newlands development projects, but with careful
planning and execution they can be dealt with.
1.04      The area of the proposed project (see also para. 2.03) is part of a larger newlands
development scheme covering 600,000 feddans in the northeast Delta and the North Sinai, under which
land will be irrigated from the newly constructed Al-Salam Canal, using 50 percent Nile water
(channeled from the northern Damietta branch of the Nile) and 50 percent agricultural drainage water
(map 28379). The canal and physical reclamation works are largely complete. Total costs, including
the irrigation and drainage infrastructure, construction of new villages and social infrastructure are
estimated at US$1.7 billion, or US$6,700 per ha. Given the high cropping intensities that will be



2                                                      East Delta Agricultural Services Project
possible, these costs are reasonable. IFAD and the Bank did not assist with financing the land
reclamation, though the Bank did support in 1992 an Environmental Impact Assessment of the North
Sinai portion of the project.
B. Agriculture Institutions and Services
1.05      The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MALR) is responsible for support
services to agriculture. In addition to its five central agencies (extension, services and monitoring,
economic affairs, administration and finance, and the Minister's office), it has a number of semi-
autonomous agencies, including the General Authority for Rehabilitation Projects (GARPAD) and the
Agricultural Research Center (ARC). Extension at governorate level is provided largely by the Central
Administration for Agricultural Extension Services, but there are overlapping responsibilities between
agencies, and between governorates and headquarters in Cairo. These broader institutional difficulties
would not be addressed through the proposed project, which would focus on introducing effective
extension to the project area.
1.06      ARC includes 16 research institutes and 5 central laboratories covering a wide range of
agricultural activities. Among the institutes, the Soil and Water Research Institute (SWRI), the Field
Crops Research Institute (FCRI), the Animal Production Research Institute (APRI), and the
Agricultural Extension and Rural Development Research Institute (AERDRI) would be of particular
relevance for the proposed project.
1.07      The General Authority for Rehabilitation Proiects (GARPAD) establishes policy and
coordinates implementation of reclamation and development of desert land in Egypt, including
construction of irrigation and other economic and social infrastructure. The reclaimed lands are sold
to settlers and GOE support varies according to the category of settlers, with land for investors being
sold on commercial terms, and land for small-scale farmers sold on concessional terms. GARPAD's
regional office in Zagazig supervises on-going reclamation works in the project area.
1.08      Since 1988 one key element of GARPAD's new land allocation policy has been the
Mubarak Program, under which young jobless university and high school graduates receive a plot of 5
feddans of reclaimed land and one house in a village built by GARPAD. They reimburse LE 10,000
over 30 years, without interest and including a 3 year grace period. In addition, they receive during
the first year of settlement LE 50/month. Graduates receive the land with tertiary irrigation and
drainage works completed as well as the first leaching done by GARPAD. The Mubarak Program is
linked to the broader government policy of phasing out guarantee of public sector employment to
graduates. Open unemployment in Egypt is concentrated (75 percent) among young people, 90 percent
of whom have a university or high school diploma. In the East Delta project area, about 25 percent of
the land has been allocated to graduates under this program.
1.09      At the governorate level in addition to the GARPAD  regional offices, MALR is
represented by the   directorates of Agriculture, Agrarian Reform, Agricultural Cooperatives,
veterinary services, Irrigation and Agricultural Drainage. At the village level, Village Extension
Workers are attached to the CAAES. The governorate administration is responsible for provision of
local services, including schools, health services, water supply, refuse disposal and village roads.
While schools and health services have been opened in graduate villages as soon as they attain a critical
mass of population, provision of drinking water has proved a much greater problem, particularly for
South Hussainya and North Hussainya, where there is no nearby surface or groundwater source of
fresh drinking water.

1.10      The Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR) is responsible for the
development of water resources and the construction and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage
systems. Its irrigation department operates and maintains public canals. The semi-autonomous
Egyptian Public Authority for Drainage Projects (EPAD) is responsible for implementing drainage
projects and maintaining both surface and sub-surface drainage systems. The Water Research Center
(WRC) conducts research on water related issues including the re-use of drainage flow.  The
Mechanical and Electric Department (MED) is responsible for installing, operating and maintaining all
irrigation and drainage pumping stations.
C. Rural Banking
1.11      Much agricultural finance is raised by producers from their own resources, friends or
relatives. Agriculture, accounting for 20 percent of GDP, received only 9 percent of formal credit in
1995. The Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC), established in 1931, is
the principal source of formal credit in the sector. It currently accounts for 78 percent of agricultural
lending and its portfolio totaled LE 5.6 billion in 1995. Historically, PBDAC has a sound financial
situation and its recovery rate is very good. PBDAC is a holding company for the 17 Banks for
Development and Agricultural Credit (BDACs) which provide credit at governorate level. There are a
total of 154 district branches and 804 village banks. BDACs exist for the project area governorates of
Dakhalia, Sharkia and Ismailya. There is a district branch in Hussainya (Sharkia), just to the south of
the project area (para. 2.03), and a village bank in Bahr el-Bakr; other branches do not presently not
exist in the project area, because of its limited population.  Credit for farming and small-scale
agribusinesses would be channeled through PBDAC under the proposed project, at market-based
interest rates.
D. Lessons Learned from IDA/IFAD Experience in Egypt
1.12      Up to 1994, IFAD had provided five credits to Egypt The two IFAD projects most
relevant to the proposed project are located in the New Lands of the West Delta; namely: (a) the West
Beheira Settlement Project (1980 to 1992), which financed irrigation infrastructure as well as
agricultural services, and (b) the New Lands Agricultural Services Project (NLASP) in Nubaria region
which started early in 1994, and finances credit and farmer services. NLASP is in an area with sandy
soils, while the proposed project area consists of heavy saline clay soils.
1.13      About one-quarter of World Bank lending has been to the agricultural sector. Much has
been directed at improving irrigation, drainage and pumping systems; recently there has been lending
to support private sector involvement, particularly small farmers, through the ongoing Agricultural
Modernization Project. IDA has financed one project involving new lands, the West Nubariya
Newlands Development Project (Cr 1083) in 1980, which financed land development and basic
infrastructure as well as services.

1.14      The following lessons have been learned from previous Bank and IFAD activities:
(a) There is a need for a strong coordination mechanism for projects which involve several
ministries and organizations; an experienced project manager resident in the project
area is important for effective implementation;
(b) Participation of project staff and beneficiaries in project design facilitates
implementation; and government commitment is essential; and
(c) Credit components managed by Project Management Units and providing credit on
subsidized terms, are not sustainable; credit should be channeled through the banking
system and should be available quickly after farmers settle in the new areas.
1.15      More particularly, experience with the West Nuberia Newlands Agricultural Services
Project supported by IFAD (para. 1.12) shows that the success of the settlement programs is closely
linked to the following conditions:
(a) efficient operation of the irrigation and drainage system;
(b) availability of basic social infrastructure and services such as reliable and affordable
drinking water supply, health facilities, social clubs, schools and mosques;
(c) access to credit;
(d) technical know-how of the graduates;
(e) availability of hired labor;
(f) access to markets; and
(g) adequate financial and technical support during the initial years is critical given the
specific conditions of the project area (high initial salinity requiring up to three years
of leaching and reclamation cropping).
1.16      These lessons have been taken into account in the design of the proposed project.
II. PROJECT AREA AND TARGET GROUPS
A. The El Salam Canal Program
2.01      Construction of the El Salam Canal began in the 1980's. The objective is to irrigate about
600,000 feddans (250,000 ha) of new lands including 200,000 feddans in the project area, west of the
Suez Canal, and 400,000 feddans in the North Sinai. The Canal length is 86 km from its intake at
Farasqour Barrage on the Damietta Branch of the Nile in the East Delta along the south end of Lake
Manzala to the Suez Canal. It crosses under the Suez Canal through four 5.1 m diameter siphons and
continues for another 168 km to service an additional 400,000 feddans of land in Northern Sinai.
Construction is complete to the west of Suez Canal, and is expected to be completed in Sinai in 1998.
The water supply will be a mixture of agricultural drainage and fresh water from the Nile with a



East Delta Agricultural Services Project                                                S
salinity level of 800 to 1,000 ppm, with 2.2 BCM of freshwater and 2.2 BCM of agricultural drainage
water from El-Sewr and Bahr Hadous drains. A modern water management and communications
system will control the water distribution, the mixing ratio, the civil works and pump stations.
2.02      GARPAD supervises the infrastructure works carried out by five public land reclamation
companies.  In addition to secondary and some tertiary irrigation and drainage networks, the
infrastructure includes villages and housing for the settlers, roads, electricity, drinking water supply,
health centers, mosques, etc. (paras. 1.07 and 1.08). The Ministry of Water Resources is responsible
for water allocation, finalizing design and construction drawings for the irrigation drainage systems,
and operation and maintenance of those systems. MPWWR will also promote and supervise the
establishment of water users' associations (para. 1.10).
B. Project Area
2.03      The project area is located in the New Lands East of the Delta between the Suez Canal and
Lake Manzala (See Maps 28378 and 28379 ). It comprises about 200,000 feddans (85,000 ha) in the
four governorates of Port Said, Ismailya, Sharkia and Dakhalia. It consists of six irrigation/drainage
schemes along the El-Salam Canal, namely: Mataria; South Hussainya; North Hussainya; South Port
Said; South Port Said Plain and Um El Reesh. Total irrigation water requirement is about 1,250
million m3 for the East Delta irrigated area of 203,000 feddans, and leaching water requirements are
an additional 10 per cent. MPWWR has stated that adequate water will be made available to the
project area, in line with National Policy. Irrigation water will be delivered to the different schemes
after the infrastructure is completed according to MPWWR standards. This is expected by early 1997.
2.04      Climatic conditions are characteristic of the eastern Mediterranean, with hot summers and
mild winters. Rainfall varies from 40 to 90 mm annually and occurs usually from October to March.
All crops are grown under irrigation during two major growing seasons: winter (November to April),
and summer (May to October).
2.05      The geology of the area is characterized by fluvio-marine alluvium deposits (10-30 m deep)
of fine textured soil transported by the Nile River. Soil textures vary from silt loams to heavy clays.
Seashells and small amounts of gypsum are present in most profiles. The soils are highly saline but
are well suited for irrigation once the soluble salts have been leached from the 0-50 cm depth. Under
the soil surface layers, there is a clay cap at depths varying from 0.5 to 3.0 meters. The depth of this
clay cap from the soil surface forms the most important criterion upon which the land reclaimability
classification has been based. Groundwater below this clay cap is saline. The topography is very flat
with land elevations generally ranging from 0.5 m below sea level to 3 m above mean sea level.
2.06      Initial reclamation of these soils is not a problem provided adequate water for leaching is
supplied and field drains and drainage pumping stations are operational. Analysis has also indicated
that these soils are not polluted. Once fully reclaimed they are capable of producing crop yields
similar to those in the Delta, given the same water allocation and quality.
Status of Infrastructure Completion
2.07      Irrigation and drainage infrastructure are largely complete and pumping equipment is being
installed. The area is being developed in phases. Graduate settlement began in South Hussainya in
1993-94; it is planned for Um El Reesh in 1998, South Port Said Plain in 1999-2000, South Port Said
in 1999-2000 and North Hussainya in 1998-2000. The situation for each scheme as of September

1996 is detailed in Annex 6; once irrigation water is available settlement is likely to increase rapidly.
Twelve villages for graduates have been constructed to date with about 7500 houses and service
buildings (schools, health centers, mosques and community and administrative buildings).
2.08      Drinking Water Supply. Water supply networks within the villages have been constructed
by GARPAD. Provision of bulk water supply to the villages is the responsibility of the governorate
administrations but has been a problem in some areas. Furthermore since the groundwater is saline,
and the canal water is partially drainage water, use of local sources as an interim measure (the solution
in most of rural Egypt) poses difficulties. Four compact water treatment units have been installed and
two more are under construction on the Port Said Canal to supply piped water for villages in Um El
Reesh, South Port Said Plain and South Port Said sub-schemes. Drinking water for South Hussainya,
South Port Said Plain and Mataria El Salam is currently supplied by tanker, costing about LE 15 per
cubic meter. Reliable drinking water supply will be a key element in sustainable settlement of the
area.
2.09      Electricity and Telecommunications.  Substations and power lines for pumping stations
have been established in most areas with three of the seven stations having been connected and work is
continuing to connect others as they come on line. It is envisaged that graduate villages will be
supplied with a wireless telephone unit to be located in the main office of the village after settlement.
C. Target Groups
Status of Settlement in East Delta
2.10      A total of 203,000 feddans of reclaimed land has been distributed among two principal
groups of beneficiaries. Poor farmers have been allocated 128,850 feddans, or 64 percent of the total
reclaimed are on concessional terms, while investors have been allocated 74,100 feddans, or 36 percent
of the reclaimed area, on commercial terms.
2.11      The poor farmers, totaling about 26,000 families, constitute the target group.  They
comprise three sub-groups:  smallholders (6,800), who will cultivate 30,800 feddans; land
reclamation cooperative members (10,450) who will cultivate 51,500 feddans; and secondary school
and university graduates (9,300) who will cultivate 46,550 feddans.
2.12      Much of the project area has not yet been settled, as social infrastructure is still being
completed, and irrigation water will be available to most of the area only by early 1997. About 7,000
families in the target groups are, however, largely settled in the area. These include smallholders
(5,000) of whom 2,000 in Mataria have been cultivating land for about 8 years with drainage water.
The remainder live along the main drains (Bahr El Bakar, Hadous, Ramsis and Serw). Some graduates
are now settling in South Hussainya; where water is available they have begun leaching, cultivation
and small livestock operations.
Poverty in the Project Area
2.13      The recent update of the Egypt Poverty Assessment (November 1995) estimated the rural
poverty line at LE 6,406 for annual household income (LE 1,131 per capita). A Rapid Rural
Assessment of project beneficiaries was undertaken in late 1994; per capita incomes were estimated
during this survey, and compared with this poverty threshold.

2.14      Poverty among Smallholders (about 6,500).  They represent about 26 percent of the
beneficiaries on 24 percent of the area (31,000 feddans).  Smallholders (about 6500), comprise
principally families referred to as "squatters" (Wadhi Al-Yed) who settled, up to 40 years ago, on
public land. They have established their right through long lasting occupancy along the drains and
around Lake Manzala. Some also were previously small fishermen who have been allocated land,
others are small farmers who practiced irrigated agriculture using drainage water, or sewage water
from the Bahr El-Bakr drain. Average landholdings are 4.5 feddans. The RRA conducted in late 1994
estimated average per capita incomes of the this group at 75-85 percent of the poverty line.
2.15      Poverty among the Graduates (9,500 beneficiaries, of whom 19 percent are women).
The unemployed university or high school graduates represent about 34 percent of the beneficiaries,
and are being settled under the Mubarak National Program for the Graduates (see Chapter 1). An
attempt is made to select young people from neighboring areas so that they can receive assistance from
their families in the first years. They are allocated 5 feddan holdings. Most graduates come from
very modest backgrounds, and the results of the RRA indicate that average incomes of graduates
already settled in the area 70-75 percent of the rural poverty line.
2.16      Poverty among Cooperative members (10.450 beneficiaries). These constitute 38 percent
of beneficiaries on 40 percent of the land area. They comprise members of the 29 Land Reclamation
cooperatives established (following the reclamation act for the project area)a, have formed New Lands
Cooperatives in order to have access to the partially reclaimed land, and them completing its
reclamation and cultivation. Average landholdings are 4.5 feddans. Members are often drawn form
the same community and may include government employees, pensioners and small traders with no
land elsewhere, as well as small farmers. The cooperatives share the cost of pumping, maintenance of
secondary canals and group credit. The RRA indicated that average incomes of this category are about
80 percent of the poverty threshold.
2.17      The project would aim to increase the income of the project beneficiaries above the poverty
level (see para. 5.04).
2.18      Investors. This group comprises about 4800 small and large investors buying about 74
000 feddans. They do not constitute the target group for the project.

2.19      Proiect Rationale and Relationship with Country Assistance Strategy. The project is
consistent with both the IDA and the IFAD country assistance strategy for Egypt. IFAD's strategy is
to increase rural incomes in a cost effective and sustainable way, with a focus on smallholders and the
rural poor. IDA's strategy (CAS of May 1997) has four principal themes: (a) creating a strong export
push; (b) promoting private sector development; (c) developing human resources; and (d) developing
rural infrastructure and protecting the environment. The proposed project focuses above all on the
fourth of these themes by supporting more efficient use of land and water (through extension) and
completion of infrastructure and drinking water; but also the second by supporting small private
farmers and farm enterprises (through credit).
2.20       Other land reclamation projects have illustrated that provision of adequate agricultural
services is key in ensuring that the sunk costs of the investment in infrastructure are utilized and yield
adequate return. This conclusion was confirmed by the recent Bank report "Egypt: Land Reclamation
Sub-sector Review 1990". At relatively little incremental cost, the Project should help to ensure the
viability of the newlands development. At a broader level, the project is consistent with several of the
key objectives of the Bank/GOE "Agricultural Strategy for the 1990's', in particular (i) sustainable
expansion of land and water availability; (ii) generation of increased rural employment; and (iii)
increased agricultural production to meet domestic demand, exports and where competitive to
substitute for imports. Furthermore the policy environment has been substantially liberalized in recent
years, and there are few remaining distortions (para. 1.01).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01      Project Obiectives. The objectives of the proposed project are to provide support services
to facilitate the settlement and increased agricultural production of about 26,000 families on about
130,000 feddans of newly developed lands in the East Delta, leading to increased farm incomes and
laying the basis for the development of a viable rural economy in the East Delta area. These project
beneficiaries would comprise up to 9,300 graduates on 46,000 feddans, 6800 smallholders on 31,000
feddans, and 10,450 cooperative members on 51,500 feddans.
B. Project Description
3.02      The project would provide essential agricultural support services to the target group. It
would have the following components:
(a) Agricultural Support Services (US$2.8 million base cost). The project would provide
agricultural extension services and adaptive research service to smallholders, graduates
and cooperative members. It would also support the development of water users
associations and service cooperatives;
(b) On-farm infrastructure. (US$20.3 million base cost). The project would finance
tertiary irrigation and drainage works on about 20,000 feddans for smallholders and
cooperative members;



East Delta Agricultural Services Project                                                9
(c) Rural Water Supply (US$10.2 million base cost). The project would install drinking
water supply in the two sub-schemes of North and South Hussainya serving about
50,000 people;
(d) Financial Support Services (US$40.2 million base cost). The project would support a
line of credit through PBDAC for short-, medium- and long-term credit for purchase of
agricultural inputs, livestock, farm machinery, and equipment for agro-processing. In
addition, the project would also support the establishment of four new village banks;
and
(e) Project Management. Monitoring and Evaluation (US$1.6 million base cost). The
project would finance a Project Management Unit to be responsible for project
implementation, monitoring and evaluation including environmental monitoring.
C. Detailed Features
Agricultural Support Services (US$2.8 million base cost).
3.03      The project would provide logistical support and training to extension staff, inputs for
demonstration plots on farmers' fields and multimedia extension materials. Field extension staff would
be nominated from existing staff in the project governorates, supported by specialized extension staff
in mobile teams. Extension would focus initially on reclamation crops, and then broaden to include
plant protection, soil and water management, farm management, livestock husbandry and marketing.
3.04      The project would support field cost of researchers, training, technical assistance  and
inputs for experimental plots, and equipment for the recently completed soil and water research station
in the project area, which would be responsible for soil and water quality monitoring. Researchers at
the neighboring stations of El-Sewr, Kassasim and Tag El-Eiz would assist extension staff with field
trials and problem solving, backed by staff from other stations in Egypt as necessary.
3.05      The project would finance office equipment, vehicles, and technical assistance costs, and
community development officers and assistants, and training for cooperative board members and
members of water users associations. It would support community organizations in the project area,
including cooperatives, primarily in order to assist farmers with group access to credit, and
development of water user associations .
On-farm Infrastructure for Smallholder Farmers (US$20.4 million).
3.06      The project would finance the construction of on-farm tertiary irrigation and drainage
systems for smallholders on about 20,000 feddans (at LE 3,500 per feddan). Smallholders would
contribute 20 percent of the cost through labor (about US$5.1 million equivalent), largely for
earthworks for land leveling, canals and drains. The project would complement the support already
given to graduates through GARPAD. The support would be arranged through the contractors.

Rural Water Supplv (US$10.2 million base cost)
3.07      The project would finance piped drinking water supplies to villages in South Hussainya
and North Hussainya, including a treatment plant and conveyance system from the Al-Salheya Canal.
Population to served at full development would be about 50,000.
Financial Support Services (US$40.2 million).
3.08      The project would provide a line of credit for the following activities:
(a) Seasonal and short-term credit, for items such as seed, fertilizer, machinery and labor
hire and pumping costs;
(b) Medium-term credit. (up to 5 years) for items such as tractors, implements, stationary
threshers, establishment of agricultural machinery hire services, rice and wheat mills,
and equipment for dairy processing and raising livestock; and
(c) Long-term credit for agribusiness , over 5 years) for items such as private veterinary
clinics, milk collecting centers, milk processing units, vegetable processing units,
animal shelters, etc.
3.09      Investment would be demand driven, and credit would be provided under PBDAC's
prevailing terms and conditions at the time of borrowing, which are based on market rates. These
rates are currently 11 percent (plus 1 percent service charge) for seasonal credit, 12 percent (plus 1
percent) for medium-term credit, and 13 percent (plus 1 percent) for long-term credit. According to
PBDAC policy, beneficiary contribution for short-term credit is 30 percent, and for medium- and long-
term credit it is 50 percent. A Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be entered into between PBDAC
and the Government of Egypt before credit effectiveness.
3.10      Institutional Support. The project would assist PBDAC in establishing and equipping four
new village banks in the project area. Staff training and logistical support would also be financed.
Project Management and Monitoring (US$1.6 million base costs)
3.11      Project Management. The project would finance a Project Management Unit (PMU) for
planning, procurement and coordination, including technical experts, office equipment, transportation,
training and incremental operating costs of the unit.
3.12      The project would also support project monitoring and evaluation, including technical
experts and logistical support. Environmental monitoring would focus on soil and water quality
monitoring would include monitoring of groundwater, irrigation water, and water discharged into Lake
Manzala.

D. Project Costs and Financing
Project Costs
3.13       Total project costs including physical and price contingencies are indicated in Table 3.1
below. They are estimated at LE 309 million (US$91.2 million) including physical and price
contingencies, of which the foreign exchange component is LE 121 million (US$36 million) or 39
percent of total cost. Import duties and sales taxes are reflected in the calculation of the project cost.
Price contingencies amount to 16 percent and physical contingencies for civil works to 15 percent of
base cost. Detailed costs are provided in Annex 1(a).

Financing Plan
3.14       The proposed IFAD Loan of US$25 million would finance 27 percent of the project costs
net of duties and taxes. At Negotiations, it was confirmed that all conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of the IFAD loan have been fulfilled, other than those related to the effectiveness of the
IDA credit. The proposed IDA credit of US$15 million would finance a further 16 percent. Local
farmers and small entrepreneurs would contribute 28 percent, PBDAC 12 percent, and Government 17
percent of project costs. The rinancing plan is given in Table 3.2 below.

3.15     During negotiations, assurances were provided that Government and PBDAC would
make available their own share of financing in a timely manner. Beneficiary contribution to the
credit component would follow PBDAC guidelines (para. 3.09).  Contribution to the onfarm
development would be equivalent to 25 percent of the cost of the works, through labor.

3.17       Procurement of farm machinery, equipment and goods through the line of credit would
respond to market demand involving numerous dealerships, with equipment imported by the private
sector. It is not feasible to package the number of contracts. Most import orders would be in the
range of US$5,000 to US$200,000, and too dispersed and small scale to be eligible for ICB; after sales
services is of critical importance in the choice of equipment by the beneficiaries. Procurement of
vehicles, laboratory and office equipment. water treatment plant. and civil works for the drinking
water supply system would follow ICB in accordance with IFADIIDA guidelines, except for contracts

below US$200,000, for which NCB would apply. Local shopping could be used for contracts of
US$20,000 or less up to an aggregate of US$1 million. Eligible Egyptian manufacturers competing
under ICB would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent provided they can prove that (i)
labor, raw materials and components from within Egypt will account for more than 30 percent of the
exact price of the product offered, and (ii) the production facility in which those goods will be
manufactured or assembled has been engaged in the manufacture/assembly of such goods at least since
the time of bid submission. Civil works for the on-farm tertiary irrigation and drainage works
(US$21.9 million) would be packaged and awarded through NCB procedures, since these works are
scattered in the project area and will not be attractive to foreign contractors. Local contractors are
already working in the area. Consultants for the various forms of technical assistance under the project
would be engaged following procedures and on terms and conditions satisfactory to IFAD. The prior
review threshold would be US$100,000 for the services of consulting firms, US$50,000 for individual
consultants, US$200,000 for goods and US$500,000 for works. This would cover at least 80 percent
of total contract value (except for the goods purchased through the credit component, which are not
amenable to prior review and would be purchased under commercial practices). At Negotiations GOE
agreed to the procurement arrangements outlined above.
Disbursement
3.18      The proposed IFAD loan of US$25 million and IDA credit of US$15 million are expected
to be disbursed in accordance with the following estimated disbursement schedule summarized below

December 31, 1996.
3.20      To facilitate project execution, four Special Accounts would be established, one for each
implementing agency (MALR and PBDAC respectively) and one for each financing agency (IDA and
IFAD). GOE would establish two Special Accounts in the Central Bank, in US dollars, with initial
deposits of US$1.0 million out of the IFAD credit and US$0.5 million out of the IDA credit
[equivalent to four months expected expenditures under the infrastructure, management and agricultural
support components of the project (see Table 3.1)]. PBDAC would open on its book two Special
Accounts for US$0.6 million out of the IFAD credit and US$0.4 million out of the IDA credit
[estimated four months expenditure under the financial support component of the project (Table 3.1)].
Disbursement would be made against Statements of Expenditures (SOE) except for contracts for goods
above US$200,000, for works contracts above US$500,000, and for TA contracts above US$50,000
for individuals and US$100,000 for firms, for which full documentation would be required. Relevant
documentation in support of SOEs would not be submitted to IFAD/IDA, but would be retained by the
PMU and made available to IFAD/IDA supervision missions and to independent auditors.
Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly, or whenever the
Special Account is drawn down to 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first. GOE
agreed to these disbursement procedures at negotiations.
Recurrent costs include incremental vehicles and goods operating costs, field bonuses of project staff,
and incremental office operating costs.

3.21     Project completion is expected by December 31, 2003 and it is anticipated that the IFAD
Loan/IDA credit will be fully disbursed six months after that date. The Closing Date would,
therefore, be June 30, 2004.
F. Accounting, Audit and Reporting
3.22      The Project Management Unit (PMU) would establish and maintain separate project-related
accounts at the central office responsible for project execution. These accounts would be maintained in
accordance with internationally recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to IFAD
and IDA. The PMU would provide bi-annual and annual financial statements to reflect expenditures
under the project. An auditor's opinion and reports satisfactory to IFAD on these statements would
be provided within six months of the closing of the fiscal year. The auditor's report will include a
statement on the adequacy of the accounting system and internal controls, and the reliability of
statements of expenditures as a basis for loan disbursements.
3.23      The PBDAC and its regional BDACs serving the project area will maintain their
accounting system in accordance with sound internationally recognized accounting principles and
practices acceptable to IFAD and IDA. They would provide annual budgets, quarterly progress
reports, summary loan statements and annual financial statements that reflect the financial performance
and position of the line of credit. The PBDAC and its branches would maintain detailed memoranda
relating to sub-project cycle progress including appraisals, approvals, disbursements, contribution from
borrowers, interest charges, installments due, collections, overdue and follow-up action. These reports
would be reviewed periodically by IFAD supervision missions. An auditor's opinion and reports
satisfactory to IFAD would be provided within nine months of the close of the fiscal year. The
auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy of the accounting system and internal
controls, the reliability of statements of expenditures as a basis for loan disbursements, and compliance
with financial covenants. Agreement to these accounting and auditing arrangements was reached
at Negotiations.
G. Environmental Aspects
3.24     The project has been classified under Environment Category "B," according to the OD
4.01 guidelines. The following environmental benefits have been incorporated into the project: (a) The
on-farm infrastructure and drinking water would facilitate the sustainable settlement of smallholder
farmers; (b) the agricultlral support services would disseminate IPM technology and efficient soil and
water management. The financial support services would enable settlers to gain a livelihood from the
new lands and would facilitate development of a viable regional economy. The Environmental
Assessment focused on concerns about; (a) possible contamination of soils around the heavily polluted
Bahr El-Bakr drain; (b) irrigation water quality and quantity; and (c) social conditions of settlers.
3.25      The Environmental Assessment was completed in September 1996 and endorsed by GOE.
It is summarized in Annex 3. Analysis concluded that: (a) soils around Bahr El-Bakr are not
contaminated, (b) irrigation water will be adequate in quality and quantity, according to the national
program of MPWWR, and (c) studies conducted during preparation confirmed the importance of
adequate drinking water. The project will provide drinking water to those parts of the project area not
currently served and will finance a soil and water quality monitoring program, and a health study of
the population.

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Status of Project Preparation
4.01      The proposed project was identified by IFAD in 1993. An FAO Investment Center pre-
formulation mission in June 1994 was followed by a formulation mission in September/October 1994.
At the request of IFAD a World Bank mission visited Egypt in September 1995 to finalize project
preparation.  The mission assessed the progress of implementation of irrigation and drainage
infrastructure and proposed changes in the design of the credit component and support for land
development for smallholder farmers.  The Environmental Assessment was completed in early
September 1996. Detailed designs for the drinking water supply component are under preparation and
would be completed by June 1998.  Designs for the tertiary infrastructure are standard; tender
documents for this and for the goods will be prepared within six months of Board approval and
funding has been provided by IFAD for this (the time between Board Approval and effectiveness is
usually about one year in Egypt). An implementation plan and procurement plan have been prepared.
The implementation and procurement plans were agreed to with GOE at Negotiations.
B. Project Management Arrangements
4.02      The Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation (MALR) would have the overall
responsibility for execution through the Chairman of GARPAD. A Project Management Unit (PMU)
would be created in the project area with responsibility for project implementation, including
coordination of project activities, procurement (except for activities implemented through PBDAC),
disbursement, annual and quarterly work plans, financial reporting, monitoring/evaluation and contacts
with IFAD/IDA. The PMU would include a project director, finance director, procurement director,
research/extension coordinator, community development officer, and monitoring and evaluation
officers including environmental monitoring. (See also Annex l(f): Terms of Reference for the
principal staff of the project management unit). The Project Director would report to the National
Coordinator who would be the Chairman of GARPAD (both the project and national coordinator have
already been nominated) who would be directly accountable to the Minister for successful project
implementation.
4.03      Local coordination would be assured by a regional working committee to be headed by the
project director. It would be composed of the relevant governorate agencies including education,
health and water supply, the Rural electrification authority, the regional offices of Public Works,
GARPAD, the agricultural extension service and agricultural research stations, and Sharkiya Water
Authority. It would meet regularly during project implementation. The Committee was established by
31st March 1997.
4.04      A National Coordination Committee (NCC) would meet twice a year or as needed to
discuss annual work plans, provide policy guidance and facilitate implementation at national level. It
would be chaired by the national Coordinator. The project director would be its secretary and he
would prepare its agenda. Its members would include, in addition, senior staff from MALR, PBDAC,
CAAES, ARC, MPWWR, and Ministry of Planning.
4.05      Implementation of the credit component would be through PBDAC (see above para. 3.09).
The agricultural support services component would be implemented by the Central Administration for
Agricultural Extension Services (CAAES) and their governorate level staff, and the applied research



18                                                    East Delta Agricultural Services Project
activities by Agricultural Research Center and their local stations. The community development
component would be implemented by the PMU in close cooperation with the Department of
Cooperatives and the MPWWR. The drinking water supply system would be taken over by the
Sharkiya Water Authority on its completion.
4.06      At Negotiations GOE provided assurances that these implementation arrangements
would be followed, and that adequate resources and satisfactory TOR for the Committee would be
provided to the Association before effectiveness.
C. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.07      The Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) experts of the PMU would operate a program for
monitoring the project activities as a management tool, in close collaboration with other members of
the PMU. They would be comprise a senior agricultural economist with experience with M&E
especially with IFAD or other internationally financed projects, and two M&E officers, one specialized
in irrigated cropping systems/soil and water management, and one in socio-economic impacts.
Monitoring and Evaluation would also focus on both project output (achieving project objectives and
targets) and project impact (improving the incomes of the target group settlers). For this purpose, key
indicators would be refined by the PMU and the M&E specialists
4.08      Key indicators would include: (i) the number and category of settlers by scheme and the
date of settlement; (ii) percentage of households who have adopted technical packages; (iii) cropped
area and crop and livestock yields; (iv) percentage of households with tertiary irrigation; (v) percentage
of households with drinking water; and (vi) the credit disbursed and recovery rates (short term,
medium term and long-term). Monitorable indicators are provided in Annex l(c); they would be
defined by the PMU.
4.09       PBDAC would have its own monitoring system, but close coordination with project
management should be maintained. PBDAC would provide the PMU with copies of its own M&E
reports. The project management may verify the bank's performance through regular field assessment.
At Negotiations, GOE provided assurances that the project monitoring arrangements outlined
above would be followed, and agreed to the monitoring indicators outlined in Annex 1(C).
E. Supervision
4.10     It is estimated that the project will require an average of 12 staffweeks of supervision per
year, including financial sector, agriculturist, irrigation/civil engineering and community development
skills. The first year up to 20 weeks may be necessary to ensure project launch, and at the end of third
year a midterm review would be held, requiring 8 additional weeks above the normal 12. The project
would be supervised from Cairo, in order to permit frequent contacts and establishment of a
partnership with the project management unit and implementing agencies, and resolution of
implementation problems as they arise. Focus in the first year would be on procurement, and putting
in place the project management and monitoring arrangements.
V. PRODUCTION. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
5.01      The main objectives of the East Delta Agricultural Services project are to provide support
services to facilitate the settlement and increased agricultural production of settlers in the project area,



East Delta Agricultural Services Project                                                   19
thereby increasing farm incomes and laying the basis for a sustainable rural economy in the region, in
both farm and off-farm activities.
5.02      The project would provide tertiary infrastructure to about 20,000 feddans (4,000 families),
credit to about 15,000 families on about 75,000 feddans, and offer extension and other services to
about 26,000 families on 135,000 feddans, with uptake estimated at about 50 percent. There are thus
three, interrelated "streams" of production benefits from the project, due to tertiary irrigation
infrastructure, uptake of credit, and uptake of technical packages, respectively.
5.03      Estimated crop and livestock production benefits are summarized in Annex 2. It will take
about five years after the start of production for farmers to reach maximum yields "with" the project.
It is assumed that (a) farmers benefiting from tertiary irrigation would start agricultural production two
years sooner "with" than "without" the project; (b) farmers obtaining credit for inputs would have
higher production and yields "with" the project, since "without" it they would not have the cash to
purchase sufficient inputs or to prepare land adequately; and (c) farmers taking up extension packages
would have higher yields than those not. The most likely scenario, also, "without" the project, is a
slower rate of settlement in the project area, and delays, therefore, in realizing benefits, to farmers or
to the economy as a whole, from the very substantial sunk investments in reclamation of the East Delta
lands and the El-Salam Canal (para. 2.01). Assumptions are summarized in Annex 2.
5.04      An analysis of likely financial returns to farmers benefiting from the project services was
undertaken, to determine whether they would be able to repay credit provided at market rates under the
project (12 percent for short-term credit, 13 percent for medium term and 14 percent for long term at
time of appraisal). The farm models indicate that annual farm incomes would increase gradually from
about LE 4,500, well below the poverty line (see para. 2.13) "without" the project to LE 11,000
"with" the project. The conclusion is that farmers in the project area would be able to apply for credit.
Economic Analysis
5.05      In the calculation of ERR, only benefits from incremental crop and livestock production
activities were considered. Costs include tertiary development for 20,000 feddans, costs of crop and
livestock production on the 75 000 feddans that are likely to benefit from credit and farmer services,
all other investment and recurrent costs of the project (including technical assistance, project
management and monitoring, and drinking water supply), and incremental operation and maintenance
costs .
5.06      The economic rate of return (ERR), measuring only crop and livestock production benefits,
was estimated at 33 percent. The high rate of return is not surprising in view of sizable sunk cost in
the El-Salaam Canal project;
5.07      The economic analysis did not quantify the expected benefits from rural water supply, in
terms of time savings, health benefits or potential increased milk production for livestock. It did not
quantify the "spin-off" effects of creating, through the project, the basis for a viable rural economy in
the area. Approximately 45 percent of employment in rural Egypt is off-farm employment, and the
project would permit the development of services, small-scale industry and trade in the project area.
These indirect "rural development" benefits are likely, in the long run, to be as significant as the direct
production benefits.

Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
5.08      The main project risk is likely to be delay, in completing the infrastructure, water, and
establishing support services, because of delays in establishing the project management unit and
moving ahead with procurement.  The project ERR  "base case" has also made conservative
assumptions regarding the start-up and phasing of project benefits, with substantive project activities
starting only in 1998, tertiary infrastructure investments being completed only in the year 2000, and a
slow phasing in of other project activities (with only new 1,700 families taking up credit in 1998,
3,000 in 1999 and 7,000 in 2000). Nevertheless even where benefits are lagged three years behind the
"base case" and costs increased by 10 percent, the ERR would decline to a still acceptable 14 percent.
GOE has also sought to minimize delays by nominating the project director and national coordinator
before negotiations, and preparing an implementation plan and establishing the local and national
coordination committees well before effectiveness.
5.09      Delay in establishing support services and adequate tertiary infrastructure may also lead to
substantially lower yields, and delays in establishing formal credit mechanisms may require farmers to
seek higher cost alternatives, increasing production costs. Assuming benefits fall by 20 percent and
production costs increase by 20 percent, the ERR is still 18 percent.
5.10      The project has some risks regarding financial sustainability. No new civil servants would
be recruited under the project. Annual incremental operating costs are only about US$200,000.
Farmers are responsible for operation and maintenance of tertiary irrigation works. The main risk
regarding financial sustainability regards the drinking water supply component. Current water charges
by Sharkiya Water Authority (LE 0.25/m3) are below operation and maintenance costs. The estimated
O&M costs of the water supply component will be available only when the detailed designs and cost
estimates are complete. Costs and cost recovery are being reviewed under the Sharkiya Water
Authority project currently under preparation; the policies that would be introduced under that project
would apply for the East Delta Agricultural Services Project. There is much scope for increased
efficiency in O&M; savings of 15 percent in operating costs in Sharkiya Water Authority, without
tariff increases, would lead to full recovery of O&M costs.
5.11      No difficulties are anticipated marketing the incremental production, once production takes
off and credit for marketing and small-scale processing is available. Egypt is currently a net importer
of the 'staples' of rice, wheat, milk and meat (from berseem) that constitute the main products, and
marketing channels are very well established for cotton.  Milk prices are currently particularly
favorable (because of shortages in supply) in Port Said.
Poverty Impact. Impact on Women. Participatory Approaches
5.12      Project beneficiaries have average incomes below the poverty line, and fall within the
IFAD target group (see paras. 2.11 to 2.17). In addition to direct beneficiaries, the project would
increase income earning opportunities for the currently unemployed or underemployed, who would
move into the project area.
5.13      Project design would benefit women in a number of ways:  (a) about 20 percent of
graduates allocated land in the project area are women; (b) the rural water supply component would
benefit women directly, since they are in charge of water collection and domestic use; (c) the focus of
extension on livestock would also benefit women, who have primary responsibility for livestock
raising. About 50 percent of incremental income from the project would be from livestock,



East Delta Agricultural Services Project                                            21
traditionally a "women's" domain, and 50 percent of the 13,000 incremental jobs created under the
project would be for women; (iv) the extension service would build on experience gained working with
women elsewhere in Egypt and particularly in the West Nubereya Newlands scheme, where extension
services for women have been "mainstreained," but there are also women's extension officers; and
(e) PBDAC is increasingly adapting its operations to increase access of women to credit and has under
way a program under which credit officers visit women in their homes to assist them with credit
applications
5.14      Rapid rural appraisals were conducted during preparation and the Environmental Impact
Assessment; drinking water and lack of credit were commonly expressed priorities in these. The
project regional steering committee would include farmer representatives, and assistance would be
provided to farmers to form cooperatives and water user groups.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01     The following assurances were provided from the Borrower at Negotiations:
(a) On-lending from PBDAC to beneficiaries would be in accordance with its applicable
policies and procedures which follow market-based interest rates (para. 3.09).
(b) GOE has agreed to the procurement arrangements outlined in para. 3.17.
(c) GOE has agreed to the disbursement arrangements outlined in paras. 3.18-3.20.
(d) GOE has agreed to the accounting, audit and reporting requirements outlined in
para. 3.22 and 3.23.
(e) GOE has agreed to the implementation and monitoring arrangements outlined in
paras. 4.1-4.7 including the monitoring indicators referred to in para. 4.09 and
outlined in Annex 1.
6.02     The following were agreed as conditions of Effectiveness:
(a) GOE and the PBDAC would finalize the Subsidiary Loan Agreement confirming the
on-lending terms between the Borrower and PBDAC (para. 3.09).
(b) Confirmation of allocation of resources and terms-of-reference satisfactory to IDA for
the operation of the Project Management Unit, the Regional Working Committee and
the National Working Committee would be provided (para. 4.06).
(c) All conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the IFAD loan would be met, other
than those related to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement (para. 3.14).
6.03     With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable basis for an IFAD loan
of US$25 million and an IDA credit of US$15 million equivalent, both on the standard terms.

ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
EAST DELTA AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
Financial and Economic Analysis
A. General
1.        The objective of the project is to facilitate the settlement and increased agricultural
production of farms on newly reclaimed land in the East Delta, thereby laying the basis for increased
incomes and a sustainable rural economy in both farm and off-farm activities. To facilitate this objective,
the project would offer agricultural support services; seasonal, medium-term and long-term credit;
tertiary irrigation and drainage networks for 20,600 feddans; and drinking water for two of the six project
schemes.
2.        Credit would enable the settlers to apply adequate farm inputs in their crop mix and adopt
modernized farm technology packages. As the project area is located in Egypt's main livestock
production belt, with credit settlers could start livestock development activities and derive benefit from a
mixed farming system. The project would also provide financing for small-scale business and trading
activities, including milk collection centers, milk and fruit and vegetable processing activities, machinery
hire operations, etc. The type and scope of credit would be demand driven.
3.        Indicative crop and livestock budgets, farm models, and some small-scale agribusinesses
prototype models were developed to show the financial and economic viability of this project. For the
economic and financial analyses, the investment incurred so far on irrigation networks, land
improvement programns, and construction of infrastructure were treated as sunk costs. It was, moreover,
assumed that settlement in the project would take place both "with" and "without" project, in accordance
with the government's anticipated program. However, in the situation of "without" project, agricultural
services would remain very weak and the settlers would not have access to reliable credit sources.
B. Financial Analysis
4.        For the crop and livestock production activities, indicative crop and livestock budgets, and
farm models have been developed to compare the situations of "with" and "without" project. These are
described in a working paper available in the project files.
5.        The size of the holdings is assumed to be five feddans. While the settlers would be able to
borrow from PBDAC under its prevailing credit terms and conditions in the "with project situation",
they would revert to private money lenders with stringent borrowing terms under the "without project
situation". For financial analysis, the "without" project interest rate was assumed to be 16%. It was
assumed that the settlers would raise livestock, and purchase one milking cow and a buffalo calf during
the first year of their operation and another buffalo calf during the second year. It has been assumed that
tertiary and leaching works would take a year, and that a further two-year delay would be realized if the
smallholder does tertiary work in the 'without' project situation.
6.        Crop budgets have been developed on a per feddan basis for six of the major crops grown in
the project or adjacent areas. Incremental crop yields for the" with" and "without" project situation have
been determined using production parameters achieved by farmers under similar situations in Egypt
(Table 2). The yield build-up is assumed to reach stability after five or six years, depending on the crops.

From year 4 onwards, it has been assumed that farmers would grow berseem and wheat in the Winter
season, and rice and cotton during the Summer season.
7.        Results are presented in Table 1. This Table reveals that net farm revenues would increase
from about LE 4,500 annualy 'without' the project to LE 11,000 'with' the project. Once the crop yields
stabilize, families with a holding of five feddans would receive incremental yields of 0.6 tons of wheat,
3.1 tons of paddy, 0.3 tons of cotton, 19 tons of berseem, 5.1 tons milk, and about 250 Kg of meat. The
cash-flow tables show that the household's revenue increases only gradually during the initial three years.

8.         Models for one milk collection center, one milk processing plant, and a small-scale wheat
and rice mill have been developed. Cash-flow analyses for these models show the following financial
rate of return:
Type of Actiity                        Financial Rate of Return
Milk Collection Center                        35%
Small-Scale Milk Processing Unit              34%
Small-Scale Wheat and Rice Mill               35%
Based on these FRRs, the envisaged activities are financially viable, and the investors would have no
problem repaying the loans. Details are provided in the working paper.
1/ Under the situation of Model 3, the cost includes the repayment of tertiary work cost to the Government. It is assumed
that the loan would have a grace period of three years and would be paid back in 30 years including grace period.

C. Economic Analysis
9.        In the calculation of ERR, only benefits from crops and livestock were considered, and the
revenues and operating costs for this analysis are based on the farm models' results. The benefit stream
accrues from: (i) incremental crop production from 76,300 feddans farmed by about 15,200 families who
would borrow from PBDAC to apply inputs, and raise livestock; (ii) a 10% increase in the crop and
livestock production of 13,000 families who adopt appropriate extension technical advice; and (iii)
incremental revenue obtained by 4,000 families benefitting from tertiary irrigation who would start
agricultural production two years sooner "with" than "without" the project.
10.       The total incremental cost stream consists of (i) the incremental crop and livestock
production cost of 15,200 families who receive project credit for their farning and livestock activities;
(ii) the tertiary development cost; (iii) the project investment and recurrent costs; (iv) the estimated
investment and recurrent cost for drinking water; and (v) and maintenance cost for the irrigation network.
11.       For traded inputs and outputs, World Bank price projections were used to estimate farmgate
economic prices, and for nontradable inputs and outputs, financial prices are based on prevailing market
prices in Egypt in 1996. A Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.88 was applied toward the project's
non-tradable costs and benefits. AH economic values were converted to local currency at the official
exchange rate of LE 3.39 to one US dollar. The shadow wage rate was assumed to be the same as the
financial wage rate for hired labor and no wage has been considered in the economic cost calculation for
use of incremental family labor. The cows and buffaloes used in these farm models are assumed to have
milking lives of seven years and to be culled after 10 years. Also, once the livestock producers have
purchased a cow and two buffalo calves, they would retain their stock size from their offsprings
throughout the project life.
12.       Based on these assumptions, the economic rate of return (ERR) was calculated to be 33%.
The resulted high rate of return is not surprising in view of substantial sunk investment costs associated
with the El-Salam canal, and sizeable under-utilized family labor in the "without project" situation.
13.       The project in its maturity would produce an incremental production of 77,000 tons of milk,
1,600 tons of cow meat, 1,900 tons of veal meat, 9,000 tons of wheat, 47,000 tons of rice, 4,500 tons
of cotton, and 290,800 tons of berseem. These 'staple' outputs easily sell in the market; wheat, rice and
meat would substitute for imports, while cotton would be exported. Also, dairy products have a good
market in the city of Port Said which is close to the project area. In addition, the project would create
about 13,000 jobs per annum, and women are expected to take more than 50% of the newly created
2
jobs.
14.       Sensitivitv Analysis. The project would remain viable under a wide range of alternatives. If
total project cost would increase by 20% and at the same time, if benefits decrease by 20%, the ERR
would still be viable at 18%. If the project's benefits would be delayed by three years and
simultaneously if its cost increase by 10%, the ERR would drop to 14%. Although this situation is not
likely to emerge, the ERR is still higher than the opportunity cost of capital in Egypt which is at the
present less than 12%.
2/ Most of the new jobs comes from livestock development activities which are generally carried out by women in Egypt.

EAST DELTA NEWLANDS AGRICULTURAL SERVICES PROJECT
Environmental Assessment
Background
1.    The objectives of the proposed East Delta Agricultural Services Project are to provide services to
facilitate the settlement and increased agricultural production of about 26,000 low-income families on
130,000 feddans (1 feddan = 0.42 ha) of newly developed lands in the East Delta, thereby laying the
foundation for increased incomes and the development of a viable rural economy in the area.
2.     The project area consists of six irrigation sub-schemes located east of the Nile Delta to the south
of Lake Manzala, and west of the Suez Canal. The terrain is largely flat and low-lying. The soils are
predominantly clays, presently saline, but capable of good yields after leaching. Lake Manzala is a
wetland area of high biodiversity and an important fishery resource. A major drain, the Bahr El Bakr
Drain, transporting industrial wastewater and sewage from east Cairo and intennediate towns together
with irrigation drainage water, passes through the middle of the project area and discharges into Lake
Manzala. Farmers have been irrigating with this polluted drainage water for the last decades.
3.    Before the GOE requested the assistance of IFAD and IDA, the project area was already
reclaimed land and most of the irrigation infrastructure was completed under a major national project,
the El Salam Canal Program which began in the 1980's. Its objective is to irrigate about 600,000 feddans
(250,000 ha) of new lands, of which about 220,000 feddans (90,000 ha) are in the proposed project area,
west of the Suez Canal, and 400,000 feddans (168,000 ha) lie to the east of the Suez Canal in the Sinai.
Social as well as irrigation infrastructure has been developed. Land reclamation under the El Salam
Program led to some losses in fisheries production and biodiversity, and some communities, such as
fishermen, lost their employment.
Potential Environmental Impacts
4.     The East Delta Agricultural Services Project will overall have a positive environmental and
social impact. The provision of drinking water, credit and extension services will improve livelihoods of
existing and future settlers and lead to better soil and water management. Environmental and social
issues directly related to the proposed project were as follows:
(i)    Suspected Soil Pollution with heavy metals and toxic chemicals around the Bahr El
Baqar Drain was suggested by an earlier study;
(ii)   Social services and infrastructure; drinking water supply and sanitation are at present
inadequate;
(iii)   Quality and quantity of the irrigation water; land in the project area is at present irrigated
with drainage water alone and water quality is poor: salinity is too high. Salinity of the
Sewer drain is 1,200 ppm, which causes soil salinization in El Matariya and consequent
crop yield reductions;
(iv)   Pesticide and fertilizer use; increased agriculture in the project area will lead to increased
pesticide and fertilizer use.
Bilharzia and hepatitis B have a high incidence rate in the northem part of the project area near
Lake Manzala.

Mitigation Measures
5.    The EA study was completed in September 1996.
(i)   Suspected Soil Pollution. The EA analyzed this problem and concluded that there was
no soil pollution in reclaimed parts of the project area and thus there were no public
health risks by using these land for agriculture. Furthermore, water from Bahr El-Bakr
drain will not be used for irrigation under the project. Water quality in the drain, and in
Lake Manzala, will shortly improve considerably when sewage works under construction
in the Cairo area are completed;
(ii)  Social services and infrastructure. Piped water supply is available for three sub-schemes.
The project would finance a piped drinking water supply system in the two schemes of
South and North Hussaniya; settlers in Matarya El-Salaam, the smallest scheme, will
continue to be served by tanker;
(iii)  Quality and quantitv of irrigation water. Water in the El Salam Canal and project area is
to consist of freshwater from the Nile (50%), and agricultural drainage water (50%),
under the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources (MPWWR) national
programme. Under these mixing conditions water quality would be adequate. Water
quality and mixing would be closely monitored by MPWWR to maintain salinity at
1,000 ppm or less; the quantity to be allocated under the national program is adequate;
(iv) Pesticide and fertilizer use. Integrated Pest Management methods would be promoted
during project implementation through the extension service and are integrated in project
design (the area will not be a major cotton production area). A negative list of pesticides
would be made available by the Bank which may not be purchased with credits provided
through the World Bank. The above mentioned activities would be monitored by the
PMU; and
(v)   Soil and water quality would be monitored systematically. Bilharzia would be controlled
through the regular public health programme. A special health study of the project area
would also be carried out.
Broader Impacts of El-Salam Canal Project
6.    The El Salam Canal Project was not financed by the Bank or IFAD; impacts of this project,
therefore, do not form part of the EA of the East Delta Agricultural Services Project.
7.    The East Delta Agricultural Services project will cause neither loss of land nor loss of
employment. The El-Salam Canal Program did cause loss of employment to certain less privileged
groups. These comprised primarily poor fishermen on Lake Manzala. These were provided with land on
the Matariya el-Salam scheme, which is now being successfully cultivated. Other poor fishermen include
those fishing in the Bahr El Bakr drain (which is sewage water). Their living conditions will improve as
a result of the El Salam Canal Program, since they are now able to fish in the Canal, whose quality is
much better than that of the of the Bahr El Bakr drain, posing fewer environmental and health hazards.
In addition, some have applied for and been provided with land. The third category of fishermen
constitutes fish laborers on fish farms reclaimed from Lake Manzala. Since this land was reclaimed over
five years ago, these people have moved to other areas or found employment as farm laborers. They too
are likely to benefit from the El Salam Canal Program, since employment per feddan on agricultural land



- 65 -                                   Annex 3
Page 3 of 3
is considerably higher than on fishfarm land. Past reclamation of Lake Manzala caused some loss of
biodiversity. There are no plans for further reclemation of the lake, whose water quality should improve
as a result of sewage treatment project nearing completion in the Cairo area. UNDP/GEF funding is also
available for pilot wetland reclamation
Environmental Monitoring
8.     Soil quality monitoring will include: (i) soil salinity monitoring, (ii) monitoring of the pollution
of drain sediment, and (iii) checks on soil pollution on suspected locations that might come up during
project implementation. Samples will be analyzed by a reliable Egyptian laboratory with control
analyses of selected samples in an internationally recognized laboratory. It is estimated that around 30
samples per year are needed during the duration of the project.
9.    Monitoring of irrigation water, drainage water and groundwater would be complementary to the
ongoing monitoring programs of the Research Centers of the National Soil and Water Research Center.
Location and number of sampling sites and samples and parameters to be monitored will be determined
during implementation. Tentatively it is estimated that around 30 samples per year are needed (5
locations for bi-monthly sampling.
10.    Since health is more critical in the project area a health monitoring program will be needed. The
details of the health monitoring program will be defined during the health study, which will be part of
project implementation and supervised by the PMU. A preliminary cost estimate is based on the
assumption that an Egyptian health expert will need 2 person months per year to follow up on data and
statistics that are to be registered in the health centers and verification of these data in the field. Social
impact monitoring (status of settlement, provision of drinking water) would be part of the regular project
monitoring program.
Training
11.    Staff involved in the monitoring of environmental parameters would be experienced, so that no
long term training programs are needed.
Consideration of Alternatives
12.    Since project location, design of infrastructure were already fixed at the time IFAD and the Bank
became involved, an analysis of altematives for these components was not relevant. Alternatives in
water saving techniques and in pest management are included in project design. Various altematives are
being considered in the design and location of the drinking water schemes.
Consultation with Affected People
13.   A Rapid Rural Appraisal was undertaken during project preparation. It concluded that average
incomes of the project beneficiaries are 75-80 percent of the poverty line in Egypt. During the EA a
Socio-economic survey was conducted of people living in the project area and project beneficiaries.
Interviews were conducted with 985 persons and in all project areas interviews have been held with key
persons in order to identify their needs and solicit their views. The socio-economic survey pinpointed
problems facing the settlers and which constitute obstacles in the way of securing a sustainable living for
them; these have been incorporated into project design. These views of the beneficiaries and affected
people have been included in project design.
