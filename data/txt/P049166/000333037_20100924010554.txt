130,000 fed of newly developed lands in the East Delta, leading to increased farm
incomes and laying the basis for the development of a viable rural economy in the East
Delta area. These project beneficiaries would comprise up to 9,300 graduates on 46,000
fed, 6800 smallholders on 31,000 fed, and 10,450 cooperative members on 51,500 fed.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Under the formally restructured project, the development objective is to improve
agricultural production and through it increased farm incomes for about 29,000 low
income families in the project area through provision of essential infrastructure and
agricultural support services.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
In the late 1980s the agricultural sector accounted for about 38 percent of employment in
Egypt, 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 20 percent of exports. It
provided the basis of the economy of rural Egypt, home for 54 percent of the country's
population. After decades of heavy state intervention, the Government of Egypt (GOE)
has embarked on deep economic reforms, providing the basis for market-based growth in
the sector. Though there were water quality and management issues, yields were among
the highest in the world for most crops due to the use of proper technologies and fertile
soils. Almost all irrigated agricultural land was being double-cropped. However, with a
population in 1995 of approximately 58 million, growing at 1.9 percent per annum, Egypt
had one of the poorest man/productive land ratios in the world, only 0.13 fed per person.
Average farm size was 2 fed (less than 1 ha) and 50 percent of the farming population
was landless.
The GOE has supported both agricultural intensification and the expansion of irrigated
areas, within soil and water constraints, for centuries. It started a new program of
reclamation in the 1950s, and lands reclaimed before that time are generally known as the
"old lands". Since 1952, over 2 million fed of new lands and "old new lands" have been
developed, and new land reclamation accounted for about 40 percent of sector
investment.
About one-quarter of Bank previous lending had been to the agricultural sector. A Bank
study "Land Reclamation Sub-sector Review 1990" had concluded that while physical
reclamation was relatively straightforward, agricultural services (research, extension,
farmer training, water management), adequate social infrastructure and credit were
essential to achieve reasonable yields and returns to investment.
The area of the proposed East Delta Agricultural Services Project (EDASP) was part of a
larger new lands development scheme on public lands covering 600,000 fed in the
northeast Delta and north Sinai. The reclaimed lands were to be irrigated from the newly
constructed Al-Salam Canal, using 50 percent fresh Nile water and 50 percent
agricultural drainage water. The canal and physical reclamation works of the northeast
Delta scheme were largely complete. Total sunk costs involved, including the irrigation
and drainage (I&D) infrastructure, construction of new villages and social infrastructure
were estimated at LE$1.7 billion, or US$6,700 per ha. Given the high cropping intensities
that were expected, these costs were seen as reasonable. The World Bank had not assisted
with financing the land reclamation of this area.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)
The objectives of the proposed EDASP were to provide the essential support services to
facilitate the settling and increased agricultural production of about 26,000 families on
about 130,000 fed of newly developed lands in the East Delta, leading to increased farm
incomes and laying the basis for the development of a viable rural economy in the area.
These project beneficiaries would comprise 9,300 graduates on 46,000 fed, 6,800 small

                                           1
holders on 31,000 fed, and 10,450 cooperative members on 51,500 fed. Output and PDO
indicators included 20,160 fed with new on-farm development (tertiary I&D structures
and leached), farmers accessing short, medium and long term credit and adopting
technical packages, increased agricultural production and yields, incremental families
living in the project area, and households with clean drinking water.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The project development objectives (PDO) were not changed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
In the East Delta project area a total of 203,000 fed of reclaimed land was to be
distributed among individuals who met the government criteria and chose to participate in
the program. There were several groups of beneficiaries. Poor farmers would be
allocated 128,850 fed, or 64 percent of the total reclaimed area on concessional terms,
while investors would be allocated 74,100 fed, or 36 percent of the reclaimed area, on
commercial terms. The poor farmers, totaling about 26,000 families, were the original
target group. They comprised the three sub-groups mentioned above: smallholders; land
reclamation cooperative members; and secondary school and university graduates. Only
about 7,000 families from the target groups had decided to live in the area at project start-
up, as infrastructure was still not completed.
At project restructuring in February 2002 the target beneficiaries were revised based on
the need to address I&D bottlenecks and the more comprehensive nature of works to be
done, and the on-going GOE plans for the area as provided by the General Authority for
Rehabilitation Projects and Agricultural Development (GARPAD). About 11,765
families were already living in the area, less than foreseen, due to the lack of
infrastructure and services. It was therefore estimated that beneficiaries of the expanded
works would include 29,318 families that would occupy the 202,800 fed East Delta
scheme, including 24,546 small farmers on 115,683 fed, as well as 4,772 investors on
87,217 fed.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)
The project would have a total cost of US$91.2 million (including US$16.2 million for
contingencies) of which IFAD would finance US$25 million, and IDA US$15 million.
Local farmers and small entrepreneurs would contribute US24.3 million, PBDAC
US$11.1 million, and the Government US$15.8 million (see details in Annex 1 Tables).
The EDASP would provide essential agricultural support services to the 26,000 families
target group under the following five components:
(a) Agricultural Support Services component (US$2.8 million base cost), included
extension services, adaptive research and support to community development services.
Extension would focus initially on reclamation crops, and then broaden to include plant
protection, soil and water management, farm management, livestock husbandry and
marketing. It would also support the development of water users associations (WUAs)
and service cooperatives;
(b) On-farm infrastructure component (US$20.3 million base cost) would finance tertiary
I&D works on about 20,000 fed for smallholders and cooperative members (at LE 3,500

                                             2
per fed). Smallholders would contribute 20 percent of the cost through labor (about
US$5.1 million equivalent), largely for earthworks for land leveling, canals and drains;
(c) Rural Water Supply component (US$10.2 million base cost) would provide drinking
water in the schemes of North and South Hussainya, including a treatment plant and
conveyance system from the Al-Salheya Canal, aiming to serve about 50,000 people;
(d) Financial Support Services component (US$40.2 million base cost) would support a
line of credit through the Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit
(PBDAC) for demand driven short, medium and long-term credit for purchase of
agricultural inputs, livestock, farm machinery, and equipment for agro-processing. Credit
would be provided under PBDAC's prevailing terms and conditions based on market
rates. Beneficiary contribution for short-term credit would be 30 percent, and for
medium- and long-term credit would be 50 percent. In addition, the project would also
support the establishment of four new village banks in the project area; and
(e) Project Management, and M&E component (US$1.6 million base cost) would finance
a Project Management Unit (PMU) to be responsible for project planning, procurement
and coordination, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) including environmental monitoring.
The fourth component (credit) with about 50 percent of the project costs would be under
PBDAC, while all the other components under the Ministry of Agriculture and Land
Reclamation (MALR), in both cases through Project Management Units (PMUs).

1.6 Revised Components
At appraisal, it was recognized that basic conditions needed to be met for achieving the
DO, namely that "the canal and physical reclamation works are largely complete". This
assumption proved to be erroneous as serious deficiencies in the I&D network acted as
bottlenecks, reducing the number of beneficiaries moving to the area, and limiting the
chances for land development and agriculture production. Due to these problems,
implementation performance (IP) during the first four years was almost continuously
rated as unsatisfactory until the components were formally revised to overcome the
design flaws. While on-farm tertiary I&D investments and key agricultural support
services were included in the original design, the upper-stream systems at the level of the
primary/secondary infrastructure were in bad shape for the project tertiary systems and
support service investments to be effective. The main structures were inadequate in
design and capacity for delivering irrigation water and to evacuate drainage water.
Similar problems affected the required supply of potable water and the sanitation
conditions necessary for families to be interested in moving to the new lands, and only a
small part of these basic needs were included in the project investment plans, as it was
assumed that the GOE would have provided these. Moreover, about 50 percent of the
project costs were supposed to be used for agricultural credit, but in the absence of
adequate I&D infrastructure, the demand for credit was minimal as farmers would not
move to the area, and those who did, were not eligible for credit and could not service
their debts as their farms were idle.
Hence, the original Credit and Loan Agreements (CA & LA) between the GOE and
IDA/IFAD dated February 12, 1998 were amended on February 14, 2002 and again on
November 15, 2002. Under the restructured project, DO continued to be the same, but the

                                            3
amounts of the Credit and Loan allocated to the components were changed significantly.
Components after the project restructuring became the following:
(a) Agricultural Support Services component (US$4 million) include community
development, agricultural research and extension, and other support activities,
(b) On-farm infrastructure component (US$15.2 million) cover irrigation improvements
and comprehensive land reclamation on about 21,500 fed (20,000 fed at appraisal) in
addition to implementation of subsurface field drainage on 8,000 fed in Mataria area, and
reclamation gypsum on 50,000 fed;
(c) Removing infrastructure bottlenecks (US$15.3 million): (i) four groups of drainage
pumping stations (PS) and related drains (US$11.2 million); (ii) supporting infrastructure
works including 60 km of rural type feeder roads and 6 bridges (US$2.12 million); and
(iii) electrification of remaining project areas (US$1.67 million);
(d) Enhanced provision of potable water supply and waste water treatment (US$16
million) including: (i) construction of a new water treatment plant (WTP) at Al Hussainia
(15,000 m3/day capacity) with 36 km raw water feeding pipeline and 18 km of treated
water pipelines, and (ii) rehabilitation of 6 existing compact water treatment units,
replacement of one compact WTP, storage tanks, etc.;
(e) Financial Support Services component (US$4 million) which would be implemented
with a reduced donor financing from US$16 million to US$4 million; and
(f) Project Management, and M&E component (US$3.2 million).

1.7 Other significant changes
As the restructured project was showing satisfactory progress, a third amendment to the
CA was approved in March 2004 extending the closing date by 18 months to December
31, 2005, and increasing the IDA financing share for works under Part A from 21 to 30
percent. A fourth amendment followed in May 2004, for increasing the authorized
allocation for the Special Account for Part A from US$500,000 to US$1.5 million
because the original amount was insufficient and causing implementation problems to
meet contractual needs of the larger contracts. The fifth amendment was requested by the
GOE and approved by IDA in December 2005, for extending the closing date for
additional 18 months until June 30, 2007. The request came after more than 15 months of
significant implementation slowdown due to an investigation of the project accounts led
by the Administrative Control Agency (ACA) of the GOE. The situation resulted in IDA
suspending all disbursements due to the GOE lack of response to the Bank inquiries
about the reasons behind the ACA investigation. However, even after the ACA
investigation closed, project management continued for some time to be risk-averse to
taking decisions, time was needed to remobilize contractors, and time was again short for
the works to advance as expected. As a result, the GOE requested a third 18 months
extension of the closing date, which was approved by IDA, through December 31, 2008.
After IFAD rejected a new request for extending the closing date beyond December 31,
2008 (due to IFAD's 10 year limit for project implementation), an additional 5 months
extension was granted by IDA until May 31, 2009, as requested by the GOE, loan
proceeds were reallocated, and the percent of works and goods expenditures to be

                                            4
financed under Part A increased to cover also the part previously financed by IFAD. A
last extension until December 31, 2009 was requested by the GOE and approved by IDA
on May 31, 2009.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The project had an extremely long cycle, as it was originally identified by IFAD in 1993.
An FAO Investment Center pre- formulation mission was followed by a formulation
mission in September/October 1994. At the request of IFAD, a Bank mission visited
Egypt in September 1995 to finalize preparation. The mission assessed the progress of
implementation of I&D infrastructure works in the project area and proposed some
changes in the design of the credit component and support for land development for
smallholder farmers. The Environmental Assessment (EA) was completed in early
September 1996. Detailed designs for the original drinking water supply component were
completed by June 1998. Designs for the tertiary infrastructure tender documents and for
goods were prepared after Board approval, with funding provided by IFAD. The
implementation and procurement plans were agreed to with GOE at Negotiations.
The project area, comprising about 200,000 fed (85,000 ha), extended areas under the
administration of four governorates (Port Said, Ismailya, Sharkia and Dakahliya). It
included six irrigation and drainage (I&D) schemes along the El-Salam Canal. GOE
gave assurance that adequate water will be made available to the project area, and
delivered to the different schemes after the infrastructure had been completed, which was
expected by early 19971. Twelve villages for graduates had been constructed, with about
7500 houses and service buildings (schools, health centers, mosques, community and
administrative buildings).
Quality at entry proved to be unsatisfactory. The project was linked to a much larger
integrated rural development operation where it would fill crucial gaps in selected areas.
Designers failed to recognize that reclamation of such areas and the establishment of new
villages with utilities and social amenities is a long term undertaking and the overall
challenge was underestimated. Some of the critical assumptions, namely that "the canal
and physical reclamation works are largely complete" (para. 1.04 of the SAR) proved to
be erroneous. The I&D infrastructure which was supposed to be provided by the
government was not functional and together with the inadequate access to potable water
supply, threatened the overall integrity and viability of the project.
2.2 Implementation
Project implementation was affected by numerous problems since its effectiveness in
January 25, 1999. With a very poor original design it also suffered from lack of
ownership, as a result of changes within MALR, and from weak PMU management
teams until 2003. It also had to go through: (i) a slow and complex restructuring process
during 2002; (ii) an investigation by the ACA from the GOE during 2004 and 2005; (iii)

1
   I&D infrastructure was largely (but not all) complete at appraisal and pumping equipment was being installed. The
area was being developed in phases: the program for graduates began in South Hussainia in 1993-94; and was planned
for Um El Reesh in 1998, South Port Said Plain and South Port Said in 1999-2000, and North Hussainya in 1998-2000.


                                                         5
a 7 months IDA suspension of disbursements during May ­ December 2005; (iv) a
remobilization period after the investigation was completed and the IDA suspension
lifted ; and (v) Five changes of Project Directors (PD) and management teams. Since
2006 management and implementation improved substantially, and almost all works were
completed by the Bank project closing date and most DOs were achieved.
The IDA Credit and IFAD Loan were declared effective fourteen months after Board
presentation. Effectiveness and start-up were delayed by almost two years due in part to
the long approval process in Egypt. The time spent in setting up an efficient PMU also
lead to coordination issues between the Project Director (PD) and the National
Coordinator and with other project implementing agencies. Implementation progress (IP)
remained unsatisfactory until restructuring by the end of 2002.
In June 2001 the Bank supervision mission rated the EDASP as a problem status project:
water levels in drainage canals were too high due to inadequate pumping capacity and
siltation; and the water levels in the irrigation canals were too low and did not permit
adequate leaching and cultivation of lands. Provision of functioning main drains and
irrigation infrastructure was not the PMU or the MALR responsibility. The potable water
situation had become critical, as existing compact water treatment plants needed
rehabilitation and increased capacity2. The Credit component was also not moving as
anticipated mainly due to the drainage bottlenecks which did not allow farmers to
produce and get the income needed to have access to credit. While good progress was
being made under the agricultural research and extension, community development, and
M&E components, these activities would have limited impact unless the irrigation and
water and sanitation challenges were addressed. It was then agreed with the GOE that
management would be strengthened and the project would be restructured.
Immediately after the June 2001 mission, the GOE reacted proactively by: (i) reallocation
of the local budget to dredge the main clogged drainage channels; (ii) hiring six local
experts to prepare the restructuring proposals that would be ready for discussions with the
IDA restructuring mission; (iii) strengthening the PMU; (iv) completion of project
support infrastructure; and (v) signing of the major contracts and the acceleration of
works. The project was amended in February 14, 2002 and by December 2002, DO was
upgraded to a satisfactory status due to the positive actions and to good performance on
indicators. The IP reached the same status in March 2003 with the progress of works and
remedial measures. With the focus on improving supportive I&D infrastructure, the
cropped area increased strongly from 20,159 fed in 2001/02 to 88,551 fed in 2004/05.
Wheat and berseem cropped areas showed a 5 and 3.5 fold increases, indicating also a
substantial improvement on the quality of reclaimed soils. The agricultural extension and
research services and community development components were also showing good
progress.
However, by February 2005 the IP was downgraded to moderately unsatisfactory due to
the risk of new implementation delays caused by a continuing investigation of the project

2
  The situation with regard to other basic infrastructure such as electricity supply was also unsatisfactory. Electricity
connections had been promised in the new villages, but several villages were still not connected even though they were
not far from transmission lines. The social infrastructure, including health and education facilities, also required urgent
improvements.

                                                            6
that was opened by the ACA of the GOE in mid 2004. Key project staff were dismissed
and new staff appointed without proper TORs nor the Bank's "no-objection". The critical
financial manager and procurement posts were inappropriately filled and implementation
significantly slowed down. Project files were removed from the project office by the
investigation team, and this prevented the Bank from carrying out its supervision role.
The Bank requested clarification on the reasons for the investigation starting in July
2004, but without any answer. As a result, Bank management decided to suspend
disbursements in May 20053. In November 2005 the GOE met the Bank required
conditions for lifting the suspension of disbursements and by December a new extension
for the project was awarded as a "unique" exception since the project status was
unsatisfactory due to the implementation slowdown brought about by the investigation
and subsequent suspension.
After renewed GOE commitment and management strengthening, the project regained
momentum by 2006 and managed to restart enhancing the conditions required for the
target populations to want to move into the area, and for increased production and
improved incomes. This regaining of momentum in 2006 included the remobilization of
contractors, and in addition all contracts had to be revised, extended and where needed,
amended. With a new and capable project management team (which was kept in place
until project closure), implementation of the project resumed at an accelerated pace.
Coordination among implementing agencies improved substantially and DO and IP were
upgraded once again to a moderately satisfactory status by April 2006, remaining as such
until closure.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The M&E plan was designed as a management tool, focusing on both project output
(achieving project objectives and targets) and impact (improving the incomes of the
target groups). Selected key indicators included: (i) the number and category of
beneficiary by scheme; (ii) percentage of households who have adopted technical
packages; (iii) cropped area and crop and livestock yields; (iv) institutional and
community development; (v) status of infrastructure development; and (vi)
environmental monitoring. M&E activities had a slow start-up, similar to that of the rest
of the project, but good progress occurred after January 2001as the unit was strengthened.
By mid 2001 the Baseline Survey Report was available and with restructuring, new
indicators were added. Information about the cropped area, number of livestock,
production yields, costs per crop or activity, and off-farm income were collected
regularly through surveys. A farm and non-farm income study was undertaken by the
M&E team in 2008 to measure the project impact.


3
  The Bank suspended disbursements without exceptions on May 4, 2005 after about one year of slowed
implementation due to the on-going investigation and the GOE not responding to the Bank letters dated December 21,
2004, and March 7, 2005 asking about the nature, scope, rational, results if any, and possible impacts on project
implementation of the investigation. Finally, the GOE through the Minister of International Cooperation by note dated
October 31, 2005 explained to the Bank Vice President of the MENA region that "the current investigations on the
infringements are not related to the IDA or IFAD loan credits, or the companies and suppliers having contractual
obligations for the project activities. As a matter of fact, the referred to infringements concern some procedural
contraventions carried out by the former project's staff".


                                                          7
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
The project was classified as category B. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was done
as part of project preparation and its results incorporated into the project design. The
main conclusions were that the soils in the project area were not polluted and that
irrigation water would be adequate in quantity and quality according to the national
program of the MWRI. The SAR included an environmental monitoring program (EMP)
focusing on soil quality, water quality, and health. The project implemented activities in
accordance with the EMP.              Environmental monitoring was undertaken, and
environmental studies were conducted in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2007; and an
environmental health study was undertaken in 2004. One of the identified problems at the
early implementation stage was the lack of potable water and proper sanitation in some of
the project areas, which led to the expansion of the component during restructuring in
2002. Contaminated potable water, disposal of sewage in canals and drains, and health
risks associated with livestock raising in close proximity of living quarters were
additional issues of concern that helped define adequate management and mitigation
plans under the restructured design. An integrated pest management program (IPM) was
also implemented, along with seminars and trainings on other environment issues
(dangers of improper use of pesticides, awareness concerning bird flu, safe use of
drinking water, etc.). Rodent control programs were also implemented. The expanded
project's sanitation activities (three waste water treatment plants) also helped to improve
environmental and health conditions in the project area.
Procurement aspects were mostly unsatisfactory until 2003 because of staff continuous
turn-over, but improved since then, after close IDA training and supervision efforts,
which led to a satisfactory status upgrade in March 2004, after a detailed post review of
procurement contracts was conducted. The review confirmed that procurement
procedures were followed and reliable.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
A new Port Said Agriculture Research Station (PSARS) has been established by MALR
at project headquarters at El-Noras village and started operating in January 2010. The
station has been staffed adequately and budget to cover expenses has been approved by
the Government in order to continue to offer the same services to the farmers and
communities of the area, similar to what the project was offering (machinery services,
research and extension, support for community development, training, provision of
artificial insemination at cost, etc.). An Extension Information Center has also been
established at El-Noras station and training courses were started in December 2009. In
sum, the MALR seems to be committed to continue the development process that still
needs to be supported so that the area can fully develop all its potential. Moreover, the
newly established PSARS is expected to expand its research and extension activities to
cover farmers in the newly reclaimed areas in Northern Sinai who would benefit from the
accumulated experience from the project area.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

                                            8
The project objectives remain highly relevant within the overall context of the MALR's
Strategy of Sustainable Agricultural Development 2030 prepared in January 2009.
Expansion of land reclamation is considered one of the axes of the current Strategy and is
expected to be accomplished by using water saved through the improvement in field
irrigation methods. New agricultural lands, including in the East Delta area, are expected
to reach 1.25 million fed by year 2017, and are targeted to increase to 3.1 million fed by
2030. The project is also in line with the Bank's objectives in the agricultural sector, as
consistently expressed over the last three CASs, which have included improving the
management and efficiency of the use of water and land resources.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Most of the planned PDOs were achieved, but only after 11 years of varying levels of
intensity of implementation and significant changes in the project investment menu.
The number of families in the project area grew from 11,528 in FY 2000 to 25,267 in FY
2009 which is 87.1% of the revised target for the end of the implementation period. The
number of people in the project area is now about 124,000.
Cropped area grew from 12,048 fed in FY 2000 to 122,611 fed in the 2009 summer
cropping season, representing 93.3% of the SAR target. In addition, the number of
farmers applying new project technologies grew from 100 in FY 2000 to 17,245 in FY
2008, which represented 5 and 60 percent of the farmers in the mentioned years,
respectively. Livestock ownership showed a 6 fold increase from 20,344 heads of large
ruminants in FY 2000 to 127,100 heads in FY 2008. Similarly, the number of small
ruminants (mainly sheep) in the area increased from 6,000 to 24,500 head.
Crop yields also show remarkable increases as they are on average about 50 percent
above the SAR target estimates. Wheat yields are 2.25 tons/fed (against 1.5 tons/fed
target); berseem yields are 30 tons/fed (against the 20 tons/fed target); cotton yields are at
1.1 tons/fed (against the 0.9 tons/fed target); and rice reached an average of 3.88 tons/fed,
(against the 2.5 tons/fed target). All these indicators demonstrate the success of the
project in creating conditions to attract the target groups to these new areas, increasing
agricultural and livestock production and family incomes.
Farm income from a 5 fed farm was estimated as being 300 percent over the control non-
project scenario according to the Farm and Non-Farm Income study conducted by the
PMU in December 2009, achievement which exceeds the SAR target by 52 percent.
The price of land in the project area has internalized the enhanced productive capacity
resulting from the I&D infrastructure improvements and the increased value resulting
from the provision of basic services. On average, land values have grown more than ten
times from about LE 7,000 to about LE 71,000 per fed. The average increase in value of
land is more than 20 times bigger than what the EDASP has invested in the area,
capitalizing the huge sunk costs of previous GOE investments.

3.3 Efficiency
According to the PAD, three interrelated "streams" of production benefits would result
from: (i) the tertiary irrigation infrastructure; (ii) the uptake of credit; and (iii) the
adoption of technical packages. The ex ante Economic Rate of Return (ERR), measuring

                                              9
only crop and livestock production benefits, was estimated at 33 percent. Investments
incurred so far on the I&D network, land improvement, and infrastructure were treated as
sunk costs. During project restructuring the ERR was re-estimated at 22 percent, given
that higher investments were needed for creating the conditions necessary to attract
beneficiaries to the project area and for their production to become viable.
At project completion the ERR was recalculated to measure the project overall impact
and, as with exa ante ERR calculation, prior I&D investments were considered as sunk
costs. Project crop and livestock production benefits were estimated based on actual
figures and are summarized in Annex 3.
The most likely "without" the project scenario was assumed to be a slower process of
I&D infrastructure and support services development in the project area. This would
result in farmers coming to the area at a slower pace, and consequently, further
postponements of the benefits from the substantial sunk investments in reclamation of the
East Delta lands and the El-Salam Canal. It was assumed that (a) farmers benefiting from
the project investments would reach the current actual levels of agricultural production
five years earlier than would have been the case "without" the project; and (b) farmers
adopting the project extension packages would reach the current higher yields after 5
years of starting with the leaching process, while "without" the project, it was assumed
that the current yields would have been reached only after 6 years of the first leaching.
These assumptions were based on discussions with the PMU staff, particularly those who
have been with the project since its early days
As explained in Annex 3, the end-of-project ERR was estimated at more than 100
percent. This extraordinary result is not surprising in view of: (i) the sizable sunk cost in
the El-Salam Canal project (more than LE 1.7 billion) as compared with the marginal
investment that capitalized on the former (LE 350 million or 17 percent of the total
investment); (ii) the huge increase in net value of production brought about by the
project, which jumped from LE 30 million to LE 400 million per year; and (iii) by
advancing the generation of such huge amounts of net benefits by 5 years with an
investment of only LE350 million is self explanatory.
Although the exclusion of sunk costs in ERR calculations is based on standard World
Bank methodology, the very large magnitude of the sunk costs would result in relatively
high ERR estimates which may not necessarily reflect the specific contribution of the
project. However, the EDASP Final Report prepared by the PMU M&E unit in April
2010 provided estimates of ERR which included the sunk costs of prior I&D investments.
According to this Report, the estimated ERR was 33.4 percent, which is considered quite
satisfactory. Moreover, the ICR's economic analysis did not quantify the expected
benefits from rural water supply, in terms of time savings, health benefits or the "spin-
off" effects of advancing the creation, through the project, of the basis for a viable rural
economy in the area. Since the project is supporting the development of services, small-
scale industry and trade in the project area, these indirect "rural development" benefits
are likely, in the long run, to be as significant as the direct production benefits.
The financial analysis at the farmers' level was undertaken to determine the impact of the
project on the beneficiaries' incomes (Annex 3). Farm models indicate that on average,
annual net incomes reached in the seventh year about LE 38,700 "with" the project. This

                                             10
is about twice the level estimated at appraisal4. Results confirm that as soon as the
appropriate agricultural and living conditions are created (with I&D system functioning,
drinking water, etc.) the targeted beneficiaries move to the area as it offers attractive
productive conditions for farming.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The overall project outcome is considered as Moderately Unsatisfactory. The project has
attained most of the PDOs and is having a significant socio-economic impact in the
project area where it is contributing to poverty alleviation, employment generation, and
gender and social development. However, the project's poor design at entry, and the
weak management during the first stages of implementation, have led to a lengthy
implementation period of 11 years. As a result, the above mentioned socio-economic
impacts were attained 5 ½ years later than originally planned. This delay involves
substantial opportunity costs not only for the funds invested by the project but also for the
sunk costs of the GOE large investments in El-Salam Canal and the associated I&D
infrastructure.

The overall outcome rating differs from the final ISR rating of MS. This is because the
ISR rating reflected the status of implementation at the time of the ISR- implementation
had been continuing, works were being completed, PDOs were met or almost met. Thus
the rating was set at MS for the last several ISRs. The ICR rating, however, reflects the
entire length of the project, and, given the very long implementation period, it was felt
that a rating of MU was appropriate.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The project has had considerable positive social development and poverty impacts, and
gender aspects have been integrated throughout as well. Much of the project's social
development impact has come through the community development activities of the
project, which had three goals: (a) to form Community Development Associations
(CDAs), (b) to form irrigation Water Users Associations (WUAs) and Water Users
Unions (WUUs), and (c) to provide training for CDAs and WUAs/WUUs. The
overarching objective has been to create viable, sustainable organizations that could
provide on-going, valuable services to their members. In order to promote sustainability,
all activities were handed over to the appropriate line ministry (for example, to the
Ministry of Social Solidarity or the MWRI).
The Project's Community Development Unit (CDU) has provided training to 14 CDAs.
Thirteen of these were able to be registered and have undertaken various activities. In
addition, 337 WUAs have been formed (above the project target of 300) and nine WUUs
established. The CDAs continue to be involved in a range of activities, including
provision of community services (health centers, day care) and small income generating

4
  In the SAR it was estimated that the net benefits for a 5 fed typical farm would reach LE 11,106. Correcting this
amount with the variation of the LE-US$ exchange rate that varied from LE 3.39 at appraisal to the current LE 5.49, the
appraisal estimate would be LE 17,986.

                                                         11
activities (rabbit breeding, sewing workshops for women, mushroom growing, etc.).
These organizations have played a critical role in generating the needed social cohesion
among community members coming from different geographical areas and social
backgrounds. The creation and training of irrigation WUAs has contributed to a sense of
ownership for the on-farm networks and promoted successful irrigation water
management at the local level, preventing and/or reducing possible conflicts over water.
Many of the project's target groups live in areas remote from (and thus disconnected
from) local governments, given that the project area is geographically located at the
periphery of the four concerned governorates. Through the creation of community-level
institutions (CDAs and WUAs/WUUs), previously marginalized communities have been
linked up to their local governments and to appropriate ministries. They now have
formal, institutional channels through which to voice their concerns and request
assistance. The project paid specific attention to assisting small holders in the farm
cooperatives of the 7,800 fed area. These individuals had previously been fishermen, and
they joined the farm cooperatives and have now been engaging as farmers in that area.
The project helped them form irrigation WUAs/WUUs and provided them with training
and extension services.
During project preparation it was determined that average incomes of project
beneficiaries were 75-80% of the poverty line in Egypt. Income levels among the various
groups of project beneficiaries (small holders, graduates, etc.) have been increased
significantly through the project, thus making a positive contribution to reducing poverty
in the area.
The project has done a great deal to incorporate gender issues into its interventions. It has
promoted the participation of women in local organizations, something which can be
challenging within the context of rural Egypt. As of late 2008, 25-30% of the
WUA/WUU members are women, as well as 35 % of CDA members, and 27% of CDA
Board members. Women are the particular focus for some of the CDA income generating
activities and thus the project has contributed to improving the livelihoods of both
women and men. The project has created, through a gender grant, 330 jobs mainly
through rabbit batteries, and the training provided to 300 women on the art of sewing
together with the distribution of 75 sewing machines. While both community men and
women are very pleased with the infrastructure services provided under the project,
women are especially grateful for the improved drinking water and sanitation services.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The MALR had the overall responsibility for execution and a PMU was established in the
project area. Local coordination was enhanced through meetings at the regional level
with the relevant governorate agencies. A National Coordination Committee (NCC) met
as needed, discussed annual work plans, provided policy guidance and facilitated
implementation at the national level.
Implementation of the credit component was supposed to be through specific PMUs to be
created at the PBDAC Cairo office, and at the three regional BDACs working in the
project area local offices. This was never done. Also, PBDAC/BDACs did not comply
with the required maintenance of the amounts repaid by sub-borrowers of project loan as
a revolving fund to be used in the project area as required by the IFAD Loan Agreement.

                                             12
Under the technical assistance activity the credit component of the EDASP financed 6
vehicles; the establishment of 4 village banks in the project area; and 172 employees
were trained in investments lending, feasibility studies, income generating loans, credit
risks, M&E, etc. In spite of these investments, the component failed to improve the
availability of sustainable credit to the project area. It never complied either with the
IFAD Loan Agreement requirement that lending rates should be in line with market rates5
covering costs and a reasonable profit margin to PBDAC.
The agricultural support services component was implemented in coordination with the
Central Administration for Agricultural Extension Services (CAAES) and their
governorate level staff, and the applied research activities with the ARC and their local
stations. The community development component was implemented by the PMU in
cooperation with the Department of Cooperatives and the Ministry of Social Solidarity.
Institutional development among beneficiaries has been strengthened beyond targets
through the CDU activities. The drinking water supply and sanitation systems were taken
over by the relevant local water authorities (such as the Sharkiya Water and Sanitation
Company) upon completion.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
The PMU conducted a beneficiary study in October 2008. According to women, the
project has led to improvement of basic infrastructure, such as drinking water and
sanitation and helped to increase women's participation in income generating projects
and in community structures such as boards of WUAs, WUUs and CDAs. It also helped
women to increase their developmental and environmental awareness through the project
training programs.
According to men, the project has helped to increase the rate of targeted beneficiaries
moving to the area. The infrastructure provided led to improvement in crop yields and
farmer incomes. Improved agricultural drainage led to the improvement in soil properties
and yields. Other significant improvements included irrigation, drinking water and
sanitation. The project has had a big role in informing the farmers about modern
agricultural technologies, such as land laser leveling, deep plowing, and using improved
varieties. The number of livestock also increased due to the project's promotion of
artificial insemination and veterinary services.
While the project has provided many infrastructure and other services, it was not
designed to cover all the needs of the project area. Annex 5 summarizes the main
problems that beneficiaries identified as still present in the area.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate
All project activities included arrangements to promote sustainability of project
outcomes. This included providing adequate training, registering organizations with the
relevant authorities, handling over infrastructure to the organizations that would operate
and be responsible for it in the future, etc. In addition, the PMU has been transformed

  Cost recovery would require a 13.375 percent rate instead of the short-term charged rate of 7.5 percent (90 percent of
the project disbursed credit funds were for short-term sub-loans).

into the "Port Said Agricultural Research Station" (PSARS). This will ensure that the
project team will continue to assume responsibility for follow-up, limited not only to
agricultural research and extension, but also including the provision of agricultural
services based on cost-recovery rental of project machinery.
Two issues are however, of special concern: (i) the insufficient level of irrigation water in
Al-Salam Canal, particularly during the summer cropping season; and (ii) the continued
illegal fish-faming activities in the project area, which contributes to aggravating the
irrigation water shortage situation as well as the well-known public health hazards
associated with the illegal use of drainage water for fish-farming. Regarding the first
point, given the higher leaching requirements of the soils in the project area, it would be
crucial for the MWRI to ensure a stable and steady supply of water to avoid any
shortages that could undermine the ability of farmers to maximize their benefits from the
huge investments in I&D infrastructure. With the second, considering the relatively very
high profits of fish-farming, it requires strict GOE intervention to enforce the legal ban
on such activities.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
The Bank preparation team failed to recognize the risk involved in the GOE not
complying with the commitment of having the primary and secondary I&D infrastructure
operating properly. It was supposed that GARPAD and MWRI works would be ready at
project start-up, ensuring the conditions needed for the project to proceed effectively with
complementary investments. However, the assumption proved to be erroneous as I&D
head works were not finished and some were requiring rehabilitation. Due to this major
failure, the project had to undergo a substantial restructuring that delayed the
development process by more than 5 years.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
 Supervision teams have proactively followed implementation, diagnosing the critical
issues and problems that were affecting progress, and ensuring that they were correctly
addressed and resolved. During the first years of implementation several agreements
tailored by the Bank supervision team facilitated improved coordination of agencies with
the PMU. When management problems were affecting implementation, the IDA team
was able to induce positive changes and/or strengthening of PMU capacities. As soon as
it became evident in 2001 that primary and secondary I&D infrastructure problems were
constraints to the project, the Bank team began the restructuring process. The Bank
supervision team worked closely with the PMU to facilitate reactivation of the project
after suspension was lifted and provided intense supervision during the remaining years
of the project.
The Bank supervision teams have been also proactive in giving support for complying
with all Bank fiduciary and safeguards policies, which led to awareness campaigns to
bring stakeholders to the same level of understanding resulting in significant

                                             14
improvements on the productive and environmental conditions: drinking water, irrigation
water, sanitation improvements, and ultimately in health and living conditions in the area.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Overall, Bank performance is considered as moderately unsatisfactory. This rating is
heavily influenced by the unsatisfactory Bank Performance in ensuring quality at entry as well
as the performance during the earlier stages of implementation. However, the Bank
implementation team was able to address the earlier shortcomings through a restructuring
process followed by intensive supervision and rapid rate of implementation. Given the
very long duration of the project and the large variation in performance over time, the
project implementation period is divided into four distinct periods, and using the average
ISR ratings for each period, the Bank performance rating can be stated as follows:

   1) June 1998 ­ November 2002: (Pre-restructuring period): Unsatisfactory
   2) November 2002 ­ March 2005: (Post-restructuring to Suspension of
      Disbursement): Moderately Unsatisfactory
   3) March 2005 ­ November 2005: (Disbursement Suspension period): Moderately
      Unsatisfactory
   4) December 2005 ­ December 2009: (Resumption of Disbursement): Satisfactory


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
Government performance varied greatly during the 15 years since project conception.
GOE did not take action as expected concerning infrastructure bottlenecks and thus the
project had to go through a slow pace during the first years, and a deep restructuring
process was required. During these first years of implementation the GOE also appointed
weak project management teams that slowed the process even further.
In 2001 however, the GOE reacted promptly and with utmost seriousness. The quick
endorsement of the proposed restructuring by the GOE Steering Committee was highly
positive. After the joint site visit by the Ministers of MALR and MWRI, the Minister of
MWRI reallocated the local budget (about LE 26.5 million) to accommodate the
immediate area needs including four groups of drainage pumping stations and related
drains, and the dredging of major drainage channels.
The investigation of the project ordered by the GOE by mid 2004 included removing all
project files and resulted in new and significant delays. After the project management
was cleared and the investigation closed, the project re-started, with a new management
team, a positive 4 year implementation period until closing, in which the GOE was highly
committed.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: MALR performance was Moderately Satisfactory, while PBDAC's performance
was Highly Unsatisfactory.
Project achievements have been attained in spite of design flaws and the failure of the
credit component, mainly due to two factors: (i) the quick response of the MALR and the

                                             15
MWRI Ministers to the concerns of the Bank supervision mission prior to restructuring,
visiting the project area and ordering immediate actions, leading to a dramatic increase in
the cropped area; and (ii) the strong support by the project's agricultural research and
extension services backed by MALR's ARC, which has been crucial in training farmers.
The PMU CDU has also performed very well developing villagers' and users' institutions
and social capital, while the M&E unit has reported key indicators to adequately follow-
up progress and to improve management.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.
In spite of the MALR's Satisfactory ratings, the overall performance of the borrower is
considered as Moderately Unsatisfactory. This rating is influenced by the Highly
Unsatisfactory performance of the PBDAC, the unsatisfactory performance of the MALR
and MWRI during the earlier stages of implementation, and the Highly Unsatisfactory
performance during the period of the investigation. Following the resumption of
disbursement the ARC/MALR took the leadership in coordinating other Ministries and
outside agencies to undertake works under the restructured project, and their own
implementing departments to sustain agricultural development. Therefore, if project
implementation period is divided into 4 periods (see above), the borrower's performance
rating can be stated as follows:

   1) June 1998 ­ November 2002: (Pre-restructuring period): Unsatisfactory
   2) November 2002 ­ March 2005: (Post-restructuring to Suspension of
      Disbursement): Moderately Satisfactory
   3) March 2005 ­ November 2005: (Disbursement Suspension period):
      Unsatisfactory
   4) December 2005 ­ December 2009: (Resumption of Disbursement): Satisfactory

6. Lessons Learned
This project offers a wealth of lessons learned as a result of all the problems it faced
during its early implementation as well as the positive corrective actions that the Bank
team and the borrower took to ensure that the project could achieve its development
objective. These lessons could prove to be crucial not only for MENA but for Bank
projects in general on why things go wrong and what should be done to reduce the
likelihood of failure. The lessons learned can be grouped into three sets of lessons
drawing from the organizational, management and programmatic weaknesses
encountered in this project:

    - Organizational weaknesses/strengths
The project clearly illustrates the critical importance of the project formulation and
design phase, and their underlying assumptions. The project preparation team failed to
recognize the risk in the GOE not complying with its commitment of having all I&D
operating properly. The team also failed to recognize the constraints imposed by PBDAC
collateral requirements for farmers to have access to credit, which led to the failure of the
largest component in the original design. On the positive side, the project showed that
major restructuring could provide the needed corrective measures to compensate for
weak project design. The restructuring team was able to recognize the importance of

                                             16
sequencing issues between I&D and potable water infrastructure and service provision
(research and extension, credit, on-farm infrastructure). The project team also realized the
important role of the project as a catalyst to capitalize on the major GOE sunk costs in
I&D infrastructure. This provided the necessary justification not to cancel the project in
spite of the poor original design and of the numerous problems that plagued the first few
years of project implementation.

    - Management weaknesses/strengths
The project provides a typical case where too many institutions were involved, including
two ministries and four governorates. A key factor for the poor performance of the
project in the early years was the difficulty in coordination among numerous institutions
that were often competing over mandates. The fact that the project was placed under the
mandate of MALR must have created serious coordination problems particularly during
the period when there were frequent changes in Ministers and lack of ownership.
Coordination problems were further magnified by the weak project directors appointed
by the MALR and the lack of clear lines of authority for decision-making between
MALR and the various agencies involved in implementation. During the last four years
of the project, the establishment of an efficient PMU, under the leadership of a strong
project director with full support from MALR, was instrumental for the rapid pace of
implementation and for the project to achieve its development objectives.

   -   Programmatic weaknesses/strengths

A key lesson learned from this project is the importance of combining social and
community services components with infrastructural components, particularly in the
context of land reclamation and I&D projects. The project shows that basic social
infrastructure (drinking water supply, sanitation, electricity, health facilities, etc.) can be
as important as the availability of I&D infrastructure in attracting people to newly
reclaimed areas. The project also illustrates the important contribution of community
development support activities. Although they generally account for only a small fraction
of project overall costs, such activities are crucial elements for creating and developing
social cohesion in a context where families from different regions and backgrounds have
come together.



7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The borrower disagreed with the overall performance rating given by ICR team as
"Moderately Unsatisfactory". It was argued that such ratings did not truly reflect the
actual effort done. Given that the ratings were based on dividing the project
implementation period into two periods, it did not capture the good performance of the
project after restructuring as well as the serious problems faced during the period
between restructuring and suspension of disbursement. It was suggested that the duration



                                              17
of the project be divided into four distinct periods, with distinct ratings, and that overall
rating should be "Moderately Satisfactory".

In response to the issues raised by the borrower, the Bank ICR team agreed to the
suggestion of dividing the project period into four separate periods, each with distinct
ratings, and the ICR was revised accordingly. However, the Bank ICR team re-iterated
their assessment that, in spite of the satisfactory performance of the project during the last
four years, the project's poor design at entry, and the weak management during the first
stages of implementation, have led to a lengthy implementation period of 11 years. As a
result, the project's positive socio-economic impacts were attained 5 ½ years later than
originally planned. This delay involves substantial opportunity costs not only for the
funds invested by the project but also for the sunk costs of the GOE large investments in
El-Salam Canal and the associated I&D infrastructure.

(b) Cofinanciers

IFAD is the only co-financier of this project. IFAD agrees to a large extent with the
approach and conclusions of the ICR document. The only reservation that IFAD has is
the overall outcome rating. It was recommended that the overall outcome rating should be
upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory. This recommendation is based on IFAD's views
that the project has accomplished its development objectives with great success in spite
of poor design, delayed effectiveness, investigation and suspension.

In response to the issues raised by IFAD, the Bank ICR team agreed that the project has
accomplished its development objectives. However, as noted in the above response to the
borrower, the numerous difficulties encountered during project implementation have
resulted in a lengthy implementation period of 11 years. Therefore, the project's positive
socio-economic impacts were attained 5 ½ years later than originally planned. This delay
involves substantial opportunity costs not only for the funds invested by the project but
also for the sunk costs of the GOE's substantial investments in I&D infrastructure.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Before the project the GOE had invested about LE 1,7 billion for reclaiming the project
area, including the construction of El-Salam canal (82 km west of the Suez Canal), roads,
leveling and digging I&D canals, building houses, establishing huge drainage stations,
etc.. Through its several components, the restructured EDASP provided complementary
infrastructure and many basic services to facilitate the targeted beneficiaries moving to
the area and its agricultural and social development. Project investments facilitated the
settlement of about 25 thousand low-income families (up to 2008/09), and the increased
agricultural production of the beneficiaries on about 130 thousand fed of the newly
reclaimed land. The lower level of beneficiaries living in the project sub-areas in South
Port Said, which shows the lowest achievement when compared with targets (46.6
percent), is due to several reasons. The most important one is that it still lacks some basic
I&D infrastructure like irrigation water as the villages of El-Etehad, El-Amany, and El-
Fath are at the end of Qantara and Shader Azzam .This bottleneck will be resolved after
the completion of the temporary station (7,800 fed contract) on El-Salam canal which
was initiated under the EDASP.
Agricultural Support Services Component performance is considered Satisfactory. This
component's cost was L.E 25.04 million, and was determinant for the attainment of the
DO. It provided extension services for the adoption of improved cropping technologies,
and veterinary advice for livestock, as well as machinery services, and key support
training courses, that resulted in increased cultivated areas, yields and production levels
well beyond targets. The most important activities, services, and outputs were:
       Dissemination and adoption of modern technologies has accelerated the
       transformation of unproductive saline land, to highly productive land, producing
       good revenues as soil properties improved and yields increased for all crops.
       The total cultivated area reached 122,000 fed in 2009 and will continue to
       increase every year, likely reaching the target - which was 130,000 fed - during
       2010.
       Farms adopting modern technologies are now about 17,200 working on 72,100
       fed, which represents 60 percent of the project area (120 percent of the target).
       Integrated pest management techniques have been disseminated that reduce costs
       of production as well as soil and water pollution levels.
       Crop yields have increased 50 percent over the target for most crops: 2.2 and 18.5
       ton/fed of wheat and sugar beet respectively in the 2008/09 winter season; and 3.8
       and 1. 1 ton/fed of rice and cotton respectively in the 2009 summer season.
       Establishment of a soil, water and environment analysis lab at El-Rowad village,
       transferred to become an agricultural research station, including 10 fed to be a
       research farm under the station, with an estimated value of LE 2 million.
       Establishment of a self-sustained machinery services unit that has played an
       important role with about 50,000 hours worked, and serving more than 3,000 fed;
       as well as providing deep plowing to 750 fed, laser leveling to 15,000 fed, I&D
       canals cleaning to 19.1 km, and digging of 17.9 km of drains & marwas.


                                             20
       The machinery unit provided agricultural services to 20,300 fed of wheat, 190 fed
       of rice, and the compressing of about 60,000 packages of rice straw.
       The total livestock production has been 174% of the target: 151,600 heads against
       the planned 87,000. The significant increase in livestock production is greatly due
       to the intensive efforts by the project extension and veterinary staff demonstrating
       silage feed production for summer when berseem was not available (cutting and
       composting corn and rice shafts and injecting with urea).
       The cases treated by veterinary caravans include about 8,600 cows, 7,900
       buffalos, 4,639 sheep and 4,846 calves. Artificial insemination and reproductive
       diagnosis of animals carried out by trained graduates were 2,885 and 2,709 for
       cows and buffalos, 1,821 hoof care, and 1,004 of veterinary assistance.
       About 1,437 demo fields have been installed (621 for summer and 785 for winter
       crops), 1,830 field days and 31 harvesting days of winter and summer crops
       organized; and extension pilots included 52 of ammonia demos, 136 of compost
       demos, and 54 of silage pile demos.
The project has also contributed significantly to the development of social capital in the
project area. The number of institutions created under the project was 364, or 18 percent
more than the targeted 309, which are contributing greatly towards the project area's
development, and providing a sustainable basis for future. The following Table shows the
type of organizations that are now working to develop social and productive links in the
communities, and to build communication channels between beneficiaries and different
levels of government and service providers.

Mechanical, hands-on training developed innovative means to increase the level of
comfort of the WUAs members in taking care of the infrastructure. Training included
District Engineers so they could get familiar with WUAs members, developing new
relationships for O&M. The PMU Community Development Unit (CDU) performed
many services especially in the project's first stage, to improve the beneficiaries' non-
farm income, and to enhance women's role as income earners for their families. It had a
big role in building institutional structures and the base for sustainability of DO in the
area. Besides WUAs and WUUs, the CDU also facilitated the establishing of: (i) ten
cooperatives for the development of local societies; (ii) eight medical centers working
under the CDAs; and (iii) training centers and small projects which were very important
for increasing family incomes. Centers for milk production, for bakeries, for mushroom
production, for apiaries and honey production, for papyrus, and nine handcraft workshops

                                            21
have been formed. Symposiums, training courses, and workshops in the fields of the
above mentioned activities, and on irrigation machines maintenance, on WUAs role, and
on small projects' feasibility studies were also organized. About 330 rabbits' batteries
were distributed among graduates who had received training in this field.
The establishment of clean and green village environment was also developed in Tenth of
Ramadan village by supporting a garden, tree planting, house coating, a bakery unit, a
nursery, a local society development unit, and woman workshops. Medical centers were
provided with medicines.
On-farm Infrastructure Component performance is considered Moderately
Satisfactory. The project implemented many on-farm improvements and works on the
primary and secondary I&D structures costing LE 106.5 million, including:
   ·   Comprehensive Land Reclamation (CLR) of 13700 fed at South El-Husainia Plain
       (El-Ezdehar, Tarek Ibn Ziad, and El-Salah) and South Port Said (El-Radwan and
       Tarek Inb Ziad) budgeted at about LE 30.5 million. Comprised rehabilitation of
       secondary and tertiary I&D systems, provision of on-farm systems, land leveling
       and reclamation for I&D of about 8,200 fed, and access roads and electrification.
       Progress reached 85 percent and amount disbursed reached LE 25.8 million.
   ·   CLR of Um Khalaf Scheme (7,800 fed.) at Um Khalaf cooperatives (EL-Keblia
       and El-Baharia) budgeted at LE 35.6 million reached about 80 percent completion
       and disbursed LE 22.8 million. Comprised supply of irrigation headworks
       pumping station equipment, rehabilitation of secondary systems, provision of
       tertiary and on-farm systems, land leveling, and facilitation of land reclamation.
       There were initial delays as land had been used illegally for fish farming and
       needed to be drained; subsequently there were delays due to the extremely slow
       rate of implementation of the contractor.
   ·   Supply and installation of the mechanical and electric works of the drainage pump
       station at South El-Husainia valued at LE 14 million reached about 95 percent
       progress and disbursed LE 13.5 million.
   ·   Supply and installation of mechanical and electric works of eight moveable
       emergency pump units was completed with total cost of LE 10.6 million, and
       handing over was in September 2008.
   ·   Planned investments in the electricity grid totaling LE 12.7 million achieved 80
       percent progress disbursing LE 9.7 million.
Supply of Drinking Water and Sanitation Component performance is considered as
Satisfactory. The project has invested about LE 130 million in drinking water and
sanitation facilities at all project areas, particularly for graduates and low-income
villages. These services are considered the most important attraction factors for
beneficiaries to move to the newly reclaimed project areas. Following are the main
component outputs:
   · Establishment of a Drinking Water Treatment Plant (WTP) at Tarik bin Ziyad
   (L.E 74.5 million), with a completion rate of 99 percent and LE 69.6 million
   disbursed.



                                           22
    · Rehabilitation of 2 compact drinking water units and establishment of 2 new ones
    at El-Sedk and El-Salah (L.E 6.6 million). Final handing over to Port Said
    Governorate was done in September 2008.
    · Rehabilitation of 4 drinking water compact units and establishment of a new one
    at Bahr El Baqar and El Cab at South Port Said (LE 10.1 million). Handing over to
    Port Said was done in February 2009.
    · Establishment of new Waste Water Treatment Plants (by wetland system) in: (i)
    El-Radwan and Tenth of Ramadan (L.E 5.2 million), handed over to Port Said
    Governorate in July 2008; (ii) El-Rowad (L.E 6.7 million), handed over to El-Sharkia
    Governorate in June 2008; and (iii) Tarek Ibn Ziad (L.E 6.1 million) for serving also
    El-Ezdehar, El-Eslah, and Khalid Ibn El-Waleed villages. Completion rate in this last
    WWTP reached 70 percent and disbursements to L.E 4.23 million.
    · Revamping of water distribution networks of 5 villages (El-Rowad ,El-Ezdehar,
    Tarek Ibn Ziad ,El-Salah, and Khalid Ibn El-Waleed) was completed (L.E 3.4
    million)
    · Installation of the main trunk lines (4 elevated tanks): completion rate has reached
    70 percent and amount disbursed was L.E 5.78 million, about half of the budgeted
    cost.
During the course of the last two years of project implementation, periodic efforts were
made by both supervision mission members and PMU staff to assemble and compile
accurate and reliable data on the various project infrastructure development contracts and
key achievements. This led to the preparation of suggested tabular formats and initial
data insertions followed by several cycles of revisions, additions and reviews by mission
members and PMU staff. The tables reflect the status of the project infrastructure
developments at time of preparation of this ICR (March 31, 2010). They provide a
comprehensive and concise summary of the project's infrastructure development efforts
and outcomes, and serve as a good reference to assist with this ICR. The results are
presented in two modified data tables that are attached to this Annex 2, as follows:
· Annex 2 - Table 1: EDASP Infrastructure Components ­ Key Achievements; and
· Annex 2 - Table 2: EDASP Infrastructure Components ­ Sustainability Arrangements.


Credit Component performance is considered highly unsatisfactory. Short term credit to
farmers under the project started in the 1999/2000 winter season with less than US$2
million disbursed (90 percent in crop loans). Between May 14 and June 8, 2000 a joint
supervision mission to the EDASP and the Sohag Rural Development Project (SRDP)
visited Egypt to look into the credit components of both projects. The BTO indicated that
the PBDAC system comprising a large network in the rural areas has been playing a
major role in promoting the development of the agricultural/rural sector as the main
financial intermediary6. However, it pointed out that its performance was showing

6
  The Principal Bank for Development and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) system consisted in the year 2000 of a Head
Office in Cairo and three branches of the Principal Bank (Cairo, Giza and Alexandria), as well as a holding comprising
17 regional banks (Banks for Development and Agricultural Credit ­ BDAC). Each of the regional banks was
incorporated as an independent joint stock company (owned by PBDAC and controlled by its Board), and was treated
as an individual entity for all legal and tax purposes. These BDACs operated through a network of 168 branches, 990
village banks and 634 retail units (mandubiyas).

                                                         23
"several areas of serious concern that still remained to be addressed, including inter-alia:
weak accounting standards; inconsistent financial statements and reporting; high loan to
deposit ratio; deteriorating quality of the loan portfolio; inadequate provisions for loan
losses; extremely weak internal controls; and almost total lack of a system for credit
monitoring and follow-up of overdue loans. Inconsistent performance in some BDACs
which are making losses in their operations and are adopting unsound banking practices,
are a burden in the overall performance of the PBDAC system, affecting capital adequacy
and raising concerns regarding its long-term viability as an autonomous and self-
sustainable financial intermediary".
Regarding in particular the EDASP, the mid 2000 IDA mission recommended that: (i) a
PMU within the PBDAC and the three BDACs in the project area should be set and that
it was not advisable to continue disbursing credit funds without these arrangements in
place; (ii) discuss with IFAD the reduction of their share of financing the sub-loans under
the project from 75 to 37 percent as was stated in the PAD (IDA was financing and
additional 23 percent); (iii) amounts repaid by sub-borrowers of the project sub-loans
should be kept as a revolving fund for the expansion of credit facilities under the Project
as established in the IFAD Loan Agreement, and adequate accounting systems should be
put in place; (iv) prevailing lending rates (7.5 percent for crop loans, and 12 and 13
percent for medium and long term loans) should be adjusted to cover the full costs for
PBDAC, and if the situation persists, suspension of disbursements could be suggested;
(v) Tripartite Agreement (TPA) between GARPAD, PBDAC and the sub-borrower for
each sub-loan should be obtained to cover all the existing and future sub-loans, and SOEs
for sub-loans disbursed should certify that PBDAC sub-loans are covered under TPA;
and (vi) the maintenance of accounts and in particular, the treatment of interest income
and expenses, should be in accordance to international accounting standards.
During the following FY 2001 loans disbursed dropped to less than half (LE 3 million),
and to LE 2 million (US$0.45 million) in FY 2002. As a result of the project
restructuring, the original US$16 million donor funds allocated for the credit component
were brought down to US$4 million (IDA US$1.1 million and IFAD US$2.9 million). At
the time about US$2.6 million were spent (IDA line of credit US$0.6 million; IDA goods
and works US$0.2 million and IFAD line of credit US$1.8 million). It was expected that
the remaining sum of US$1.1 million would be disbursed before the project closing date.
However, for 2003 disbursements for loans reached only LE 2.37 million, decreasing to
LE 170,000, and to LE 243,176 in FY 2004 and 2005 respectively. According to the
PBDAC's completion report, the main reasons for the poor performance of the
component were: (i) beneficiaries could not submit enough collateral to repay their
required loans mainly because they had no land ownership documents or related contracts
to offer; (ii) the existing constraints and bottlenecks of the main I&D infrastructure that
was not able to provide the required irrigation water, and to dispose the excess drainage
water from the fields to allow for proper cropping activities; and (iii) delayed moving of
beneficiaries to the project area. Consequently, instead of the planned US$ 20 million in
credit allocations, the highest amount of credit that PBDAC was able to finance in the
project area was only about US$2 million by the end of FY2000 and almost exclusively
in short-term credit.


                                            24
Project Management and Monitoring Component performance is considered
Moderately Satisfactory. Following the first two years of implementation with a weak
management team that resulted in lack of leadership and problems with procurement and
disbursement issues, management improved and a restructuring process allowed for
redesigning the project in accordance with the area's and beneficiaries' needs. Again in
2004 and 2005 there were management problems due to the on-going investigations that
dismissed most of the PMU team. From 2006 until closing, a new and very effective team
was appointed which conducted a satisfactory and highly effective period lasting 4 years.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Introduction. In estimating the economic impact of the project, the ICR team followed
standard methodologies for calculating economic returns to investment, such as the
Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV). As such, the economic
benefits was estimated based on the contribution of the project to generate higher farm
incomes as a result of expansion in area planted, increase in crop yields, and increase in
the number and productivity of livestock. The project's substantial investments in utilities
infrastructure (piped potable water, sewage networks, etc) provided tremendous positive
externalities to the entire project area that are not captured in the ICR evaluation exercise.
The availability of such basic utilities provided a significant boost in local living
conditions and constituted probably the most significant factor in convincing the farm
communities to live permanently in the project area.
The project has also created a conducive environment for the development of other
private sector activities in the project area including agricultural services (machinery
rentals, veterinary services, etc.) as well as retail marketing of consumer products.
Moreover, the project was successful in establishing a large number of functioning and
effective community organizations, including CDAs, WUAs and WUUs and Agricultural
Cooperatives. It is clear that these organizations played a critical role in generating the
needed social cohesion among community members originating from different
geographical areas and social backgrounds. Thus, the positive social impact of the project
should not be underestimated even though quantifying externalities is much more
difficult to measure than the direct agricultural economic impact. This ICR only
highlights the above-mentioned externalities in addition to the standard economic
analysis which only considers the net value of increased agricultural production.
Methodology. According to the PAD, three interrelated "streams" of production benefits
would result from: (i) the tertiary irrigation infrastructure; (ii) the uptake of credit; and
(iii) the adoption of technical packages. The ex ante Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
measuring only crop and livestock production benefits, was estimated at 33 percent.
Investments incurred so far on the I&D network, land improvement, and infrastructure
were treated as sunk costs. When project restructuring at MTR, the ERR was re-estimated
at 22 percent, given that higher investments were needed for creating the conditions for
the beneficiaries to move to the project area and for their farm production to become
viable.
At project completion an ERR was recalculated by the ICR team to measure the project
overall impact. FARMOD software was used for preparing crop and livestock activity
budgets, farm models and the "with" and "without" project scenarios. Project crop and
livestock production parameters and benefits are now based on real facts based on the
PMU M&E records about investment pace since 1999, number of families in the project
area, areas planted for each crop, the evolution of average yields, the cost of production
of each crop, the evolution of the cropping area, the growing number of animals in the
project area, etc.. The "with" the project situation is then given by what had really
happened. Tables 1 to 3 in this Annex 3, shows the crop budgets for wheat, berseem and
rice. Similar budgets were prepared for other crops with the assistance of the M&E
project unit team. Table 4 show the typical 5 fed farm in the project area, and Table 5, the


                                             30
aggregate incremental value of production in the project area, assuming that the project
had the effect of advancing the development process by only 5 years as explained below.
The most likely "without" project scenario was assumed to be given by a slower process
of I&D infrastructure and support services development in the project area. In other
words, it is assumed that the same investments would be done but, given the GOE budget
constraints, the development process would have required about 16 years instead of 11
year required by the EDASP. This would have resulted in beneficiaries moving to the
area at a slower pace, and consequently, further delays in realizing benefits from the
substantial sunk investments in reclamation of the East Delta lands and the El-Salam
Canal. In sum, it was assumed that (a) farmers benefiting from the project investments
are reaching the current actual levels of agricultural production five years earlier than
would have been the case "without" the project; and (b) farmers adopting the project
extension packages are reaching the current higher yields after 5 years of starting with the
leaching process, while "without" the project, it was assumed that the current yields
would have been reached only after 6 years of the first leaching.
As can be seen in Table 5 where the difference between "with" and "without" project
scenarios are presented, the ERR is now estimated as being higher than 100 percent. This
extraordinary result is not surprising in view of: (i) the sizable sunk cost in the El-Salaam
Canal project (more than LE 1.7 billion) as compared with the marginal investment that
capitalized the former (LE 350 million or 17 percent of a total investment of more than
LE 2 billion); (ii) the huge increase in net value of agricultural production brought about
by the project, which jumped from LE 30 million in 1999 to LE 400 million per year in
2009 onwards; and (iii) by advancing the generation of such huge amount of net benefits
by 5 years, with an accelerated investment of only LE350 million is self explanatory.
This economic analysis did not quantify the expected benefits from rural water supply, in
terms of time savings, health benefits or the "spin-off" effects of advancing the creation,
through the project, of the basis for a viable rural economy in the area. Since 45 percent
of employment in rural Egypt is off-farm employment, and the project is supporting the
development of services, small-scale industry and trade in the project area, these indirect
"rural development" benefits are likely, in the long run, to be as significant as the direct
production benefits.
The financial analysis at the farmers' level was undertaken to determine the impact of the
project on the beneficiary's incomes. Farm models indicate that on average, annual net
incomes is reaching in the seventh year of settling to about LE 38,700 "with" the project.
This is about twice the level estimated at appraisal7. These results confirm that as soon as
adequate living and agricultural conditions are created (with I&D system functioning,
drinking water, etc.) beneficiaries decide to move to the area because it offers attractive
productive conditions for farming. This attractiveness and productive potential was also
confirmed through the average value of land in the project area, that jumped from about
LE 7,000 to LE 71,000 per fed.

  In the SAR it was estimated that the net benefits for a 5 fed typical farm would reach LE 11,106. Correcting this
amount with the variation of the LE-US$ exchange rate that varied from LE 3.39 at appraisal to the current LE 5.70, the
appraisal estimate would be LE 18,673.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
        The PMU conducted a study to identify the current number of families living in
the project area, in order to assess the success of the project in meeting one of its major
objectives - to facilitate the habitation of the lands in the project area, through provision
of basic infrastructure and social services. (Another objective was to facilitate increased
agricultural production through extension and other agricultural services. An income
study was conducted to assess the results in this area, and the findings are discussed in
the economic and financial analysis section of the ICR).
       In particular, the study aimed to achieve the following:
1­ Assess the current rates of habitation of the project villages.
2 - Recognize the reasons of the current rates of habitation of the project villages.
3­ Determine the economic and social characteristics of the inhabitants.
4- Recognize the factors related the project that contributed to increased levels of
habitation.
5 - Determine the most important remaining problems facing the inhabitants from the
beneficiaries' point of view (males and females), as well as the main project benefits from
the beneficiaries' point of view.
       The study applied a variety of tools to provide data and information:
 · Using a comprehensive survey of the organized population groups that are represented
in graduates' villages, and other beneficiaries at South Hussainia plain, South Port Said,
South Port Said plain and Um El-Reesh area.
· Getting the secondary data of the unorganized population groups from the Ministry's
institutions at South Port Said and South Hussainia Plain, South Port Said, the local unit
at El-Asafra, the Agriculture Institution in Port Said Governorate, and Agriculture
Institution in Ismailia Governorate.
· Holding a series of symposiums with beneficiaries at the project area locations.
· Holding a series of symposiums with agricultural engineers from the Ministry's
institutions and engineers from the Extension & Research Unit.
       The main results of this study can be summarized as follows:
The project area:
        Generally, the project region, at the time of the study (October 2008), contained
25.3 thousand families. This is 87.1% of the target, which is 29,318 families. The total
population of the project region is 123,578 persons. The study was undertaken before all
project infrastructures were completed. As the provision of infrastructure provides better
living conditions and thus promotes increased habitation, the population totals may have
increased since the time of the survey, as additional infrastructure has been completed.
The results by project sub-region:
   1   - South Hussainia plain: The number of families is 3,782, which is 107.5% of
       the targeted number of 3,529 families. The number of population in this region is
       - ,     individuals.




                                             39
   2    South Port Said plain: The number of the families is 3,346, which is 46.6% of
        the targeted number of 7,183 families (this is the lowest percent among the
        various project areas). The total population in this area is 17,221 individuals.
   3    Um El-Reesh region: The number of families is 2,002, which is 88.5% of the
        target. The total population in Um El-Reesh region is 7,476 individuals
        represented in 2002 families.
   4    South of Port Said: The number of families at South Port Said is 11,596 families
        consisting of 64,804 individuals. This is 106.5% of the target (10859 families).
   5    North Hussainia: The number of families at North Hussainia is 1,555, which is
        73.3% of the target ( , families). The total population in this area is 3,860
        individuals.
   6    El-Mataria: The number of families at El-Mataria region is 2,000 families, which
        is 100% of the target. The total population is 10,550 individuals.
Other findings of the study
       In addition, the study highlighted women's participation in the project, training
conducted under the project, and also reported results from the consultations with
beneficiaries.
       The project has done a great deal to incorporate gender issues into the project.
The project has promoted the participation of women in local organizations, something
which can be challenging within the context of rural Egypt. According to the study, 25-
30% of the WUA/WUU members are women, 35 % of CDA members are women, and
27% of CDA Board members are women. Women benefited greatly from the small
income generating activities of the project, and from the basic infrastructure services
(such as supply of drinking water).
Training under the project
        Training provided at the project in the fields of development, environment,
           research, and extension to men and women from 2001 through 2006.

Findings from consultations with male and female beneficiaries
       The study team met with 60 men and 40 women. The following were the main
opinions of the women and men concerning the benefits from the project.
 Opinions of women:
       ·  The project has lead to an improvement in key infrastructure, like drinking
          water and sanitation.
      · It increases women's awareness of small projects like poultry, rabbits and
          sewing ---etc.
      · It increases women's participation in the social aspects, such as participation
          on the boards of WUAs, WUUs and CDAs.
      · It helps women to increase their developmental and environmental awareness
          through the training programs established by the project.
      · It activates the women's role in the productive process in the family.
Opinions of men:
      · the infrastructure provided by the project leads to the improvement of yield
          per feddan and farm incomes.
      · It solved the problem of drainage and lead to the improvement in soil
          properties and yields at some areas.
      · According to the project's big role in the artificial insemination and veterinary
          services, it lead to the increase of the number of livestock.
      · It has had a big role to inform the farmers of modern agricultural technology,
          such as laser leveling, deep plowing, and using high productivity seeds
          through demonstration fields.
      · The projects' activities have helped to increase the rate of habitation in the
          area.
      · The project has helped to solve the bottleneck problems of drainage,
          irrigation, drinking water and sewage.
        While the project has provided many infrastructure and other services, it was not
designed to cover all the needs of the project area. Men and women interviewed outlined
the following problems remaining in some areas:
   Problems of Women:
       1. The absence of specialized health care for women and families.
       2. The lack of female rural guides to handle the awareness process and to
          demonstrate the possible roles of women.
       3. The lack of market places and daily goods, especially bread which is often
          obtained through shopping in nearby towns, villages or the central markets.
       4. Non-availability of crèches in some villages of the project.
       5. The weakness of women's role to integrate into the public action.
       6. In some villages, lack of small projects directed to women and consequently
          her weak productive role within the family.
   Problems for men:
       1. Non-availability of irrigation water at the end of canals, especially the remote
          villages from the main canal such as El-Noras, El-Etehad and El-Amany.


                                           41
     2. The high price of production inputs, especially the fertilizers.
     3. Lack of government funding sources at the project area.
     4. Irrigation canals and drainage at some villages are not cleaned. This matter
        has a negative effect on the agricultural process.
     5. Lack of veterinary care for some regions and the consequent high cost of
        livestock and poultry at the project area.
     6. Increase in prices of agricultural labor, which adds another financial burden
        on farmers.
Common problems among men and women:
     1. Lack of adequate housing for the current (size of ) households and the re-
        construction of housing to accommodate the current size of the family are
        considered another financial burden.
     2. Large distance between houses and agricultural land is a major problem
     3. Lack of means of transportation especially in the evening.
     4. Non-completion of educational service (after the preparatory phase like the
        secondary schools of commerce, apprenticeship, and public) adds another
        burden on the family.
     5. Lack of entertainment and culture places leads to educational and
        psychological problems.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's Comments on Draft ICR

Comments on Draft ICR, by Dr: Mahmoud Hassan El-Kholy, Executive Director,
East Delta Agricultural Services Project

We believe that performance rating given by ICR team as "Moderately Unsatisfactory"
did not truly reflect the actual effort done. Basis given for this rating is dividing the
project implementation period into two periods were unfair, because pre-restructuring
period continued for less than 4 years with rating as "Moderately Unsatisfactory", and
post-restructuring continued for more than 7 years with rating as "Moderately
Satisfactory".

On the other hand, project implementation has been affected by numerous issues and
problems since its effectiveness in January 25, 1999 which could take any project to its
closing, but sound insight by the Bank and the project team in dealing with these issues
resulted in reaching the project its objectives positively. So the lengthy implementation
period was a necessary need to accomplish this project in order not to waste the sunk
costs disbursed to develop the larger new lands development scheme that EDASP is one
of its part. Accordingly, the Bank and the project team deserve a rating of "Moderately
Satisfactory" as long as the project achieved its development objectives as shown in your
comprehensive details of ICR.

We suggest that the project implementation period be divided into four distinct periods,
as follows:
 1- First Period ­ Pre-Restructuring Period, which started from January 25, 1999 to
     November 14, 2002, giving 3 years, 9 month and 20 days.
 2- Second Period - Post- Restructuring Period till Disbursement Suspension,
     which started from November 15, 2002 to March 25, 2005, giving 2 years, 4 months
     and 11 days.
 3- Third Period - Disbursement Suspension Period, which started from March 26,
     2005 to November 30, 2005, giving 8 months and 5 days.
 4- Fourth Period ­ Post- Disbursement Suspension Period, which started from
     December 1, 2005 to December 31, 2009, giving 4 years and 1 month.

Therefore, the fair rating for each period and the overall rating can be summarized in the
table below:

                                  Second                            Fourth
                First Period                     Third Period                    Overall Rating
                                  Period                            Period

Find below our justifications for each rating in details:

1- Outcomes Rating: the rating given as "Moderately Unsatisfactory" does not agree
   with your findings under Clause 3- Assessments of Outcomes. The following
   achievements raised under this clause were as follow: (a) Relevance of Objective,
   Design and Implementation, the project objectives remain highly relevant within the
   overall context of the MALR's Strategy of Sustainable agricultural Development, and
   is also in line with the Bank's objectives in the agriculture sector (b) Achievement of
   Project Development Objectives, the main objective of the project for facilitating the
   settlement of the number families was 87% of the revised target, target of farmers
   adopting improved technologies has been surpassed by 32%, annual increase in
   agricultural production has been surpassed the target by different ratios, net benefits
   from typical 5 fed increased by 2 fold than the level estimated at appraisal.
2- Bank Performance Rating: in spite of the Bank performance is considered as
   Moderately Unsatisfactory in ensuring the quality at entry period, the Bank
   implementation team was able to address the critical issues and problems that
   affecting progress and worked closely with PMU to accomplish the project's
   objectives during the remaining years of the project.
3- Borrower Performance Rating: In spite of the borrower performance was
   moderately unsatisfactory during the earlier stages of implementation due to the
   shortage of irrigation and drainage in the project area, however they quickly
   responded to the Bank's recommendations for restructuring the project. As of the
   time of restructuring process except disbursement suspension period, they took the
   leadership in coordinating other Ministries and outside agencies to undertake works
   under the restructured project, and their own implementing departments with high
   efficiency to sustain the project development objectives.

In the light of above, we would like to take our clarifications into consideration to the
final report.

In this occasion, we would like to express our appreciation to the World Bank as a whole
and special gratitude to ICR team for their cooperation and support

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments received from Dr. Mohamed El-Eraki, IFAD Representative in Egypt:

The ICR team has done a commendable job. We agree to a large extent with the
approach and conclusions of the ICR document. The only reservation we have is the
overall outcome rating. The project has accomplished its development objectives with
great success in spite of poor design, delayed effectiveness, investigation and suspension.
Yes the development objectives have been realized five years later than planned but most
of the original targets have been significantly surpassed. For example, the economic rate
of return based on actual data is more than 100% while its ex ante estimates were 33 % at
appraisal and 22 % at MTR. Also, it should be noted that the ERR estimate did not
account for expected benefits from drinking water and sanitation facilities among others.
In addition, we think that project services are likely to be sustained over time. The
establishment of Port Said Agricultural Research Station, the Extension Information
Center and the Soil and Water Testing Lab are all steps in the right direction.

The idea of dividing the project implementation period into two distinct periods is quite
justifiable. Starting from 2006 onward the quality of supervision and project
implementation has improved remarkably, and this is reflected in the ratings. But the
overall outcome rating in my view should be upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.
