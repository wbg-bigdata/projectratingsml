PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Integrated
Cotton Development Project, for which Credit 610-IN in the amount of
US$18.0 million was  approved  on  January  27,  1976.    The credit became
effective on November 30, 1976 and was closed on March 31, 1984, two years
and three months later than scheduled; an unused balance of US$6,383.33 was
cancelled. The date of final disbursement was March 11, 1985.
The PCR was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of
India. The Evaluation Summary, prepared by Asia Region Staff, is based on
the PCR: the Staff Appraisal Report, President's Report, Development Credit
Agreement, and on supervision mission reports. There has been no follow-on
project.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments and they are attached
to the Report (Annexes 1 and 2).

INDIA
INTECRATED COTTON DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 610-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        India plants about 24% of the world's cotton area (1983) but
produces about 8% of world output. The area under cotton has remained almoet
constant being 7.5 million ha du-ing 1954-55, 8.4 million ha during 1964-55,
and again 7.5 million ha during appraisal year 1974-75. Productivity
increased from the very low level of 100 kg lint per ha to 161 kg per ha
during the same period, however even that yield was very low. The Government
of India was very keen to improve productivity of cotton to meet local needs,
and also to improve the incomes of about 13 million farm families engaged in
cotton production in India. With this broad objective in view the integrated
cotton development project was taken up in three representative Indian -otton
growing areas.
Objectives
2.        The project was designed to develop and demonstrate to the rarmers
the practical means of increasing cotton yields, and also to improve the by-
product recovery from ginning and cotton seed pressing.  It iniolved:
(a) Accelerated research to breed more suitable and higher yielding
cotton varieties and develop improved cultural practices.  Super-
vised by ICAR, the research was to be executed by the respective
L                atate agricultural universities of Punjab, Haryana and Maharashtra
and directed to evolve varieties which were tolerant to pests and
suitable for the multiple cropping areas of northern India and
rainfed areas of Maharashtra and other regions. The universities
were also to produce breeder and foundation seed.
(b) Improved cotton production facilities for the 120,000 cotton growers
in the project area including the use of good quality seed, and more
intensive insect and disease control, through the strengthened
extension service (Cotton Development Service).
(c) Modernization and improvement of existing facilities and new units
in the ginning and seed processing sectors through financing
replacement saws for existing saw gins, precleaners for existing
roller gins and new gins and presses. Cotton seed processing
facilities in Amraoti and Sirsa areas would be augmented to process
the 150,000 tons of cottonseed then fed to livestock.



-v -
(d)  Provision of seasonal production credit through the Agricultural
Refinance and Development Corporation to meet the credit needs for
increased use of inputs including certified seed and pest control
operations.
(e)  Technical assistance and training for all levels of staff in each
project component.
Implementation Experience
3.        Project Phasing.  Although the project was formulated after a
detailed survey of the country and wide ranging discussions were held lasting
almost 2 years with people involved in all sectors of cotton economy
(development, research, farmers, traders, processors and financial
institutions), the PCR finds that the project formulation underestimated the
magnitude of adn nistrative and procedural problems related to staff postings,
import licenses, release of foreign exchange, and other factors such as
shortages of critical construction inpits like cement. Project implementation
was therefore slow to begin and fell behind appraisal targets, resulting in
the project period being extended by two years and thrae months so as to
complete the civil works and machinery installation.
4.        Financial.  Project costs during implementation amounted to Rs 337
million against the appraisal estimate of Rs 288 million. In fact, it would
have been still higher if the states of Punjab and Harayana had charged the
project with expenditure on pest control aerial spraying over a gross area of
0.62 million ha during 1976 to 1983. This cost was met out of the Government
budget and was debited to farmers as short term (taccavi) loans which were not
reimbursed as they carried lower rates of interest than the one specified in
the Credit Agreement. Delays in implementation and cost escalations for the
ginning and processing machinery were the main factors contributing to cost
overruns.
Organization and Management
5.        The comp.exity of the project required a considerable degree of
coordination between government ministries and participating agencies both at
the national and state levels. A Project Coordination Committee was set up by
the Ministry of Agriculture at the national level. The States set up project
management committees at the state level and in the project areas. These
committees functioned quite satisfactorily in the beginning and facilitated
project implementation. The national level committee would have benefitted
and monitored implementation more effectively if it had been provided with
stronger secretarial support. The cotton research component was supervised by
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and implemented by the
Harayana Agricultural University, Punjab Agricultural University, three State
Agricultural Universities of Maharashtra, and Cotton Technological Research
Laboratory Bombay. The research component was implemented satisfactorily and
additional facilities comprising laboratories and equipment for future cotton
research both under irrigated and rainfed research were created. A large
volume of breeding material has been generated for future use. The Agricul-
tural Refinance and Development Corporation provided effective support to the
credit component.

Agricultural Performance
6.        Cotton Research.  Clearly defined tasks of cotton breeding, on-farm
testing and training of scientists and extension workers were formulated and
implemented. In the irrigated north zone cotton belt of Punjab and Harayana,
new improved medium staple varieties were popularized, basides evolving
promising cultures for future exploitation. Three new varieties of short
staple were developed and released in Harayana (1) and Punjab (2). Similarly
a number of new improved varieties were introduced/developed in Maharashtra
State. A number of new agronomic low cost- high benefit techniques were field
tested and introduced both in the irrigated and rainfed areas.
7.        Training.  Four scientists were deputed for post graduate studies
(Ph.D program) in the USA, whilst 17 scientists and development officers were
sent for study tours to the Sudan and USA, and large numbers of short training
courses were organized locally by the participating research institutions.
8.        Cotton Development Service.  The cotton development service was
organized in the project areas to educate farmers in the latest cotton
cultivation technologies, help procure inputs and organize pest control
operations. Except in Maharashtra, the staff strength actually provided in
the field was less than proposed in the SAR.
9.        As required under of the project, the indian Institute of
Management, Ahmedabad evaluated the research/development component. The
evaluation report concluded that the cotton productivity in the project area
had increased faster cotupared to the control area.
10.       Seasonal Credit-Fund.  ARDC prepared detailed procedures for the
operation of the Fund. In the initital years this component did not work
satisfactorily because of such reasons as cantral cooperative banks being
unable to utilize resources because of poor recovery of previously advanced
loans, insistence on mortgage of land as security by commercial banks being
unacceptable to the farmers. The level of disbursements improved during the
later years of the credit, i.e., from 1980 onwards.
11.       Term Loan.  The project provided to the Maharashtra and Harayana
components, facilities for replacement of gin saws, precleaners, roller gins,
high capacity saw gins and processors, as well as expeller cum solvent
extraction plants. Actual utilization was higher than SAR expectations, but
usage was limited mainly to high speed saw gins and for seed processing. No
factory owners came forward to improve roller gins.
12.       No information is available on the progress of recoveries of the
loans advanced under the seasonal credit fund and term loans and the PCR
analysis is weak in this respect. Project supervision should have given
pointed attention to this aspect.
Rates of Return
13.       At appraisal the economic rates of return for the different
components were calculated at 10% for cotton ginneries, 34% for cottons seed



- vii -
processing and more than 1001 for cotton growers, Cotton Development Service,
Research and Seasonal credit. The overall project rate of return was
infinity. The PCR has not calculated the ERR for the entire project. With
significant increase in production (para. 15), it is realistic to expect that
the revised ERR for the project wo-ild still remain high. However, with lower
benefits from the processing component, because of deiays and lower capacity
utilization, the overall ERR would be significantly lower than the rate (1002)
completed at appraisal. The net benefits from investments made on Cotton
Development Service, Research and Short-term credit in Harayana and Punjab
show a rate of return higher than 100l. The per hectare yields of cotton in
the project area in the year 1982-83 increased to 1600 kg (900 kg pre-project)
in Sirsa, Harayana, 2,000 kg (1,250 kg preproject) in Faridkot, Punjab, and
560 kg (32 kg preproject) in Amraoti, Maharashtra. In the intervening project
years, the yields fluctuated but at levels higher than the preproject
period.  The yields adjusted to seasonal variations on the basis of trend
equation, are quite close to SAR yield levels.
14.       The PCR has not calculated the net benefits from investments made in
ginneries and cottonseed processing plants. Seven units comprising three
ginneries (Harayana), three seed processing complexes (two in Harayana, one in
Maharashtra) and one solvent extraction plant (Harayana) were established.
Most of these units were completed clos-e to project completion. Even the
units (e.g., two ginneries in Harayana) which were completed in early 1981,
only functioned for a short-period up to project closing, due co power
shortages.
15.       The SAR assumed that total additional cotton production would reach
106,000 tons, however, the actual additional production was 154,000 tons
annually. This represents a saving in imports valued at Rs 857.5 million at
1983-84 domestic ptices. The cotton seed processing unit, when working at
full capacity, can convert 100,000 tons of cotton seed into high valued by-
products.
Sustainability
16.       The PCR does not comment on the project's sustainability.
Nevertheless it can be concluded that the agronomic aspects of the project
were successfully completed and additional farmers will replicate and sustain
higher yields in future. The Cotton Development Service established in the
project area has become part of the reformed axtension system and the research
component is now part of the overall research organization of the States.
Improved technologies and already strengthened extension services will
continue to assist farmers to improve cotton productivity and incomes.
windings and Lessons
17.       Although project completion was delayed, the project objective of
increasing cotton yields through strengthened research, extension and credit
support was achieved.
18.       The establishment of ginneries and cottonseed processing plants was
delayed for a variety of reasons (lengthy procedures for obtaining licenses,



- viii -
foreign exchange and undertaking procurement, shortages of cement, etc.) and
the capacity utilization was low because of power supply shortages. According
to the PCR these initial problems have now been overcome and these units are
expected to work satisfactorily. However, it is too early yet to comment on
their performance.
19.       SLrong commitment from Government and effective management and
coordination of essential project components activities are basic conditions
for the success of a complex project. Full time officers in key positions are
essential for solving interagency problems during implementation.
20.       As this multi-component project involved a number of agencies, it is
considered that the SAR was optimistic in projecting the time it would take to
implement the components; recruit the staff, procure and establish the cotton
ginning and processing units, and establish, and agree on, the norms and
procedures for credit disbursement.



INDIA
INTEGRATED COTTON DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (CREDIT 610-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1       The Integrated Cotton Development Project was identified in
October/November 1972; pre-appraised in February 1973; appraised in
March/April 1974; reviewed (Punjab component) in October 1975; negotiated with
the Bank in November/December 1975; signed on February 26, 1976; became
effective on November 30, 1976 and closed on March 31, 1984.
1.2       At the time of identification of this Project, it was observed tha
the main problems in cotton production and processing in India were: (i) area
planted, yield and output had been relatively stagnant for the past ten years;
(ii) staple lengths produced were not in balance with the requirements of the
market; (iii) the low yields were due to poor quality seed, failure to control
insects, and ineffective cultural practices; (iv) ginning facilities were slow
and inefficient; (v) less than half the cottonseed produced was crushed, and
much of it so poorly that the products had a low market value.
1.3       This project was, therefore, designed to pioneer key improvements in
three representative Indian cotton-growing areas, one each in Haryana and
Punjab (irrigated) and one in Maharashtra (rainfed). The total area involved
was 183,000 ha, about 2% of India's total planted cotton area.
II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, APPRAISAL AND OBJECTIVES
Identification and Appraisal
2.1       A six-member, preappraisal (Identification) mission consisting of
Mr. Frank Lowenstein (Mission Leader), Mr. C. Von Wallenberg (Financial
Analyst), Dr. H.L. Manning (Consultant-Cotton Production), Mr. J. Boer
(Consultant-Cotton Manufacturing), Mr. R. Baker (Consultant-Cotton Ginning),
Mr. A. Smith (Consultant-Cotton Seed Crushing) arrived in the country on
February 4, 1973. The Mission identified an Integrated Cotton Development
Project in the State of Maharashtra (rainfed area in Amravati district) and
Haryana (irrigated area in Hissar/Sirsa district), covering an area of 1.5 to
2.0 million ha. The Project was appraised in March/April 1974 by appraisal
mission consisting of M/s. D.D. Brown (Leader), A. Seager and C. Von
Wallenberg (IDA), and K. Anthony (Consultant) visited India in April/May
1975. Later on, Government of India decided to include into the project
proposal a small irrigated unit in Punjab also, which component was reviewed
by M/s. D.D. Brown and G. Stern in October 1975. The Project was negotiated
with the World Bank from November 24 to December 2, 1975; signed on February
26, 1976 and became effective on November 30, 1976.

Project Objectives
2.2       The project was developed to demonstrate pra-tical and effective
means of increasing cotton yields and maximizing by-product recovery from
ginning and cottonseed processing. It involved: (i) accelerated research to
breed more suitable and higher-yielding cotton varieties; (ii) provision of
improved seed and more intensive insect and disease control services;
(iii) modernization and expansion of ginning and cottonseed processing;
(iv) provision of revolving fund for incremental seasonal credit to growers;
and (v) training programs.
Project Description
2.3       The project was implemented over an area of 183,000 ha in the states
of Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra. In Haryana it comprised a compact region
of 110,000 ha of irrigated cottons in the Sirsa/Hissar districts. This area
was spread in 350 villages. The area is irrigated from the Bhakra Dam
Irrigation and Power Complex. The cotton is planted in the month of May-June
and picked up in November-December. The cotton yield at the time of imple-
mentation of this project was about 900 kg per ha of kapas. In Punjab, only
an area of 23,000 ha was taken up in Muktsar Block of Faridkot district. This
is irrigated from canal and tubewells. The yield at the time of inception of
this project was 1,250 kg per ha of kapas. In Maharashtra, the area selected
under the project was Amravati district which was entirely rainfed. The
cotton yield at the time of initiation of this project was only 320 kg per ha
of kapas. The yields depended more on the rainfall and its intensity. The
soils are medium to heavy black clays.
2.4       To ensure the success of the project the Government of India
(Ministry of Agriculture) had set up a Project Coordination Committee, which
was responsible for project coordination/execution; help State
Governments/Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in the execution of
the project; finalize plans for short-term study ours by Research and Develop-
ment Officers; monitor progress of seasonal credit fund and cotton seed
processing facilities. The State Governments of Haryana, Punjab and
Maharashtra had also set up Project Management Committees at State level and
in the project areas.
2.5       The Project had the components of:  (i) Cotton Research; (ii)
Provision of seasonal credit funds to the cotton growers; (iii) Creation of
ginning and processing facilities; and (iv) Cotton Development Service. The
cotton research component was supervised by the Indian Council of Agricultural
Research and executed by the Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), Hissar,
Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, Punjabrao Krishi Vidhyapeeth
(PKV), Akola, Marathwada Agricultural University (MAU), Parbhani, Mahatma
Phule Agricultural University (MPAU), Rahuri and Cotton Technological Research
Laboratory (CTRL), Bombay. The Agricultural Re-finance Development Corpora-
tion (ARDC), now designated as National Bank for Agricultural and Rural
Development (NABARD), was responsible for preparing plans and financing
seasonal credit funds and the creation of ginning and processing facilities.
For improving cotton production facilities, the existing extension service in
the States was strengthened through the formation of a Cotton Development



Service (CDS) in each project area and intensified training was given to the
staff on various aspects of dotton production. The CDS was responsible to
provide growers with advice on cultivation practices, plant protection
services against insects and diseases and in marketing of kapas. The cotton
seed processing facilities in Haryana and Maharasbt.ra were augmented by the
installation of new processing complexes.
2.6       The estimated cost of the project was US$36.0 million out of which
the IDA credit was US$18.0 million. The cost estimated and IDA credit
financing were as follows:

;                3.17      A survey of 374 farmers (195 contact + 179 noncontact) with regard
to adoption of recommended practices revealed that majority of the farmers had
adopted practices like sowing of recommended varieties, using optimum seed
rate, following irrigation schedule and interculture operations. Uowever,
they were not using recommended quantity o4 fertilizers and taking plant
protection measures because these involved financial investments. This was
evident from the following table:

of the area. In the case of fertilizer use also, with the dose of 80 kg
nitrogen per ha., the maximum area covered could be only 98,000 ha as against
the total area cove:age of 122,000 ha. During 1982-83, special plant
protection squads were organized, each equipped with a van, a mechanic, 10
spray pumps and insecticides to help cotton growers in ground spraying
operation. Such a service if continued would serve a very useful purpose.
3.20      As against the provision of Rs 11.022 millions the expenditure on
CDS was Rs 14.050 millions.
3.21      CDS in Punjab.  The selected area in Punjab was Muktsar block in
Faridokot district. The area was spread over 85 villages involving 14,000
growers.  The Punjab State had also constituted a Project Management Committee
at State level and a Project Area Committee at the district level. The Joint
Director Agriculture, at state headquarters acted as Project Coordinator for
this project. The physical achievements of various components in the project
areas were as follows:

3.22      A look at the physical achievements made revealed that the certified
seed distribution increased from 38 tons in 1976-77 to 90 tons in 1977-78. In
1978-79 there was no certified seed distribution in the project area. in
1979-80 it was the maximum, at a level of 145 tons and later on the position
with regard tc the distribution of certified seed deteriorated. The
fertilizer consumption on the other hand increased tremendously. Use of
nitrogen.ous fertilizers almost doubled and that of phosphatics increased by
three times. The yield also increased from 1,400 kg in 1976-77 to 2,010 kg
per ha in 1982-83.
3.23      The CDS was also involved in training the farmers, seed treatment,
fumigating the seeds in factories for the control of pink ball worm and also
delinting the cotton seeds. The progress achieved under these components was
as follows:

3.24      CDS in Maharashtra:  In Maharashtra the State Government selected
Achalpur and Chandur Bazar revenue circles of Amravati district for locating a
rainfed unit of 50,000 ha as project area. The State Government had set up a
Project Management Committee at the State level and Project Area Committee at
the district level to implement the project. The organizational strength in
the project area in 1981-82 was 255 as against 223 as per IDA appraisal
report. However, the number of development officers and field assistants was
less. The increased strength was on account of positioning of 100 scouts in
the years 1979-80 to 1981-82 to monitor the plant protection operations.
3.25      The physical achievements of various components under the project
area were as follows:

3.26      The distribution of improved seed increased from 139 tons in 1976-77
to 520 tons during 1982-83.  The introduction of pest scouting system
certainly helped in reducing the number of sprays undertaken by the farmers.
The yield increased from 469 kg per ha in 1976-77 to 651 kg in 1981-82.
3.27      The total expenditure on CDS was Rs 11.476 millions as against the
provision of Rs 7.891 million.
Seasonal Credit Fund (SCF)
3.28      The project provided for the supply of short-term seasonal credit
for financing project inputs. ARDC extended refinance for short-term credit,
on the lines of the terms and conditions on which it was being provided by
Reserve Bank of India to cooperatives. Based upon the guidelines framed by
Reserve Bank of India for sanction of limits for seasonable agricultural
operations, ARDC prepared a detailed procedure for operation of seasonal
credit fund and circulated the same among the participating banks. In
December 1975, the ARDC set up a Seasonal Credit Fund for providing refinance
to participating banks for onlending to cotton growers in the identified
project areas for incremental inputs. In February 1976, it prepared detailed
guidelines for preparation of credit plans for seasonal credit fund. It also
prescribed the set of documents and finalized banking plans in consultation
with the State Governments and participating banks every year and also the
lending targets. Credit requirements for seasonal credit were worked out on
the basis of the coverage of area, the varieties of improved cotton to be
grown, as recommended by State Governments, and the scales of finance fixed
for each variety. In view of the fact that all the cotton growers of the
project areas were not the members of Primary Agricultural Credit Societies
(PACSS), co-mercial banks were required to lend to the nonmembers, and State



- 19 -
Government Departments and Project Officers were required to extend necessary
assistance to commercial bankis. The banking plan indicating the allocation of
physical and financial program for cooperative and commercial banks was
finalized in the month of December every year. While allocating the program
among participating banks, concerned State Governments, Project implementing
authorities and Reserve Bank of India were consulted by ARDC and separate
short-term credit limits for cotton were sanctioned every year.
3.29      The data relating to sanction of seasonal credit limits by National
Bank, disbursement of funds by participating banks and refinance disbursed by
ARDC during 1976-77 to 1983-84 are shown in Annex Tables 1 to 4. The data
indicate that the performance of financing banks in terms of disbursements
made and refinance availed of by them under seasonal credit was not
satisfactory in the initial period; the response of State Cooperative Banks
and Commercial Banks was found to be inadequate. The main reasons for poor
disbursement in the initial years pertained to delays in selection of project
areas, approval of varieties of cotton and scales of finance, inability of
District Central Cooperative Banks to draw the limits due to unsatisfactory
recovery position, nonobservance of seasonality discipline, besides comfort-
able resource position of State Cooperative Banks, particularly in
Maharashtra. In the case of Punjab and Haryana aerial spraying of pesticides
done by the respective State Governments financed from their own budgetary
resources resulted in a reduction in the flow of credit for pesticides, which
invariably was the major component in the crop loan for cotton. Further, some
of the cotton growers used less than the recommended quantity of fertilizers
and pesticides and this resulted in lower credit needs. Some of the farmers
preferred to use their own resources for cotton cultivation. The studies con-
ducted by the ARDC also revealed that commercial banks were not in a position
to effectively participate in the project due to poor branch network in the
area and inadequate field staff to supervise the loans as also on account of
scattered lending. Insistence on mortgage of land as security for the loan by
commercial banks was not acceptable to the cotton growers.
3.30      With the extension in implementation period from December 31, 1981
to December 31, 1983, disbursements under seasonal credit fund showed
considerable improvement from the year 1980-81 onwards. The Haryana State
Cooperative Bank was the largest recipient of ARDC refinance under the
seasonal loan account category, while the disbursement to the Punjab State
Cooperative Bank was modest. In the case of Maharashtra, the disbursements
were very poor due to high level of overdues of Amravati District Central
Cooperative Bank. To meet the requirements of cotton growers, Maharashtra
State Cooperative Bank released funds from its own sources without availing of
refinance facilities from ARDC, which was possible due to its comfortable
resources position. Though credit limits were sanctioned to the Maharashtra
State Cooperative Bank for the project area right from 1976-77 to 1979-80 no
drawer was effected on the limits in view of the reasons explained earlier.
3.31      The disbursements made by participating banks increased from Rs 7.5
million (M) in 1976-77 to Rs 61.3 M in 1979-80 and thereafter reached the peak
level of Rs 95.5 M in 1982-83. The overall shape of cooperative banks ranged
between 77Z and 85Z of the total funds disbursed by the participating banks in
different years (Annex 1). The performance of participating banks has been
analyzed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.

3.32      Cooperative Banks:  The District Central Cooperative Banks were gen-
erally the major drawers of short-term credit for agriculture under ICDP. The
short-term cooperative structure in Haryana and Punjab provided substantial
quantum of seasonal credit and the refinance assistance availed of by them
reached the maximum in the year 1982-83. However, the same tempo could not be
maintained in the year 1983-84. The particulars of disbursements made by
cooperative banks in Haryana, Punjab and Maharashtra are tabulated below:

3.33      Commercial Banks:  In all, ten commercial banks participated in the
project area. The disbursements by commercial banks for financing seasonal
credit requirements of cotton growers increased from Rs 1.25 M in 1976-77 to
Rs 16.33 M in 1981-82. However, in relative terms the commercial banks played
a minor role as their share in the total disbursements in all the three States
varied from 15% to 231 among different years. Because of the thin spread of
branches, commercial banks were not able to make much headway in the project
area in Maharashtra. The dominance of cooperatives in the States of Punjab
and Haryana made it difficult for the commercial banks in showing a better
performance. The particulars of seasonal credit disbursements made by commer-
cial banks are given below:

3.34      Refinance assistance against short-term loans provided by ARDC
diuring the project period in the three States are indicated in Annex Tables 2
to 5. The State-wise performance of participating banks is reviewed in the
following paragraphs.
3.35      During the project period, Haryana State Cooperative Bank and the
District Central Cooperative Bank of Sirsa and Hissar, and nine commercial
banks participated in the program. Cooperative banks played a more dynamic
role in the project area in financing seasonal credit. Since the Cooperative
Banks were already engaged in providing finance for seasonal credit for agri-
cultural crops they had no difficulty in participating in the project
effectively. The credit limits sanctioned to Cooperative Banks increased from
Rs 9.00 M in 1976-77 to Rs 45.00 M in 1979-80 and thereafter reached the high-
est level of Rs 75.00 M in the year 1982-83. Short-term credit limits
sanctioned to commercial banks in Haryana were around 10% of the total credit
limits sanctioned by ARDC. The absolute amount of refinance drawn by commer-
cial banks increased from Rs 0.301 M in 1976 to Rs 6.75 M in 1981-82.
3.36      Punjab:  Faridkot District Central Cooperative Bank and seven
Commercial Banks participated in Muktsar Block. Its disbursement reached the
maximum level of Rs 10.149 M in 1982-83 from the modest level of Rs 2.613 M in
1976-77. The increased disbursement was on account of introduction of
improved system of sanction of credit limits and disbursements to the members
of the societies. The members were issued passbooks and checks to draw loan
subject to the credit limit indicated in the passbook. Commercial Banks' dis-
bursements ranged between Rs 0.892 M in 1976-77 and Rs 4.683 M in 1981-82.
Refinance drawn by commercial banks was nearly 50% of credit limits sanctioned
to them, whereas the Cooperative Banks availed 90% of credit limits sanctioned
to them. The oA'erall disbursements by participating banks in Punjab attained
the maximum level of Rs 13.88 M in 1983-84. The refinance drawn by
participating banks was Rs 12.499 M in 1983-84.

iI
3.37      Maharashtra:  In Maharashtra, Amravati District Central Cooperative
Bank and four commercial banks were identified as participating banks. Though
credit limits were sanctioned to the State/District Central Cooperative Bank
it could not avail of refinance assistance from ARDC for various reasons.
While on one hand the comfortable financial position of State Cooperative Bank
reduced the need for refinance, the unsatisfactory overdues position of
Amaravati District Central Cooperative Bank and noncompliance of seasonality
discipline ruled out, on the other hand, the possibility of availment of
refinance. In the year 1978-79, the Government of Maharashtra declared
Amravati affected by drought, and recovery of short-term dues was postponed.
Despite these difficulties, Amaravati District Central Cooperative Bank
disbursed funds to the extent of Rs 2.73 M, Rs 4.4 M and Rs 3.08 M in the
years 1976-77, 1977-78 and 1978-79 respectively. Its disbursements reached
the highest level of Rs 5.5 M in the year 1980-81, which was less than the
'basic level' fixed for the District Central Cooperative Bank. Participation
of commercial banks in the project was very modest until 1979-80. However,
the level of disbursement increased from next year and reached a maximum of Rs
4.62 M in 1982-83. The commercial banks in Maharashtra were reluctant to
participate in the project due to low priority accorded by the State
Government in regard to recovery of their dues under monopoly procurement
scheme and insistence of levying a guarantee fee of 12Z.
3.38      The total reimbursement claimed from IDA under SCF component was to
the extent of Rs 63.62 M. The year-wise and State-wise particulars of claims
lodged by National Bank with Government of India/World Bank were as follows:

Term Loan
3.39      Tne project envisaged provision of term credit for making improve-
ments in existing ginnery and cotton seed processing units and for setting up
new ginne-y and seed processing units in the project area in the States of
Haryana and Maharashtra. In the case of Maharashtra, the project area for
this component was extended in August 1980 to cover the entire State. The
main objective in incorporating these items in the project was to introduce
practical and effective means of improving the quality of lint-produced and
ensuring better by-product recovery. The components envisaged for financing
under the project and actual achievements thereof are compared below:

3.40      Against the provision of Rs 101,656 M, Haryana and Maharashtra
together had utilized Rs 159:775 M towards procassing components. With regard
to modernization and augmentation of roller gins practically no progress was
made as the factory owners did not show any interest due to lack of price
incentive for a clean gin product.
3.41      High capacity saw gins and cotton seed processing plants established
in Haryana and Maharashtra are as under:
(a) Haryana
(i) High capacity ginneries at Ding, Ratia and Bhattukalan;
(ii) Cotton seed crushing cum solvent extraction units at Ding and

disbursement in respect of Maharashtra aggregated to Rs 41.098 M leaving a gap
of Rs 4.994 M. The gap was attributable to nonavailment of bank finanLe by
the implementing agency namely Maharashtra State Oilseeds, Industrial and

3.47      Against project provision of Rs. 288.0 M, expenditure reported was
Rs. 337.0 M. In fact, it could be still higher, had Haryana and Punjab booked
expenditure incurred on aerial spraying under which the two states together
covered gross area of 0.62 M ha during 1976 to 1983-84. Two states have been
undertaking aerial spraying of cotton on Government account and debiting the
entire cost as short-term (taccavi) loan which was not reimbursed as taccavi
loan carries lesser rate of interest, 8X or so, than the specified IDA rate of
interest of 11X.



- 28 -
1.48      Main reason for exzcess expenditure is that where as stipulated
project duration was 1976-77lto 1980-81, it was extended first up to end-
December, 1983 and then up to March 31, 1984. Another reason for increased
cost has been steep price escalation, particularly in the case of processing
components. Of three ginneries established by HAFED, third ginnery set up at
Bhattukaian alone costs Rs. 10.022 M, whereas other two ginneries costs Rs.
12.152 M established in the earlier years of the project. Similarly, cotton
seed processing plant setup at Ratia later in the project costs Rs. 43.412 M,
as against the one set up earlier at Ding at a cost of Rs. 23.264 M.
3.49      The component-wise details of the expenditure for the Universities
were as follows:

3.50      It will be evident from above that the Agricultural Universities
have established infrastructure and laboratories have been suitably equipped.
Agricultural Universities in Maharashtra, notably Akola University has set up
good seed production/processing facilities. Hissar Agricultural University
though has established good seed production unit at Sirsa, has no seed
processing facilities of its own though State Seed Development Corporation
under National Seed Project has set up a cotton seed processing plant at
Sirsa. Punjab University, unfortunately, has yet to set up a good seed
production/processing unit.
3.51      Under the Cotton Development Service, civil works were undertaken
and equipment purchased for plant protection purposes. The details of the
expenditure under CDS in the participating States were as follows:

3.52      Major shortfall in project provision utilization has been on
technical assistance component. Against provision of Rs. 7.2 M, utilization
is not more than Rs. 2.3 M, because ICAR opting for Indian consultants
resulted in savings of over Rs. 4.9 M. Also out of 12 advance degree fellow-
ships, only four were availed. The details of the expenditure incurred by
ICAR were as follows:

Project Financing
3.53      IDA was expected to finance 50% of the total project costs, i.e.
100% of the foreign exchange costs and about 21% of local costs.  The total
IDA credit was US$18.0 million and the remaining was to be met by the
participating state governments/agencies. Of the total IDA credit about 22%
would support the costs of research and CDS through government agencies and
78% would finance growers incremental credit needs (42%) for ginning and
processing (36Z).

Loan Allocation and Disbursement
3.54      The disbursement was slow in the beginning.  However, by the
extended closing date the credit amount was utilized in full except for a
small amount of US$6,383.0 which was cancelled. The category-wise total dis-
bursements under this project were as follows:

3.55      From the above table it will be observed that the IDA credit
utilization was almost 1001. The utilization for short-term loans and long-
term loans for SCF component and ginning and processing complexes exceeded the
original allocation, whilst for consultancy and training was below the
appraisal estimates.
IV. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND DEVELOPMENT
Project -Coordination
4.1       The Project Coordination Committee met regularly, twice yearly, not
as fragment as for SAR Schedule of once per month during early stages and at
least quartsrly later on. During 1983 it met only once and the last meeting
was held in March 1984. The Project Management Committee regularly monitored

implementation at the state level. Project Coordination Unit at the national
level was understaffed and therefore project monitoring was sometimes delayed.
4.2   Implementing Agencies.  The Indian Council of Agricultural Research,
concerned state agricultural universities, Cotton Technological Research
Laboratory, Bombay, Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation (now
NABARD), and State Agricultural Departments of Maharashtra, Haryana and Punjab
implemented the project.
4.3   The State Governments showed laxity in recruiting sufficient staff, in
particular key personnel like Cotton Development and Plant Protection Of-
ficers.1 Altho-.gh, Haryana Government appointed a Project Director and
positioned him in the project area, the Punjab and Maharashtra States desig-
nated Joint Directors working at their State headquarters, far way from the
project areas to supervise the project. The state Governments did not ensure
the production and distribution of required quantity of certified seed and
effective plant protection against pests.2 Various legislations though
enacted as required under the project, were not enforced.
Cotton Research
4.4   For strengthening research capability of agricultural universities, ICAR
gave financial support &s per its funding p-ctern for components like addi-
tional staff, laboratory equipment, etc. Universities have definitely
utilized this assistance. The ICAR engaged only local consultants for
advising research programs in the field of Breeding, Plant Protection and
Agronomy. The universities have not been able to produce superior medium
staple varieties with compact plant type. It is to the credit of foreign
consultants (M/s. Klattor and Sachs) who visited briefly, to introduce the
concept of pests scounting for need-based spray. Engagement of foreign
consultants might have infused new ideas in the project. ICAR also failed to
develop short-term consultancy in plant physiology, water management, seed
production, etc. Against the provision of twelve advance degree fellowships,
ICAR could utilize only four.
4.5   The installation of and operation of processing units remained behind
schedule. In the case of ginning and processing units in haryana, technical
aspects relating to the selection of press and size of saw gins caused some
1As indicated in the Borrower's comments attached as Annex 2, the Haryana
Government disagrees with this assessment, indicating that recruitment rates
could not be expected to exceed those likely to eventuate under existing
procedures and regulations.
2As conveyed in Annex 2, the Borrower observes that production and
distribution of certified seeds is largely a commercial venture and that
related sales are determined by market conditions.

delay in finalizing the banking arrangements. There was shortage of cement
and bricks especially during 1979-80 to 1981-82. Lack of experience on the
part of HAFED caused some delay in the finalization of tenders. the issue of
import license and granting of clearance for foreign exchange and of permis-
sion to open letter of credit against supervisory erection charges were
delayed. Nonavailability of electricity connections and lack of adequate
supply of expeller cakes for solvent extraction unit was faced at Amravati in
Maharashtra. There was low utilization of installed capacity of ginneries and
cotton seed processing units. The solvent extraction plant at Amravati was
operated at 30% of the installed capacity.
V. PROJECT IMPACT
5.1   ImPact of the Research Component on Cotton Production and Upgrading
BRearch: Besides providing the additional infrastructure for further speedy
progress in research, the following benefits have accrued:
(a)   Research facilities in five agricultural universities operating
for the benefit of the major cotton producing areas of the country
both under irrigated and rainfed conditions have ben improved for
intensifying multi-disciplinary research on field-oriented
problems.
(b)   Several improved medium staple varieties and hybrids and desi
cotton cultivars have been released and the recent production
figures show considerable rise in this staple category as also
short staple. A large volume of breeding material has also been
generated and from the pipeline of breeders, a number of them may
emerge soon as potential high-yielding varieties.
(c)   The large number of low cost or low cost high benefit technologies
having potential practical application for improving irrigated and
rainfed productivity have been evolved/identified, demonstrated
and popularized.
(d)   Efficiency of plant protection for cotton with reduced cost, low
pollution levels, balanced ecosystem, need-based integrated pest
management principle has been demonstrated for sustaining the
continued interest of the farmer in the cotton cultivation.
(e)   Adequate production of breeder and foundation seed of importance
varieties/hybrids was ensured.
(f)   Trained manpower, especially of scientific and development
officers was made available for propagating cotton production
technology.
(g)   Large awareness has been created among the various categories of
cotton development workers and , considerable band of cotton
growers in the three States by imparting training in modern
production and processing technologies and the impact will
accelerate further promotional efforts for increasing the produc-
tion and improving the quality of cotton.



- 33 -
(h)   The philosophy and approach of ICDP and the achievements
demonstrated have permeated into the cotton production systems in
other parts of the country.
(i)   It has been demonstrated that by growing the latest improved
varieties/hybrids and application of the modern recommended
package of practices, the yield can be improved in rainfed
arhoreem, rainfed hirutFum, rainfed hybrids and irrigated
varieties in these States by 100,150,200 and 250 kg lint/ha
respectively with reduced inputs, scientific approach and thus
achieve high cost benefit ratio.
5.2   Achievaments in Production Technologiea:
(a)   The optimum time of sowing, plant population and fertilizer dose
have been worked out for the newly recommended varieties in north
zone states of Punjab and Haryana and also the central zone
Maharashtra.
(b)   Skip row planting was demonstrated to be profitable and ad-
vantageous than solid planting for saving irrigation water, but
solid planting was superior in yield.
(c)   Use of gramaxone and Diuron at appropriate doses controlled the
weed flora in the irrigated areas of Haryana.
(d)   In addition, the advantage of legume cotton rotation, use of
defoliants like MSMA, Bolls eye and Paraquat to check excessive
growth and maturity, proper scheduling of irrigation, use of slow
release nitrogen fertilizers, role of zinc application, nutrition
requirements for various rotation systems, skip row furrow
irrigation, use of cycocel for flowering control, etc. have been
identified for the irrigated cotton in Haryana and Punjab.
(e)   In the predominant rainfed cotton state of Maharashtra, the
research at the three agricultural universities on response of
modern varieties to higher plant population and nitrogen levels
was able to demonstrate that the higher population and up to 50 kg
N/ha improved the productivity considerably.
(f)   By sowing in optimum time on ridges and furrows system in Vidarbha
and also using the contour gradient technique, higher yields of
seed cotton and better moisture conservation/rain water management
could be ensured.
(g)   The crow bar technique for planting rainfed hybrid cotton crop was
demonstrated to yield sizeable (up to 20%) increased yields. This
is helpful to maximize the rainfed cotton production.
(h)   Several risk distribution technologies like proper placement of
FYM, paired row planting, preplanting weedicide application using
basalin, intercropping with blackgram short duration type T9, use
of neem cake blended urea, etc. have been demonstrated (see a list
of technologies, Annex Table 13).

Pest ManaGrement
5.3   Scounting, sex pheromone technique for pest monitoring, economic
threshold levels for key pest, biological control, effective flowering period
for spraying potent insecticides, proper/optimum use of synthetir pyrethroids
and conventional insecticides, integrated pest management using these techni-
ques in combination with cultural and field sanitary practices have been
improved/popularized/demonstrated. The resistance genotypes for major insect
pests and diseases have been identified besides screening advanced breeding
material. Use of acid delinted fungicide coated seed warded off diseases very
much.
5.4   The effectiveness of recommended plant protection practices is given in
Annex Table 14.
Economic Reevaluation
5.5   The investments financed under the project have generated benefits at
three levels, viz., (i) cotton growers; (ii) ginning units; and (iii) cotton
seed processing units. The investments at these levels were mainly financed
by bank loans and refinanced by ARDC. ARDC provided refinance, from a
specially set-up Seasonal Credit Fund, to cooperatives and commercial banks
for their onlending to cotton growers in the project areas for their
incremental seasonal input requirements. Refinance assistance was also
provided in respect of loans issued by cooperatives and commercial banks for
setting up ginning complexes and cotton seed processing facilities.
Cotton Cultivation
5.6   The use of improved seed varieties, plant protection and increased use
of other inputs like fertilizers are expected to result in higher yields and
larger net income to the cotton growers participating in the project. Thus,
the benefit at the farm level is related to the generation of annual net
incremental income from the use of incremental inputs in cotton cultivation.
This has been worked out as a difference in net income (at constant prices of
1983-84) between the preproject year (1975-76) and the successive project
years (1976-77 to 1983-84).
5.7   To estimate the net incremental income that accrued to the cotton
farmers from the adoption of improved cultivation practices, the time series
data made available by the Project Directors on costs of cultivation, yield
rates and prices of inputs and outputs in the project area, for the period
from 1975-76 (preproject period) to 1983-84, have been utilized. In the case
of Maharashtra (amravati district), the project authority could not furnish
data on costs of cultivation of cotton in the project area. For the purpose
of estimating the net incremental income due to the projects, the costs of
inputs and the values of output (kapas), have been worked out at 1983-84
constant prices. While in the case of Haryana and Punjab, the market prices
have been used for evaluating output (cotton), for Maharashtra, the statutory
monopoly procurement price fixed by the State Government has been used. The
details relating to area covered under the project, number of farmer
beneficiaries and disbursement of short-term credit under IDCP are given in
Annex Table 5.



- 35 -
5.8   Use of Inputs:  consistent with the objective of increasing the yield
levels of cotton (kapas) gradually to the optimum level considered feasible in
the three districts, the project provided for a gradual stepping-up of the
levels of input use. Seed, fertilizer, plant protection, were considered
strategic for increasing the yield rate and therefore, substantial increases
in the quantum of use of these inputs were postulated. For other inputs like
hired labor, and irrigation (except Maharashtra) increases assumed were
modest.  The improved seed varieties recommended in Haryana ana Punjab were
320-F, H-777 and Bikaneri Narma and F-414. In Maharashtra the recommended
varieties were H-4, B-1007, AK-235, SRT-1, A-4 and L-147. Alvhough seed rates
actually used (ranging from 12 to 15 kg/ha on an average) during the project
period were higher than those in the preproject period, it fell short of
recommended rates (20 to 22 kg/ha) in Haryana and Punjab. Most farmers in the
project areas of these two states feel that using a seed rate higher than 15
kg/ha would create problems in interculture and plant protection operations.
In Maharashtra, the seed rates used were found to be close to the recommended
rates.
5.9   Though the project envisaged burning of cotton stalks and other crop
residues as an effective method of plant protection, it did not find wide
acceptable among the farmers who continued to use cotton stalks as fuel.
Against the recommended practice of five to seven sprayings of pesticides,
farmers in Haryana and Punjab were observed to use thiree to four sprayings,
depending upon the severity of the infection. in Maharashtra, the actual
number of sprayings were lower at one to three.
5.10 In Sirsa and Faridkot districts, for which cost of cultivation data for
project beneficiaries were available, the value of fertilizers applied (at
constant prices registered an increase ranging from 100 to 200% during this
period. The input of hired labor (valued at constant prices) increased in
1982-83 over the preproject year (1975-76) by about 30% in Sirsa and Faridkot
districts.
5.11  Yield Rates:  A major objective of the project was to raise the yield
levels of cotton through investments in research and extension services and
increased credit facilities to farmers to enable adoption of improved tech-
nology of cotton cultivation. The SAR has assumed that by the end of the
fifth year of implementation of the project, average yield of cotton (kapas)
per ha in the project area would increase from nine quintals (preproject) to
16 qu4.ntals in Sirsa District, 12.5 quintals (preproject) to 20 quintals in
Faridkot district and from 3.2 quintals (preproject) to 5.6 quintals in
Amravati district. It was further postulated that continuation of research
and extension activities would enable yields to stabilize at 20 quintals per
ha in Sirsa, 25 quintals per ha in Faridkot and nine quintals per ha in
Amravati districts from the ninth to twentieth years. While comparing the
average yields achieved under the project during different years of implemen-
tation with the above assumptions, due allowance has to be made for the basic
difference between the two estimates, while the SAR assumed yields are based
on assumptions of normal weather, the estimates of actual yields are subject
to year to year weather aberration. This point has greater relevance in the
case of Amravati district, where the entire project area is unirrigated.

5.12 The estimated yields per hectare in the project areas were as follows:

1976-77               13.98                14.00                   4.69
1977-78               12.99                14.20                   5.57
1978-79               15.00                18.80                   6.14
1979-80               14.49                19.40                   6.09
1980-81               15.00                17.10                   6.18
1981-82               15.99                17.20                   6.51
1982-83               17.01                20.10                   6.50
1983-84               10.05                 8.50                   5.20
5.13 The data presented in Table 17 for the period 1976-77 to 1983-84
indicate that despite increasing input levels, yield rates have been subject
to fluctuations from year to year, which is probably the result of variations
in weather conditions and other factors like crop damage due to insects and
pests. However, the basic trend points to increasing yield rates. Excluding
from consideration the data for the year 1983-84, during which the cotton crop
was subject to large-scale damage due to heavy infestation by bollworms, it is
observed that the level of yield postulated for the fifth year in the SAR was
actually achieved in e sixth and seventh years in Sirsa (15.99 quintals/ha)
and Faridkot (20.1 quintals/ha) districts respectively and in the second year
in Amravati district (5.57 quintals/ha). In all the three districts, the
highest level of yield during the project period (1976-77 to 1983-84) was
attained in 1982-83, which corresponds to the seventh year to project. In
order to assess whether the increase in yield rates compare favorably with
those assumed in the SAR, a trend line has been fitted on the basis of actual
yield data to remove the seasonal variations. the actual yields and estimated
yields based on the trend equation are given in Table 18 (refer graph).

A = Actual yield rates.
B = Computed yield rates.
Note:    A linear trend equation has been fitted taking into account the
actual yields given in Cols. (2), (4) and (6) and the estimated trend
values based on the equation y = a + bt, where y = actual yield rates
and t = project years (1976 to 1982-83), are shown in Cols. (3), (5)
and (7).
5.14     The estimated values (yields per ha) on the basis of the equation are
compared below with the SAR projections:
Fifth year           Seventh Year
SAR      Trend       SAR      Trend
District     yield      yield     yield      yield

Faridkot     20.0       17.8      22.0       19.0
Amravati      6.2        6.3        7.1       6.5
5.15      The above comparison shows that the actual yields, adjusted for
seasonal variations on the basis of trend equation, sre quite close to the
yield levels assumed in the SAR for the fifth and seventh years. Thus, with
the strengthening of research and extension efforts and inputs use at in-
creased levels, it should not be difficult to achieve the maximum yield levels
envisaged in the appraisal report, although those may be attained with a lag
of two or three years.

5.16      Gross Value of Produce (Kapas):  The average gross value of produce
per hectare (Annex 6-7) in 1975-76, at 1983-84 prices, was Rs. 4,500 in Sirsa,
Rs. 6,625 in Faridkot and Rs. 1,600 in Amravati. As a result of implementa-
tion of the project, these values increased at 1983-84 prices to Rs.  ,505 in
Sirsa, Rs. 10,653 in Faridkot and Rs. 3,250 in Amravati in 1982-83. 1   Thus,
the gross value of additional production is estimated at Rs. 4,005, Rs. 4,028
and Rs. 1,650 per ha in the respective project areas.
5.17      Costs of Cultivatior.:  In the preproject year (1975-76), per ha
costs (at the constant prices of 1983-84) came to Rs. 2,599 in Sirsa and Rs.
3,016 in Faridkot (Annex 9-10). With the project completion, these costs (at
1983-84 prices) worked out to Rs. 3,727 in Sirsa, Rs. 4,157 in Faridkot in
1982-83. Thus, the incremental costs are estimated at Rs. 1,128 and Rs. 1,141
per ha in Sirsa and Faridkot respectively (Annex 6-7). Although data relating
to cost of cultivation were not collected by the Project Authority of
Maharashtra, information gathered from field visits and other sources indicate
that costs of cultivation had increased in Amravati too, though by a smaller
magnitude as compared to the other two districts. According to some limited
data available from other sources, the costs of cultivation per ha in 1982-83
in Amravati could be placed at around Rs. 1,300 to 1,400 and incremental costs
at around Rs. 600 to Rs. 700 per ha.
5.18      Net Income and Incremental Income:  The net income at 1983-84 prices
increased from Rs. 1,901 per ha in 1975-76 to Rs. 4,778 in 1982-83 in Sirsa
and from Rs. 3,609 per ha to Rs 6,495 per ha in Faridkot (Annex 6-7). The net
incremental income (i.e. difference between the preproject net income and net
income during project period) due to the adoption of improved technology of
growing cotton, worked out to Rs. 2,877 per ha in Sirsa and Rs. 2,886 per ha
in Faridkot in 1982-83. Though precise data are not available, indications
are that in Amravati, average net incremental income would have reached in
1982-83 a level of around Rs. 900 to Rs. 1,000 per hectare.
5.19      In the project areas covering Sirsa and Faridkot districts, the
Financial Rates of Return (FRR) exceed 100% i.e., infinity, because the
additional costs incurred during the crop season (May to November in produc-
tion of cotton) are covered by the excess revenue accrued during the period
from November to January each year except in 1983-84 when the yield rate was
abnormally low due to pest infestation). In the absence of complete data in
respect of Amravati, the rate of return had not been worked out. But such
data as are available given the indication that the Financial Rates of Return
would have been fairly high in all the years except 1983-84. Economic Rates
of Return (ERR) also exceed infinity in both the districts, viz., Sirsa and
Faridkot.
1/   Though the project was completed in 1983-84, comparison with preproject
level is made with reference to 1982-83 since, as mentioned earlier, the
yields in 1983-84 were adversely affected due to the infestation of crop
by bollworms.



- 39 -
5.20      Sensitivity tests carried out on the basis of data for Sirsa and
Faridkot indicate that in all these two regions, even with 50Z reduction in
incremental yield, the Financial Rates of Return would continue to be
infinite. Even in absolute amounts, the returns would continue to be fairly
high (at Rs. 614 and Rs. 873 per ha respectively). However, this may not
happen in Amravati, where a 50% reduction in incremental yield would result in
t'.e return falling to a very low absolute level, which may inhibit the culti-
vators initiative to aaopt improved methods.
Institutional Credit
5.21      In working out the size of SCF, institutional share of credit in the
incremental input costs was estimated at appraisal to increase from its
preproject level of 35% to about 67% at the end of the completion of the
project. On the basis of data available on incremental costs of cultivation,
area benefitted by the project and credit disbursements under the project, the
share of institutional credit in the incremental costs due to adoption of
improved cotton cultivation technology is examined below for Sirsa and
Faridkot districts.

5.22      It will be seen that the share of institutional credit into the
incremental input costs increased to 51% and 43% respectively in Sirsa and
Faridkot districts at the end of the project period, as against the assumed
level of 67%.
Ginneries and Cotton Seed Processing Units
5.23      It has already been stated that though the project envisaged
financing improvements to existing ginneries as well as setting up of new
ginnery units, actual financing were confined only to setting up of new
ginneries. Alcogether seven units--three ginneries (one each at Ding, Ratia
and Bhattukalan) and two seed processing complexes (one each at Ding and
Ratia) in Haryana, one solvent extraction plant (Amravati) and one seed
processing complex at Parbhani in Maharashtra - were set up under the



- 40 -
project. The ginnery at Bhattukalan was given only trial runs in 1983-84.
The seed processing complex in Parbhani district (preprocessing and oil mills
at Hingoli and Gangakhed and solvent extraction and refinery units) were
completed between October 1983 and Mary 1984. The seed processing unit at
Ratia was completed only in December 1983. Likewise, though the seed
processing complex at Ding was completed in February 1981, the unit has had
only trial runs until 1983-84. Of the remuining four units, two units, i.e.,
ginneries at Ding and Ratia were completed in February 1981, but these units
could function only for a limited period up to the reference year, 1983-84
based on which experience, it is difricult to assess what the financial
viability of these plants would be under expected capacity utilization
conditions. The solvent extraction plan at Amravati was established in
February 1981. But this unit could not get adequate supply of decorticated
cake either from its associates or from the open market. To overcome this
problem, MOCICOL purchased an old oil mill having a crushing capacity of 100
tons per day, which, however, had not been functional until 1983-84. As a
result, the capacity utilization of the unit could not exceed 32% over the
period 1980-81 to 1983-84. In view of the above reasons, no attempt has been
made to assess financial viability of these units under normal capacity
utilization conditions. However, in response to measures taken to overcome
the initial bottlenecks, the prospects of these units are briefly indicated in
the following paragraphs:
Haryana
5.24      Ginneries:  Raw material availability for each of the three units at
Ding, Ratia and Bhattukalan (working for 240 shifts of eight hours each over a
period of 120 days in a season) is estimated at 13,000 tons (kapas) per
annum. Thus the requirement of all the three units set up under the project
is estimated at 39,000 tons (kapas) per annum. Considered against the
estimated average incremental production of cotton in the project area in
Haryana over the period 1980-81 to 1982-83 of 88,000 tons (kapas) ant the fact
that the units existing in the preproject period were being fully utilized at
the preproject production level, the three additional ginning-cum-pressing
units are not expected to face any problem with regard to raw material avail-
ability. The HAFED has since installed its own power generators in Decembe-
1984 to overcome the power supply bottleneck, which was the major constrai-
to full utilization of the ginneries earlier. Therefore, the units could ilF
expected to work for 120 days in a year.
5.25      Cotton Seed Processing Units:  Until 1983-84 the unit at Ding has
had only trial runs. Barring 1983-84, when the cotton crop was damaged due to
bollworm infestation, the utilization during trial runs ranged from 8,486 to
8,833 tons (or 34-35% of installed capacity). The constraints to fuller
utilization of capacity, such as low voltage, frequent interruption in power
supply, etc. have been removed with the installation of diesel power gene-
rators. The reduction in demand caused by prolonged textile strike in Bombay
has also ceased to be a serious problem any more. The supply of raw material
for the two new seed processing units, would also not constitute any problem,
though it was desirable to educate the farmers against using cotton seed
before deoiling as feed, since that results in wastage of feed where the
formulated feed would be more digestible and of higher nutritional value. As



- 41 -
against the total raw material requirement of the two units of 50,000 tons per
year, the average additional'availability of cotton seed over the period 1980-
81 and 1982-83 (at 64% recovery) was 56,000 tons per annum (corresponding to
the average additional production of cotton (kapas) of 88,000 tons per annum).
The raw material requirements of existing seed processing units (preproject)
would have been fully met from the preproject production levels in the area
and such additional supplies from Punjab and Rajasthan as were normally
available.
Maharashtra
5.26      Cotton Seed Processing Complex (Parbhani).  The total raw material
requirement of the two oil mills (Hingoli and Gangakhed) is estimated at
50,000 tons per year. The Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation
Limited (MSCMFL) is the State Government's agent for procuring cotton under
the Monopoly Procurement Scheme which has been in operation in the State. It
procures cotton from the prodicers and processes the same at the ginning and
pressing factories situated at various procurement centers. After selling
lint bales, the MSCMFL sells the remaining cotton seeds by auction. Raw
material for the cotton seed processing units is largely procured from the
cotton procurement centers in the project area, which covers four districts of
Marathwada region, viz., Parbhani, Aurangabad, Bhir and Nanded. On the basie
of the average quantity of cotton procured in these four districts over the
last four years (1979-80 to 1982-83), the cotton seed available is estimated
at 1.24 lakh tons per year. Making due allowance for the raw material
requirements of other mills in the area (all of them being village oil mills
except one cooperative oil mill) estimated at 35,000 tons per year, the
balance of 89,000 tons are expected to be available for the two project
units. Further, the sunflower seed produced in large quantities in the region
can also be used as a substitute raw material for cotton seed.
5.27      Solvent Extraction Plant (Amravati):  The solvent extraction plant
at Amravati which was established in February 1981 was expected to process 100
tons of cotton seed expeller cake per day. At the time of sanction, it was
assumed that supply of 45 tones of expeller cake would be available from
existing old oil mills and the balance supply of 55 tons would be procured
from the market. However, the expected quantities could not be procured from
outside. To overcome this problem, MOCICOL purchased an old oil mill having
crushing capacity of 100 tons per day. But this had not been functional until
1983-84. As a result, the capacity utilization of the unit could not exceed
32% over the period 1980-81 to 1983-84.
Benefits at Macro Level
5.28      In the three selected districts, viz. Sirsa, Faridkot and Amravati,
the project covered by 1982-83, an area of 2.30 lakh ha as against the target
of 1.83 lakh ha. The SAR had assumed that total additional production of
cotton (kapas), Would reach 1.06 lakh tons (kapas) by the end of the project
(i.e., fifth year). As against this, the total additional production in 1982-
83 (i.e., seventh year) in the project area was estimated at 1.54 lakh tons
(kapas). This would have resulted in an additional supply of 0.49 lakh tons
of lint (32%) to the textile industry and 0.99 lakh tons of cotton seed (64%)
to seed processing units.  There is a loss of 4% while processing.



- 42 -
5.29      The contribution of the project to Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
during 1982-83 was Rs. 545.5 million (at 1983-84 prices) in the form of
additional cotton production. The three new ginneries established under the
project in Haryana are expected to produce lint of higher quality compared to
that produced from the existing ginneries in the project area which use
outdated equipments and processes. But, the contribution of additional
ginneries to GDP in terms of producing improved lint quality has not been
estimated for want of adequate data. However, their contribution would be
sizeable only in the future, as the ginneries were not being fully utilized
until 1983-84 because of delays in installation and various other constraints.
The new cotton seed processing units installed under the project would ensure
a higher percentage of recovery of oil and by-products of higher quality,
e.g., cotton seed cake free of linters and hulls. These units, at full
capacity utilization, would contribute to Gross Domestic Preduct (at 1983-84
prices) Rs. 34 million by way of better oil recove-j and improved by-product
utilization.
5.30      The annual incremental production, at 1982-83 yield level, of 1.54
lakh tons of cotton (kapas) (equivalent to 0.49 lakh tons of lint) under the
project represents a saving in imports of the va'.ue of Rs. 857.5 million at
1983-84 Domestic Prices. The cotton seed processing units would enable con-
version, at full capacity utilization, of 1.0 lakh tons of cotton seed into
high-valued by-products. Similarly, about 16,000 tons of refined oil valued
at Rs. 240 million woild substitute for current import requirements of edible
oils.
5.31      Regarding employment effects, the SA-1 estimated that nearly 1.2 lakh
farm families and 2.0 lakh laborers would be annually engaged in production
and harvesting of cotton. By 1982-83, when the actual araa covered under the
project constituted about 122 to 127% of the targetted areas, nearly 1.71 lakh
farm families were engaged in cotton cultivation. But the number of agricul-
tural laborers benefitted annually from the project is estimated (assuming 250
days of annual employment per laborer) at around one lakh. It is possible
that due to reduced levels of inputs used, the employment generation fell
short of the target. At full capacity utilization, the new ginneries and seed
processing complexes would provide employment for unskilled labor amounting to
0.80 lakh mondays per annum.
Evaluation of Research/Development Component
5.32      As per requirement, Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ahmedabad,
was approached for project evaluation. The terms of reference conveyed
were: to fix benchmarks for various parameters like yield, varietal complex
change (area under long duration/short duration/upland/arboreum), quantitative
change in various parameters and project objectives like use of certified
seed, adoption of pest management measures like field sanitation, etc.,
improvement in gin product, cotton seed crushing and benefit resulting from
the project implementation.
5.33      M/s. Tirath Gupta, C.G. Ranade and G.A. Patel undertook the study
with 1978-79 as reference year and submitted a report in October, 1980.
Sample size used was 100 cotton growers, 85 in the project area and 15 as
control (nonproject area). Parameters used by the evaluation team were:



- 43 -
(a)  Awareness of farmers regarding the significance of soil analysis.
(b)  Changes in the area allocated to cotton during 1976-77 to 1978-79
compared to the total cultivable lands.
(c)  Adoption of recommended cotton varieties and distribution of
certified and/or improved seeds.
(d)  Quantity of seeds per ha used by farmers vis-a-vis the recommended
seed rates.
(e)  Farmers' awareness and perception regarding recommendations in
respect of sowing time, plant population, rouging, thinning and
weeding.
(f)  Recommendations for plant protection and their follow-up by farmers
with respect to use of pesticides, number of sprays, expenses
incurred and purchase of plant protection equipment.
(g)  Irrigation.
(h)  Credit.
(i)  Grading and Marketing.
5.34      Conclusions arrived at by the evaluation team were:
(a)  Only 22Z of the growers appreciated the value of soil analysis and
followed recommendations.
(b)  59% of the area owned by sample farmers were planted under cotton.
(c)  A majority of farmers did not plant recommended varieties.  lack of
awareness and seed of recommended varieties was the reason.
td)  There was positive change in seed rate but gap between the
recommended rate and actually used continued to be substantial.
(e)  Regarding otpimum sowing time, thinning, rouging, farmers response
was satisfactory but alike in project and control areas.
(f)  Use of manures tas common but quantity limited to home supply.
(g)  Only 50% of growers used basal dose.  Farmers were not aware of
placement advantage. However, quantity of fertilizer used and
expenditure were higher in project area than control area.
(h)  Project efforts with regard to field sanitation did not appear to
have significant impact.



- 44 -
(i) Hand sprayer was the most common equipment and considerable higher
percentage of projdct farmers owned the equipment as compared to
control area.
(j) As against recommended 5-7 sprays to protect the crop, project
farmers used 3-4 sprays as compared to 2-3 by control farmers.
(k) 80% of project farmers reported their ignorance about pesticides
spray recommendations as compared to 100% in control area.
(1) Only 39Z of farmers availed aerial spray facilities.
(m)  Quantity of chemical used and expenditure on plant protection was
higher in project area as compared to control.
(n) 77% of the farmers approached cooperative institutions for their
credit needs.
(o) Borrowing in project areas was on an average Rs. 519 per ha as
compared to Rs 346 per ha in control areas.
(p) Cotton productivity in the project area has increased as compared to
control area. Productivity targets for different years have not
been met and gap between targets and achievements widened over
years.
(q)  100% of farmers in the project area sold their produce to private
agencies and only a small fraction of farmers availed grading
facilities.
Evaluation by ICAR
5.35      In 1980, ICAR constituted an expert team to evaluate progress and
impact of the project. The team consisted of Dr. C.T. Patel, ICMF (Surat);
Dr. K.S. Kushwaha, Professor of Eminence, Rajasthan College of Agriculture,
University of Udaipur; Dr. H.N. Byra Reddy, Director of Extension, Andhra
Pradesh Agricultural University; Dr. N. P. Wankhede, CICR (Nagpur). Expert
team submitted the report in February, 1982. Conclusions arrived at are as
under:
(a) Progress in strengthening of research facilities has been
satisfactory.
(b) In Breeding, attention has been mostly at evolving long staple
hybrids particularly in Maharashtra. Hybrids evolved have not been
as popular as H-4.
(c) As 96% of the area is under rainfed/semi-arid conditions work on
Asiatic cottons has not received much attention, so approach needs
reorientation.



- 45 -
(d) SRT-1 gave good response to Nitrogen application to the extent of
100 kg per ha undei rainfed condition. This needs confirmation.
(e) Physiological research needs more emphasis, particularly on Asiatic
cotton.
(f) None of the varieties tested found resistant to bollworms.
(g)  Early maturing upland varieties developed in Punjab and Haryana have
permitted double cropping.  However, breeding for appropriate plant
type and agrotechniques needs more attention.
(h)  Work on Desi cottons promising, but improvement of staple of these
types needed as Desi cottons are preferred because of pest
tolerance.
(i) Seed production program falling short.
(j) Patchy germination in Punjab and Haryana needs an investigation.
(k) Critical stages of plant growth, rainfall and soil types needs to be
worked out for irrigation water economy.
(1) Role of biotic agents to regulate the pest population in cotton eco-
system needs concentration. IPM (Integrated Pest Management) so far
followed is only for timing of chemical treatment.
(m) Use of synthetic prethroids needs to be judiciously adjusted with
other measures to conserve biotic factors.
(n) Project has provided skeleton staff for plant protection.
(o) Operational research planning and impiementation not given consider-
able thought.
(p) Specially designed project with development orientation, like ICDP,
needs to be managed by experts in agricultural extension.
(q)  ICDP needs to be evaluated for its cost benefit but there were no
experts in economics to gather required information.
(r)6 ICDP has proved to be very successful in accelerating the tempo of
research, development and extension work ard would play a great role
in increasing production per unit area and improving quality. Such
projects should be started in other potential areas of the country.

VI. WORLD BANK PERFORMANCE
Project Design and Appraisal
6.1       Integrated Cotton Development Project was formulated after a
detailed survey all over the country and wide-ranging discussions with people
involved in all sectors of cotton economy including cotton development,
research, growers, traders, processors, textile people and financial
institutions.
6.2       World Bank has been intimately involved right through
reconnaissance, identification and appraisal of the project. Preappraisal
mission of Frank Lowenstein and Dr. Manning defined the issues well and
subsequent appraisal/follow-up missions of Dorris Brown aid G. Stern outlined
the project components in great detail.
6.3       Supervision.  The IDA supervision missions have been regularly
visiting the project areas. They offered constructive suggestions, but by and
large, the review missions monitored mainly financial aspects of the
project. They could have gone into details of the technical part as well.
6.4       One of the components in Punjab was the modernization/augmentation
of the existing ginning facilities. Nothing could be done in this direction
because interest rate charged on the funds made available by ARDC was 11%
whereas Punjab Financial Corporation could finance at the rate of 9%. Thus
for World Bank aided projects to be effective, the final rate of interest
charged should not be more than the one available from existing financial
agencies. The claiming of loan and submission of claims to the World Bank
seems to be a quite complicated process. IDA may think of simplifying their
procedure for lending and filing claims from the Bank.
6.5       In order to implement the project earnestly, the World Bank may
always reserve a small amount in each project and position at least two
persons, a Technical Expert and an Economist to guide/act as a watchdog for
ensuring project implementation as per stated objective and norms.
VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
7.1       The major objectives of the Integrated Cotton Development Project
were: (i) accelerate research to breed more suitable and high-yielding cotton
varieties; (ii) provision of improved seed and more intensive insect and
disease control services; (iii) modernization and extension of ginning and
cotton seed processing; (iv) provision of seasonal credit to growers; and
(v) training the research/development workers and farmers.



- 47 -
7.2       As far as strengthening of research facilities is concerned, this
objective has been achieved to a considerable extent. Laboratories have been
constructed and suitably equipped. The research facilities in all the five
agricultural universities have been tremendously improved for intensifying
multi-disciplinary research. A large volume of breeding material has been
generated and from the pipeline of breeders, a number of them may emerge soon
as potential high-yielding varieties/hybrids. The low cost technology has
been evolved and demonstrated in the field. The use of integrated pest
management (IPM) has also been adopted by the farmers due to the continuous
efforts of the Research and Development Officers involved in the project.
Scientists and Development Officers have been trained in cotton production
technology. However, the new varieties released by agricultural universities
have not covered wider areas. The agronomic, entomological and pathological
studies have mainly confirmed proven technology like dry sowing on ridges
having 0.2-0.4 contour gradient, intercropping, pests scouting, use of
synthetic pyrethroids, etc. More emphasis may have to be given on disciplines
like plant physiology and water management. With regard to breeder and found-
ation seed production, only PKV, Akola achieved notable success while other
universities have not been able to achieve their targets.  Research scientists
of agricultural universities took a lot of pains to impart training to the
officers involved in cotton development services and farmers.
7.3       Cotton Development Service (CDS) organized by all the three states
was by and large very satisfactory. However, non/less appointment of some key
personnel like Cotton Development and Plant Protection Officers did hamper the
development work. Nonenforcement of various legislations made CDS task little
difficult. The CDC officials demonstrated beyond doubt that given good
quality seed, efficient plant protection, credit and training in improved
production technology, the cotton yields can be appreciably stepped up.
7.4       Commendable progress has been achieved under the component of
ginning and cotton seed processing. In Haryana, three high capacity saw gins
have been set up by HAFED at Ding, Ratia and Bhattukalan. The HAFED has also
set up two modern combination expeller-cum-solvent extraction plants at Ding
and Ratia. In Maharashtra, apart from adding solvent extraction unit to their
already existing cotton seed processing plant at Amravati, MOCICOL has set up
one combination expeller-cum-solvent extraction plant at Parbhani and two
cotton seed expeller plants at Hingoli and Gangakhed. The operational
efficiency of these plants needs to be stepped up.
7.5       In Punjab, the ginnery owners did not show any in_erest in
installing precleaners in the absence of price incentive for clean gin
product. The higher rate of interest on IDA credit as compared to that being
charged by local financial institutions in Punjab also resulted as a handicap
in modernization of the existing ginneries in Punjab.
7.6       To help farmers in adopting improved cotton production technology,
provision was also made for short-term seasonal credit by the cooperative and
commercial banks. Under this component, in Haryana a total amount of Rs.
328.983 M was distributed by the banks. In Punjab, the total disbursemerts
were Rs. 72.781 M whereas in Maharashtra the disbursements were Rs. 38.323
M.  The performance in Haryana and Punjab was commendable.



- 48 -
7.7       The research workers were actively involved in training the Develop-
ment Officers and farmers. Nine scientists working in the universities in the
fields of plant breeding and plant protection had the opportunity of having
short-term study tours to USA, Sudan, Peru and Turkey. Eight Development
Officers also visited USA and other countries to acquaint themselves with the
latest cotton production technology. The exposure of these scientists and
development officers will be very useful in further cotton prouuction programs
in the country.
7.8       The most positive gain of the project has been that the farmers have
become aware of the improved cotton production technology, particularly in the
use of required quantity of quality seed, fertilizer, water management and
adoption of phyto-sanitation/plant protection measures.
7.9       Overall, the project has been a success and has by and large served
the purpose for which it was designed.
Issues and Lessons
7.10      A project having a number of components is likely to face coordina-
tion problems and procedural delays in implementation. Short-term credit
needs were overgenerously estimated once the base year and considerable diffi-
culties were encountered in harmonizing interest rates and refinance
conditions with commercial bankis. Some of the covenants proved very
difficult to implement and had to be relaxed, for example, legislation
restricting cultivation of permitted varieties only, mandatory control of
cotton plant residues, prohibition of blending seed cotton, etc. (Section 2.08
Haryana Project Agreement).
7.11      From experience, it seems that SAR was optimistic in assessing the
time it would take to sort out basic issues in the initial stages and it would
therefore seem essential at project appraisal to discern realistically what
can be achieved during the Project period.

Note:    Project authority in Maharashtra did not collect any data on cost of cultivation.  However, according to some
limited data available from other sources, the cost of cultivation per ha in 1982-83 could be placed at around
Rs. 1,300 to Rs. 1,400 and incremental cost at around Rs. 600 to Rs. 700 per ha. On the basis of this cost of
cultivation data, average net incremental income would have reached in 1982/83 a level of around Rs. 900 to Rs.
1,000 per hectare.

Subjects-  .ndia Integrated Cotton Dovelopment Project
(Credit 610-IN) Prosect Completion Repaort.
Please refor to your letter dated 14th Feb.,1989
addressed to Mr.A.S.PoonijFinancial Commissioner and Secretary
Agriculture,Government of Punjab,Chandigarh.
In Project India Integrated Cotton Development the
following objectives were successfully implemented.
a)         Accelerated research to broed more juitable and
higher yielding cotb n varietios and developped
improved cultural practices;
b)        Improved cotton developnent facilities for the
cotton growers.
Progress on these 2 objects had been continuing eve
after the cessation of these projects. Now Faridkot district ranks
first in country in terms of fertilizer consumption and is one of thq
top districts in pesticides use. Faridkot district also ranks first in
terns of the cotton yields. This has been possible becuass to a limited
extent the state continue that project from its own resources to-dato.
The identification development of short durAtion-cotton
varieties during this project period has lead to the improvemnt in
cropping intensity not only in Faridkot diatrict but also in the
adjoining districts. Some cotton varieties identified/dewelopped
during that period have been replaced now by still better varieties.
The farmers are continuously being guided about the need based
sprays and about using pesticides from dlfferent groups in;slternato
sprays. Credit facilities as a short term crop loan are contAnaLng.
All this shows that India Integrated Cotton Development
Project resulted in speedy development in cotton research,extension
and adoption. It is true that during early phases there were
some difficulties which could have been avolded
;-26

it they were pro-conceived and discussed during pro-appraisal
and appraisal visits. Some times the implementation agency
thinks-that the appralsal team are adamant of their own line
of thinking and they give in easily to that line of thinking.
This results in covering up the difficulties likely to be faced
during implementation. It is suggested that the pre-appraiscl
teams and appraisal teams should be very open and should give
an impression that they are not adamant about any particular
line of thinking. Each aspect should be discussed thoroughly
from all angles. Once this is-done and the components are
identified then IDA should insist that the components are put
to work. For example if the Project Coordinator would have
been appointed in addition to the present Joint Director of
Agriculture and extension staff would have been strengthen
then the results would have been still better.
It is further suggested that more such projects
my be indentified for implementation in future.
