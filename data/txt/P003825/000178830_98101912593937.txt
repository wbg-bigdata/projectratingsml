I. THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY SECTORS
A. Economic Background
1.01      Indonesia is endowed with abundant energy resources and has large,
as yet undeveloped, reserves of natural gas, coal, geothermal energy and
hydroelectric power, but the availability of indigenous oil caused it to
develop a primarily petroleum-based energy sector. Eighty percent of the
total commercial energy consumption now derives from petroleum. Currently
oil and liquified natural gas (LNG) exports generate 70% of government's
revenues and finance almost all of its non-oil imports. Domestic oil
consumption has been growing at 12% per year and this trend is expected to
continue until the end of the decade. As oil production is virtually
constant at about 1.6 million barrels per day, and is expected to remain so,
oil available for export will continue to decline. The main focus of
government's energy resource development policy, first enunciated in 1978,
is to develop alternative energy sources to offset this trend and avoid the
possible devastating effects on its economy in the mid-1990s of Indonesia
becoming a net importer of oil. Since then, the Government of Indonesia (GOI)
has taken a number of steps to implement this policy. The steps cover
organizational improvements, more rational energy pricing policies, and
innovative arrangements to expedite the diversification program. They are
explained in the following paragraphs.
B. Energy Resources and Status of Development
Oil
1.02      The proven oil reserves are reported to be 9.5 billion barrels,
amounting to 16 years production at the recent annual production rate of about
575 million barrels. Exploration of much of Indonesia is still at an early
stage. During 1975-77, after a period of rapid increases in oil exploration,
there was little activity as a result of uncertainty following GOI's moves to
renegotiate terms of production-sharing contracts. Exploration work has
picked up since the resolution of this problem in 1978. Undiscovered reserves
are estimated between 10 billion and 40 billion barrels. There have not been
any major discoveries in recent years. Unless further massive reserves are
discovered, it is considered unlikely that annual production will increase
beyond 700 million barrels.
Natural Gas
1.03      Reserves of natural gas are estimated at some 69 trillion cubic
feet (TCF), almost equivalent to the proven level of oil reserves. The bulk
(85%) of this gas is non-associated and can be developed independently of the
level of oil production.  However, the reserves are generally located far
away from major population and industrial centres. Arun field in North
Sumatra contains 17 TCF and the recently discovered Natuma field in the South
China sea contains 35 TCF.



1.04      Production of natural gas reached 2,700 million cubic feet per day
in 1979, equivalent to one-third of the country's oil production.  Nearly
half of that production was exported as LNG to Japan from liquefaction
centers at Arun and Badak. Pipelines also have been laid to steel and
fertilizers plants in Java and Sumatra and domestic consumption of natural
gas is expected to increase at about 15% per year during the next few years.
LNG production at Arun and Badak is expected to double by 1985 to 15 million
tons per year, and by 1990 to 28 million tons, including planned develop-
ments at Natuma. These are the most important elements of the country's gas
development program.
1.05      About 30% of the natural gas associated with oil production is
currently flared. The major constraints on increased use of natural gas
resources within Indonesia are pricing, and institutional/contracting
arrangements. The price paid to private producers has been too low to
provide sufficient incentives for them to produce and deliver non-associated
gas for domestic users or to conserve associated gas by reinjection.
Coal
1.06      The total coal resources of Indonesia are large, perhaps as high as
20 billion tons. The bulk of it (15.5 billion tons) is lignite and brown
coal, followed by sub-bituminous coal (4.0 billion tons) and just over 0.6
billion tons of bituminous coal. Coal bearing formations are scattered
throughout the country but the major deposits (about 99% of known resources)
are located in the Sawahlunto area of West Sumatra (Ombilin mine), around
the TABA concession (Bukit Asam mine) in South Sumatra, and along the coast
of East and South Kalimantan. The coal reserves of various areas are shown
in Annex 1.
1.07      Coal has been produced in Indonesia for a long time.  The Ombilin
mine, dating back to 1892, reached a peak of 665,000 tons in 1930. Around
1941, the annual production at Bukit Asam was 850,000 tons and 600,000 tons
from mines in East Kalimantan. The industry declined thereafter. Current
coal development and production is undertaken by two large state companies,
PN Batubara and PT Bukit Asam, and a number of small private firms.
PN Batubara covers major coal reserves outside South Sumatra, whereas
recently formed PT Bukit Asam covers the South Sumatra coal fields, mainly
Bukit Asam and Banko. The production in 1980 was about 250,000 tons, of
which Ombilin provided about 100,000 tons, and Bukit Asam, 150,000 tons.
1.08      There is considerable uncertainty about the true quantity and
quality characteristics of the various deposits. Enough information is
available, however, to establish the basic features and to draw up a short-
term development strategy, while, at the same time, organizing systematic



- 3 -
coal exploration which would lead to firm long-term plans.  The best quality
coal of all reserves is that from, Ombilin in West Sumatra.  It is low in ash
and sulfur, has a heating value of 6,800-7,500 kcal/kg, and most of it has
to be mined by underground methods. The limited reserve and its high
quality requires that it be earmarked for special industrial uses. Although
lower in heat value (5,000-6,500 kcal/kg) the sub-bituminous coals of South
Sumatra which are accessible to surface mining are eminently suitable for
steam generation and general industrial purposes. This is also true of East
Kalimantan coal. The large South Sumatra reserves at Banko and surrounding
areas, which are estimated at 15 billion tons, represent a large surface
mining area. but the high moisture content (35-60%) and low heating value
render the coal uneconomic to transport over long distances. Further,
several technical and economic problems associated with development and
utilization of this type of coal remain to be tackled and solved. The
government's short- and medium-term coal development strategy has therefore
concentrated mainly on the Bukit Asam and Kalimantan sub-bituminous deposits
(paras. 1.09-1.10).  However mention must be made of a crash program of
expansion of production at Ombilin to about 1.3 million tons per year by
1989.
1.09      Work started early in 1982 n an integrated coal mining and trans-
portation project. It includes a 3.2 million ton per year coal mine at
Bukit Asam in South Sumatra, extending and upgrading the railway line from
Tanjung Enim to Panjang port, constructing a new coal loading terminal at
Tarahan near Panjang and upgrading one at Palembang, and a self-unloading
ship to carry coal across Sunda strait to the 800 MW (initial) Suralaya
power plant in West Java. This station is being constructed by the national
power entity (PLN) with assistance from the Bank under the eighth and ninth
power projects (Loan 1708-IND and Loan 1872-IND). The cost of the mining
and transportation project to be completed in 1986 is about $1,124 million.
A Bank loan of $185 million (Loan No. 2079-IND) was approved in December
1981 for this project. Loans from several foreign aid agencies and export
credit sources will meet the balance of foreign costs. Work has also
started on a new shallow mine in the adjoining Muara Tiga area to the west
of Bukit Asam to produce about 0.6 million tons per year by 1986. Tt has
the potential to produce 2.8 million tons per year and GOI plans to achieve
this by 1990. Besides these developments, which are expected to provide
enough coal for four 400 MW generating sets at Suralaya by the end of the
decade, a comprehensive coal exploration program in South Sumatra and East
Kalimantan has been initiated by the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) for
which the Bank approved a $25 million loan (2153-IND) in 1982.
1.10      The bulk of domestic coal production is expected to take place in
East and South Kalimantan. These areas have been set aside for exploration
and development by private companies. Tenders were invited in 1978 but



- 4 -
agreements were not reached until 1981 when bidders agreed to the establish-
ment of local companies and on principles of production sharing. Between
May and November 1981, the government signed three production sharing agree-
ments with joint ventures of Atlantic Richfield and Utah International of
the USA; AGIP Overseas of Italy; and of Conzino Rio-Tinto of Australia and
British Petroleum of the U.K. The agreements are patterned on those now in
successful use in the Indonesian oil sector, with the difference that the
partners get a guaranteed share in output rather than a share of gross
profits. Extensive exploration has started in the Senakin and Mahakam
areas. It is to be followed by mine development and production in the mid
1980s. The contracts provide that 13.5% of the production would be given to
PN Batubara and the balance would be exported subject to Indonesia's own
needs.  If the country requires large quantities of coal, they would be paid
for at current average sale prices in the South West Pacific Region. A
period of 8 years is specified for general surveys, exploration and
construction of mining facilities but it is expected that actual production
would start well before that, reaching up to 10 million tons per year at the
end of the 1980s. The government intends that a part of this production
should be used at the 4,000 MW (ultimate) Paiton power station in East Java,
which is planned to be commissioned in 1989. PLN is currently studying the
location of a new site for a third coal fired station located either in
Central or in West Java, to be developed by about 1992. A second round of
negotiations was started in March 1982 with 10 contenders for further
exploration and development work in Kalimantan. The coal production targets
of the private and government-owned mines in Sumatra are given in Annex 2.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.11      Indonesia's total hydroelectric energy resources are large but
its development is limited by its geographic distribution relative to demand.
The greatest potential (over 35%) lies in Irian Jaya where the current
electricity demand is less than 1%; Java, which accounts for 80% of the
current demand, has less than 10% of the total potential. Hydro resources
have an increasingly important role in electrical energy generation in the
islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. It will have
continuing significance until the 1990s in Java and some smaller islands.

1.12       The status of hydro development is summarized below.

Total technical potential                32,000              160,000
1.13       The existing installations are distributed as follows:  Java,
489 MW (includes Jatilihur, 150 MW, set up by the Jatilihur Authority as
a multiple-purpose project) and Karangates (105 MW); Sumatra, 612 MW
(including 600 MW at the Asahan site developed jointly by the governments
of Japan and Indonesia primarily for meeting the demands of an aluminum
smelter); Sulawesi 181 MW (including 165 MW at Larona I, owned by the
International Nickel Company and constructed in 1978) and Kalimantan, 30 MW.
1.14       The figures of technical potential and identified sites given in
para. 1.12 must be treated with caution as they have been derived mainly
from desk studies and some limited reconnaissance. An important basic
resource study is currently being undertaken by PLN, with the assistance of
Nippon Koei of Japan.  To remove these uncertainties, the entire data base
and all previous studies will be reviewed. PLN will then prepare (i) a
detailed inventory of sites; (ii) a priority list of schemes to be
considered for implementation by the year 2000 taking into account access to
power markets, status of electricity supply, demand growth and alternative
sources; and (iii) a program of field investigations.  The foreign cost of
this study is being financed through Loan 1365-IND for the sixth Power
project.  It is being carried out with the active involvement of a team of
about 30 of PLN's staff and an Indonesian consulting engineer (Indra Karya)
to ensure that adequate technical capabilities are developed within the
country to continue the work of hydro electric surveys and detailed
investigations after the first phase of this study is completed in August
1983. The work is progressing satisfactorily and should prepare the ground
for systematic and efficient investigations of sites yet to be developed.

1.15      Recognizing the constraints of administrative, engineering and
construction manpower, which could limit the future role of hydroelectic
energy, the government, through PLN, has entered into an innovative design-
and-construct contract for the 180 MW Mrica project in Central Java, to be
financed mainly by commercial credits. The turnkey contract was signed in
March 1982 and completion of construction is scheduled by 1988. If
the project is completed by the target date and within reasonable costs
the result could be of great significance.
1.16      There are about 45 mini-hydro stations with an aggregate capacity
of about 10 MW in operation in Indonesia today. They are distributed all
over the country, range in output from 50 kW to 1,500 kW at each site and
utilize heads varying from 3.6 m to 170 m. More than half of the total (6
MW) has been installed during the past 3 years, and was financed out of
loans from the U.K., France and Indonesia's own resources. Investment costs
range from about $800-$2,000 per kW installed at 1980 prices. A proper
survey of the potential for mini-hydro development in the country has not
been carried out but given the rugged terrain in many of the islands and the
incidence of rainfall, the scope is believed to be large. A recent study of
the North Sumatra region indicates that over 100 MW could be installed in
that region alone. GOI has assigned a high priority to accelerating
development of mini-hydro resources, perceiving it to be an economic option
in providing electricity to rural areas having a good growth potential. PLN
is currently engaged on preparation of such a plan for incorporation in
Repelita IV (1984/85-1989/80). It has requested assistance from the Bank in
implementing a pilot program with the objective of establishing standard
procedures to be followed for all future developments within two to three
years. This program will form part of the proposed project (paras. 4.17 and
4.18).
Geothermal Energy
1.17      Surface manifestation of geothermal energy sources are found on all
the major islands of Indonesia with the exception of Kalimantan. However,
only a half a dozen or so of these have been investigated thoroughly and
only one, Kamojang in West Java, has been explored sufficiently to enable its
energy potential to be classified as proven. Consequently, estimates of
geothermal reserves, all of which are owned by the state, vary considerably.
Identified reserves are currently about 1,500 MW, mostly in Java where most
of the exploration work has been carried out. It is believed that potential
reserves may approach 10,000 MW though the economic and technical
feasibility of their exploitation is not knowni at present.  Of these 5,500
MW are in Java, 1,400 MW in Sulawesi, 1,100 MW in Sumatra, and the rest
(2,000 MW) in the other islands.
1.18      Exploration began as early as 1920 but it proceeded in a slow and
sporadic manner until the early 1970s when the changing international energy

environment caused a renewed interest in geothermal resources. In 1973, a
bilateral grant from the New Zealand Government was used to develop the
geothermal resources in the Kamojang field, where a 30 MW geothermal power
plant will be in operation by December 1982. PERTAMINA, the national oil
company, is in charge of production and supply of steam to the power station
site and PLN is responsible for construction and operation of the power
station. This pattern of separate and distinct responsibilities has been
formalized in 1981 for all future geothermal developments in the country by
a Presidential Decree.  The Bank believes that this institutional arrangement
could be improved upon (see para. 4.09).
1.19      GOI has accorded geothermal energy development a high priority in
its energy program and has announced its intention to develop about 900 MW
by the end of the decade. To accelerate work it has decided to rely on
private capital and its entrepreneurial skills. Bids were invited in 1981
for development of selected areas. In February 1982 PERTAMINA signed a
30-year joint operation contract with Union Geothermal of Indonesia Ltd (a
subsidiary of Union Oil of California) to explore and develop the 56,650
hectare Salak geothermal field in West Java, wherein up to about 495 MW
could be installed in increments of 55 MW. Union Geothermal would operate
and maintain the wells, pipelines and other facilities. An energy sales
contract has been signed at the same time between PERTAMINA (which will own
the steam) and PLN (which has to install the power plant within a stipulated
time from notice by Union Geothermal). This agreement assures Union
Geothermal a price set to yield a rate of return of 20% on its estimated
development and construction costs of the Salak field at December 1980 price
levels and escalated thereafter by an agreed formula. There will be an
upper limit of not more than 80% of the fuel cost (ex Singapore) generated
by an equivalent oil fired power plant. This agreement would set the future
pattern for development of other areas such as Darajat in West Java, and
Dieng in Central Java. Some of them are expected to be put out to bid
shortly. The Union agreement provides certain work programs and time
targets but actual plant construction would depend on the results of ongoing
drilling. The first generating set at Salak is expected to commence
operation in 1989.
1.20      Simultaneously with the major expansion programs described in
para. 1.19 GOI intends to use its own funds and borrowings to expand its
activities at Kamojang where drilling has established that it is feasible to
expand the station by 110 MW by the end of 1986. It has requested Bank
assistance in this regard. Because it may be difficult to attract foreign
investments for smaller geothermal developments, and especially for
developments on the other islands, GOI feels that it should continue to
build up its own expertise, particularly at Kamojang, where it has invested
considerable funds and carried out extensive work already. The Bank agrees



-8-
with this approach. The Kamojang extensions will form part of the proposed
project (paras. 4.02 and 4.04).
1.21      Meeting the ambitious targets set for this decade will require
additional local and foreign resource mobilization and a considerable
strengthening of the technical and managerial expertise of the institutions
involved in geothermal development (see paras. 4.06(iv), 4.08(iii) and 4.09).
Nuclear Power
1.22      Since 1976 several studies have been carried out on the need for
nuclear power in Java. The most recent study carried out by NIRA-ENEL of
Italy in 1981 concluded that introduction of the first nuclear power station
with a 636 MWe CANDU type reactor by FY89/90 would be feasible.  GOI has,
however decided to defer action on this recommendation for a few years. It
has recently ordered a small (50 MW) reactor for experimental use. PLN's
latest development plans assume that no large nuclear power stations would
be operational before 1996/97.
Non-Commercial Sources
1.23.     Non-commercial fuels (fuelwood and agricultural wastes) contri-
buted over 60% of total energy in 1960 but its share declined to just under
half now. These fuels are almost entirely used in rural areas. Forests
cover 64% of the land surface areas constituting biomass capacity far in
excess of current usage. However, demand is heavily concentrated in Java
and as a result there have been increased instances of deforestation there.
About 16 million tons of logs are exported annually from Kalimantan and
Sulawesi rainforests and provide the second largest source of export
earnings. A substantial increase in indigenous milling industries, which
would result in substantial quantities of residues, is expected. Agricul-
tural residues (from coconuts, paddy, cassava, etc) contribute an equally
large source which accounts for almost all the biomass production in Java.
1.24      Precise and reliable information on the sources and distribution
of noncommercial energy sources are not yet available despite some recent
surveys. Further studies are needed to refine them. They are relevant
because of apparent trends of substitution by kerosine, whose consumption
has been increasing by about 10% annually causing concern because of the
heavy subsidies involved. The extent to which rural electrification could
have a beneficial impact also requires examination in this context.
C. Organization of the Energy Sector
1.25      In May 1978, the MME was established as part of a general reor-
ganization of government departments to coordinate all activities in the
energy sector. MME has overall responsibility for mining, oil, natural gas
and electricity. It controls the state enterprises responsible for the



- 9 -
execution of the government policies in the energy subsectors - e.g. the
national oil and gas entity (PERTAMINA), the coal agencies (PN Batubara and
PT Bukit Asam) and PLN. The Ministry is still in the process of developing
its organization to fulfill its role in the energy sector. MME's
organization chart is shown in Annex 3.
1.26      GOI has established a Technical Committee on Energy Resources.
The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee are the MME's Directors-
General of Oil and Gas and of Electric Power (DGEP), respectively. A
Permanent Committee on energy problems has also been formed by the minister
and entrusted with the tasks of assessing energy technologies, dealing with
day-to-day energy problems and preparing long-term projections for demand and
supply. A ministerial level National Energy Board (BAKOREN) has recently
been formed to review proposals emerging from the technical committee and
eventually to establish a more clearly defined energy policy with specific
implementation instructions to the ministries concerned. It is now
functioning actively. Perhaps one of the most important of these
organizational steps was the establishment of a unit for energy planning in
the MME, under the control of DGEP.
D. Bank Role and Strategy in the Energy Sector
1.27      The Bank has been actively involved in some of the sector devel-
opments described above. Further, during 1981, at the invitation of GOI
the Bank/UNDP carried out a detailed assessment of the Indonesian energy
sector, identifying policy options and analyzing investment priorities to
provide a framework for technical assistance and advice to GOI on
institutional aspects. The results have been incorporated in a report (No.
3453, August 1981) entitled "Indonesia - Issues and Options in the Energy
Sector." This report confirms earlier findings that alternatives for oil
must be developed quickly for electricity generation, and recommends that
this should be extended to industry, transportation and'households. It
further points out that subsidized oil prices, weak institutions, manpower
shortages and a lack of detailed energy sector planning remain the chief
obstacles to rapid substitution of oil. The Bank is currently carrying out
further studies on the following selected issues (i) welfare implications of
eliminating energy subsidies; (ii) the demand for energy by the household
sector; (iii) energy needs and problems of rural households and industries
and economics of rural electrification.
1.28      In 1979, in the context of the seventh power project (Loan
1513-IND), GOT and PLN agreed that tariffs for electricity should reflect
long-run marginal costs (LRMC) as closely as possible. In 1980, in the
context of the ninth power project (Loan 1872-IND), the GOI agreed in
principle to the eventual elimination of all energy subsidies, subject to
the consumers' ability to pay. Domestic oil price increases of about 50% in
May 1980 and about 60% in January 1982 have since reduced the oil subsidies



- 10 -
significantly.  The prices of some petroleum products e.g.  gasoline, have
now risen close to international levels but others, notably, kerosene, fuel
oil and diesel oil are still far below them, involving continuing government
subsidies.  The Bank is currently carrying out follow-up studies (para.
1.27) and will seek further improvements in this situation in the context of
future energy sector lending operations.
1.29       The Bank is now providing help to the energy planning unit of the
1MME by financing the services of a few experts through the tenth power
project, (Loan 1950-IND).  The seventh power project (Loan 1513-IND) will
design and install a management information system for DGEP activities and
assist it in ensuring that future development programs in the electricity
sector are consistent with national policy objectives.  A contract for this
task was negotiated late in 1981 with a consultant, PA International of
U.K., and this work is now underway. Further strengthening of energy sector
institutions will be sought through future Bank loans for subsector projects
and/or programs. These loans will include components for training to
alleviate the current manpower shortages.
1.30       The magnitude of investments necessary to implement GOI's policy
of diversification of energy sources is large.  The Bank estimates that the
annual investments in the sector will increase from about $1.27 billion in
1980 to about $10 billion (at 1980 levels) in the year 2000. About half of
these will be directly in the electricity subsector. The Bank's lending
strategy for the energy sector that has emerged from the study referred to
in para. 1.27 is to continue its support for investment programs in the
electricity and coal sectors during the next few years with a focus on steps
to overcome the constraints of subsidized fuel prices, institutional
weaknesses and manpower shortages.
E. The Electricity Subsector
1.31       The Electricity subsector is regulated by MME through DGEP.  It
comprises (i) PLN, (ii) captive plants installed by private parties for
their own use, (iii) some small municipal franchises, and (iv) a small
number of cooperatives which were set up to provide electricity in certain
rural areas remote from PLN supply systems. Legislation was enacted in 1979
to provide for private and cooperative franchise participation in the elec-
tricity sector.
1.32       DGEP.  Since its inception in 1978 DGEP has been responsible for
electricity policy in the country. Until its establishment, PLN had been
responsible for giving advice to the Minister on sector policy and for
planning and licensing. Legislation enacted in 1979 transferred these
responsibilities, particularly in policy planning, licensing of franchises,
and general supervision of the sector from PLN to DGEP.



- 11 -
1.33      PLN.  PLN was first formed in 1961 when three Dutch-owned electri-
city utility companies were nationalized but its growth as an effective
modern organization started around 1972 when its status was changed from
that of a department of a ministry to a public corporation and foreign
financing became available for its urgently needed rehabilitation of exist-
ing systems and for its expansion programs. PLN now has 3.3 million con-
sumers and provides about 70% of the total electricity consumed in the
country.  It has made impressive progress during the past decade.  The
improvement is discernible not only in the trend of PLN's sales growth - an
average of about 22% p.a. since 1978, but also in the decline in the growth
of captive (oil-consuming) private generating plants, whose total capacity
rivalled that of PLN in the mid-1970s (and was growing faster) and is now
virtually halted in areas (e.g. Java) where public supply has proved its
reliability (para. 1.34).
1.34      Captive Plants.  UJntil the mid-1970s public sector development was
severely constrained mainly because of lack of finance.  Consequently PLN
could not meet the demand for electricity with any reliability.  Captive
plants therefore grew rapidly.  The total capacity of such plants is
currently about 2 ,000 MW compared to 2 ,994 MIW of PLN.  Most of the plants
are small diesel installations with a few larger gas turbines. During
1973-76, the average annual growth rate of captive plant was 15 percent (with
a peak of 22 percent in 1975).  Since then the growth rate has fallen rapidly
to an average of about 4 percent during 1976-79 (Annex 4). It has been
negligible since then.  This is a direct consequence of the rapid augmenta-
tion of PLN's system capacity, significant improvements in reliability
standards and positive marketing measures.  It is PLN's policy when connect-
ing owners of captive plant to allow such plant to remain in use as reserve
until the end of its economic life.  Some captive plants will continue to be
installed, as PLN's investment program is not large enough to meet the entire
demand at all locations in the country; but the rate of growth is likely to
remain well below five percent.
Rural Electrification (RE)
1.35      As explained in para. 2.02, access to electricity supply is still
very limited in Indonesia.  This is true both of urban areas and more so of
rural areas.  There are an estimated 60 ,000 villages, less than 10% of which
have electricity. As about 80% of the population live in these villages GOI
attaches high priority to RE and it is expected that the Repelita IV (1984/85
to 1989/90) target will be substantially higher than in the preceeding one
(4,700 villages).  Several Indonesian agencies are presently involved in RE.
They are PLN (which carries the bulk of the responsibility), the Director
General of Cooperatives, regional agencies and some private parties.  Donor
countries such as the USA and Holland have made concessionary finance and
technical assistance available.  The costs of ongoing projects are high



- 12 -
and there is little evidence of their profitability.  The programs bear the
stamp of the experiences of donor countries elsewhere and have been slow in
getting off the ground and making the expected impact. The poor institu-
tional base and the absence, so far, of productive uses for electricity,
e.g. pumping for irrigation, or village industries, have been the main
limiting factors. However there is evidence that a greater number of
households than originally expected are connecting up, spending a larger
proportion of income on energy. The implications of this require further
study. While the Bank has been keeping in close touch with these
developments, it has not been actively involved in investments.  The main
focus is expected to remain on the policy side, particularly through
discussions in connection with studies of economics of RE mentioned in para.
1.27.
1.36      Any strategy for RE in Indonesia must recognize (a) the very
different pattern of population distribution in Java (where habitations are
practically contiguous) compared with the other islands where they are
dispersed into distinct villages; (b) the state of development of public
supply systems, which are the only ones likely to conform to the national
energy policy (paras. 1.01 and 1.27); and (c) the status of institutional
development. Java is far better placed for rapid development of RE because
of the existence of a main grid (para. 3.12) and the ongoing extension of
the 20 kV backbone distribution system (paras. 4.12 and 4.13). However, RE
in Java will be so closely interwoven with the development of the main
electricity system as to be physically indistinguishable.  In the other
islands, almost all extensions of electricity outside the few main urban
centers, at the present stage of development, would fall in the category of
rural electrification. Institutionally, PLN is the most effective agency in
the power sector for the construction of RE systems but it is clearly
over-extended. Its obligations on the financial side, as set by GOI and
international institutions, further limit its participation on RE on a large
scale. It follows that the establishment of new institutions, both for
financing RE and for operating RE systems, is a prerequisite for any
large-scale RE programs, particularly outside Java, and this will take time.
In Java, it is essential to work through PLN, if necessary separating RE
activities (in a financial, rather than technical sense). In this context,
the results of ongoing studies at para. 1.27 are awaited. The Bank will
then decide on a strategy for its involvement.
F. Bank Role and Strategy in the Electricity Subsector
1.37      The Bank strategy in the electricity subsector has been to assist
PLN in its institutional growth and to support its development program.  It
has already provided $1,290 million through eleven projects in generation,
transmission and distribution. In view of PLN's impressive progress during
the last decade, the size of its investment program and the greater need in
the future to influence policy in the entire energy sector, the Bank plans



- 13 -
to move towards subsector lending as rapidly as possible.  The timing would
depend on:
(a) the progress made by GOI and PLN on measures agreed during the
eleventh power project (Loan 2056) to prepare short and medium
term financing plans for PLN's investment program to provide
adequate assurances on availability of funds;
(b) improvements in PLN's planning capability on the basis of measures
agreed in connection with the tenth power project (Loan 1950);
(c) improvements in construction management on the basis of studies
initiated through the eighth power project (Loan 1708); and
(d) changes to be agreed under the proposed project in the organization
and methods of procurement of goods and services (para. 3.23).
The electricity subsector continues to be a major focus of the Bank's
lending program in Indonesia representing about 20% of its value. The next
loan (the thirteenth) in FY84 will be for the 500 MW Cirata hydroelectric
project whose preparatory work is well advanced.  It will be appraised in
December - January 1983.  Feasibility studies have been recently conpleted
on the new coal fired thermal station in East Java and detailed engineering
is due to start shortly. Studies on other alternative projects are also
under way to enable timely decisions on future projects which the Bank will
assist.
II.  THE POWER MARKET AND THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
A. Status of Surveys
2.01      Several attempts were made during the 1970s to prepare a meaning-
ful demand forecast for the Indonesian power sector in a difficult situation
characterized by very low per capita consumption levels (on the order of 10-14
kWh), haphazard development of captive plants (para. 1.34) and imperfect
records.  The most useful of these was the study carried out for Java in
1974-76 by consultants financed by IDA Credit 399 for the third power
project. Similar studies have recently been made for the islands of
Sulawesi and Bali and other areas in Sumatra.  Thus about 90% of PLN's market
has been reasonably surveyed.  During the negotiations of the tenth power
project (Loan 1950-IND) PLN agreed to build up its own expertise to keep
these studies updated and to extend them throughout the country. PLN has
recently established a new sub-division in the Planning Directorate for
power market surveys.  The work will be carried out both at the headquarters
and the wilayah (regional) levels.  PLN has recently built up a data base
from billing records. Consultants have been selected to assist PLN in this
work.  Their services would be financed out of Loan 1950-IND.  To improve
the quality of PLN's future surveys, DGEP of MiE has undertaken to provide



- 14 -
PLN with guidelines on national energy policies and firm data on energy
availability, energy usage and pricing policies as these would influence the
future demand for electricity although its capability to do this will be
incomplete until its information system (para. 1.29) is installed and fully
operational. New forecasts are now being compiled. Until they are available
surveys carried out earlier by consultants and updated by PLIN (para. 2.03)
constitute the basis for planning the development of Indonesia's power
sector. This is acceptable.
B. Present Consumption and Access to Service
2.02       The per capita consumption of electricity in Indonesia is very low
at about 85 kWh (FY82). This compares with about 800 kWh in Malaysia and
about 300 kWh in the Philippines and Thailand. Only about 9.4% of all the
households have access to electricity though in electrified urban areas
about 40-60% of the households have been connected.  The degree of electri-
fication in different regions varies, being about 10% of households in Java,
7.8% in Sumatra, 9.8% in Kalimantan, 10.3% in Sulawesi and about 5.8% in the
other islands.
C. Projections of PLN's Sales
2.03       The initial results of the Java study (para. 2.01) suggested that
the magnitude of the underlying demand was so large that annual growth rates
of public electricity supply would have to be on the order of 30-35% during
FY76-85, compared with historic rates of 10-12%.  It was recognized, however,
that PLN's sales in Java could not rise quickly to such levels and that, in
the short and medium term, the growth of sales would depend on the rate at
which PLN could build up its facilities and meet an increasing proportion of
the existing demand.  In the longer term, PLN sales would reflect more
closely the growth of the power market itself.  Extensive discussion of these
forecasts and their assumptions and methodology took place during the period
1977-79 and eventually agreement was reached between GOI and the Bank on the
sales forecasts to be adopted in Java for planning purposes up to 1990.  The
development program for electric power incorporated in Repelita III is based
on these and PLN's estimates for the other islands. PLN increased its sales
during the period 1978 to 1982 by an average of about 22% per year (Annex
5).  Its future targets are given in para. 2.04.  PLN is now poised to meet
them.



- 15 -
2.04       PLN's energy sales targets are summarized below:

90   24,185       10,680      34,865      17.4
D. Connection Program
2.05      As a necessary instrument of meeting its sales targets, PLN agreed
with the Bank in 1978 that it would prepare and actively implement a
consumer connection program consistent with its improving capabilities. The
growth of PLN's consumers, connected load and sales since 1976 are
summarized in Annex 5.
2.06       PLN exceeded its customer connection targets each year from FY78
through FY80, but energy sales grew rather less rapidly. In FY81 energy
sales growth overtook that of both connections and connected load, reflecting
mainly the diminishing use of captive plant by PLN's industrial consumers.
Targets for FY82 have been met.
2.07       In some of the wilayahs, notably East Java and North Sumatra, the
results of PLN's efforts at expediting consumer connections have been
striking.  For example, in East Java the growth rates in FY79  to FY81
were 30%, 36% and 33% respectively. These growth rates give some indica-
tions of the extent to which potential demand exceeds PLN's near-term sales
targets.  Of more immediate concern is the fact that growth rates of new
connections are ahead of PLN's capacity to provide adequate and reliable
supplies.  In particular, the gains made so far need to be urgently
consolidated, but equal, if not greater, emphasis needs to be given to
programs for improving operational reliability and reducing system losses.
These needs will be addressed under the proposed project (para. 4.14).



- 16 -
E. Long-term Development Program
2.08      On the basis of its forecast of power sales, PLN prepares annually
a long-term development plan to cover the projected requirements of genera-
tion, transmission, distribution and other facilities. The latest plan
finalised in October 1980, covers a 12 year development period from FY82/83
to FY93/94.  In the past, least cost investment programs for generation,
transmission and distribution were planned with the help of consultants.
PLN has recently developed in-house capability for carrying out least cost
generation planning studies itself with computer modelling which is utilized
to review and update the Java generation plan. Java accounts for about 60%
of Indonesia's population (1980 census) and 80% of PLN's sales.  The
development plan has been formulated to achieve the following objectives:
(a) optimize resource utilization by substituting coal for oil, by greater
exploitation of hydro and geothermal resources for power generation and by
reducing the use of fuel inefficient installations; (b) realize economies of
scale by larger sized installations; (c) achieve operational economy by
coordinating the utilization of plants through interconnected operations;
and (d) provide acceptable standards of reliability of supply.  The plan
represents a significant improvement over previous versions.  Last year, in
the context of the eleventh power project GOI/PLN agreed to further
refinements in the planning process which would subject plans optimized on
technical and economic criteria to tests of financial feasibility.  In recent
years, systematic planning of power generation has been extended to the other
islands, but further work is needed on the optimisation of the associated
transmission systems.
2.09       PLN's 12-year development plan is summarized in Table 2.2 below.

2.10      The details of the generation expansion program in Java and other
islands are given in Annexes 6 and 7 respectively. It should be noted that
coal-fired steam, hydro-electric, and geothermal plants will register the
greatest growth in a program which will increase generating capacity about
six and one-half times. These sources, which presently account for only
18.6% of the total generating capacity will increase their share to over 70%
by 1993/94. Oil accounted for about 80% of PLN's energy generation during
1981/82. Its share will decline to about 20% in 1993/94 (See Annex 8).
2.11      PLN's 12-year investment program (1982/83-1993/94) is thus the
most vital part of GOI's program of diversification of energy sources away
from oil. Details are given in Annex 9. The program is fully justified.
In physical terms its implementation would be manageable in Java, because of
the choice of large sized (400 MW) thermal generating sets with no more than
one per year being installed at each site, and the resort to diversified
construction arrangements for geothermal and hydro-electric site (paras.
1.15 and 1.18). The latest plans for the other islands are more ambitious
and aim at removing the present imbalance between electricity consumption in
Java and the other islands by the end of the decade. Some slippages in this
program are likely. The annual investment (at 1982 prices) would be about
$2 billion in 1983/84 increasing gradually to about $2.5 billion at the end
of the decade. PLN has to strengthen itself to achieve these investment
targets; GOI would also have to consider relaxing some of its procedures
(para. 3.03) and controls (para. 3.04) for PLN to carry out these
expenditures.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
3.01      The beneficiary of the proposed loan would be PLN, the government-
owned national power utility.
A. Legal Status and Responsibility
3.02      PLN was constituted by Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1972 as a
public corporation with sole responsibility in the country for planning,
construction and operation of facilities for generation, transmission and
distribution of electricity. It was also responsible for licensing the
operation of electricity generating installations by private parties (though
imports of plant are authorized by a coordination board for industrial
development). In 1979, GOI amended PLN's charter giving MME the pivotal
role of policy and planning in the electricity sector and the responsibility
for licensing. The 1979 regulations also provided for the establishment,
under license from MME, of private entities and cooperatives in the hope of
accelerating the pace of expansion of electricity supply as needed. However
none has been licensed so far. Due to shortage of staff in the MME, PLN
continues to handle its former responsibilities for licensing operation of
privately owned plants on behalf of the MME.



- 18 -
3.03      PLN participates effectively in the national economic planning
process. Financially, PLN is expected to cover all operation and
maintenance costs (including depreciation and financing costs) from current
revenues and to generate a contribution to the financing of its expansion
programs (para. 5.08). PLN's major policies and programs - including its
investment plans, budgets and tariffs - are subject to review by a
supervisory board, established in 1981 and chaired by the DGEP and
ultimately to approval by GOI. Apart from the undesirable constraint of the
GOI capital budget system on PLN's financial management, the supervisory
arrangements appear to work smoothly, if slowly.
3.04      PLN is also bound by a number of recent procurement control
procedures affecting all public sector enterprises. Of particular
importance are those set out in Presidential Decrees 10 and 14A of 1980,
relating to the award of procurement contracts and for the award of
consultants' contracts. The application of these new procedures took time
and have added significantly to the delays encountered in projects assisted
by the past power loans from the Bank. Recent experiences in power project
delays were reviewed by the Bank appraisal mission in May 1982 with the
Secretary of the Procurement Control Team (SEKNEG) set up under Presidential
Decree 10 and some progress was made in identifying problem areas (para.
3.24). Remedies should be devised between the Bank and GOI as a country
matter through ongoing discussions.
Organization and Management
3.05      PLN's organization chart is at Annex 10.  PLN's operations are
managed by a board of directors headed by a President-Director who is
appointed by the President and is responsible to the Minister of Mines and
Energy. The board includes 5 directors, respectively of planning, con-
struction, operations, finance and administration, who are all responsible
to the President-Director. The President-Director is the chief executive
empowered to issue directives, supervise and guide the work of directors and
managers responsible to him. Responsibility for major construction work
devolves from the board as a whole to 12 project managers, and for opera-
tions (and minor construction work) from the board to 16 regional (wilayah)
managers and the manager of the new all-Java load despatch center. Also
responsible to the board are 3 staff departments respectively for power
research, education and training, and management services, and an audit
unit - the corporation inspectorate. The management services and corpora-
tion inspectorate units are additions decreed by the Minister of Mines and
Energy in September 1981 to enable PLN to cope better with current respon-
sibilities. However they have not yet been established.
3.06      The minister's decree of September 1981 also redefines the
responsibilities of PLN's five main directorates. In particular, it unifies
responsibility for all aspects of financial control.  The function of
corporate planning has been added. PLN is still implementing these changes
which should eventually make for better management. However, they do not



- 19 -
deal with the crucial management problems which are associated with the
construction of major projects.  These need to be addressed if PLN's
excellent growth record during the past four years is to be maintained as is
planned during the next few years.
3.07      It is becoming increasingly evident that, contrary to the impres-
sions of delegated authority conveyed by the organizational structure,
construction project managers of PLN are not actually in a position to take
full responsibility for the progress of their projects. In fact, there is
little that they can do in the initial stages, until contracts are awarded
by the plann5ng department; heavy procurement responsibilities are not
usually part of the work of planning departments in developed electricity
utilities (see para. 3.23). Even during the later contruction stages,
construction and finance directorates have overlapping responsibilities with
the project managers and, in effect, retain the dominant roles. They
intervene in a degree of detail which inhibits initiative, invites delay and
risks becoming a serious hindrance to progress on the scale required in
future. The problems are exemplified by experience on the eighth power
project (Suralaya thermal power stations). Noting lack of clear responsi-
sibility and the potential for serious delays when work was initiated in
1978, the Bank required as a condition of this loan (1708-IND), that the PLN
board should nominate one of its directors to be specifically responsible
for coordination of all construction activities.  PLN agreed and the board
nominated the director of planning for this role. Nevertheless, delays of
15 months have already occurred while the project is still in the early
stages of construction, with a consequent lowering of PLN's sales targets in
Java during 1983 and 1984. While some of the delays are due to unexpected
site construction problems and contractor's inefficiencies, there have also
been instances, e.g., delays in initiating procurement action on the short
(17 km), but crucial, 150 kV line required for testing of auxilliary
systems, where PLN's planning directorate was responsible. There are other
anomalies in the present organizational structure. For example, design is
treated as a function of the construction directorate and is done mainly by
consultants and not by PLN. The time is now appropriate for a review of the
present organizational structure for better management of construction with
greater de facto delegation of responsibilities and authority to the project
managers (para. 3.08), and for PLN to become more self reliant in
engineering as it aspires to and needs to become (para. 3.17(b)).
3.08      Under the eighth power project (Loan 1708-IND) the Bank has
provided $2.5 million for the foreign costs of consultancy assistance to
improve PLN's project management capability. There were considerable delays
in abortive contract-negotiations on remuneration rates with the selected
construction firm.  To avoid furtlher loss of time, the Bank agreed to this
work being assigned to the consultant retained for the power sector manage-
ment information systems (para. 1.29). The project management study started
in April 1982, and is to be completed in 18 months. The mission expects



- 20 -
this study to result, inter alia, in recommendations on measures to deal
effectively with the problem of delegation of appropriate responsibilities
and authority to project managers, referred to in para. 3.07 above.
3.09      On the operational side, the principle of greater decentralization
to the regions has already been accepted by PLN and GOI. It is intended
that head office control of regional operations will focus increasingly on
performance as measured by certain key physical and financial performance
indicators with a consequent relaxation of detailed supervision. In
preparation for greater decentralized management, first and second level
regional managers have attended management development courses. It is
recognized that this change will be slow and that the speed with which
operational responsibility can be fully delegated with safety will vary from
one region to another.
3.10      The eleventh power project (loan 2056-IND of FY82) provides
$0.6 million for the foreign costs of further management consultancy *to
assist in setting up the accounting and financial control systems necessary
to support a decentralized form of management, and in developing appropriate
performance indicators. Other measures to strengthen PLN's planning include
the integration of financial planning with its technical planning procedures,
and preparation of 5-year financing plans, as agreed in the context of the
eleventh power project.
C. Present Facilities
3.11      Until the early 1970s, PLN's expansion was severely restricted
because of the lack of foreign exchange in the country. A crash program
then resulted in gas turbines being preferred; currently they comprise about
25% of total capacity. The imbalance in plant is being corrected with the
commissioning of 1,000 MW of new steam capacity during 1981-83. Currently,
PLN has about 3,000 MW of installed generating capacity - 1150 MW of steam
(oil-fired), 800 MW of gas turbines, 500 MW of diesel and the balance
in hydroelectric installations.
3.12      PLN operates about 6,400 km of transmission lines at 70 and 150 kV
and about 50,000 km of distribution lines, the bulk of which are in Java.
About 2,000 km of 150 kV transmission under construction are scheduled for
completion by 1982. Java will have an interconnected grid at 150 kV by
1983. By 1984, a 500 kV system effectively linking West and Central Java
will be commissioned; it will be extended to East Java by 1986.
D. Manpower
3.13      PLN now has a staff of about 32,100, 19,700 of whom are employed
in technical and 12,400 in administrative jobs. About 21,000 of these are
on the permanent payroll. A manpower study carried out late in 1981 by



- 21 -
Electricite de France (EdF) confirmed PLN's own projections of manpower
growth over the next decade. By 1985/86 the labor force will number 42,000
of whom 25,900 would be technical and by 1991 these figures will increase to
54,500 and 33,400 respectively. These estimates are acceptable.
3.14      PLN has had no difficulty in recruiting staff at levels up to
technical high school, but the proportion of technical graduates at only 4%
of the total, is unusually low for an electricity utility. It needs to be
raised considerably, particularly if PLN seriously intends to limit its
reliance on foreign consultants. Though it has been sponsoring 30-40
student scholarships annually to meet the need for graduates it has had
difficulty in recruiting them. Recently, PLN has started recruitment of
technical graduates working elsewhere, expecting to retrain them in
electricity work, but a long-term program is clearly needed. The Bank is
considering assistance in this area as part of a comprehensive education
project to be taken up in the near future.
E. Training
3.15      PLN has a separate center, known as Pusdiklat, for education and
training (para. 3.05). Its staff of about 200, including 48 trained
instructors, manage various training centers and programs and play an
important supporting role. The Bank accorded high priority to training in
its earlier lending operations starting in 1973 with the establishment of
six training centers. They now train/retrain about 1,300 personnel annu-
ally, providing induction training to new technical recruits and financial/
administrative training to others. The centers were set up with EdF acting
as consultants and have adequately met requirements of existing smaller
installations and systems. As these were due to be replaced by larger ther-
mal power stations, and existing power systems would be overlain by
extra-high voltage power systems,. special training programs were arranged
under the fourth (Loan 1127-IND), sixth (Loan 1365-IND), seventh (Loan
1513-IND), and eighth (Loan 1708-IND) power projects for training thermal
power station operators and supervisors. These culminated in the program
under the ninth power project (Loan 1872-IND), which provides for an advanced
training school (now under construction at Suralaya in West Java for
commencement in 1983/84), which includes a fascimile digital training
simulator. It will upgrade existing training facilities for thermal station
operators at Tanjung Priok. About 300 such personnel have been trained so
far and now hold key positions at the 500 MW Muara Karang (West Java) and
Gresik (East Java) thermal stations. More are under training in operation
of very large generating units (400 MW) to meet future needs. Additionally,
training is being arranged in Canada under the ninth power project in the
fields of system protection, design of thermal stations, their special
maintenance problems, and in extra-high voltage (500 kV) practice. TJnder
the tenth power project (Loan 1950-IND) on-the-job training is being
arranged in the country, with the help of consultants in selected areas,
e.g., civil works contract administration, power system planning and
operation, and power market surveys. These programs have been proceeding
reasonably satisfactorily.



- 22 -
3.16      A review of PLN's training program was carried out in the context
of the proposed project. It was based on PLN's future plans and on a
preliminary report prepared by EdF which outlined a 10-year strategy of
manpower development and training. While being appreciative of the
appropriateness of the ongoing programs, the equipment and facilities, a
number of useful recommendations have emerged:
(a)  A major effort will be necessary in reorganizing and enlarging
the entire manpower development, training and personnel manage-
ment functions so as to enable PLN's human resources to be
fully and effectively utilized. Five more training centers
are necessary to meet future requirements at middle and lower
echelons;
(b)  An improved system of job-performance evaluation is needed which
ties in with a career development policy (to be developed) and
enables potential managers to be identified at an early stage;
(c)  Management training is not carried out in-house.  There is
need for PLN, with the help of a specialist, to introduce a
system whereby managerial candidates, once identified, can be
given appropriate in-house training and career development
assignments;
(d)  A thorough analysis of all jobs performed by staff at all
levels is needed to enumerate the skill requirements of each
task as an aid to further improvements in identification of
training needs; and
(e)  Senior technical staff lack certain skills in planning, design,
project management, and operation of extra-high voltage sys-
tems. The EdF study does not identify the training needs to
develop such high-level technical staff. Unless this particular
need is tackled vigorously, PLN will find itself increasingly
dependent on consultants (para. 3.07).
3.17      The following lines of action are recommended as part of the
proposed project:
(a)  To deal with items 3.16(a)(b)(c) and (d), the proposed project
will include a training component (para. 4.20) for (i) training
equipment and materials, (ii) technical assistance in strength-
ening its personnel management, and (iii) overseas fellowships
for middle- and upper-level managers to develop skills
required;
(b)  In regard to item 3.16 (e), an assurance was obtained from
PLN that it will prepare not later than by December 31, 1983 an
adequate



- 23 -
training/development program for PLNs senior technical staff
(including, as may be necessary, appropriate training assistance
provided by or in overseas electricity companies) and promptly
thereafter initiate this program in consultation with the Bank
(Sect. 3.07 of the draft Project Agreement); and
(c) establish a mechanism by which the training center, Pusdiklat,
reports to the Director of Administration to ensure optimum
coordination between PLN's training and overall manpower
development programs.
F. Research
3.18      PLN has established a power research center (the LMK), which
includes a high voltage testing laboratory. The institute, which conducts
applied research in power associated areas, has a staff of 278, including
87 graduates.  It carries out useful work in some areas, e.g., testing of
relays, etc., where PLN has to build up specialized skills.
G. Accounting and Audit
3.19      PLN prepares its financial statements according to generally
accepted accounting principles and normal utility practice. Assets in use
are revalued from time to time according to indices published by the
Ministry of Finance, and annual depreciation charges are revised accord-
ingly. The last revaluation was carried out in FY80. PLN's accounting
system was installed by consultants in the early 1970s and, while it has
generally served the company's needs well, it is now in urgent need of over-
haul. With the expansion of PLN's operations and the proliferation of
accounting units, preparation of financial statements is increasingly
delayed by cumbersome and time-consuming procedures.  Furthermore, the trend
towards increased decentralization of management functions (paras. 3.07-3.09
will call for some restructuring of the system so that adequate financial
information is available to local managers in a timely manner. These
problems are to be addressed in the management consulting assistance
provided under the eleventh power project (Loan 2056-IND) contracts for
which are currently awaiting GOI approval. The same assignment will also
review the desirability of extending the use of computer facilities in
accounting and financial control systems.
3.20      Audit of PLN's accounts by the Directorate General of State
Financial Control is prescribed by PLN's charter.  The Directorate General
follows the standards of the International Accounting Standards Committee
and the International Auditing Guidelines of the International Federation of
Accountants and their audit reports are acceptable to the Bank, but are
subject to increasing delay as a result of the problems affecting PLN's
accounting system. PLN also has an effective internal audit group reporting
to the president director which carries out various special investigations
in addition to keeping general accounting matters under review.



- 24 -
H. Insurance
3.21      PLN carries motor vehicle insurance, and transit and marine
insurance on equipment and materials in transit. Fire and other hazards are
self-insured. In view of the geographical spread of PLN's assets, any
single loss would be relatively small by comparison with total assets and
operations, and this policy is therefore considered satisfactory.
I. Procurement
3.22      Procurement of goods and services has a major influence on PLN's
overall performance in project implementation. It is particularly crucial
it a time when PLN launches construction of major projects in the shortest
possible time periods to keep pace with exceptionally high growth targets.
However, as explained in para. 3.04, procedures introduced by GOI in 1980
and 1981 for external control of procurement of both consultants services
and of goods and services have reduced PLN's autonomy in procurement.
During the past 2 years there has been increasing evidence that the gains in
timely preparatory work on appointment of consultants and bidding on the
eighth, ninth and tenth power projects were all but lost partly because of
delays in approval of contract awards by authorities outside PLN. In other
cases, PLN's internal evaluation systems could also be faulted. In any
case, these have resulted in some avoidable construction delays (para.
3.28). During the appraisal of the proposed project, attention has been
given to both internal procedures within PLN and problems of external
control of procurement (paras. 3.23/ 3.24).
3.23      Bank staff carried out a detailed review in January 1982 of PLN's
internal procurement procedures in the context of its investment program.
The findings and recommendations for improvement were placed on the project
file.  The recommendations included discontinuation of PLN's system of
preparation of joint bid evaluation reports which makes it impossible to pin
responsibility between PLN and its consultants for imperfections which are
seen as a significant cause of delays in subsequent approvals of contract
awards. Agreement on this was obtained during negotiations. (Sect. 3.06 of
the Draft Project Agreement). Staff recommendations also included
consolidation of procurement activities, presently spread over three
directorates, into a centralized procurement directorate. However, the
organization of procurement is currently under review (inter alia) by
consultants in the context of the project management study (para. 3.08).
During negotiations it was agreed that PLN would prepare a plan of action
no later than January 1, 1984 to improve the efficiency of procurement
administration and will implement such a plan after its review by the Bank.
3.24      The opportunity of a post-appraisal mission in May 1982 was taken
to discuss with SEKNEG the effect of delays in approval of awards on some
recent power projects, notably the ninth and tenth power projects.
Recommendations were made by the mission that SEKNEG should ensure that its



- 25 -
activities in controlling procurement should not disregard the critical
programs of construction as these lead both to direct increases in cost (of
which examples were given) and delays in project completion with even more
serious consequential costs.  It is believed that these were noted for
future use.  As pointed out in para.  3.04, concrete corrective action must
be sought as a country matter. The Bank is of the view that PLN can hardly
be expected to implement its entire investment program in time without
greater autonomy in handling procurement than it currently enjoys.
J. Overall Performance of PLN
3.25      PLN's overall performance during the past 4 years, 1977/78 to
1981/82, has been impressive.  Its sales increased annually by an average
of 22% and performance indicators such as the number of consumers per employee
and the energy sold per employee rose 50% in this period.  Its ambitious
customer connection programs were fulfilled year after year.  Access to
service increased by about 50%.  Standards of reliability of supply were
improved. The growth of uneconomic captive plants in the country declined
after 1977 and seems to have been virtually eliminated. Long waiting lists
for new service connections assure a large market for PLN which in the next
few years will be limited only by its capacity to expand its systems. On
the financial side its performance has continued to grow strongly (para.
5.03) reflecting mainly the growth of sales. But its tariff levels are low
(about 70% of the long run marginal cost) and a new approach to funding its
investment program is now necessary (paras. 5.08-5.09).  Improvements in the
speed of implementation of projects reported a year ago (SAR No. 3468 on the
eleventh power project) have been eroded by slippages of over a year in
construction of major thermal projects like Muara Karang, Semarang and
Suralaya (para. 3.28). They have inhibited current sales and will limit
PLN's sales increases in Java until 1985/86. PLN's loss reduction drive
appears to have run out of momentum (para. 4.14) and it has been reported by
consultants that unless specific measures are taken overall system losses
may increase. The proposed project includes measures to deal with these
areas in need of improvement.
K. Performance Under Earlier Bank Operations
3.26      The Bank has provided $1,290 million for power generation/dis-
tribution facilities in and around Jakarta and in West and Central Java.
Three distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334, and Loan 1259) rehabili-
tated and expanded the distribution facilities in the greater Jakarta area
and a fourth (Loan 2056 of FY82) will further strengthen the Jakarta
transmission and distribution system. The power loans also enabled some
major institutional, organizational and financial reforms to be carried out
in the electricity subsector, including providing PLN with a new charter
giving it some autonomy. Seven power generation projects (Credits 399, and
Loans 1127, 1365, 1513, 1708, 1872 and 1950) in West and Central Java were



- 26 -
undertaken to help PLN expand electricity generation capacity in Java and to
provide a strong all-Java 500 kV grid. Past loans and credits have also
provided funds for various consulting services such as that of SOFRELEC of
France (to establish PLN's original accounting systems), the Java System
Development Study undertaken by Preece, Cardew and Rider of the UK, and
feasibility studies for a number of thermal, hydroelectric, transmission and
distribution projects.
3.27      A completion report on the first two projects (Credits 165 and
334) was issued in November 1979. It describes how, after an initial
period of difficulty and delay (the two projects were completed some three
and a half years behind schedule) many institutional and operational
improvements were effected, greater reliability of supply was achieved, and
PLN's sales began to increase rapidly. The completion report on the third
and fourth projects was prepared in 1981 is currently under review by OED.
Lessons learned from all these operations have been applied to subsequent
operations. They relate mainly to timely appointment of consultants,
effective supervision, and lending as late as possible in the project cycle.
A specific program for financial recovery, designed to improve PLN's
management capabilities and to reach financial breakeven, was incorporated in
Credit 399 and was accomplished ahead of target during FY76.
3.28      PLN's performance in implementing the 11 Bank-assisted power
projects was uneven at first. There was significant improvement until the
introduction of new GOI procurement procedures during 1979/80 (para. 3.04).
The earliest generation project (Credit 399) covering the first and second 100
MW units at Muara Karang thermal station was completed about two years behind
schedule; the next (Loan 1127) for the third 100 MN unit, had a delay of less
than one year. The trend has not improved as expected last year. The 2 x 200
MW extensions at Muara Karang (Loan 1365-IND) have just been completed, over a
year late. The Semarang project (Loan 1513-IND) is over a year behind the
appraisal schedule. The two projects at Suralaya (Loans 1708-IND and
1872-IND) are also about a year behind the original program. Physical
progress of construction at the Saguling hydropower project (Loan 1950-IND)
was poor at start but it has since improved and is now proceeding fairly
satisfactorily.  Completion is expected close to the target date.  Good
progress has been made on procurement under the eleventh power project (Loan
2056-IND) with contracts for about 87% of the loan amount having been approved
within 6 months of effectiveness of the loan. The overall record of
implementation of agreements reached in connection with these power operations
has been satisfactory.
3.29      Reflecting the recent slowdown in pace of project implementation
(para. 3.28) disbursements on earlier loans during the past year were slower
than anticipated. A system of joint monitoring of disbursement performance
on Bank loans by PLN and the Bank on a monthly basis has been recently set
up in PLN. It will identify the causes of slippages and enable management
to take timely remedial steps where possible.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The objectives of the proposed project are to:
(a)  diversify the sources of electricity production mainly through use
of geothermal energy and coal;
(b)  improve efficiency of PLN's distribution networks;
(c)  reduce PLN's system losses; and
(d)  provide consulting services for the continued institutional
development of PLN.
B. Description
4.02      The project comprises the following five components:
(i)  construction of a 110 (2 x 55) MW extension of the Kamojang
Geothermal station in West Java and substation equipment to
interconnect with the existing transmission system;
(ii) construction of the third 400 MW, coal-fired, generating unit
(No.3) at the Suralaya thermal station in West Java, and
step-up substation extensions to connect it with the 500 kV
system under construction including engineering services for
the third and fourth generating units;
(iii) distribution system improvements in Java, North Sumatra and
South Sulawesi;
(iv) a mini-hydro development program in North Sumatra; and
(v)  training facilities and services to assist PLN's manpower
development program.
The project would provide PLN's Java grid with a substantial source of
additional firm energy of about 2,850 GWh annually by end 1986. The
transmission component would enable losses on the distribtuion side to be
reduced from 21% at present to about 16% by end 1985, apart from other
operational benefits. The mini-hydro component, while relatively small in
its impact on PLN's total sales, is expected to lead to greater acceleration
in future exploitation of a renewable energy source, especially in the context
of rural developments. The training and consultancy programs under the
project will considerably strengthen PLN's manpower developments and its
institutional growth.

C. Relation of the Project to PLN's Development Program
4.03      The project is part of PLN's 1982/83 to 1986/87 development pro-
gram. The subprojects described under para. 4.01 (items (i) and (ii)) are
the next steps in the Java generation expansion program demonstrated to
represent the most economic sequence considering all available alternatives
(para. 2.08). Item (iii) constitutes part of the PLN's overall program for
improvement of its distribution systems during 1982/83 to 1985/86. Java,
North Sumatra, and S. Sulawesi together account for about 90% of PLN's total
market. Consultant's studies over the past two years in this region have
shown that this distribution program is needed to match growth of generating
capacity. The components of the distribution program to be financed by the
Bank are those aimed specifically at improvements in operational efficiency
and system loss reduction to be achieved by 1984/85 (para. 4.15). Item
(iv) is a pilot program in a area rich in hydropotential where a sizeable
potential market lies beyond economic reach of PLN's main grid for many
years to come, and can benefit from early introduction of electricity supply
relying substantially on hydro resources. It has been chosen with a special
accent on standardization of techniques to demonstrate its economic
advantages and eventually to lead to acceleration in pace of mini hydro
development. Item (v) is a further step in PLN's continuing program of
manpower development and training.
D. Evolution of the Project and Status
Kamojang Geothermal Project
4.04      As explained in para. 1.17, scientific exploration of Kamojang
geothermal site, located 42 km southeast of Bandung in West Java, was
actively resumed in 1972. During 1972-76 Geothermal Energy New Zealand
(GENZL), a firm of consulting engineers, carried out detailed geophysical,
geological and geochemical studies and delineated a geothermal field, about
14 sq km, with a potential above 120 MW. Production drilling is now being
continued by PERTAMINA. Six wells together capable of producing about 49
MW, are currently connected by pipeline to supply geothermal steam to the 30
MW plant, which is in an advanced stage of erection and is expected to be in
commercial operation in December 1982 (para. 1.17). A 150 kV line with
adequate capacity to handle the full ultimate output of 140 MW has been
constructed to link Kamojang power station to the Java grid.
4.05      A feasibility report on a 110 MW extension at Kamojang was pre-
pared in December 1981 by GENZL. It demonstrates that exploration carried
out to date establishes that the Kamojang geothermal reserves would support
a 140 MW station operating continuously for 50 years. This conclusion has
been confirmed by an independent geothermal expert, who assisted the
appraisal mission during February-March 1982. His report is available in
the Project File. The following are the main conclusions:
(i) The reserves proven by the 18 holes drilled to date within
an 10 ohm-meter line in the 14 sq km area are sufficient to



- 29 -
supply steam to a 140 MW geothermal plant operating at
full capacity for 30-50 years;
(ii)  The circumscribed area within the 10 ohmrmeter boundary can
be safely taken as a conservative calculable reserve area;
The actual areal extent of the field is unknown. It may be
much larger than its apparent 14 sq km size;
(iii)  To date wells for 60 MW capacity have been developed at
Kamojang. The average steam outputs of 5 MW are above
average for a geothermal field and it bodes well for further
development; and
(iv)  The loan for the next 110 MW of generating plant can be
made now, providing that adequate assurance is given by
PERTAMINA that the additional wells necessary for full
production of 140 MW will be completed on schedule. Should
an immediate commitment be obtained to a continuous drilling
program (as given as alternative B in the GENZL feasibility
study) it should produce 105 MW by August 1983 (when the main
mechanical and electrical equipment contract is planned to
be awarded) and the total of 140 MW could be developed by
April 1984.
These conclusions have been accepted by the Bank.
4.06      At appraisal there were doubts that PERTAMINA would be able to
meet the drilling commitment referred to in para. 4.05 above because of
inadequate budget provisions, problems of land acquisition and obtaining
rights in respect of land required for the expansion program, lack of
understanding between PERTAMINA and PLN on steam pricing and the absence of
a firm continuing consultancy arrangement for PERTAMINA's geothermal work.
The latter was considered particularly important. In June 1982, PERTAMINA
entered into an agreement with a French Consultant (BEICIP) to be assisted
in the specialized geophysical and geological work. This agreement will
ensure timely development of geothermal steam at Kamojang and training of
PERTAMINA staff in geothermal technology. PERTAMINA will continue to employ
this or other consultants (Schedule 2 of draft Loan Agreement). Since
appraisal, considerable progress has been made in overcoming land rights
problems in time, and in speeding up execution of the drilling program (see
para. 4.08).
4.07      Regarding steam pricing, because geothermal energy is a non-
tradeable good, it would not be appropriate to link it with international
oil or coal prices. The Bank's view was that geothermal energy should be
priced on the basis of cost plus a reasonable return, providing an adequate
incentive for PERTAMINA to develop the steam. During negotiations
understanding was reached that the GOI would ensure that PERTAMINA and PLN
sign a sales contract satisfactory to the Bank (Sect. 3.07 of the draft Loan



- 30 -
Agreement).  It was further understood that the supply of steam would be
priced on the principles of cost plus reasonable return and the application
of sound business practices (to maintain continued deliverability of
geothermal steam) and that the contract would be signed not later than six
months before the scheduled commissioning of Kamojang TUnit III currently
scheduled for April 1986.
4.08      The following further assurances were obtained from GOI that it
will:
(i)  cause and ensure that PERTAMINA prepares and implements a
work program of steam field drilling and development,
acceptable to GOI, the Bank and PLN ensuring sufficient
steam production at Kamojang to generate (i) not less than
105 MW by August 1983 and (ii) not less than 140 MW by April
1984 (Sect. 3.03 (a) of draft Loan Agreement). It was also
agreed that satisfactory evidence of steam production for
105 MW of generating capacity would be a condition of
disbursement for the Kamojang sub-component (Schedule 1,
draft Loan Agreement);
(ii)  cause and ensure that PERTAMINA will allocate all funds, as
and when needed, for the financing and timely completion of
the work program referred to above (Sect. 3.03 (b) of the
draft Loan Agreement), and
(iii)  take, or cause to be taken, such action as is necessary to
make available as needed all such land and rights to land as
shall be required at Kamojang and inform the Bank in a timely
manner that such land rights in respect of land have been
acquired (Sect. 3.04 of the draft Loan Agreement)
4.09       Implementation of the Kamojang extension project is proceeding on
the basis of separate responsibilities for steam and electricity development
by PERTAMINA and PLN respectively following GOI's recent decisions (para.
1.19). The Bank has been of the view since the energy assessment study
in 1981 (para. 1.27), that the best long term organizational arrangement for
efficient development of geothermal energy in Indonesia would be to
establish a separate entity jointly owned by PERTAMINA and PLN, responsible
only for geothermal energy production. While the prevailing institutional
arrangements would be acceptable to the Bank for the Kamojang extensions
project, in consultation with PERTAMINA and PLN, GOI would carry out studies
on possible institutional and organizational improvements to establish the
most efficient long-term development of geothermal energy based on
experiences in Indonesia by April 1, 1987 and will then forward the study to
the Bank for comments.

Suralaya (Unit 3) Extension
4.10      The first and second 400 MW generating units at the Suralaya (coal
and oil fired) thermal power station in West .Java are now under construction
(para. 1.09) and they are expected to be in commercial operation during
1984-85. The third 400 MW coal-fired unit at Suralaya is required to be
commissioned early in 1986 according to system studies carried out by PLN's
Planning Directorate (para. 6.03). An associated all-Java 500 kV system now
being constructed would enable the entire output of the station (including
that of unit 3) to be utilized. Coal for the operation of the third unit
would be available from the Muara Tiga field in South Sumatra (para. 1.09).
BAKOREN approved the implementation of this subproject in January 1982.
4.11       A report justifying the timing of the project and outlining the
procurement strategy for construction by the target date of April 1986 was
sent to the Bank in April 1982. It was prepared by PLN and Montreal
Engineering Company (MONENCO) of Canada, the consultant for the Suralaya
project from its inception. The GOI has agreed that implementation of the
project could proceed on the basis of this report. Compared to units 1 and
2 at Suralaya which are designed to be suitable for dual firing with both
coal and oil, the third unit would be designed only for coal firing but it
would otherwise be similar to units 1 and 2 in all respects.
The Distribution Subproject
4.12       This subproject has evolved from Bank/PLN efforts since the sixth
power project (FY77) to ensure that PLN's transmission and distribution
systems are adequately matched to the growth of its generation facilities,
and to reduce its heavy system losses to acceptable levels. Early in 1981
using funds out of Loan 1365-IND, PLN commissioned Beca Worley International
(BWI) of New Zealand to review and report on (a) the adequacy of its
transmission and distribution programs until 1987 to match ongoing programs
of construction of new generating facilities, and (b) measures to augment
them with due emphasis on economy and efficiency. The study was limited to
Java, North Sumatra and South Sulawesi (now referred to as the JASUSS area)
which presently accounts for 90% of PLN's market. BWI's final report was
submitted in April 1982. It recommended (a) development of an extensive 20
kV "backbone" network, particularly in Java, to give a wide coverage of the
most populated areas of the country and to link smaller towns with feeders
following roads along which the greatest commercial activity is developing,
and (b) a number of measures for improving the reliability of PLN's
distribution systems and reducing losses to levels which can sustain present
demand growth rates.
4.13       During 1981 GOI requested a review of PLN's progress in meeting
construction targets for Repelita III. PLN reported that construction
progress was unlikely to meet these targets and proposed alternative
programs to meet them. These plans utilized many of the preliminary BWI
findings reported in its August 1981 draft report, particularly those



- 32 -
involving the 20 kV backbone network and their extensions to rural areas.
In October 1981 GOI agreed in principle to authorise the funding of what is
now known as PLN's Accelerated Investment Program (AIP), amounting to some
US$1.4 billion to be disbursed through 1984/85. It was formally agreed in
April 1982. The program is justified as it will ensure the necessary
balance between development of generation and distribution facilities, and it
would forestall capacity shortages in areas outside Java. However, the AIP
has some shortcomings which are explained in para. 4.14 below. The table
below summarises the costs of PLN's transmission and distribution program
during the period 1982/83 to 1986/87 and the AIP investments.

4.14      The main objective of the AIP was to rapidly expand the power
distribution network to meet GOI's aims of attracting industry to rural
areas and to permit development of viable RE projects on a more comprehen-
sive basis. It did not provide funding for measures recommended by BWI to
improve the efficiency and reliability of the distribution network and to
hold down distribution losses. The proposed subproject will address these
needs providing both a construction commitment and a strong monitoring and
reporting component to assure that the aims of Bank involvement - streng-
thening of PLN's institutions and operations in the distribution area - are
also achieved. The loss reduction program is of particular importance
because the latest analysis by BWI shows the following trends indicating a
levelling off during the past 2 years at an unacceptably high level of 21%.

4.15      The BWI study shows that the biggest contributor to system losses
are the old 6-12kV and 127/220 V distribution systems which are generally
overloaded, in an unsatisfactory state of repairs and considerably more
susceptible to unauthorized usage. Newer 20 kV systems were developed in
Jakarta under the first, second and fifth power projects and, outside
Jakarta, in West Java, Medan and South Sulawesi by the ADB; in North Sumatra
and Central Java by US AID; in East Java by OECF and in Bandung and its
environs by Kuwait/Abu Dhabi Fund operations. A considerable amount of
further expansion at 20 kV will be funded by the AIP. For the low voltage
systems GOI issued policy directives in 1973 to standardize on 230/380 V but
the pace of development of Indonesia's power systems in recent years has
left little room to effect voltage changeovers on a comprehensive basis.
New consumers are connected to 230/380 V but existing consumers have
continued to be supplied by the old 127/220 V systems which have not been
developed to keep pace with demand growth. Losses and service conditions on
these have deteriorated. PLN estimates that there are presently some
880,000 consumers served by these old systems. Of these, about half will be
changed over during the next 4-5 years through committed programs. The
proposed project will aim at an additional changeover of some 250,000
consumers in this period as well as elimination of the 6-12 kV systems with
an overall target of reducing the distribution losses by a further 5 percent
by 1984/85. This will require rapid procurement and installation of a
variety of equipment e.g. 20 kV, transmission line materials and switch
gear, reclosers, autotransformers, voltage regulators, low voltage change
over materials, meters and industrial power factor correction equipment. To
improve operational efficiency and reliability, some existing 150/70 kV
transformers require rewinding (to correct a phasing problem); centralized
control facilities need to be added in some cities, and system protection
improved. The Bank's approach in this situation is to use about $100 million
of the proposed loan for the project as a distribution development fund
(rather than a geographically described project component) to purchase
urgently needed equipment out of an agreed list.



- 34 -
The consultant (BWI) would continue to assist in implementation, monitoring
and reporting on the loss reduction and operational efficiency improvement
program in accordance with terms of reference attached as Annex 11, (Sec.
2.02 of the draft Project Agreement). The development fund approach should
enable the Bank to move towards subsector lending in power distribution by
FY86.
4.16      BWI has already been appointed as consultant for the implemen-
tation phase of the project (para. 4.15). Tender documents for about $50
million of equipment and materials whose need has already been established
are to be put out to bid in July 1982. PLN's bid evaluation is expected by
mid-November and GOI approval by end December 1982. The balance of
equipment is expected to be tendered in December 1982 when the design phase
is more advanced. PLN/BWI are expected to finalize their detailed program
of implementation, monitoring and reporting by this stage. The entire
subproject is expected to be completed by December 1982.
Mini Hydro Subproject
4.17      This project for design and construction of 8 mini hydro stations
with an aggregate installed capacity of about 7 MW emerged from a survey of
mini hydro potential of the western half of North Sumatra (which lies beyond
economic reach of the Asahan Grid in the east) carried out in 1981 by BWI
of New Zealand and Indonesian counterparts. It identified some 40 sites
with a total potential of 55 MW, each site being located within 4 km of
existing roads and not more than 20 km from population centers requiring
electricity. Of these, 16 were considered favorable for immediate develop-
ment. The survey revealed that a number of these sites had similar hydro-
logical and topographical characteristics and could be developed using a few
standardized generating sets. They could also be connected to the 20 kV
distribution network being constructed as part of the AIP in Repelita III
(paras. 4.14-4.15). The effect of standardization would be to reduce
design and construction costs whereas interconnection into the 20 kV system
fed by diesel installations would enable the installed capacity to be
increased beyond the firm capacity based on minimum river flows thus
improving the overall economy of these projects. PLN has decided to follow
this approach for its future mini hydro programs starting with the pilot
mini hydro component under the proposed project.
4.18      Nine standard groupings were considered with unit sizes varying
from 100-1,000 kW and operating heads of 10-50 meters. Of these, two sizes,
both operating under 15 m heads, viz 200 kW and 750 kW, were found to have
the greatest applicability among the 16 favorable sites referred to in para.
4.17 above. PLN selected the 750 kW size to provide the main thrust of the
pilot project because cost comparisons showed them to be more economical and



- 35 -
obviously they would have a greater electrification impact with available
manpower resources. The pilot project provides for design and construction
for 6 schemes employing nine 750 kW generating units (Total 6.8 MW) and 2
schemes employing 200 kW generating units. The six (750 kW) schemes have
been finalized and costed. Reports on their locations, hydrology,
geological assessment, scheme layouts etc. have been forwarded to the Bank.
Schemes for installation of 200 kW generating sets will be finalized
shortly.
4.19      PLN has appointed BWI as consultant to (i) prepare guidelines for
the continuing investigation and development of other mini hydro resources
for the whole of the country and (ii) to assist in the design and construc-
tion of the two groups of schemes referred to in para. 4.18 above. This
work has been in progress since April 1982 to a target of commissioning the
six schemes between December 1984 and April 1985. WI has fairly extensive
experience of mini hydro work in New Zealand and elsewhere and has formed a
consortium with a local firm of consulting engineers, PT Yodya Karya. The
greater portion of the design work will be done in Indonesia with the
cooperation and close scrutiny of PLN. PLN has nominated counterpart staff
and arranged their program of work both in Indonesia and New Zealand. To
implement the project PLN has formed a separate mini hydro department with
its headquarters and planning department at Jakarta. The field work of
investigations and construction will be carried out by the North Sumatra
wilayah.
Training Component
4.20      The evolution of this project component has been explained at
para. 3.16. The project covers the establishment of five new training
centers at Suralaya, Semarang, Bukit Tingi, Cilacap and Giganjar for
training at levels of skilled workers and supervisory staff and technical
assistance as detailed below:
(a) provision of equipment and materials for the new and existing
training centers so as to create an additional 875 new train-
ing places;
(b) technical assistance amounting to 30 man-years to assist PLN
in the following specific areas: (i) in strengthening its
personnel management; (ii) in supervising the procurement and
installation of new training equipment and in launching courses in
the new training centers;
(c) introducing instructor training programs at Tanjung Priok
and to develop a Training Resource Center in which training
aids and materials will be produced for use in all training
centers; and



- 36 -
(d) a total of 240 man-months of overseas fellowships to provide
selected PLN middle and upper-level managers with the oppor-
tunity to broaden their experience and develop skills required
in the development of the personnel function, and in those
areas of planning, operations and construction, in which
traning needs still remain to be identified.
4.21      Details of the facilities at PLN's training centers, existing
and planned (item 4.20(a)) and of the technical assistance proposed
(4.20(c)) are given in Annexes 12 and 13 respectively.
E. Project Cost Estimate
4.22      The detailed cost estimate of the various components of the
project are given in Annex 14. The cost estimates for the Kamojang and
Suralaya extensions project are based on the experiences of the initial
developments at these sites. The estimates for the distribution component
have been based on PLN's most recent cost data and are as included in its
investment program reviewed by the Bank.  The costs of the mini hydro
component are based on feasibility stage investigations and costs derived
from recent experiences in Indonesia and equipment procured both in
Indonesia and elsewhere.
4.23      Table 4.3 summarizes the project cost estimate.  All costs are
as expected to prevail during the last quarter of 1982. Physical con-
tingencies vary from 10% for the civil works to 5% for the equipment in
cases where detailed engineering has been carried out. Price contingencies
are based on the following inflation factors. For local costs: 12% in 1983,
10% in 1984 and thereafter; for foreign costs: 8.0% in 1983, 7.5% in 1984,
7.0% in 1985, 6% in 1986 and thereafter. The costs for equipment are net of
taxes and duties as PLN is exempt from these levies, but the cost of civil
works involve applicable local taxes.

Engineering and Construction
4.24      The arrangements for implementation of the Kamojang extensions
project will be the same as for the ongoing initial 30 MW development
(para. 4.09). GENZL has been appointed the consultant for engineering and
construction supervision of the project. This work started on June 1, 1982.
The implementation schedule is at Annex 15(a). A list of key dates for
completion of activities on the critical path is also attached Annex 15(b).
The target is to commission the first 55 MW units in June 1986 followed by
the second in December 1986. The construction program is realistic, given
the experiences on the initial development and the fact that the work is an
extension of the initial project. The GENZL contract is for about 765
man-months at an average man-month cost inclusive of basic salary, overheads
and fees, international travel and overseas allowance for resident field
engineers, of about $8,600.. The Bank has agreed to finance the cost of the
engineering to the extent of $2.3 million out of Loan 1365-IND (sixth power
project), and the balance of engineering costs will be charged to the account
of the proposed loan.

4.25       The Suralaya (Unit 3) extension will be carried out entirely by
PLN, with the assistance of MONENCO, the engineer for the ongoing work on
the first two 400 MW generating sets. MONENCO was appointed in April 1982
for detailed engineering and supervision of construction. Work started
effectively on June 1, 1982. The MONENCO contract involves a total of about
2,150 man-months, at an estimated all inclusive man-month cost of about
$10,000. As PLN's investment program requires commissioning of Unit 4 in
1988, the Bank agreed to a GOI request that engineering of this generating
set be included in the MONENCO contract and financed under the proposed
loan. AX expenditure of about US$6.0 million is expected to be made under
this engineering contract prior to loan signing and is proposed to be
retroactively financed.
4.26       In order to achieve the commissioning target date of April 1986
GOI and PLN decided in June 1982 thlat supply of the main equipments (the
boiler and the turbo-generator and ancilliaries) would be negotiated with
the suppliers of the first two units on the basis of their recent successful
bids through ICB under the Bank's eighth power project. Commercial credits
would be used to finance the costs involved. If these negotiations are
successful, PLN intends to negotiate the associated civil works contract
(for piling, cooling water ducts and civil works) also with the contractors
presently at site on the basis of the rates for ongoing work, as the work
would be repetitive. These would be local contracts. The rest of the work
will be arranged through six supply and erect equipment contracts which will
be awarded on the basis of ICB. About four months were allowed in the imple-
mentation program for the direct negotiations decribed above. Simultan-
eously with these negotiations GOI advised PLN to undertake preparation of
bidding documents to inviting limited bids, for the main equipments (the
boiler and the turbogenerator) with suppliers credits so that they could
fall back on this option if, for any reason, the negotiations described
above fail. The implementation schedule attached as Annex 16 indicates the
construction program in this latter alternative. The third unit at Suralaya
is expected to be commissioned by April 1987.
4.27       The distribution component is more in the nature of a program,
than a conventional project, and involves procurement of special items of
equipment required for achieving specific objectives of improving opera-
tional efficiency and loss reduction all over PLN's systems in a short time
period. The approach for implementation of this program by PLN with the
assistance of BWI has been explained in paras. 4.15/4.16. The implement-
ation schedule is at Annex 17. The VI contract, approved in June 1982,
involves about 210 man-months at an estimated all inclusive man-months cost
of $8,100.
4.28       The arrangments for implementation of the pilot mini-hydro
development program have been detailed in paras. 4.19. BWI will be the
engineer assisting PLN In this work. Its contract, approved in June 1982,
involves about 80 man-months at a all-inclusive cost of about $8,200.



- 39 -
4.29      The training program involves establishment of five new training
centers and technical assistance. In consultation with the Bank PLN
has drawn up a short list of five consulting organizations from whom
proposals for consultancy services have been invited to terms of reference
agreed with the Bank. An implementation schedule for the work has also been
drawn up.
4.30      No particular difficulties are anticipated in implementing the
various components of this project in view of the advanced stage of prepara-
tory work and the arrangements made as described above. During
negotiations agreement was reached that PLN would continue to employ
consultants, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, for
implementation of these projects. (Section 2.02 of the draft Project
Agreement).
G. Procurement
4.31      The proposed Bank loan would be used to finance the foreign cost
of equipment procured by ICB in accordance with the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines and engineering services as described in paras. 4.24, 4.25,
4.27-4.29. The equipment contracts to be procured under the proposed loan
would be for the supply and erection of (a) two 55 MW turbogenerators and
ancillary equipment and (b) balance of mechanical equipment, including
cooling towers for the Kamojang project; (c) steel work and cladding; (d)
stack; (e) ash and dust plant; (f) station electrical equipment; (g) coal
handling plant; and (h) substation equipment, for the third 400 MW
generating set at Suralaya; the supply of (i) miscellaneous equipment and
materials for the distribution component; (j) supply and erection of the
turbogenerators required for the mini hydro component; and (k) equipment
required for the new training centers. All bidding packages for goods and
services costing over $1,000,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's
prior review of procurement documentation. This would cover all of the
foreseen Bank-financed contracts. GOI/PLN finances would be used for all
civil works contracts and for the main equipment contracts for the Suralaya
extension. Suppliers credits will be used to finance the foreign costs of
the boiler and turbogenerator at Suralaya. The civil works local contracts
would be procured through local procedures which are acceptable.
H. Financing Plan
4.32      The following financing plan is proposed for the project:

4.33       The Bank loan would be to the Government, which will relend the
proceeds to PLN, the beneficiary, at an interest rate at least equivalent
to that of the Bank loan plus an appropriate administrative cost, for 20
years, including 5 years of grace. Interest and commitment charges during
the grace period would be capitalized. The foreign exchange risk would be
borne by the Government. Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement would be
a condition of loan effectiveness.
I. Disbursement
4.34       The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 100% of the foreign
expenditures of directly imported equipment and materials; 100% of the local
expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured equipment and materials
and 65% of the total expenditures for imported goods procured locally and
(d) 100% of expenditures on consultants' services.
4.35       The schedule of disbursement of the Bank loan is at Annex 18.  It
is based on the implementation schedules of different components of the
project. Regional and Bank disbursement profiles have not been used as the
project components are not typical. The distribution component for example,
does not follow the usual project description and is in the nature of a
development fund (para. 4.15). The geothermal and mini hydro components are
not typical Bank projects. Finally, Bank finance is being applied only to
certain components of the Suralaya thermal project, for which comparisons
could have been made. But, in this case, disbursements have been assumed to
follow a conservative trend (para. 4.26).
J. Environmental Impact
4.36       Three of the project components (a) the training program; (b) the
distribution component and (c) the mini hydro program, are, in their nature,



- 41 -
not expected-to have any significant environmental impact. At Suralaya
site, the siting and the measures taken in connection with the initial ongoing
development of the first two generating sets under the eighth and ninth power
loans e.g., the design features to deal with stack emission and ash disposal,
reduce the environmental impact to a minimum. The same features will prevail
for the third set. Because Kamojang is a dry steam field and only small
volumes of liquid wastes are expected to be generated from the cooling water
cycle its environmental impact is expected to be minimal. Reinjection systems
are currently being studied in connection with the ongoing initial development
as a further precaution. The project cost estimates provide for additional
equipment and wells to meet future reinjection requirements, particularly
during the dry weather periods when river flows are too low to dilute liquid
wastes. Provisions have also been made in the station designs to extract the
bulk of the noncondensible gases from the condensor using a steam ejection
system and to vent them direct to the atmosphere at dispersion levels well
within environmental health standards. In view of these precautions it is not
considered that this project component has any adverse features which cannot
be satisfactorily dealt with.
K. Risks
4.37      There are no risks of any significance associated with the project
components other than the Kamojang geothermal project. At Kamojang, in view
of the facts that (i) extensive scientific investigations have been carried
out over a long period; (ii) adequate steam capacity would have been developed
by the time the generating units are being ordered; and (iii) the 18 wells so
far drilled have yielded results well above normal for a geothermal field, it
is felt that there is little risk of ending up with insufficient steam. On
the other hand, expert opinion indicates the potential of the field may be
considerably greater than presently anticipated and any shortfalls experienced
during the lifetime of producing wells could be made up by supplementary
wells.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Results
5.01      When IDA undertook the first lending operation in the power sector
in Indonesia in 1969 (Cr. 165), it found PLN virtually bereft of accounting
records, unable to prepare meaningful financial statements, and thus ignorant
of the financial results of its operations. Accordingly, in this first
credit, IDA funded the services of consultants to set up a proper accounting
system and prepare a balance sheet and an operating budget. By 1972 the work
was sufficiently advanced for PLN's financial condition to be determined with
certainty. Although the balance sheet was reasonably sound, substantial
operating losses were being incurred, operating cash flow was barely positive,
and capital expenditure - at a low level - was financed entirely by Government
contributions.



- 42 -
5.02       The implementation of measures to improve the financial
performance of PLN was considered of such importance and urgency that in
both Cr. 399 (1973) and Loan 1127 (1975) it formed a component of the
project: PLN adopted target Revenue/Cost /1 ratios, as follows:
FY75 /2   -    80%
FY77       -    90%
FY79       -   100%
5.03       PLN achieved a 100% Revenue/Cost ratio three years ahead of
target in FY76. Its progress since financial recovery, and the growth of its
operations, have been impressive. Highlights of its results over the past
few years are as follows:

5.04      The stagnation of tariffs between FY77 and FY80 held PLN's net
income around breakeven point, and its cash flow was derived mainly from
depreciation (assets are revalued every fourth year) and customer
connection contributions. But the major source of its funding has been

PLN also benefits financially from GOI by virtue of the subsidy on its fuel
oil, which is sold to PLN (through Pertamina) at less than its imported
cost. Without this subsidy, PLN's internal funds flow would have been
virtually nil. The degree of subsidization is currently 45% and the annual
value of the subsidy about Rp 200 billion.
5.05       PLN's debt:equity ratio is quite low at 21:79.  Its balance sheet
(estimated) at March 31, 1982 also shows a healthy current ratio at 4.5 and
substantial liquidity, with current assets including cash balances of
Rp 138 billion. The salient points are as follows:

Tariff Structure and Levels
5.06      PLN's tariff comprises about 20 consumer classes.  For all except
the smallest domestic class, two-part charges are applied, and for industrial
and the largest commercial consumers time-of-day pricing is in effect.
Provision is made for a cost surcharge, variation of which requires the
Minister's approval; alteration of the basic rate requires Presidential
approval. The present rate structure was introduced in May 1980 as a first
deliberate step towards LRMC pricing as agreed with the Bank in the context
of the Seventh Power Project (Loan 1513-IND). The Bank had been extensively
consulted and provided technical assistance in the analysis of costs.
Considerable refinement is still necessary, particularly as regards the
relative weighting of energy and demand charges, and in respect of the
recognition of significant regional differences in supply costs.
5.07      Although some progress has been made in structuring electric
rates according to economic pricing principles, the average level is still
well below LRMC. PLN has calculated this to be Rp 79/kWh on the basis of
its latest 12-year development program (in 1982 prices including fuel oil
at full international price, but without any other shadow pricing),
representing an increase of about 45% over the current average of Rp 54/kWh.
In view of the importance of rational energy pricing generally to Indonesia's



- 45 -
economic planning and the agreement already reached with GOI on the undesira-
bility of perpetuating energy subsidies (para. 1.27-1.28), this increase
should be effected as soon as possible. The issue is of particular concern
to PLN because of the risk of eventual over-investment in new facilities if
electricity demand continues to be distorted by artificially low prices.
To reach the current-price equivalent of LRMC would, on present assumptions
of 10% inflation, take two annual increments of 33% or three of 25%. The
last tariff increase (February 1982) averaged 25%, and the one before that
(May 1980) averaged 50%. There is therefore some evidence of the feasi-
bility of annual increases averaging 25%, and this should be the minimum
aim. This would put tariff levels on to an LRMC basis by the beginning of
FY86.
Financing Policy
5.08      The second major issue facing the corporation is the mobilization
of sufficient funds to maintain its development program. The attainment and
maintenance of tariff levels at LRMC would set a parameter to PLN's internal
cash generation capability. Furthermore, the size of PLN's planned capital
expenditures, and budgetary constraints facing GOI in the near term, suggest
that it would be imprudent for PLN to count on continuing to receive such a
large proportion of its funding in the form of government equity as it has
done in the past (para. 5.04). But PLN is currently well placed to increase
its level Qf borrowing. Its balance sheet is sound; its debt:equity ratio
is notably low (para. 5.05) and debt service is currently covered about
three times. Given the low risk inherent in its near-term investments,
undertaken at such an early stage of the country's power development, PLN
should be attractive to lenders both inside and outside Indonesia. Therefore,
its near-term objective should be to secure a significantly higher degree of
leverage in its financing plan by increasing its long-term borrowing.
5.09      Assuming tariffs at LRMC levels by FY86, a number of projections
have been made to determine the extent to which PLN can increase its debt
capitalization with safety. These show that a debt:equity ratio of at least
40:60 could easily be supported even on quite rigorous assumptions as to terms
of borrowing. The Bank has therefore recommended to GOI and PLN that
they should consider an increase of the debt/equity ratio from around 20:80
at present to at least 40:60. This could be achieved by allowing PLN to
borrow approximately half of its planned capital expenditures (plus interest
during construction) in each financial year, beginning with the present,
until the target ratio is reached. Initial contacts have been made by PLN
with a number of interested local sources, including insurance companies and
pension funds. The possibility of a limited amount of funding through bond
issues is also under consideration. To help PLN develop these concepts,
define a capitalization policy and prepare a financing plan (as agreed with
the Bank under Loan 2056), GOI has assigned its banking advisors (Lazard
Freres, S.G. Warburg and Lehman Bros., Kuhn Loeb) to work with the
corporation.   The conclusions of this study are to be finalized by GOI by
August 30, 1983.



- 46 -
PLN's Financial Objectives
5.10      After financial recovery in 1976, PLN agreed with the Bank
(Seventh Power Project; Loan 1513) to adopt cash generation targets /1 as a
measure of financial performance,  The covenanted target was 30%, to be
achieved by FY86. However, on the basis of PLN's latest 12-year development
program, achievement of the covenanted level of cash generation in FY86
would require an average tariff substantially in excess of LRMC. Further,
although interim targets for the intermediate years of FY80, 81 and 82 (12%
each year) were comfortably achieved, the substantially higher levels of
capital expenditure included in PLN's recent financial forecasts, coupled
with the postponement of operating cost savings resulting from the slippage
of certain large new power plants, has made achievement of the targets for
FY83 and FY84 (20%) difficult. At negotiations these were therefore reduced
to 10%.  The covenented target for FY86 and thereafter has been reduced to
20% (Section 4.05 of the draft Project Agreement).  The cash generation
covenants under earlier projects will be amended with respect to the target
levels in order to be consistent with the levels agreed under this project.
5.11      In order to facilitate steady progress towards the pricing
objectives, it is necessary that the cash flow targets be protected so far
as possible from the risk of erosion, particularly as a result of possible
slippage in the investment program. Accordingly, it was agreed at negotiation
that in the event of significant variation (upwards or downwards) of
capital expenditures from those on which the above targets are predicated
(and which are reflected in the financial forecasts set out at Annex 20),
the target cash generation percentages would be adjusted correspondingly
(downwards or upwards). It was also agreed that additional costs that
might be imposed on PLN in any year as a result of increases in the price
of fuel oil above the current levels, should be allowed as a deduction
from the cash generation requirement for that year; this provision is
designed to avoid the risk of exceeding LRMC when cash generation targets
are set on top of cost recovery.
5.12      The necessity to build in adjustments such as those described
above is an indication that the cash generation targets are less
appropriate to PLN's circumstances now than they were four years ago.
Adoption of a rate-of-return formulation for PLN's objectives would have a
number of advantages including in particular the following:
/1 The percentage of capital expenditures for the target year plus the two
preceding years covered by its net revenue plus depreciation retentions
less debt service for the same three years.



- 47 -
(a) it is very little affected by non-operating revenues, which
have made an important contribution to PLN's cash flow in the
past, and so bears more directly on the level of prices and the
efficiency of operations;
(b) the value of assets in use can usually be established with
certainty at the beginning of each year, and so the rate base
for tariff setting is less susceptible to error;
(c) it is neutral as to the disposal of net cash flow, and so it
does not highlight self-financing rather than any other
financing policy.
At negotiations, the GOI delegation accepted that there could be advantages
in moving to a rate-of-return criterion for PLN's financial performance but
indicated that GOI did not wish to initiate any change until after they
reviewed the recommendations of their banking advisors on PLN's financing
policy (para. 5.09). The Bank will follow up the subject in the context of
future lending operations.
Future Financial Performance
5.13      If GOI and PLN move to establish LRMC electricity pricing within
the time frame proposed at para. 5.07, PLN will earn a positive rate of return
in each year of the forecast (through 1989). The quantification of the rate
of return from PLN's own financial records will depend on the timing of GOI's
action to phase out fuel oil subsidies by raising the prices at which
Pertamina actually bills PLN.  Since PLN is virtually the only customer for
residual fuel oil (though not for diesel), GOI could take this action
independently of its program for phasing out other petroleum product
subsidies, and it may choose to eliminate PLN's subsidy more quickly in order
to provide better grounds for justifying higher electric tariffs and to avoid
the emergence of abnormally high financial rates of return in PLN; if the
subsidy is retained unchanged, the rate of return would rise from 3% in
FY83 to over 15% by FY89. Assuming the subsidy is phased out in FY86,
coincidentally with the attainment of LRMC electricity prices, the rate of
return that year would be 4%. After FY86 operating earnings are expected to
improve steadily under the influence of gradually reducing unit costs
attributable to the commissioning of new hydro and geothermal plants and to
improve system efficiency resulting from interconnection. Provided tariffs
are maintained in real terms, rates of return will tend to rise towards the
12% cost of capital implicit in LRMC.
5.14      From a financial point of view the termination of fuel subsidies
would make no difference to either PLN or GOI, since the reduced funding of
subsidies would be balanced by an increased funding of equity capital
contributions. However, PLN's internal cash generation would be reduced by
virtue of the increased fuel costs and the target for FY 86 would be
correspondingly reduced (by virtue of the adjustment formula described in
para. 5.11) from 20 % to 11%; this is the case shown in the financial
projections in Annex 20.



- 48 -
5.15     - The financial projections assume international borrowing at 2%
above LIBOR on 10-year maturities and domestic borrowing at 15% over 15
years (including 4 grace), which is probably fairly severe considering that
certain concessionary finance is likely to be available to PLN for some
years; nevertheless debt service remains covered at least three times at a
debt:equity ratio approaching 50:50. Existing covenants binding PLN to a
maximum debt:equity of 60:40 and a minimum 1.3 times coverage of future debt
service out of current revenue before incurring further debt would be
repeated under the proposed loan. The recommended financing policy will
substantially reduce the equity funding expected from GOI and initiate a
declining trend; annual requirements could be expected to fall from around
Rp 700 billion in FY83 to Rp 300 billion by the end of the decade. Pressure
on the GOI budget would be still further reduced by the elimination of fuel
oil subsidies to PLN, which would have reached a level of around Rp 550
billion by 1985.
5.16      PLN's financing plan for the period of project construction would
appear as follows:
Rp billion      %
Capital Expenditure, FY84-88                   11,012      100
Financed by:
Internal funds                               2,402
Less:  Increase in working capital              822
1,580      15
Equity                                        3,122      28
Long-term debt                               6,310       57
11,012      100
By comparison with the financing plan for the past seven years set out in
para. 5.04, the future plan shows the following main changes:
(a)  the proportion of debt financing has risen from 24%
of the program to over 50%;
(b)  the proportion of equity required from GOI has fallen
from 60% to under 30%.
Although the self-financing ratio appears to remain virtually constant at
15%, internal funding for the forecast period is after charging debt
service of Rp 842 billion (negligible in prior years).  Furthermore, the



- 49 -
fuel subsidy, which has supported virtually all PLN's cash flow in the
past (para. 5.04), is assumed terminated in FY86, requiring the absorp-
tion of an additional Rp 1,500 into operating costs during the project
construction period, with a corresponding reduction of funds available for
investment.
VI. PROGRAM AND PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      PLN needs to expand its supply facilities as rapidly as possible
in view of: (a) the low prevailing level of per capita consumption in
Indonesia (85 kWh); (b) the extraordinarily high and sustained sales growth
rates (22% average) during the past four years; (c) the large unsatisfied
demand reflected in long waiting lists; and (d) the dramatic decline during
the past five years (para. 1.34) in growth of oil-consuming captive power
plants which until a few years ago have been sharing equally with PLN the
responsibility for meeting the country's growth of electricity demand.
PLN's sales are currently limited by its supply facilities in all regions of
Java but PLN is prepared to increase them rapidly as soon as new generating
capacity is commissioned. Present sales targets (para. 2.04) are based on
realistic commissioning dates of the major generation expansion projects well
under way and detailed connection programs. We are satisfied that they will
be substantially reached during the next few years even if the overall growth
of the Indonesian economy is abated, due to the large pent-up demand. Tariff
increases of 50% in May 1980 and 25% in January 1982 have not diminished PLN's
sales. Nor is it expected that the increases in tariffs necessary during the
next 2-3 years to ensure PLN's financial integrity and to match LRMC (paras.
5.12) will significantly alter PLN's sales growth targets during the rest of
this decade. For, the alternative for most consumers, viz. oil based
electricity generation would be far costlier, particularly in view of GOI's
policy of removing oil subsidies rapidly (para. 1.27). On the other hand, as
will be clear from the following paragraphs, the imperatives of the present
situation, when a large committed program of expansion of supply facilities
involving a major diversification of energy sources (para. 2.11) is in
progress, are: (i) to ensure that new generating stations (and associated
system facilities) are completed in the quickest possible time; and that (ii)
the rate of growth of sales is maintained.
Need for the Generation Components of the Project
6.02      The anticipated peak demand on the Java grid during 1987/88
of over 3,600 MW cannot be reliably met with the total generating capacity
of existing power stations and those committed for completion by that date
(4,500 MW) taking into account the relatively large unit sizes (400 MW)
of the most recent installations, maintenance requirements and the expected
overall availability factors. Additions to generating capacity would there-
fore be required by about April 1987 to meet the growth of demand in Java.
The most feasible and economic source is the extension of the coal-fired



- 50 -
Suralaya thermal station, located in West Java!, whose economic priority was
established by the Java System Study (1976) and its updated versions (para.
2.03-2.08).
6.03      During 1987/88, the total energy generation requirement would be
21,500 GWh. Against this, the energy generation from coal-fired and hydro-
electric stations would only be about 11,500 GTh. The balance would have to
be generated using gas turbines (680 MW) and oil-fired steam installations
(1,700 MW). During 1981/82 PLN carried out detailed system studies, based
on simulation techniques, to determine the most appropriate timing of the
next generating set at Suralaya (Unit 3) in the context of fuel economy
and system peak requirements. The earliest practical date for commissioning
this unit is April 1986. The study established that the economic penalties
(through higher fuel costs) of delaying the commissioning of Suralaya Unit 3
to October 1986 and April 1987 would be S88.8 million and $184.4 million
respectively.  The report on this study is in the Project File.  Prevailing
international oil prices, and a coal price of $45.0 per ton (for coal
similar to Indonesian coal to be used for units 1 and 2 at Suralaya) were
used for the studies. PLN and GOI therefore decided to take up the con-
struction of Unit 3 with a contracting strategy aimed at commissioning the
plant early in 1986. The Bank agreed with this approach.
6.04      The Kamojang extensions (110 MW) represent a relatively small
increase in generating capacity compared to PLN's system in Java by 1987,
but it is nevertheless a significant addition because it is a base load
station like Suralaya, and is expected to operate at even higher annual
plant factors. The feasibility report contains economic studies showing
(on the basis of estimated costs of steam development which are now fairly
well established through a large drilling program and of the power station)
that it would be far more economic than a coal or oil installation. It
will, in fact, be in a competitive range with the majority of hydro-electric
schemes. Its timing for completion by the end of 1986 has also been
justified.
6.05      The justification of the distribution component which emphasizes
loss reduction and improvements in operational efficiency has been explained
in para. 4.15, while that of the mini hydro component has been dealt with
in paras. 4.16 and 4.17.
6.06      Rather than attempt to calculate the individual economic rates
of return of each of the subprojects which would require arbitrary allo-
cations of associated system costs it was considered that, for the purpose
of the proposed project, calculation of the rate of return of PLN's entire
development program would be more appropriate. Each of the sub-components
constitute basic elements of PLN's expansion programs which have been
established on the basis of least-cost sequence analysis, both for Java and
the other islands (para. 2.08). Accordingly, the estimation of the rate of
return of PLN's development program for the period 1982/83 to 1991/92 is
described in the following paragraphs.



- 51 -
Economic Rate of Beturn of PLN's Development Program
6.07      A ten-year time slice of PLN's 12-year investment program was
chosen as it represents a full period of transition from isolated systems
and heavy reliance on oil (until about 1986) to a more mature integrated
system, with increasing reliance on more economical sources (coal, geo-
thermal and hydropower). A rate of return was not calculated using the
prevailing average tariff level as a proxy for economic benefits, as at the
current level of Rp 54 per kWh (8.4) is only 70% of the long-run marginal
cost of power (para. 6.09). Calculations showed that the results, at this
tariff level, would be negative. This is due both to (a) the low prevailing
level; and (b) higher oil costs during the initial years up to 1986 due to
delays in commissioning of more economic stations (para. 3.28). Further, PLN
has, under covenants with the Bank, agreed to raise its tariffs to reflect
LRMC as closely as possible and it is the intention of assurances to be
sought under the proposed project that this should be achieved within the next
2-3 years, i.e., well before the project is completed. Annex 21 summarizes
the calculations of the rate of return on the assumption that the tariff would
be increased in three annual steps to the LRMC level by 1985/86. On this
basis the rate of return of the 10-year time slice of PLN's development
program works out at 11.6%.
6.08      The economic rate of return of the program increases to just over
11.8%. in the alternatiVe case of increasing the tariff level to LRMC in
two annual steps by 1984/85. This is because the rate of return, at the
present stage of development of PLN's system (see paras. 2.08, 6.01 and
6.07), is far more sensitive to increases in sales and to fuel costs than to
increases in tariff levels.  The combined effects of diversification of
fuel sources and large sales increases (in GWh) become more pronounced only
in the second half of the decade.
Long-Run Marginal Cost (LRMC)
6.09      PLN has calculated the LRMC of its 12-year development program,
1982/83 to 1993/94, on the basis of its generation expansion programs
detailed in Annexes 6 and 7, and the investment program summarized in
Annex 9. Fuel costs have been estimated on the basis of simulation studies
which established the merit order of operation of its various generation
stations and international prices of $45 per ton for coal, $235 per ton for
fuel oil, and $320 per ton for high speed diesel oil. Operations and
maintenance cost have been duly provided for, including administrative
expenses and the cost of facilities. On the basis of forecast sales (para.
2.04) and a 12% discount rate, the LRMC for the system works out to Rp 79
(12.5) per KWh (1982 prices).

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOM_ENDATIONS
7.01      Specific agreements reached during negotiations of the proposed
loan are:
(a)  government agrees that it will:
(i)  cause and ensure that PERTAMINA prepares and implements a
work program of steam field drilling and development,
acceptable to GOI, the Bank and PLN, ensuring sufficient
steam production at Kamojang to generate (i) not less than
105 MW by August 1983 and (ii) not less than 140 MW by
April 1984; [para. 4.08 and Sect. 3.03 (a) of draft Loan
Agreement]
(ii)  cause and ensure that PERTAMINA will allocate all funds, as
and when needed, for the financing and timely completion of
the work program referred to above; [para. 4.08 and Sect.
3.03 of draft Loan Agreement]
(iii) take or cause to be taken, all such action as shall be
necessary to make available, as and when needed, all such
land and rights in respect of land as shall be required at
Kamojang and shall inform the Bank in a timely manner that
such land and rights in respect of land have been made
available (para. 4.08 and Sect. 3.04 of the draft Loan
Agreement);
(iv) cause the terms and conditions of sale and delivery of the
geothermal steam produced at Kamojang to be contained in a
contract, satisfactory to the Bank, between PERTAMINA and
PLN (para. 4.08 and Sect. 3.07 of the draft Loan Agreement)
not later than six months before commissioning of the power
Unit II at Kamojang station);
(b) PLN agrees that it will:
(i)  prepare by not later than December 1, 1983, an adequate
training/development program for PLN's senior technical
staff (including, as maybe appropriate training assistance
provided by or in overseas electricity companies) and
promptly thereafter initiate this program in consultation
with the Bank (para. 3.17(c) and Sect. 3.07 of the draft
Project Agreement);
(ii)  discontinue the system of preparation of joint bid evalua-
tion reports by PLN and its consultants which makes it
impossible to pin responsibility for imperfections which



- 53 -
are seen as significant cause of delays in approval of
contract awards (para. 3.23 and Sect. 3.06 of the draft
Project Agreement).
(iii) continue to employ consultants under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank to assist it in implementation of
items (i) to (v) of the project description (para. 4.02,
4.06 and 4.28 and Sect. 2.02 of the draft Project Agreement);
(iv) employ consultants to assist it in implementation of item
(iii) of the project and, especially, monitoring and
reporting on the loss reduction and operational efficiency
improvement schemes, in accordance with Annex 11 appended
to the SAR (para. 4.15 and Sect. 2.02 of the draft Project
Agreement); and
(v) take all measures as shall be required to produce during
consecutive three-year period from its fiscal years 1982/83
through 1984/85, funds from its internal sources equivalent
to not less than 10% of its capital expenditures. For
fiscal years 1985/86 and thereafter the level of such funds
shall be not less than 20% (para. 5.10 and Sect. 4.05 of
the Project Agreement).
7.02      Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and PLN
satisfactory to the Bank will be a condition of effectiveness (para. 4.33).
7.03      Production of sufficient steam for generation of 105 MW at
Kamojang is a condition of disbursement against contracts for construction
of the Kamojang subproject (para. 4.08 schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement.)
7.03       Subject to satisfactory agreements being reached on the above,
the project is suitable for the proposed loan of $300.0 million (including
capitalized front-end fee) for a period of 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, at the standard variable interest rate.

TWELFTH POWER PROJECT
Terms of Reference and General Approach for Implementation
of the Distribution Component of the Project
A. INTRODUCTION
1.        These terms of reference are for engineering consulting services
for the design and construction aspects of the Transmission and Distribution
component of the IBRD Power XII Loan.
2.         It is essential that the service commence as early as possible to
ensure that all detailed investigation and design and tender documents are
completed before December 1982. The first set covering the most urgently
required equipment and materials will be issued by July 15th, 1982. Because
most of the equipment for loss reduction will be of standard design the
procurement process should be accelerated.
B. TERMS OF REFERENCE
3.         IBRD funding is to be directed to improving the operational
capability of the transmission and distribution systems and reduce
losses particularly in the areas of Java, North Sumatra, and South
Sulawesi. It is to disbursed at PLN's discretion on the basis of detailed
studies carried out under the Agreement between PLN and the Consultant.
Following the success of the program it is anticipated that the further
funding on a similar basis may be considered in future IBRD Loans. The
essence of the assignment therefore, is to ensure that targets (e.g. for
loss reduction) are achieved within the stipulated time period.
4.         To facilitate funding of the consulting services the terms of
reference of the work are divided into two phases as follows:
(a)  Phase I (May 1982-Mlarch 1983) Investigation, Design and
Procurement
(b)  Phase II (April 1983-March 1985) Construction and Monitoring

Page 2
Phase I - Investigation and Design
(a)  Prepare a loss reduction program aimed at achieving a reduction
of the current level of transmission and distribution system
losses to an average value of 16% by March 1985.  An outline of
the program must be submitted for approval by the IBRD before
the work proceeds and shall include the preparation of the
following:
(i)  a program of implementation giving full details of the
procedures to be followed; the PLN manpower and resource
requirements; and the preliminary action required to
ensure successful completion of the program;
(ii) an outline of the reporting methods to be adopted to
monitor the successful implementation of the program and
to ensure the adequate feedback to the planning and
construction departments.  These reports shall measure
actual performance against targets for the following:
a.  organizational development (including manpower and
resources);
b.  construction progress;
c.  operational performance; and
d.  funds disbursements.
(iii) maps showing locations and giving details of the extent of
the problem areas where voltage changeover programs will
produce the most significant impact on loss reduction.
These should identify the respective metering requirements
for assessing results; and
(iv) detailed breakdown of the estimated losses associated with

Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts
General
1.        Inflation has been taken into account at the following rates (%):
CY                         1983  1984  1985   1986 and after
Offshore costs               7.5   7.5   7.5       6
Local costs (exc. fuel)   10    10    10          10
Fuel costs                  10    10    10        10
Income Statements
2.        Revenues assume a tariff increase of approximately 25% at the
beginning of FY84, 85 and 86 so as to attain the current price equivalent of
LRMC in the' latter year. Thereafter, the tariff is adjusted only to absorb
the assumed level of local cost inflation (10%).
3.        Fuel/Bulk Power is derived directly from the planting schedule.
Steam produced at geothermal fields is assumed to be bought by PLN from the
agency responsible for generating it. In FY86 the price of all fuel oil to
PLN is assumed raised by about 80% to bring it to international levels.
4.         Operating Expenses have been forecast in detail taking into
account the facilities expected to be in use each year, and subject to local
cost inflation indices as at 1 above.
5.        Depreciation is based on the apaplication of PLN's normal rates to
assets revalued annually as described at para. 8.
Funds Flow
6.        Financing.  Borrowing has been assumed for 50% of capital expendi-
tures including interest during construction. Assumed terms are:
Foreign loans: 2% above LIBOR, which is projected as:
FY83      13%
84     12.5%
85     12%
86 on  11%
Local loans: 15%

7.         Capital Expenditures exclude costs of geothermal steam field
development which are assumed to be incurred by another agency.
Balance Sheet
8.         Fixed Assets are revalued annually according to the following
percentages:
FY82 ........ 8.4%
thereafter ... 7.4%
