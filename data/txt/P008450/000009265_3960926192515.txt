MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL BAN K OF HUNGARY
WITH THE GUARAN'TFE OF THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
FOR AN AGROPROCESSENG MODERNIZATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
National Bank of Hungary (NBH) with the Government of Hungary (GOH) as
Guarantor for US$70 million is submitted for approval. The proposed loan
would be repayable in 15 years, including three year- grace, at the Bank's
standa.d variable interest rate and help finance an agroprocessing
modernization project, which would assist about 70 agroprocessing and wood
processing enterprises.
2.        Bank Assistance Stategy.  Since it started lending to Hungary in
1983, the Bank's strategy of assistance has been, and is still, focussed on
supporting Hungary's program of economic reform, to make it more efficient,
flexible, market responsive and competitive in external markets, particularly
in the convertible currency area. Within this general context, the main
objectives supported by the Bank's activities have been to: (a) increase
foreign exchange earnings; (b) reduce foreign expenditures through selective
import substitution - in particular the energy sector; (c) facilitate
technology transfer; and (d) promote agricultural and industrial
restructuring. This strategy was reflected in lending operations to support
the agricultural, industrial, energy and transport sectors. Since 1985, the
country has relaunched its economic reform to develop further a
market-oriented economy and promote its structural adjustment. The important
objectives of reform process are to improve mechanisms for reallocating
factors of production, foster price liberalization based on increased
competition and increase the level and efficiency of productive investment.
The Bank has supported these objectives through the inclusion of substantial
policy content in its lending operations. Foremost among these is the
industrial restructuring program, under which the Bank has supported the
adjustment process through a series of operations that have a substantial
policy and institution-building content across a broad range of policy areas
and include restructuring operations at the subsector and enterprise levels.
The proposed project fits in the Bank's assisLance strategy, by focussing on
the restructu ing of the agroprocessing sector.
3.        Background.  The GOH is looking toward increased earnings from
a;roprocessing exports to assist in fulfilling its objective of improving its
foreign trade balance over the current five-year plan (1985-90). The
agricultural sector, including agroprocessitig, accounted for 30% of
convertible currency and 18% of ruble exports, and had total exports of about
US$1.2 billion in both 1986 and 1987. Experience shows that selected
agroprocessed products are already internationally competitive but are
constrained by: (a) lack of modern methods of marketing at the enterprise



-2-
level; (b) low profitability at the enterprise level; and (c) lack of
incentives and a business envircnment which encourage managers to improve
their overall performance. In line with its overall liberalization program,
the GOH is undertaking economic reforms which include measures designed to
create: (a) greater managemenc responsibility such as the election of
enterprises' management by worker aFsemblies and the setting up of management
councils; and (b) financial autonomy such as the establishing of the
commercial banking system and issuance of bonds by enterprises.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank has the opportunity to
assist Hungary in acquiring the needed management and technology in order to
take advantage of new market opportunities emerging from the liberalization
program. Complementing the restructuring of the industrial sector which is
being assisted by two Bank loans, the project is designed to help realign food
and wood products in the agroprocessing sector with market demand in the
convertible currency area. The project seeks to motivate agroprocessing
managers to be more responsive to efficiency in production and exports by
providing rewards and penalties based on performance and by significantly
improving the support services of research and development, grading, quality
control, packaging, training in management and marketing and export trade
promotion and marketing.
5.       Project Objectives.  The objectives of the project are to:
(a) increase earnings from exports to the convertible currency markets by
improving product quality; (b) increase profitability of selected products by
iacreasing productivity and reducing unit costs of production; and,
(c) support the GOH efforts to create a more effective business climate by
introducing free market prices for producers and consumers and a gradual
reduction in government subsidies.
6.       Project Description.  The project would provide funds through the
commercial banking system to about 70 agroprocessing enterprises (US$64.5
million of Bank loan) to modernize their facilities and to introduce improved
management, marketing and technology. These improvements would be icentified
by management and marketing consulting firms which would assist enterprisLs
seeking subloans under the project to prepare complete business plans for the
medium-term. Based on export market studies and the results of a marketing
and technology workshop held in Budapest in June 1987, enterprises would
develop product and market strategies which would identify the type of
investment required over the medium-term to increase product quality and to
expand market coverage. Modern equipment to rehabilitate lines in processing,
packaging, canning, bottling, chilling, freezing and cold storage facilities
would be the major areas for plant improvement. Computer software and
consultant services would be financed for those firms which want to install
inventory control systems, cost accounting, management information systems and
other operations requiring automation. Funds would also be allocated (US$5.5
million of Bank loan) for: (a) improvement in training of senior enterprise
managers in management and marketing; (b) establishing an agromarketiag office
to assist enterprises in gathering market information, to keep abreast of
barriers to entry, to update practices in packaging and labelling, advertising
etc.; (c) setting up a grading system and standards for raw materials and
final products in order to improve their quality in line with consumers'
preferences; and (d) establishing a research and development faciiity for
product development and improved technology including a center for improving
packaging of final products. The total cost of the project is estimated at



-3-
US$160.2 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component cf US$86.3
million (54X). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Hungary are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps are also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7091-HU, is being distributed separately.
7.       Agreed Actions.  Assurances or confirmations were given at
nego'iations by Government, NBH, or the Ministry of Trade (MT) on the
following points. Policy Measures: (a) a monitorable program for the
reduction in subsidies by one-third in agricul.ure and food industry cver the
period 1988-90, and a reduction in the maximum rate of export subsidies from
34X to 28% of convertible currency export earnings; and (b) a plan of action
covering 1988-90 to reduce costs and to improve the quality of poultry
products. Enterprise Activities: (a) each enterprise seeking a subloan under
the project would prepare a business plan and statement of financial
projections for commercial banks' review along with its subloan application;
(b) enterprises would create marketing and sales units within their
organizational structure.  Institutional Strengthening:   (a) establish an
agromarketing office for export trade promotion and marketing to assist
enterprises in convertible currency exports; (b) upgrade the University of
Horticultural and Food Industries (UHFI) training program in management and
introduce practical training in marketing through associatiot with a relevant
training certer in an industrialized country by end of 1988; (c) set up an
intra-industry panel to determine priorities in research and development in
agroprocessing by end of 1988; (d) adopt Western grading and quality control
standards for agroprocessing products by June 30, 1989; and, (e) establish a
center for packaging by June 30, 1989. Feeder Industry Restructuring:
(a) decentralize the glass container industry, carry out a stud; for
restructuring the industry by June 30, 1989 and put into action the
recommendations of the study; and (b) complete the necessary study to develop
a plan by December 31, 1988 for restructuring can manufacturing for
agroprocessing enterprises. Environmental Impact: each beneficiary would
demonstrate that its investment would be in accordance with safety, health and
environmental staaidards of the country, which are acceptable to the Bank.
8.       Benefits.  The proposed project would help restructure enterprises in
the agroprocessing sector to enable them to improve the quality of their
products, to penetrate new international markets, and to increase sales and
profitability. The economic rate of return based on indicative enterprise
models is expected to range between 16% and 57% and average about 33% per
investment.
9.       Risks.  The project faces three sets of risks:  (a) at the macro
level, policy and institutional reforms may not move the economic system
rapidly enough towards a market-oriented one. The risk is being reduced by
the present Government's strong commitment and the continuous dialogue between
the Bank and Hungarian officials on policy and institutional reforms; (b) at
the micro level, traditional practices may cause a delay in the response by
managers and employees of productive enterprises to the freeing of prices and
reduction in corporate taxation and subsidies. Supporting services such as
export trade promction and marketing, product grading system, quality control
improvement and training will help to accelerate changes in the behavior of
managers; (c) at the international level, unfavorable terms of trade and



-4-
tariff and non-tariff barriers may limit Hungarian exporters' ability to
increase cales abroad.  Apart from the import tariffs ard the specific
regulation regime under its Connon Agricultural Policy, export opportunities
to the EEC are also limited by the general status of production and imports in
the Community, and in some products, the market shares of Hungary are already
so high, or the proportion of extra-EEC imports in total trade is so low, that
large incremental exports are likely to be difficult. But, in spite of these
constraints to trade, Hungary's overall performance in the EEC market showed
improvement between 1980 and 1987. Hungarians can cope with these exogenous
factors through the irprovement in the quality and servicing of their products
on export markets and signing of a trade agreement with the EEC, which is
under active discussions between the Hungarians and the representatives of the
EEC and is expected to improve the Hungarian position on the EEC market;
finally, (d) environmental risks of water and air pollution are reduced as
Government imposes an effective graduating charge on enterprises which cause
pollution, and enterprises are finding it more economical to install pollution
control devices rather than pay the charges.
10.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRr and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
