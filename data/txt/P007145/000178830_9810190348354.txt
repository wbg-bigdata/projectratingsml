EL SALVADOR
APPRAISAL OF THE REVISED THIRD HIGIWAY PROJECT
SUT4ARY
i.        On November 2, 1962, the Association granted a Development Credit
of $8.0 million to the Republic of El Salvador (Credit 31-ES) for a project
with a total estimated cost of about $13.5 m]illion, which inc'luded:
(a) improvement and construction of seven trunk roads and four feeder roads;
(b) maintenance reorganization; and (c) engineering services for (a) and (b),
The Credit became effective on April 8, 1963.
ii.       At the end of 196h, the Government asked the Association to agree
to upgrade the design standards of two trunk roads, San Salvador-Acajutla and
Santa Tecla-La Libertad, because of the rapid increase of traffic, and to deo
lete the feeder roads from the project in order to stay as close as possible
to the original cost estimates.  The change in the description of the project
was approved by the Executive Directors on December 23, 1964.
iii.      The change in the project description was not formalized because
the Government subsequently requested the Association to reinstate the feeder
roads in the project and asked it to provide additional funds to cover in-
creased costs for (a) the upgraded design standards of the two trunik roads
and (b) the reinstatement of the feeder roads, for which the cost estimates
had been increased on the basis of more detailed information resulting from
the completion of detailed engineering.
iv.       Negotiations for a supplementany loan of US$ 2.8 million took place
in Decermber 1965 on the basis of cost estimates then available.  Approval of
the supplementary foreign borrowing by the El Salvador National Assembly TwTas
only obtained in MYay 1967, and then only with a reservation which needed to
be clarified. Recent estimates, based on fuller engineering data and con-
struction experience, are higher than the 1965 estimates, amounting to US$ 20.5
million and indicate that the additional foreign exchange requirement is $4.1
million.  However, due to the further delay that would probablly ensue in ob-
taining National Assembly approval for an increased amount of loan, the Govern-
ment has agreed to provide the additional foreign exchange requirements above
those covered by the proposed supplementary loan of US$ 2.8 million.
v.        The execution of the project is behind schedule but otherwise sat-
isfactory. The Government was assisted by a US consulting firm in design and
supervision of construction, and engaged another US firm to continue super-
vision after December 31, 1966. Detailed engineering is complete and con-
struction contracts have been awarded for 60% of the road works in the revised
project; these works are substantially complete.
vi.       The revised project is technically feasible, and economically ad-
vantageous. It is scheduled to be completed by lafto 1970.



- ii -
vii.      During loan negotiations in 1965, the Government confirmed its
undertakings under Credit 31-ES and gave assurance that the necessary local
funds would be appropriated. As total estimated costs have risen since
negotiations, the Government has reconfirmed the availability of local funds,
and also that part of the increased foreign exchange cost which would not be
met by the proposed supplementary loan.
viii.     The revised project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
$2.8 million equivalent to supplement the $8 million equivalent provided
under Credit 31-ES. A term of 23 years, including a four-year period of
grace, would be appropriate for the loan.

EL SALVADOR
APPRAISAL OF THiE REVISED THIRD BIGI-MYWAY PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
1.1       On Noveriber 2, 1962, the Association granted a Development Credit
of $8 million to the Republic of El Salvador (Credit 31-ES) for a third
highw-ay project originally estimated to cost about $13.5 million.  It con-
sisted of:
(a)  the improvement, construction or reconstruction of seven
trunk roads and four feeder roads;
(b) improvement of the maintenance organization for the Coastal
0                             lHighway, and
(c) engineering services required for the above.
The project was appraised in Report No. TO-3h1Oa of October 11, 1962.
1.2       The Credit became effective on April 8, 1963, and it was expected
that the project would be completed by the end of l1966. However, by letter
of October 9, 1964, the Government askNed the Association to agree to raising
of the design standards of the San Salvador-Acajutla and Santa Tecla-La
Libertad trunk roads, the higher design standards being required by a rapid
increase in traffic.  Tn order to release fumds to meet the increased costs
involved, the Government proposed to delete from the project the four feeder
roads, originally estimated to cost US$ 1.95 million, on which work had not
been started.  Specifically, the Government recuested the agreement of the
Association to:
(a)  raising of the design standard of the eight kilometer section
Santa Tecla-La Cuchilla of the San Salvador-Acajutla road
to a divided four-lane highway;
(b)  upgrading of the paving from a bitumLnous doub'le surface
treatment to an asphalt concrete carpet over the Santa
Tecla-Acajutla and Santa Tecla-La Libertad roads;
(c)  upgrading the design beyond primary suandards on the section
La Cuchilla-Sonsonate of the San Salvador-Acajutla road, in-
cluding the improvement of the road junction at La Cuchilla;
and
(d) deferring of the construction of the four feeder roads.
1.3       The Government's request was presented to the Executive Directors
in the President's Report No. P-411 of December 11, 196h, and approved by
them on December 23, 1964. The Government of El Salvador was informed
accordingly.



1.4       Before the proposed changes were formalized, the Government de-
cided to retain the feeder roads in the project because of their importance
to the economy and to finance their construction wTith its own resources.
Shortly thereafter, in May 1965, an earthquake struck San Salvador, the
capital of the counatry, and the Government had to reconsider the allocation
of its resources in order to meet the costs of emergency fork and reconstruc-
tion. Consequently, by letter of June lh, 1965, the Government requested
the Association to provide additional funds for the project, in order to
retain both the feeder roads and higher standards for the trunk roads, and
to maintain the original 61%/39% financing ratio between IDA and the Govern-
ment.
1.5       Following the Government's request, negotiations took place in
December 1965 for a revision of the project and a supplementary loan of
US$ 2.8 million. Howvever, authorization for the Government to sign the sup-
plementary loan was only obtained in May 1967 from the NCational Assembly,
and then only with a reservation which needed to be clarified.  Therefore,
presentation of the supple:oentary loan to the Executi-Ve Directors for ap-
proval was delay-ed.
1.6       Detailed engineering has been completed for all project roads.
Seven construction contracts representing about 45  of the revised construc-
tion project have been completed; two more contracts representing about ]$g
of the revised construction project are more than 70' complete.  Awarding of
contracts for the remaining road works has been held up pending availability
of the supplementary financing. Conpleted construction is generally satis-
factory.
1.7       Credit 31-ES also financed the foreign exchange cost of a four-
year program of maintenance and betterment of the Coastal Highway, which
ended on December 31, 1966. Adequate maintenance procedures have been
established under this program and the results have been satisfactory.  The
maintenance organization Twhich has been established should continue to
operate satisfactorily in the future, and the lessons learned therefrom are
gradually being put into practice on the rest of the national high-way system.
1.8       Disbursement from Credit 31-ES totalled US$ 6.8 million as of
October31, 1967. The status of the revised project is shown in Table 1, and
the revised design standards agreed upon with the Government in Table 2.

II.  REVISED COST ESTIMATES
2.1       The following table summarizes the preliminary cost estimates of
the original project in 1962, the cost estimates used during the negotia-
tions in 1965 for the US$ 2.8 million supplementary loan, and the present
cost estimates of the proposed revised project including both the proposed
changes in design standards and the feeder roads (for details, see Table 1).

say    20,500    12,100
1/ In this Table, the contingency allowances have been distributed among
the various items to permit an easier comparison.
2.2       The original cost estimates were based on a feasibility study and
preliminary engineering, and for some feeder roads on reconnaissance engineer-
ing only. They included a contingency allowance of 20% on construction and
8% on maintenance. The revised construction cost estimates used during nego-
tiations in 1965 were based on contract prices for work in hand (plus a con-
tingency allowance of 5% for uncompleted work under these contracts), and on
consultants' estimates derived from detailed engineering for works yet to be
started. The estimates for works yet to be started included an allowance of
10% for price and quantity contingencies. The amount of US$ 2.8 million for
the supplementary loan was determined on the basis of these estimates. How-
ever, since then, the estimated cost of the project has further increased.
The 1967 estimates are considered reliable as they are based on the actual



cost of completed works, on contract unit prices for work in hand adjusted
for estimated final Twork ouantities, and on consultants' estimates for the
remaining works, revised and updated by the Roads Department and including
a 10% allowance for price and quantity increases.  The higher cost of roads
no. 1 and no. 2 (Table 1) is prinarily due to their asphalt concrete sur-
facing and upgraded design standards. The increase in the final cost of
road no. 6 and the estimated cost of the feeder roads is due partly to a
substantial underestimate of earthwork quantities in the original project,
which was based on a rough reconnaissance of the terrain and partly to
heavy slides during construction which could not be anticipated in the engi-
neering. The increase in the estlimated cost of road no. 3 is primarily due
to revisions in the original engineering on the basis of construction expe-
0            rience with recent works. All costs on remaining works are affected by
increases in unit prices since 1962.
2.3       There hare been no major changes in the proportion of the imported
elements of highwa-r constructilon from the time of the original project, and
the foreign currency cooponent of cost remains at about 60%.  On thlis basis,
the foreign cost of the revised project would be about US$ 12.1 million,
which would justify additlonal lending of t 4.1 rr.illion.  However, negotia-
tions were conducted in 1965 on the basis of additional lending of $ 2.8
million and legislative approval' Ilas been obtained in El Salvador for a loan
of that amount.  In order to avoid the additional delay which would be in-
curred by,r resubmission to the Legislature of loan documents in a higher
amount, the Government has proposed, and the Bank concurs that the loan be
maintained at the level of $ 2.8 million as originally negotiated.  The
level of Bank/IDA participation in construction expenditures will be ad-
justed downward to between 40!t and 50% as appropriate when bids f1or the
remaining works have been analyzed. The Government is prepared to cover the
expenditures in excess of the Bank/IDA share from its own resources.

III. EXECUTION
3.1       The Highlwniay Department is responsible for the execution of the
project.  The detailed engineering, including specifications and conitract
documents, has been prepared by Tippets-Abbett-7lIcCarthy-Stratton, U.S.
consultants, who, until December 31, 1966, were also in charge of super-
vision of the construction work and responsible for advising the Highway
Department on the maAntenance of the Coastal HighwazaF.  The Government has
appointed Brown and Root, U.S. consultarits. to supervise construction work
from January 1, 1967.  Construction is b-y contract let on the basis of
international corrmpetitl-ve bidding. In order to mirinimize costs through
better com,petition, the remainsing works will be divided into five sections,
and two bids will be called, at different times, for groups of three and
two work sections.  Contractors will be permitted to bid each time for one
or nmore sections, which will enable sraaller regionally based corntractros to
comripete with larger international firns.
3.2       Works now under contract will ke conpleted earlv in 1968.  The
first call for tenders for the remaining works will be made shortly, and
the whole project should be comrpleted by late 1970.

IV.   COCI.'IIC JUSTTFTCATIOPI
A. Trunk Roads
4.1       lconomic analyses were made on three trunk roads in the paragraphs
below to check wThether they are still justified with increased costs.  Theyr
are:  The Santa Tecla-Acajutla and Santa Tecla-la Libertad highwa-Y7s, on
which construction standards have been raised, and the Sonzacate-San Jorge
highway on which the cost increase has been substantial although no upgrad-
ing of design standards is involved. As construction worlks on four other
roads included in the original project are alreadiE,r completed, no attermpt to
review the _ustification of these roads is made in this report.
Santa Tecla-Acajutla and Santa Tec'a-La Libertad
The original appraisal of the pro,ect was based on the assumiption
that traffic would grow at an annual rate of 9D betweenr 1961 and 1970.  Be-
t'ween 1961 and 1966, howrever, the actual annual traffic growth exceeded
those projections substantially, ranging between 1h4  and 2h4  on different
sections of the Santa Tecla-Acjceutla road and an average of 28% on the Santa
Tecla-La Libertad road (see Ta'le 3).
4;.3      These higher than anticipated traffic volumes now justify higher
design standards on both roads.  Upgrading the pavemient from a bituminous
double surface treatment to an asphalt concrete carpet is necessary to ac-
commodate the projeczed traffic and to reduce road maintenance costs.  The
widening of the Santa Tecla-La Cuchilla section of the Santa Tecla-Acajutla
road to a four-lane highway is needed to prevent serious congestion, which
otherwise would ha,-e taken place soon after completion of the originally
planned two-lane highway,.
_1-h .kThe rates of return, based on quantifiable economic benefits, have
0             been reassessed taking into account the higher construction costs and apply-
ing the originally estimated unit savings in vehicle operating costs (US 0.o4
per 1Ic for passenger cars and US 1.6A, per l-m for corMmercial vehicles) to the
revised traffic forecasts.  These unit savings have been confirmed by recent
misslons.  Except for the Santa Tecla-La Cuchilla section, mentioned above,
the following annu-l traffi.c growth rates have been projected:  10% between
1966-197S, declining thereafter to 7% and 5%J for 1977-1981 and i982-i986
respectively.  These assumptions are conservative cormipared to the actual
growth rates experienced in recent -ears.  Tra.f Ic on the La Cuchilla-Sonso-
nate section has not been projected bey.-ond 1977, as the capacity of the
improved road (6,000 vehicles per day) will -then be reached, and additional
investment would be necessarv to acco2modate additional traffic.  In view of
the existing high traffic voluzme and the sLowing dowvn in traffic growth rate
experienced in the recent past, traffic on the four-lane Santa Tecla-La
Cuchilla section is anti.cipated to grcw at a somewhat lower rate:  B% per
annum between 1966 and 1975 and 6f between 1976 and 1985.



-7-
4.5       Hi,her benefits from the increased traffic generally offset the
cost increase due to the rise in design standards.  Benefits from savings
in transport costs alone, projected over a 20-year assumed economic life of
the road sections included in the project, result in the following returns
on the investment cost for individual' sections of these twqo trunk roads:
i.  Santa Tecla-Acajutla                 16%
of which:
Santa Tecla-La Cuchilla        10%
La Cuchilla-Sonsonate          214%
Sonsonate-Acajutla             114
ii.  Santa Tecla-La Libertad              10%
These returns are satisfactory.  In addition, they do not incllide any allow-
ance for time savings to freight and passengers or for avoiding the increas-
ing congestion costs that would occur (particularly on the Santa Tec'La-La
Cuchilla section) if the investment was not made.
Sonzacate-San Jorge
4.6       This road will provide a 16 killometer shorter link for through
traffic between Santa Ana and the seaport of Acajutla, wghich at present uses
a detour along Lake Coatepeque.  For the traffic on the existing, low-stand-
ard road benefits consist of savings in vehicle operating costs of about
US¢ 2.2 per vehicle-km for automobiles and US¢ 5.3 per vehicle-kmi for com-
mercial vehicles as a result of improvement in the quality of the road and
the above reduction in distance. There will also be savings equivalent to
USO 4.1 per average vehicle-km because of savings in distance for the Santa
Ana-Acajutla through traffic which will be diverted to this road.  For
0             normal traffic growth on the existing road the past trend of 5/0 per annum
was projected over the lifetirme of the project. Diverted through traffic,
which is estimated at 50% of the present traffic on the detour route along
Lake Coatepeque, is anticipated to increase 10% annually over the first ten
years of the project's lifetime, declining thereafter to 7% and 5% for the
remaining two five-year periods.  On this basis, benefits would yield a
return of 11% on the investment cost.
B. Feeder Roads
4.7       In view of the doubling of costs for the feeder roads the agricul-
tural and developmental benefits have been reassessed on the basis of the
present situation. The original appraisal report did not quantify the econ-
omidc returns. Benefits have now been estimated on the basis of the net
economic value added to GDP from the incremental agricultural output within
the zones of influence of the roads made possible by the improvemLent of the
access to markets.  The gross value of incremental production resulting from



better access to markets is expected to reach almost US$ 2.7 million
annually at full developnent five years after completion of the road (see
Table 14.  The net economic value of the incremental production at full
development is estimated at approximately $ 1.4 million equivalent.
4.8       The estimation of net economic value is based oni the results of
an investigation undertaken by the Government of hl Salvador, which i-ndi-
cates that the on-farm costs of current inputs, including labor, for the
products concerned (fruits, beans, corn, sugar cane, rice) range betwieen
40l and 75% of the gross value added.  Since transportation is the major
bottleneck to f,rther agricultural development in the roads' service areas,
the entire increment in net value was attributed to inproved access to mar-
kets.  Although a further increase in production as a result of other fac-
tors, such as improved agricultural techniques, is conceivable, no allowance
for these has been mniade in the calculations.  The benefits from the feeder
road program are, therefore, the iricreass in thF* nrt value of agricultural
production in the area served.
14.9       Lhe estimat-ed annual net benefits at ful'l develop-ment range be-
tween US$ 80,000 equivalent a-nd abo,x. US$ 600,000 equivalentt for the dif-
ferent roads. These benef-ts vield the fol'lowing rates of return on the in-
vestment o-ver the usefLui economic life of the project of fifteen vears:
(a)  Santa Tecla-Teotepeque -20,v
(b)  Santo Tozaas-Co4utepeque - 17%;
(c)  San Ramon- Inter-Lmerican THighway - 12% and
(d)  Juavua-Los Arenales - 10.
The rate of return on the feeder road program, as a whole would be 17%.  The
overall as well as the individual returns are adequate to justify the in-
vestment evean writh the increases in construction costs.

V. CONTCLUSION
5.1       The revised highway project, including upgraded design standards
on two of the trunk roads and updated cost estimates, is technically sound
and has a satisfactory economic justification.
5.2       During loan negotiations in 1965, the Government confirmed its
undertakings under Credit Agreemient 31-ES and gave assurance that the neces-
sary local funds would be provided.  As the cost estimates have risen since
the negotiations, the Government has reconfirmed that funds, including that
part of the increased foreign exchange cost which will not be met by the
supplementary loan, will be made available in accordance with the new cost
estimates.
5.3       The revised protect provides a suitable basis for a BaJlt Loan of
$12.8 million equivalent to supplement the `8.O ruillion equivalent of Credit
31-7S.  A terl-a of 23 Years, inc71uding a four-year period of grace, tTould be
appropriate for the proposed loan.
