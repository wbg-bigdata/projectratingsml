INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPHENT ASSCCIATION
REPOiRT AND RECONEYNDATION OF TIlE
PREBSIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE DEVELOP ENT CREDIT
(NO. 31-ES) TO EL SALVADOR
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        I submit herewith the folloTing report and recoi{mendation on a
request from the Government of El Salvador for a change in the use of
funds under Development Credit No, 31-ES for a highway project.  It is
proposed to delete certain roads from the Project, and to use the funds
thus released, amounting to about $1l9 million, to raise the design
standards on other roads on which the growth of traffic has been more
rapid than anticipated.
2.        On November 2, 1962, thie Association signed a Credit for $8
million with the Government of El Salvador for a project estimated to cost
about $13.5 million. It consisted of:
i)  the improvement, construction or reconstruction of seven
trunk roads and four feeder roads;
ii)  improvement of the maintenance organization for the Coastal
Highway; and
iii)  engineering services required for the above.
3.        The Credit became effective on April 8, 1963.  Final designs
for all project roads have been completed, and five contracts representing
70% of the trunk road construction have been awarded.  Work on the trunk
roads is presently somewhat behind schedule, but the delay is not expected
to affect seriously the final completion date of the Project, scheduled
V.         for December 1966.  No contracts for feeder road construction have yet
been awarded. The implementation of the maintenance program of the Coastal
Highway is also behind schedule but is presently showing satisfactory
progress.



II. PROPOS5M CHA^NGES IN THE PROJECT
t.        The Government has asked the Association to agree to a revision
of the design standards of the roads San Salvador - Acajutla and Santa
Tecla - La Libertad, resulting in substantial additional work on these
roads and increasing the costs; at the same time, the Government has re-
quested the deletion from the present project of the four feeder roads for
which about $1.9 m-l'ion had been allocated but on which work has not yet
started.  Specifically, the Government of El Salvador has requested the
agreement of the Association to:
i) raise the design standards of the eight kilometer section
Santa Tecla - La Cuchilla to a divided four-lane highway on
the San Salvador - Acajutla road;
ii) upgrade the pavement from a bituminous double surface treat-
ment to an asphalt concrete carpet over the two roads, in-
cluding the section Acajutla - Santa Tecla and Santa Tecla -
La Libertad;
iii) improve the geometric design on the section La Cuchilla -
Sonsonate of the San Salvador - Acajutla road;
iv) improve the road junction at La Cuchilla;
v) in order to reallocate the Credit funds to the above purposes,
defer the construction of the four feeder roads included in
the Project to the next stage of highway development.
III. EFFECT ON COST ESTIMATES
5.        The total cost of the project was originally estimated at $13.5
million equivalent of which $10.8 million (including 20% for contingencies)
represented the preliminary estimated cost of construction of the seven
trunk roads and four feeder roads. Original estimates were based on
feasibility studies and preliminary engineering without detailed engineering.
The table below shows the original cost estimates, the revised cost
estimates after detailed engineering, and the final project including the
proposed improvements. The cost of the seven trunk roads, on the basis of
their original design standards, is still reasonably close to the original
estimates after final engineering has been completed and construction work
partly contracted.  The higher costs of these roads in the revised project
are due primarily to the proposed changes in design standards. Since the
total cost of these roads would now come to $11.9 million (including con-
tingencies) the Government at our request has confirmed its willingness
to provide additional funds if required.

IV.  TECHNICAL AND ECOl.NCNIC JUSTIFICATICNJ
6.        When the project was appraised, it was assumed that the traffic
on the trunk roads would increase by an average of about 10% per year
between 1961 and 1970.  On two roads, traffic has been increasing at a much
higher rate:

iii. check poinu Sonsonate               595        1,683          41
B.  Santa Tecla - La Libertad
i.  check point Santa Tecla            720        2,138          43
ii.  check point La Libertad            560        1,974          52
The increased traffic is partly due to the extensive industrial development
which has been going on in the San Sal-v-ador area and at Acajutla, such as
the establishment of a fertilizer plant, cement plant, oil refinery, glass
factory and grain silos, and the construction of a 25 MZ thermal power
plant financed by a Bank loan in June 1963.
7.        The improved design standards as related to the traffic are tech-
nically justified and consistent with sowud engineering practices.  Up-
grading the pavement on the San Salvador - Acajutla and Santa Tecla - La
Libertad roads from a bituminous double surface treatment to an asphalt
concrete carpet is necessary to accoimodate the expected uraffic and to
keep maintenance costs down. If the Santa Tecla - La Cuchilla section of
the San Salvador - Acajutla road is not built as a four-lane divided high-
way, traffic will become congested very soon after this section is completed.
8.        In the revised project, the increased costs of the San Salvador -
Acajutla and Santa Tecla - La Libertad roads are generally more than offset
by increased savings resulting from the larger growth in traffic than had
been anticipated, so that returns on the investments tend to be higher
than in the earlier estimate.
9.        For the Santa Tecla - La Libertad section, the daily traffic in
1967 is now estimated at about 3,000 vehicles compared to less than 800
in the original project. This would result in an economic return of about
20% instead of the initial 10%.
10.       The daily traffic on the La Cuchilla - Acajutla section is now
estimated at 2,1400 vehicles in 1967, compared to less than 700 in the
earlier estimate, This would result in an economic return of about 28%,
instead of 18%.
11.       For the Santa Tecla - La Cuchilla section, the daily traffic in
1967 is now estimated at 5,000 vehicles, compared to 3,500 in the original
appraisal. In addition, the better alignment and larger capacity of the
road will decrease vehicle operating costs by at least L17 US/ per kna,



- 5 -
compared to a saving of 1.1/ on the earlier design. These two factors
do not quite offset the increased costs of the project, but the rate of
return on the investment still exceeds 20?, which is highly satisfactory.
12.       During the appraisal of the original project, it was impossible
to quantify the economic return to be expected on the feeder roads. Their
deletion from the project appears justified in view of the very high
economic returns on the above improvements of the trunk highways, although
the developmental effects of these feeder roads are probably high, and
enough to justify the investment.  The Government considers that, in view
of the temporary limitation on its resources, priority should be given
to the two major trunk roads, which have a general impact on the whole
economy and its import-export trade, over the construction of the feeder
roads, the impact of which would be limited to a restricted zone. It is,
however, preparing a new highway program for consideration by the Bank
which would include financing for the roads deleted from the present
project.
13.       If the draft letter attached to this report is approved,
correspondence will be exchanged to confirm the modifications in the
project.
V. RECOMMENDATION
14.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the following
resolution:
RESOLVED:
THAT the Association shall enter into an agreement with the
Republic of El Salvador, amending the Development Credit Agreement between
the Association and the Republic of El Salvador, dated November 2, 1962,
-upon terms and conditions substantially in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the draft letter which has been presented to this meeting.
