MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO UGANDA FOR A
SOUTHWEST REGION AGRICULTURAL. REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Uganda for SDR 7.6 million (US$ 10.0 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance a Southwest
Region Agricultural Rehabilitation Project. The project would be
cofinanced by IFAD, who would provide a loan of SDR 9.1 million (US$ 12.0
million equivalent).
2.       Background. Uganda's population of about 15 million is 901 rural.
Agriculture provides 651 of GDP, 99Z of exports (coffee) and over 90X of
employment. Agricultural potential is goods 701 of the land is
cultivable, with smallholder production predominating. Until 1970, Uganda
had one of the strongest agricultural economies in Africa. Political and
military instability since then have seriously disrupted production.
Output and exports of all major crops were less in 1980-85 than in 1966-70.
With the near collapse of the society, and the destruction of transport and
marketing infrastructure, fanmers have reverted to subsistence production,
with little surplus for the domestic or export market.
3.       The economic situation inherited by the National Resistance
Movement in January 1986 was extremely precarious, and economic
developments and policies worsened during 1986. Finally, a consensus has
emerged within the Government to change its policies on the exchange rate,
producer incentives, public sector enterprises and other key areas. The
resulting Economic Recovery Program is already being supported by an IMF
Structural Adjustment Facility of SDR 53.3 million, and the Bank and
Government signed for SDR 69.7 million in Economic Recovery Credits on
September 30, 1987. The credits would support reforms in agricultural
producer pricing and marketing, as well as supply-side measures in the
industrial and transportation sectors. This agreement with Government on
the macroeconomic framework now makes it possible to undertake
rehabilitation operations in the agricultural sector.
4.       Rationale for IDA and IFAD Involvement.  Besides adequate price
incentives and open markets for food crops provided under the Economic
Recovery Program, key factors in obtaining agricultural production response
from smallholders will be the rehabilitation of transport and marketing
infrastructure and the revival of research and extension, as provided under
the proposed project. At a later stage support would be provided for



-2-
strengthening of national service institutions and production and
processing of particular commodities (livestock, coffee and tea). The
proposed project is simple, focussirg only on inputs, roads, research and
extension. Tihe Southwest region is one of the most stable and potentially
productive in the country, and is currently benefiting from complementary
donor support for road rehabilitation, rural water supply atU .aealth
services development. With most of the land in the hands of smallholders
(cropped area per farm estimated at 1.6 ha) and with a rural population
density of 90 persons per square km, the project area meets IFAD's
objectives of assisting small farmers with food production.
5.       Proiect ObJectives.  The project seeks to increase food
production, incomes and living standards of small farmers in the four
districts of Southwest Uganda, by increasing agricultural productivity
through the provision of improved inputs, research and extension, and
improving access to markets and inputs, through road rehabilitation.
6.       Project Description.  The project, managed by the Ministry of
Agriculture, would cover the Mbarara, Bushenyi, Rukungiri, and Kabale
districts, and includes four components totalling US$27.4 million:
(a) Agricultural inputs (USS 8.1 million) to support food
production;
(b) Rural access roads (US$ 13.3 million) would rehabilitate up
to 2,000 km of Class II and III roads through spot
improvements, and improve district level road maintenance
capabilities;
(e) Adaptive research and extension (US$ 3.9 million) would
rehabilitate two district farm institutes, a research
substation and a MOA farm, and strengthen adaptive research
and farmer outreach programs; and
(d) Management, monitoring and evaluation (US$ 2.1 million).
7.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement was obtained that the Government will
provide adequate resources from its budget to cover the operating costs of            p
maintaining the roads and other infrastructure to be rehabilitated.  To
ensure effective project execution, agreement was also obtained that: (a)
the Interministerial Coordinating Committee, the Regional Coordinating
Committee and key members of the Project Management Unit would be in place
and the first year's Work Program would be approved prior to credit
effecti-eness; (b) project input prices would approximate market wholesale
rates; and (c) the project inputs wholesaling operation woula be privatized
prior to the completion of the project.
8.       Justification.  The Southwest region has excellent agricultural
potential. With supportive Government policies, coupled with the
infrastructural support and improved services provided in this project,
food production will return to and surpass previous levels and will yield a
satisfactory rate of return.



-3-
9.       Risks.  The viability of this project depends on the maintenance
of an appropriate exchange rate, adequate production incentives and
producer prices, the liberalization of food crop marketing policies, and a
reduction in the inflation rate. The project also depends on the creation
of a climate of physical security and economic stability to encourage on-
farm investment. -The risk that the Government may cease pursuing these
policies is mitigated by its agreement to the conditions of the IMF and IDA
support. Project related risks, which include the possibility of: (i)
resistance to higher priced project inputs; (ii) delays in implementation;
and (iii) lack of motivation amongst Government staff charged with project
implementation, have been taken into consideration, and minimized, in the
design of the project implementation mechanisms.
11.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the oroposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
