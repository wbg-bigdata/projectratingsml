REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
BIODIVERSITY COLLECTIONS PROJECT
Background
1.          Rich Biodiversity. Indonesia is rich in biodiversity. It contains nearly 10 percent of the
world's closed tropical forests. It also has extensive coral reefs and more marine coastline than any
other tropical country. Although the archipelago represents only 1.3 percent of the earth's land area,
it contains an estimated 25 percent of the world's fish species, 17 percent of all bird species, 16
percent of reptile and amphibian species, 12 percent of mammal species, 10 percent of plant species,
and unknown numbers of species of invertebrate animals, fungi and microorganisms. Of these,
perhaps 30 percent of the flora and 90 percent of the fauna are not yet fully described and
scientifically documented.
2.          Economic Importance of Biodiversity. Indonesia's biological resources are economically
important both globally and nationally. Many plant species originated in Indonesia, including cloves,
black pepper, and some tropical fruits. Indonesians use over 6,000 species of plants and animals;
daily they gather or cultivate these species for food, handicrafts, medicines, fuel, and building
materials. Natural ecosystems strongly influence natural resource development (the agriculture,
livestock, forestry and fisheries sectors contributed over 18 percent of GDP in 1991), provide new
commercial products (e.g., pharmaceuticals) and also affect water resource management, which is
important for industrial and municipal development.
3.          Importance of Systematic Biology and Collections. Systematic biology or systematics
(i.e., the classification of living organisms) provides the scientific theory, principles, and process to
inventory, monitor, and catalogue biodiversity information. Systematic collections (i.e., reference
collections of plant and animal specimens that are preserved in chemicals or pressed and dried) and
their associated data provide basic reference tools for acquiring, managing, accessing, and
disseminating this scientific information on biodiversity. Biodiversity information is required in
natural resource management, identification of plants and animals with economic potential,
conservation, spatial planning, natural resource valuation, and environmental impact assessment.
Improving systematic information through better reference collections and through better access to
associated anthropologic, habitat, geographic, and environmental data is therefore an integral
component of the global biodiversity strategy.
4.          Importance of PPPB's Collections. The Research and Development Center for Biology
(PPPB) of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI)' provides the core scientific resources for
systematic collections and associated information in Indonesia. PPPB's collections are the largest in
Asia and include many unique and irreplaceable scientific reference specimens, including some dating
from the nineteenth century.
5.          Constraints. PPPB's institutional capacity to respond to the growing national and
international demand for biodiversity information is limited by serious constraints in staffing,
specimen storage, geographic and taxonomic coverage, and data management:
LIPI is a non-departmental government institution, which is under the control of and reports directly to the
President.



- 2 -
(a)   Staffing. PPPB has a shortage of senior staff experienced in strategic management,
systematic biology, and database development, and a shortage of well-trained and
motivated curatorial assistants.
(b)   Storage. A significant proportion of the PPPB's collections have been preserved using
non-archival quality materials and stored for years under sub-optimal conditions. They
urgently require restoration to avoid irreparable damage and loss of valuable information.
(c)   Coverage. The geographic and taxonomic coverage of Indonesia's combined collections,
including PPPB's, is patchy, and the sampling density (the average number of specimens
collected per unit area) is one of the lowest in the world.
(d)   Data management. The lack of a database seriously restricts access to information within
the existing collections. The lack of a database not only makes access to specific
taxonomic or geographic information difficult, it also makes identification of gaps in
coverage difficult. The weakness of PPPB's linkages with external clients also
undermines its effectiveness. Outside groups frequently send specimens for identification
to overseas institutions instead of PPPB and then the information is not readily available
to other users in Indonesia.
Government Strategy for Biodiversity Conservation and Information
6.          The Government of Indonesia's (GOI's) overall conservation strategy has been elaborated
in the 1991 Biodiversity Action Plan for Indonesia. To ensure the sustainable use of natural resources
and conservation oi genetic and biological diversity in the various ecosystems, the Government's
strategy is to increase ecosystem types covered in protected areas, improve the management of
protected areas, and enhance understanding and participation of people. Support for biodiversity
collections was explicitly included in the Plan.
7.          Over the long-term, PPPB plans to meet the expanding need for scientific information on
biodiversity. The mission of PPPB, as it relates to biodiversity, is to develop systematic research
collections and to develop and disseminate associated specimen-based information. Research at PPPB
is collections-based and integral to this mission. Research subjects include systematic biology,
ethnobiology and study of other plants and animals with economic potential, conservation biology, and
ecology. PPPB seeks to integrate and coordinate the organization and dissemination of biodiversity
information at the national level, in a way that would be responsive to user needs. This mission
requires a transformation of PPPB into an institution that provides essential documentation for an
environmental information system and for priority research on biodiversity. The data storage
revolution in computational science has only recently made it feasible to readily access information in
systematic collections. PPPB has the potential to become a world leader in the use of databases that
would enable it to strategically manage the collections and to make information available to users in
real time.
8.          Within the next ten years, LIPI plans to consolidate several centers for research and
development (Biology, Limnology, Biotechnology, and units of Applied Chemistry and Applied
Physics) in a new Life Sciences Complex/Center, which would facilitate the integration of biodiversity
research and information services. As an initial step, GOI is seeking support from the Government of
Japan (GOJ) to provide a replacement building for PPPB's zoological collections which would become
part of the Complex/Center. Future improvement of scientific information on biodiversity would also



- 3 -
include developing capacity for inventory and monitoring at new regional centers and at existing
facilities within provincial universities.
Rationale for GET Funding
9.         The project meets the "demonstration" criteria currently required for GET support. It is
the first project of its kind. It would provide an institutional model for developing and strengthening
systematic collections in other countries. Furthermore, it would increase basic knowledge in
systematic biology and disseminate this knowledge throughout the international scientific community.
10.        The project would also contribute to the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy by
improving environmental management and strengthening government capacities. It is a logical
progression of the Bank's support for conservation and environmental assessment. The Bank, through
a number of initiatives under the Indonesia Forestry I and subsequent projects, has assisted GOI in the
formulation of the national conservation strategy. Bank-supported projects have included investment
in conservation, such as support for specific parks. The Bank has also supported the strengthening of
environmental assessment of investment proposals. Systematic collections are a basic tool for
biodiversity inventory and monitoring, which in turn is a crucial element of environment assessment.
Project Objectives
11.        The proposed project would strengthen the institutional capacity of PPPB to support
systematic biological collections, a basic reference tool for biodiversity inventory and monitoring.
The project would also make information from the collections available to external clients. The
project would establish the foundation required for PPPB to meet the expanding needs for biodiversity
information over the long-term, and would provide high priority information during the project period.
The main objectives would be:
(a)  to provide support for overall project management and coordination, in order to foster
both effective project implementation and long-term institutional transformation;
(b)  to restore and develop the collections and associated functions of the Botany and Zoology
Divisions;
(c)  to design and establish a computerized database of specimen-based data for collections
management, collection plans and development, and external use; and
(d)  to strengthen the capacity to coordinate and foster collaborative biological research
activities and client services.
Project Description
12.        The project would be implemented over five years and would include the following
components:
(a)   General Project Management and Coordination. This component would comprise the
establishment of a steering committee, a project management committee and a project
implementation unit (including locally contracted specialists in project and financial
management), a technical advisory group (of international advisors with institutional and
technical expertise), a user advisory group (representative of external clients), short-term



- 4 -
advisors and trainers (in environmental health and safety, document restoration, data
field design, and specialized systematic biologists), provision of language training and
project-related workshops for staff of PPPB, including provision of training materials and
supplies, a grants program for systematic research and genetic resource conservation2,
and a financing strategy study.
(b)   Systematic Collections and Research in Botany and Zoology. This component would
support the development of systematic collections and associated research in the Botany
and Zoology Divisions through:
(i) Human Resource Development: Provision of about 18 graduate-level scholarships
in systematic biology and about 11 overseas work-study programs, local
management training programs for collection managers, plus advice and extensive
on-the-job training for managers, scientists, interns, and technicians in curation,
taxa identification, field collecting, and user product development;
(ii) Collections Restoration and Development: Provision of building renovations,
furniture, archival supplies, 40 temporary employees and redeployment of 20
permanent staff to work as curatorial assistants in order to improve and expand
specimen storage, to improve the scientific organization of the collections, to
restore deteriorating specimens, and to stabilize the specimens as necessary before
moving them to new cabinets or buildings3 (these activities would include the
integration of the marine reference collections belonging to the Research and
Development Center for Oceanology with PPPB's terrestrial-based reference
collections);
(iii) Research Facilities: Building renovation and provision of essential scientific
literature and equipment in order to improve systematic biology research facilities;
and
(iv)  Publications and Products: Development of an illustrated technical glossary, a
computerized bibliography of written reference materials, a computerized
gazetteer, a database and handbooks covering specific taxa, national field guides,
including a field guide for Gunung Halimun National Park, and a specimen
identification service.
(c)   Information Systems Management. This component would set up a computer database
and a local area network capable of basic specimen data entry, automated label
production, collections management functions, and information dissemination. This
system would complement and comprise a node of a wider network, which GOI plans to
develop. This component would comprise inputs of technical assistance, an overseas
work-study program, computer and network equipment and installation, software
development and support, and the establishment of a new sub-division with redeployed
and newly recruited staff.
2 During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that the research grants program would be carried out
in accordance with procedures and criteria agreed with the Bank.
During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that GOI would stabilize specimens as necessary before
moving them to new cabinets or to different buildings.



- 5 -
(d)   Scientific Collaboration and Services. This component would provide a small amount of
technical assistance and office equipment to strengthen PPPB's capacity to manage
collaborative research, client services, and training programs.
prject Fi ng
13.        The proposed GET grant of US$ 7.2 million equivalent would finance 63 percent of the
total project costs (US$ 11.4 million). GET would finance an estimated US$ 3.8 million net of taxes
for technical assistance, studies and training, for which an estimated US$ 2.2 million net of taxes
would be procured through a single contract in accordance with Bank procedures. A single contract
would facilitate provision of highly-specialized technical expertise and training, which is in scarce
supply worldwide, and in some cases, unique. GOI would finance an estimated US$ 1.0 million in
taxes and duties on investment costs. In addition, GOI would contribute US$ 3.2 million net of taxes
in local training, research grants, and recurrent institutional operating expenses. Estimated costs and
financing are summarized in Schedule A. Procurement methods, disbursement categories, and the
disbursement schedule are outlined in Schedule B.
Project Implementation
14.        Overall Management. PPPB would implement the project. A Project Manager,
supported by a small project implementation unit, and Project Coordinators for botany, zoology,
information systems management, and scientific collaboration, would manage the project. The Project
Manager would work with a Project Management Committee (which would include PPPB divisional
managers) to coordinate project activities with the overall PPPB operations, and would report to the
Director of PPPB and an interagency Steering Committee. The Project Manager would also receive
guidance from the Technical and User Advisor Groups and from short-term foreign experts and
individually contracted specialists. In addition to providing general project oversight, the Steering
Committee would direct the financing strategy study and decide on research grant allocations. During
negotiations the Bank obtained assurances from GOI that the membership of the Project Management
Committee, Steering Committee, and the User Advisory Group would be determined in accordance
with criteria agreed with the Bank. GOI has submitted to the Bank evidence that the consultants
implementing the technical assistance and specialized training contract, and the individuals to be
contracted as the project management and financial management specialists have been selected.
During negotiations it was agreed that as a condition of disbursement for equipment, furniture, and
materials, and for research grants, that GOI provide evidence that the technical assistance and
specialized training contract has been signed and that the project management and financial
management specialists have been hired.
15.        Planning, Monitoring, and Evaluation. The project design includes a planning process in
the first year that would: (a) define an explicit policy framework for managing and developing
biodiversity information; (b) develop a work program and set of priorities for overall institutional
management, curation upgrading, database development, and client services; (c) specify detailed
arrangements for staffing, career development, budget, and other required inputs; and (d) delineate
criteria and procedures for evaluating the performance of staff and consultants and the effectiveness of
management policies and procedures, training programs, client services. The resulting plan would be
used for project monitoring and evaluation. The planning process includes two workshops during
project inception, both of which would require participation of the TAG and other specialists. One
workshop would determine database fields. The other workshop would determine taxa-specific
priorities for project activities, using a methodology which incorporates estimates of accuracy and
coverage of existing information, and projections of incremental costs and benefits of improvements.



- 6 -
During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that PPPB would: (a) in consultation with the User
Advisory Group and the Steering Committee, prepare the content of the project work plan and the
format of the progress reports, acceptable to the Bank, by March 31, 1995; (b) subsequently submit
the progress reports, including an evaluation of consultant and staff performance, on a semi-annual
basis, by April 30 and October 31, beginning April 30, 1995; (c) submit to the Bank a review of the
work plan, which would include staffing, management procedures and decisions, budget, technical
assistance, training, client services, and other project requirements, by September 30, 1995, and on an
annual basis thereafter, and promptly carry out the recommendations of this review, taking into
account the comments of the Bank, and (d) submit to the Bank the budget proposals for the project
work plan agreed with the Bank, by December 31, 1995 and on an annual basis thereafter. During
negotiations the Bank obtained assurances that PPPB would prepare a mid-project review by
December 31, 1997, which would incorporate the strategy developed under the Financial Strategy
Study, and a report on collections data access policy, and promptly carry out the recommendations of
this review, taking into account the comments of the Bank.
16.        Staffing. Of the 115 positions required for the project, some 53 would be filled by
existing PPPB staff (from a pool of some 325 PPPB staff), some 13 staff would be seconded or
recruited, and some 49 staff would be locally contracted on a fixed-term basis. All 18 managerial job
positions for the project would be filled by existing PPPB personnel, with the exception of the
Information Systems Coordinator position, which would be filled initially by an employee seconded
from another LIPI agency. Locally contracted specialists would assist with project management tasks,
fmancial management, software applications, engineering design, and various publications and
products. New permanent staff would be recruited as required to participate in the graduate
scholarship program. Some 20 redeployed staff and 40 temporary employees would work as
curatorial assistants on the collections restoration and development, and data entry. This staffing plan
is feasible given PPPB's existing labor profile, the standard GOI civil service and contracting
regulations, and high retention rates of permanent staff. However, there are significant uncertainties
regarding the potential capacities of PPPB permanent and contracted staff. To address this concern
and facilitate smooth project implementation, the annual review of the work plan would include a
specific focus on staffing and associated financial requirements.
17.        Training. The training program would consist of: (a) graduate degree scholarships for
eighteen staff; (b) overseas work-study and local management training programs for twelve staff;
(c) on-the-job training of all project staff by three long-term advisors, eleven short-term advisors and
experts, 6-10 scientific mentors, three locally contracted specialists, and PPPB scientists and
managers; (d) internships for eight to sixteen faculty from local and provincial universities;
(e) language training as required; and (f) inventory and monitoring fieldwork training. The project
implementation unit would manage the overall training program, with contractual and staff assistance.
As part of the project objective to strengthen PPPB's capacity to manage training, the project would
include specific measures to strengthen the mobilization of additional financial resources for human
resource development of PPPB staff. During negotiations the Bank obtained assurances from GOI that
the graduate scholarship programs and students would be selected in accordance with criteria agreed
with the Bank, and recipients of training would be offered positions in PPPB for a minimum of three
years where they could make full use of their training.
18.        Project Scope, Phasing. and Focus. Project designers have made every effort to
determine a level of funding and an implementation schedule that is within the implementation
capacity of PPPB and that reflects the importance of systematic collections relative to other national
biodiversity priorities. Because of the current condition of PPPB's collections and the limited
institutional capacity in the field of expertise the project must draw on, both within Indonesia and



- 7 -
worldwide, the project would focus on internal development. Measurable services and products for
external clients would be limited in scope and would be achieved only in the later years of the project.
Yet these would enable PPPB to demonstrate, albeit on a small scale, the current and potential
benefits of project investments to external clients and to possible funding sources.
19.        Linkage with Users and Information Policy. This investment is designed to be user-, not
supply-driven over the long-term. Early in project preparation, GOI sponsored a workshop to give
potential users an opportunity to contribute to project design. Prior to grant negotiations GOI gave
these users an opportunity to review the final project proposal. GOI is now establishing a User
Advisory Group (UAG) representative of the range of potential users. The project will also support a
Collections Data Access Specialist who would draft a report on government policies involved in access
to and sharing of data with outsiders.
20.        Coordination with Japanese-financed Project. The proposed Japanese-funded project that
would replace the buildings that house the Center's zoological collections would supplement, not
duplicate, the GEF project. The GEF project schedule has been adjusted to accommodate the
projected timing of GOJ-funded investments, giving special consideration of the need to stabilize the
specimens before the move. GOI has taken responsibility for further coordination. While the GOJ
project would provide a valuable contribution, the GEF project could proceed even if GOJ support
does not materialize. During negotiations the Bank obtained assurances from Government that GOI
would provide an adequate budget to rehouse the zoological collections in improved facilities by
March 31, 1998 should the anticipated Government of Japan support be insufficient or not materialize.
Project Sustainability
21.        The project includes financial, staffing, training, technical assistance, and physical
investments designed to support long-term institutional transformation. The project includes a study to
develop a financing strategy to address financial sustainability after the project period. During
negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that the Financial Strategy Study would be completed by
September 30, 1997, and that PPPB would begin to operationalize the strategy developed under this
study during the mid-project review. The Financing Strategy Study will help enable PPPB to obtain
the long-term increases in the institutional budget to cover incremental operating costs resulting from
the project, and the financing required for continued development of biodiversity information. The
staffing plan depends on training and motivating a core group of permanent managers and curatorial
assistants to maintain the collections and to continue to develop the database after the project, and
using temporary staff for much of the restoration work which would be completed by the end of the
project. The annual review of the work plan would facilitate any necessary adjustments in the staffing
plan and the Government's financial contribution. The selection criteria for the scholarship programs
and students and the subsequent employment requirements would address concerns regarding the
sustainability of investments in graduate scholarships. The technical assistance would be provided
with the goal of transferring expertise and technological resources to Indonesia. The physical
investments would provide supplies and equipment necessary for the efficient long-term curation and
scientific management of the national biological collections. These physical improvements would also
provide improved working conditions, which are essential to staff motivation.
Past Experience and Lessons Learned
22.        The Bank has not financed a similar project in Indonesia or elsewhere. Generic
implementation issues for the Bank projects in Indonesia have included: (a) inter-agency coordination;
(b) timely allocation of government counterpart budget; and (c) timely appointment of consultants and



- 8 -
their effective interaction with government staff. These issues would be addressed through the use of
appropriate coordination mechanisms (including a detailed implementation plan and specific reporting
relationships), the allocation of budget funds to a specially established project account, the agreement
to consultant appointments as conditions of disbursements, and the provision of financial incentives for
counterpart project staff. Project design also reflects the lessons learned from agricultural research
projects; these lessons center on strategic and financial management.
Environmental Aspects
23.        Hazardous Chemicals. The project would contribute to national conservation efforts and
would improve information needed for environmental assessment nationwide. The main anticipated
negative environmental issue associated with the project is exposure of staff and visitors to the residual
hazardous chemicals used to preserve biological specimens prior to project inception. As of January,
1994, PPPB ceased applying mercuric and arsenic compounds and paradichlorbenzene. During the
first year of the project, health and safety consultants would review environmental health and safety
issues. During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that PPPB would prepare, in consultation
with the environmental health and safety advisors, an environmental health and safety action plan, by
April 30, 1995. The recommendations of this plan and associated training would precipitate changes
in collections management procedures that would be implemented under the project to minimize
exposure to residual harmful chemicals.
24.        Rare and Endangered Species. During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances that
the collection of specimens from the wild under the project (under the field work training and
guidebook production program) would be carried out with full regard to the need to conserve rare and
endangered species. The overall project, including the collection activities, would *mprove the
information on the status of rare and endangered species in Indonesia.
Agreed Actions
25.        During negotiations, the Bank obtained assurances from the Government that:
(a)   The research grants program would operate in accordance with procedures and criteria
agreed with the Bank;
(b)   GOI would stabilize specimens as necessary before moving them to new cabinets or to
different buildings;
(c)  that the membership of the Project Management Committee, Steering Committee, and the
User Advisory Group would be determined in accordance with criteria agreed with the
Bank;
(d)   PPPB would: (i) in consultation with the User Advisory Group and the Steering
Committee, prepare the content of the project work plan and the format of the progress
reports, acceptable to the Bank, by March 31, 1995; (ii) subsequently submit the
progress reports, including an evaluation of consultant and staff performance, on a semi-
annual basis, by April 30 and October 31, beginning April 30, 1995; (iii) submit to the
Bank a review of the work plan, which would include staffing, management procedures
and decisions, budget, technical assistance, training, client services, and other project
requirements, by September 30, 1995, and on an annual basis thereafter, and promptly
carry out the recommendations of this review, taking into account the comments of the



- 9 -
Bank, and (iv) submit to the Bank the budget proposals for the project work plan agreed
with the Bank, by December 31, 1995 and on an annual basis thereafter;
(e)   PPPB would prepare a mid-project review by December 31, 1997, which would
incorporate the strategy developed under the Financial Strategy Study, and incorporate
the report on collections data access policy, and promptly carry out the recommendations
of this review, taking into account the comments of the Bank;
(f)   The graduate scholarship programs and students would be selected in accordance with
criteria agreed with the Bank, and recipients of training would be employed for a
minimum of three years in positions at PPPB where they could make full use of their
training;
(g)   GOI would provide an adequate budget to rehouse the zoological collections in improved
facilities by March 31, 1998 should the anticipated Government of Japan support be
insufficient or not materialize;
(h)   PPPB would: (i) prepare, in consultation with the environmental health and safety
advisors, an environmental health and safety action plan by April 30, 1995; (ii) furnish
this plan to the Bank for comments; and, (iii) carry out this plan taking into account the
comments of the Bank;
(i)   The collection of specimens from the wild under the project would be carried out with
full regard to the need to conserve rare and endangered species and in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations;
26.        GOI has submitted to the Bank, as a condition of Regional Vice President (RVP)
approval, evidence that the consultants implementing the technical assistance and specialized training
contract, and the individuals to be contracted as the project management and financial management
specialists have been selected.
27.        During negotiations it was agreed that, as a condition of disbursement for equipment,
furniture, and materials, and for research grants, that GOI provide evidence that the technical
assistance and specialized training contract has been signed and that the project management and
financial management specialists have been hired.
Pro.ject Benefits
28.        Uses of Biodiversity Information. The project would enable PPPB to become a leader in
environmental data management and enable GOI, non-governmental organizations, and commnercial
users to access priority biodiversity information. This biodiversity information would provide a more
factual basis for decision-making in natural resource management, conservation, spatial planning, and
environmental assessment. It would also enable the identification of plants and animals with economic
potential. The label information associated with specimens in the collections include location, date of
collection, soil type, elevation, slope, proximity to water courses, associated species, and local uses.
Applications of this label information include:
(a)   Rapid assessments of the biological resources of specific locations, to be used in land-use
planning and ecosystem management;



- 10 -
(b)   Enviro nental monitoring to measure the impact over time of investments and other
human activities on ecosystems;
(c)   Identification and monitorinL of rare and endangered species, and analysis of geographic
distribution patterns for biodiversity conservation;
(d)   Identification of unknown species such as newly introduced agricultural pests;
(e)   Repository of local knowledge about plant and animal uses, which is rapidly
disappearing; and
(f)   Database searches for prospecting plants and animals for various uses including
therapeutic drugs, food, biological controls, reforestation (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi), and
geological species indicators (e.g., discovery of mineral deposits and hot springs).
29.         Institutional Benefits. To achieve these applications, the project would accomplish the
following:
(a)   Strategic and institutional transformation. The project would enable PPPB to become
one of the first examples in the world where the collection, organization, and
dissemination of biodiversity information would be driven by user need, integrated and
coordinated at a national level; and based on primary specimen-based data. The project
would also enable PPPB to take the first step in a long-term process to provide
biodiversity information adequate in scope and scale to the task of conservation and
sustainable development in a large, developing country with high biodiversity. The
project would make PPPB more effective and responsive, and would provide a model of
strategic and institutional transformation for similar organizations in both developing and
developed countries.
(b)   Improvements in the physical condition of specimens. The project investment in
collections and research would significantly improve the physical condition of the
collections. Under the project, PPPB would take definitive steps toward international
standards of physical curation. Unless immediate measures are taken to restore large
numbers of specimens that are deteriorating under tropical conditions, the Center's
extensive historical collections will shortly sustain irreparable damage, and large amounts
of valuable biodiversity information will be lost. In economic terms, it is four to twenty
times more cost-efficient to capture biodiversity information from the existing collections
than to collect new data from the field.
(c)   Database design and establishment. The database development would improve
collections management, enable collection plans and development, and facilitate external
use. The database would be state-of-the-art, and would provide a key part of the
scientific and institutional foundation required for a national biodiversity information
system. It would provide functional fields of information that meet internal and external
needs for the priority taxa that are in the project work program. The project would also
establish the basic database infrastructure required for the long-term process of entering
100 percent of the data from PPPB's existing collections.
(d)   Fostering of scientific collaboration and research. The project would help to foster
scientific collaboration and research, beyond that which would be provided under the



- 11 -
project itself. This increased scientific collaboration and research would supplement
financial and expert resources, and be an important source of new specimens, data, and
human resource development.
(e)   Development of user products and services. The project also includes support for a
variety of products and services for external clients. These tangible products and
services would be based on, and mostly limited to, priority taxa, and might include
preliminary species lists, measures of abundance and distribution, identification reference
tools and services, field guides, compilations of ethnobiological data, and biotic resource
prospecting services.
rqJect isks
30.         Risks and areas of uncertainty associated with the implementation of the project consist
of: (a) provision of sufficient management support; (b) recruitment, motivation, and training of
sufficient numbers of new and existing staff; (c) provision of technical expertise from a limited pool
worldwide; (d) building of institutional linkages, which would enable the fullest possible utilization of
the collections; and (e) sustainability after the project. The project would establish new positions key
to project management, make provision for competitive recruitment of new staff, and provide
incentives and training for all project staff. It would use a single contract arrangement for procuring
specialized technical expertise. The project includes specific measures to strengthen linkages with
users. It also includes measures that address financial and institutional requirements for long-term
sustainability.

BIODIVERSITY COLLECTIONS PROJECT
GRANT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Recipient:         Republic of Indonesia
Amount:            SDR 5.1 million (US$ 7.2 million)
Terms:             Grant
Project Description: The proposed five-year project, to be funded by the Global Environment Trust
Fund (GET), would strengthen the capacity of the Research and Development
Center for Biology (PPPB) to support the systematic biological collections
(reference collections of plant and animal specimens that are preserved in
chemicals or pressed and dried) and their associated data that are a basic
reference tool for biodiversity inventory and monitoring. The project would
also make information from the collections available to users in other sectors.
The project would inter alia support:
(a) General Project Management and Coordination. This component would
comprise the establishment of a steering committee, a project management
committee, a project implementation unit, technical advisors, an advisory group
representative of external clients, a research grants program for systematic
research, a financial strategy study and provision of language training and
project-related workshops.
(b) Systematic Collections and Research in Botany and Zoology. Systematic
collections and associated research in the Botany and Zoology Divisions would
be developed through:
(i) Human Resource Development: graduate-level scholarships in systematic
biology and overseas work-study programs, local management training
plus on-the-job training;
(ii) Collections Restoration and Development: building renovations, furniture,
supplies, and temporary employees to improve specimen storage and
organization and to restore deteriorating specimens (these activities would
include the integration of the marine reference collections belonging to the
Research and Development Center for Oceanology with PPPB's
terrestrial-based reference collections);
(iii) Research Facilities: building renovation and provision of scientific
literature and equipment; and
(iv) Publications and User Products: development of an illustrated technical
glossary, a computerized bibliography of written reference materials, a
computerized gazetteer, a da,abase and handbooks covering specific taxa,
national field guides, and a specimen identification service.



(c)  Information Systems Management. This component includes the design and
establishment of a computer database and a local area network capable of basic
specimen data entry, automated label production, collections management
functions, and information dissemination. This system would complement and
comprise a node of a wider network, which GOI plans to develop. Inputs
comprise technical assistance, an overseas work-study program, computer and
network equipment and installation, software development and support, and the
establishment of a new sub-division.
(d)  Scientific Collaboration and Services. Technical assistance and office
equipment would be provided to strengthen PPPB's capacity to manage
collaborative research, client services, and training programs.
Benefits:                The project would enable PPPB to become a leader in environmental data
management and enable. GOI, non-governmental organizations, and commercial
users to access priority biodiversity information. This biodiversity information
would provide a more factual basis for decision-making in natural resource
management, conservation, spatial planning, and environmental assessment. It
would also enable the identification of plants and animals with economic
potential. To accomplish this intent, the project would transform PPPB
through strategic planning and institutional development into an effective and
responsive organization, improve the physical condition of specimens, design
and establish a state-of-the-art database system, foster scientific collaboration,
and provide client products and services.
Risks:                   Risks and areas of uncertainty associated with the implementation of the project
consist of: (a) provision of sufficient management support; (b) recruitment,
motivation, and training of new and existing staff; (c) provision of technical
expertise from a limited pool worldwide; (d) building of institutional linkages,
which would enable the fullest possible utilization of the collections; and (e)
sustainability after the project. The project would establish new positions key
to project management, make provision for competitive recruitment of new
staff, and provide incentives and training for all staff. It would use a single
contract arrangement for procuring specialized technical expertise. The project
includes specific measures to strengthen linkages with users. It also includes
measures that address financial and institutional requirements for long-term
sustainability.

NOTES:  Figures in parenthesis are the respective amounts financed by the Global Environtnent Trust Fund.
Numbers may not add due to rounding.
2.              Civil Works (USS 0.1 million).  These consist of building improvements to the
herbarium, including window screening, wall partitions, and the installation of air conditioning for
selected portions of the building. Because these small contracts would not attract foreign bidders,
these works would be procured following local competitive bidding procedures (LCB) acceptable to
the Bank.



- 2 -
3.         Equipment, Furniture and Materials (US$ 2.0 million). About US$ 0.6 million would
be for highly specialized scientific and curational equipment and supplies, which are only available
from a limited number of suppliers worldwide. These items would therefore be procured through
limited international bidding (LIB). An additional US$ 30,000 of the scientific and curational
equipment and curational equipment and supplies, for readily available off-the-shelf purchases in
amounts less than US$20,000, would be procured through local shopping. About US$ 0.3 million
would be for computer and office equipment, of which some 75 percent would be procured through
LCB because the small contract values and the need for local servicing would preclude international
competitive bidding (ICB). The remaining 25 percent of the computer and office equipment, for
readily available off-the shelf purchases in amounts less than US$ 20,000, would be procured through
local shopping. About US$ 1.0 million would be for custom-built metal cabinets and other curation
furniture. These cabinets are produced locally at prices below the international market and they
would therefore be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. The remaining
US$ 0.1 million would be for readily-available off-the-shelf, small value freezers, office furniture and
materials procured through local shopping. The aggregate total of all items in this procurement
category procured through local shopping would be limited to US$ 200,000.
4.         Technical Assistance, Studies and Training (US$ 4.5 million). All technical assistance
and studies would be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants
and engaged according to the Bank's Standard Conditions of Contract for Consultants. About
US$ 2.5 million would be for technical advisors, specialized training (including overseas work-study
programs, local management training programs, and on-the-job training), and the financing strategy
study procured through a single contract, which would facilitate provision of highly specialized
technical expertise, which is in scarce supply worldwide, and in some cases, unique. In order to
expedite the start of project activities after project approval, this contract should be signed as a
condition of disbursement of the equipment, materials, and furniture and the research grants.
Some US$ 1.6 million for overseas graduate scholarships and academic co-supervisors would be
procured through direct contracting with universities, and reimbursement for other related eligible
expenses. A locally contracted specialist would handle administrative arrangements for the graduate
scholarship program. The remaining US$ 0.4 million, mostly for local graduate scholarships,
language training, internships for local university faculty, and training in field inventory and
monitoring, would be supplied mainly by reimbursement of eligible expenses.
5.         Miscellaneous Contracts and Other Expenditures (US$ 1.8 million). About
US$ 0.8 million for publications and products (e.g., periodicals, computer software development,
bibliography and gazetteer compilation, and glossary, handbook, and guidebook production) would be
procured through either through consultant service contracts in accordance with Bank Guidelines
(about US$ 0.4 million) or through reimbursement of eligible expenses (about US$ 0.4 million) as
appropriate. Locally contracted specialists who would assist PPPB staff with administrative and
financial tasks, and temporary employees who would assist with curation, would be hired through
direct contracts totalling some US$ 0.5 million. In order to expedite the start of project activities
after project approval, the specialists in project management and in financial management would be
hired as a condition of disbursement of the equipment, materials, and furniture and the research
grants. About US$ 0.5 million for small research grants would be procured through direct contracts
in accordance with selection procedures outlined in the Preparation Report paragraph 4.10 and
Annex 3, Part C, pages 81-86.
6.         Allowances and Honoraria (US$ 0.4 million). These consist of reimbursements of
eligible allowances and honoraria.



- 3 -
7.         Review of Procurement. For LIB, GOI would use and conform to the Bank's Standard
Bidding Documents for the ICB of Goods for all aspects other than advertisement, prequalification
and preferences. GOI would also use and conform to the Standard Form of Contract for Consultants,
and the proposed Standard Bidding Documents for the LCB of Civil Works and Goods which would
facilitate the tender and contract preparation by the various agencies involved. Under LIB, domestic
preferences are not applicable in the evaluation of bids. All tender documents and contracts for goods
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$ 200,000 or more, all consultant and service contracts with
institutions estimated to cost US$ 100,000 or more, all consultant and service contracts with
individuals estimated to cost US$ 50,000 or more, and all studies would be subject to prior review by
the Bank. For consultancy contracts with institutions, the review would include terms of reference,
short list, letter of invitation, selection procedures and criteria, recommendation for award, and the
final contract. The prior review by the Bank would cover about 63 percent of total contract values,
and the contracted specialist who would handle the administration of the graduate scholarships would
provide external oversight for an additional 21 percent of the total contracted values. All contracts
and statements of expenditure not subject to prior review by the Bank would be subject to a post-
review by the Bank on a sample basis. This review would concentrate on the competitiveness of
prices paid and on physical inspections of the relevant items.
B. DISBURSEMENTS, ACCOUNTS, AND AUDITS
8.         Disbursements of the GET grant would be made as follows:
Table 2: Disbursement Categories

a! Excluding vehicles.
b/ Excluding regular staff salaries.



9.         Disbursement Arrangements for Research Grants. In order to facilitate 100% financing
by GOI of a large portion of the research grants program, unallocated funds would not be available to
the research grants category.
10.        Disbursement Documentation. Disbursements under the project would be made against
Statement of Expenditure (SOE) for contracts for works, goods, and equipment valued at less than
US$ 200,000, contracts for the employment of consulting firms costing less than US$ 100,000
equivalent per contract, and contracts for the employment of individual consultants costing less than
US$ 50,000, and research grants, non-contractual training, intern stipends, allowances, honoraria, and
other staff expenditures. Disbursement for all other expenditures would be on the basis of full
documentation. Contracts disbursed under SOEs would be based on bid documents approved by the
Bank. Supporting documentation for SOE expenditures would be retained by PPPB and be made
available for inspection by Bank supervision missions; it would not be submitted to the Bank.
11.        Disbursement Schedule. The proceeds of the grant are expected to be disbursed over six
years, which is shorter than the seven and a half year average disbursement period for projects in
Indonesia (Table 3). The Project Completion Date would be March 31, 2000 and the Project Closing
Date would be September 30, 2000.

I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.    Importance of Biodiversity in Indonesia
1.1        Indonesia is exceptionally rich in biodiversity. It contains about 110 million hectares, or
nearly ten percent of the world's closed tropical forests--more than any country in the world except
Brazil. It also has the most extensive area of coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean--more marine
coastline than any other tropical country (McNeely et al, 1990). Although the archipelago represents
only 1.3 percent of the earth's land area, it contains an estimated 25 percent of the world's fish
species, 17 percent of all bird species, 16 percent of reptile and amphibian species, 12 percent of
mammal species, 10 percent of plant species, and unknown numbers of species of invertebrate
animals, fungi and microorganisms (BAPPENAS, 1991). Of these, perhaps 30 percent of the flora
and 90 percent of the fauna are not yet fully described and scientifically documented.
1.2         Many sectors of the Indonesian economy are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the
diversity of natural ecosystems and the environmental functions they protect.
(a)   It is estimated that 40 million Indonesians are directly dependent upon biodiversity' for
subsistence, utilizing more than 6,000 species of plants and animals daily (BAPPENAS,
1991).
(b)   Approximately 23 percent of the Indonesian gross national product in 1990 was derived
from agriculture, livestock, forestry and fisheries (Biro Pusat Statistik, 1991). Of this,
agriculture and livestock contributed approximately US $18.7 billion, fisheries US $1.8
billion and forestry US $1.0 billion directly to the national income. It is also estimated
that the subsistence of up to 12 million people is to some extent derived from hunting
and extracting non-timber natural forest products, valued at more than US $1.25 billion
per year, and many more are dependent on coastal resources (KLH, 1992; BAPPENAS,
199 1).
(c)   The export of forest products provided Indonesia with about US $1.7 billion in foreign
exchange in 1987, second only in importance to oil (World Bank, 1993). Moreover,
much of the US $1.8 billion contributed to the national economy in 1990 by the tourism
sector may be attributed to visitors' appreciation of the species richness and
environmental integrity of the country (BAPPENAS, 1991; KLH, 1992).
(d)   Though difficult to quantify, the value to the Indonesian economy of natural ecosystems
in protecting water catchment areas, minimizing soil erosion, and stabilizing climatic
change, may be implied from the environmental cost of present deforestation, which is
counted in tens of billions of dollars per year (KLH, 1992).
1.3        Indonesia's strategy for long-term economic development is founded on the principle of
conserving natural resources, including the sustainable management of commercial forests and
fisheries, the maintenance of ecosystem functions such as hydrological and nutrient cycling, and the
In this context biodiversity is "the variety and variability among living organisms and the
ecological complexes in which they live.. .Thus, the term encompasses different ecosystems,
species, genes and their relative abundance" (US Congress, Office of Technology Assessment,
1987).



protection of rare and endangered species and their habitats (Repelita V; GOI, 1990; BAPPENAS,
1991; KLH, 1992). Further, under the terms of the Biodiversity Convention (UNEP, 1992),
Indonesia has an international and legal commitment to both inventory and monitor its biodiversity.
B.   Contribution of Systematic Collections
The Importance of Inventory and Monitoring in Biodiversity Conservation
1.4         Accurate biodiversity information is essential for sound environmental decision-making,
policy and planning. It is required in the development of national biodiversity conservation strategies
and action plans; priority setting for the conservation of species and/or habitats; and the preparation
of enviromnental impact assessments in the context of planning large-scale development projects.
Therefore, there is a growing international consensus that strengthening national capacities to carry
out biological inventory and monitoring should be an integral component of the global biodiversity
conservation strategy (United Nations, 1992; UNEP, 1992). Inventory may be regarded as biological
stocktaking, while monitoring measures changes in stock over time. Both supply a basic knowledge
of species diversity, distribution, and abundance that are in turn necessary to support:
(a)   Sustainable Economic Development
Access to biodiversity information creates informed options for natural resource
managers. Since the maintenance of healthy ecosystem function in any given habitat
depends on complex interactions between unique combinations of species and their
environment, to ensure the long-term stability and productivity of natural ecosystems
estimates of sustainable yield for economically valuable species harvested from the wild
must be based on a thorough knowledge of the ecology of the system, and this in turn
requires a basic knowledge of the species present.
(b)   Applied Research
Because the scientific name of an organism provides the key to access any associated
knowledge in the scientific literature, workers in forestry, agriculture, fisheries,
veterinary science, medicine, and the social sciences need a reliable means to identify
the economic species, pests, predators, parasites and disease vectors with which they are
concerned. Current interest in 'Biodiversity Prospecting', particularly the search for
new pharmaceutical products and pesticides, and the selection of economically useful
genetic traits from populations of wild progenitors, assumes a detailed knowledge of the
identity, distribution, and variation of wild species.
(c)   In situ Conservation
Effective conservation measures require an ability to identify species of plants and
animals with very restricted geographical and ecological ranges that are potentially 'at
risk' of serious genetic erosion and possible extinction, and to prepare long-term in situ
management plans to ensure the survival of critical populations.
(d)   Ex situ Conservation
When in situ conservation measures are insufficient to ensure the viability of wild
populations, occasionally it will be necessary to maintain genetic resources in germplasm



- 3 -
gardens, seed banks, genome banks, or captive breeding programs. To conserve
genetically representative samples of the target species, it is essential to have a
knowledge of the variation present both within and among all the remaining populations.
(e)   Biodiversity Monitoring
The ability to detect short-term changes in ecosystem diversity and function over time
provides an early warning system of potentially detrimental and irreversible effects of
human activity on the maintenance of biodiversity. Carrying out an inventory to obtain
quantitative baseline data on the distribution and abundance of keystone species is an
essential prerequisite of all monitoring programs.
(f)   Spatial Planning
Spatial planning to minimize environmental impact due to civil works requires a
knowledge of the spatial distribution of species and their habitats, and the ability to rank
their relative value in terms of biodiversity conservation.
(g)   Natural Resource Valuation
To estimate the economic value of specific natural resources, it is necessary to quantify
the distribution and density of the target commodity species present. These may include
commercial species such as meranti and rotan, as well as species important to the local
subsistence economy such as medicinal herbs and wild animals hunted for their meat.
Numbers measure only a part of the natural resource values; to estimate the value of
healthy ecosystems requires a knowledge of the complex interactions between species
and their environment as explained in (a) above.
The Importance of Systematic Biology in Biodiversity Inventory and Monitoring
1.5         Systematic biology provides the basic tools to inventory and catalogue the natural world,
the means to access existing biological information, and a way to organize and disseminate new
information critical to the conservation of Indonesian biodiversity.
Future Development of Indonesian Systematic Resources
1.6         Progress in inventorying Indonesia's wealth of biodiversity will depend on developing
adequate national resources for systematic biology, which in turn can be separated into six critical
elements:
(a)   Human Resource Development
To achieve technical and scientific self-sufficiency in the provision of biodiversity
information for managing its own natural resources, Indonesia will need a critical mass
of trained collectors, data managers, curators and researchers.
(b)   Upgrading Collections and Research Facilities
To ensure efficient, high-quality scientific output, Indonesia will require improved
facilities for the storage and scientific curation of the collections and for taxonomic
research.



-4 -
(c)   Collections Development
Most information on biodiversity, especially in tropical countries, is originally derived
from--or at least closely dependent upon--the scientific study of preserved specimens.
Specimens also provide verifiable biological reference points that, together with the
scientific literature, form the basis of a stable and universal system for naming all plants,
animals and microorganisms. Biodiversity information is also essential for identifying
gaps in the collections. Collections development is therefore an essential part of
biodiversity information management.
(d)   Systematic Research
The identification and description of the Indonesian biota using information derived from
the collections, and the organization of this information into scientific classifications, is a
core task. Without adequate systematic research, and the production of basic biological
reference tools such as checklists and identification keys, the biodiversity information
contained in the collections will remain largely inaccessible.
(e)   Information Systems and Management
Increased knowledge about biodiversity will lead toward the goal of conservation and
sustainable development only when the information is readily available to decision-
makers, conservation managers and applied biologists. An effective means will be
required to capture information contained in biological collections and the basic scientific
literature; to synthesize this into a format that can be integrated with information relating
to topography, land use, climate and soils; and to feed it back through a system
accessible to agencies concerned with biodiversity issues within government and the
public domain.
(f)   International Scientific Cooperation
The rate of growth of Indonesian resources for systematic biology, in the initial stages,
will depend on the amount of support received from specialists in other countries. In the
longer term, international expertise will continue to complement Indonesian expertise in
fields where specialist knowledge resides in only one or two individuals throughout the
world. Indonesian biologists may, in turn, support biodiversity efforts in other
countries. It is therefore essential that Indonesia develop and maintain active links to the
informal international network of systematic resources, and to the growing worldwide
electronic knowledge base of taxonomic and bibliographic information.
Experience in Other Countries
1.7         Worldwide, there are few examples where the collection, organization, and
dissemination of biodiversity information is:
(a)   driven by user need;
(b)   integrated and coordinated at a national level;
(c)   based on primary, site-based or specimen-based data; and



- 5 -
(d)   adequate in scope and scale to the task of conservation and sustainable development in a
large developing country which encompasses great biodiversity.
1.8        The model that is presently receiving most international attention and recognition (Yoon,
1993) is the Environmental Resources Information Network (ERIN), set up in 1989 by the
Commonwealth Government of Australia. Using readily available hardware and software platforms,
ERIN's mission is to provide geographically-related environmental information of an extent, quality,
and availability required for planning and decision-making. Specimen-based information derived
directly from collections at national and state herbaria and museums is being integrated, using
Geographic Information Systems (GIS), with map data, satellite imagery, and topographic, geological,
meteorological and land-use data. ERIN serves users ranging from government ministers, the
Australian Environmental Protection Authority, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, and state
government agencies, to the Australian National Botanic Gardens, universities, and government
research agencies.
1.9        Possible examples from developing countries include the National Biodiversity Institute
(INBio) of Costa Rica, and the Mexican National Commission of Biodiversity (CONABIO) which are
currently developing and implementing biodiversity information management systems similar to that
of the Australian model. However, in common with Indonesia, Costa Rica and Mexico face the
additional challenge of developing collections, human resources, and technical facilities adequate to
the task of conserving relatively poorly-known tropical biotas.
II. CURRENT STATUS OF SYSTEMATIC COLLECTIONS IN INDONESIA
A.   Urgency
2.1        The systematic collections of the national herbarium and the national zoological museum
provide the core scientific information and basic reference material for biodiversity inventory and
monitoring in Indonesia. However, after several decades of financial constraint when investment in
systematic biology received low priority in Indonesia, the institutional capacity of the Center for
Research and Development in Biology (PPPB) to respond to an expected growth in demand for
biodiversity information presently is severely limited. And, unless urgent measures are taken to
restore large numbers of scientific specimens that are deteriorating under ambient tropical conditions,
the extensive historical collections of the Herbarium Bogoriense and Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense
will shortly sustain irreparable damage, and large amounts of valuable biodiversity information will be
lost (see Annex 2).
B.   Overview of Present Resources
The Indonesian Institute of Sciences
2.2        Although at least eight agencies within the Government of Indonesia play a role in
managing the environment (see Annex l)--and hence have a need for biodiversity information--the
Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) has principal responsibility for carrying out basic biological
research. This it discharges through four Centers for Research and Development in Biology,
Oceanology, Limnology, and Biotechnology (Puslitbang Biologi, Oseanologi, Limnologi and
Bioteknologi), respectively, and through the Botanic Gardens of Indonesia (most notably the Kebun
Raya, Bogor).



- 6 -
2.3        Within this framework, the focus for systematic biology is concentrated in two
institutions, the Centers for Research and Development in Biology and Oceanology. Both maintain
collections, undertake taxonomic research and provide an advisory service to government agencies,
applied researchers and the public, in addition to undertaking a wide range of other activities.
2.4        At the Research and Development Center for Biology, the emphasis is mainly on
terrestrial and freshwater organisms; at the Research and Development Center for Oceanology
concentrates, through the Marine Biology Division, the emphasis is on the fauna of coastal waters and
the open sea--primarily crustaceans and fish. These distinctions are not absolute as many taxonomic
groups cross environmental boundaries and, for largely historic reasons, there is a significant
collection of marine organisms in the Center for Research and Development in Biology.
The Research and Development Center for Biology
2.5        The Research and Development Center for Biology (PPPB) consists, in turn, of three
research divisions and two administrative divisions (see Figure 4). The Division of Botany is
responsible for research activities concerning plants and fungi at the Herbarium Bogoriense and the
Treub Laboratory, including the maintenance and scientific curation of the botanical collections. The
Division of Zoology is responsible for research activities at the Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense
concerning multicellular animals, including the maintenance and scientific curation of the zoological
collections. The Division of Microbiology has primary responsibilities for research on
microorganisms, involving at present only a limited collection bacterial and fungal cultures. (See
Annex 2).
2.6        Within the Division of Botany there are six research programs--biosystematics, ecology,
ethnobotany, phytochemistry, morphogenetics, and physiology--each with a research coordinator.
The botanical collections contain between one and two million specimens of Indonesian plants,
representing a national collection two to three times larger than that of any comparable institution in
Southeast Asia. Responsibility for the management of the collections at the Herbarium Bogoriense is
presently shared by the chief technician and the staff of the taxonomy section.
2.7        Within the Division of Zoology, the collection of nearly 500,000 specimens at the
Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense is organized under laboratories representing the main taxonomic
groups--entomology, aracology, malacology, carcinology, mammalogy, ornithology, herpetology and
ichthyology. Research is organized under three programs--biosystematics, ecology, and physiology.
Each laboratory has a curator who is responsible for the maintenance of the collections, and each
research program has a coordinator who oversees the research activities.
2.8        The Division of Microbiology presently consists of four sections: agricultural,
environmental, industrial and basic microbiology. Of these, the basic microbiology section has
responsibility for the maintenance and development of collections. Existing collections of bacteria
and fungi number about a thousand, of which perhaps ten percent have been identified to species.
They are maintained in culture tubes, rather than lyophilized.
C.   Current Constraints
Human Resources
2.9        Given the huge scale of the task of inventorying and monitoring biodiversity in a country
as large and diverse as Indonesia, the greatest current constraint is an acute shortage of experienced



- 7 -
Indonesian collectors, collection managers, systematic researchers, and biodiversity information
managers.
Collections Maintenance
2.10        The national herbarium and zoological museum house large historical collections, some
dating from the nineteenth century, representing many unique and irreplaceable scientific reference
specimens, or "type specimens". In economic terms, it has been estimated that it would be four to
twenty times more cost-efficient to capture biodiversity information from the existing collections than
to collect new data from the field. However, a significant proportion of the collections have been
preserved using non-archival quality materials and stored for years under sub-optimal conditions.
These are deteriorating rapidly to the point where many are in imminent danger of sustaining
irreparable damage or total loss; indeed some specimens may already be beyond repair.
Collections Development
2.11        The sampling density of Indonesian biodiversity (that is the average number of scientific
specimens collected per unit area) is amongst the lowest for any region in the world (Campbell &
Hammond, 1989); the geographic and taxonomic coverage tends to be patchy and the quality and
quantity of the information inadequate for current purposes. The resulting gaps can be detected when
the database is in place. Thereafter, new collections, which are also necessary, can be made.
2.12        As with most of the world's highly diverse tropical ecosystems, most organisms
indigenous to Indonesia are not represented in scientific collections, and consequently they have yet to
be catalogued, described and named. At many Indonesian localities that on empirical evidence might
be expected to contain novel endemic species--including the majority of the national parks--even the
relatively well-known groups such as flowering plants, birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians have
yet to be systematically inventoried and new species described.
Collections Facilities
2.13        Although the botanical collections are housed in a relatively modern building, the
majority of the dried specimens are contained in old, rusting metal boxes--many of which lack fitting
lids. There are no facilities for climate control and all the specimens are subject to ambient tropical
temperature and humidity. Insect pests can gain free access to the collections through unscreened,
open windows, and as a consequence many newly collected specimens have been destroyed by beetle
larvae before even being mounted and inserted in the herbarium.
2.14        The zoological collections are housed in a series of inadequate buildings about a quarter
of a mile apart. Recently, part of the collections sustained permanent damage when the basement of
the building in which it was stored became flooded with water. A large part of the wet (alcohol
preserved) collections is stored in makeshift containers without airtight lids, and there are presently
insufficient drawers and storage trays to curate the insect collection scientifically.
2.15        While an attempt is being made to maintain--under sub-optimal conditions--a minimal
collection of fungal and bacterial cultures at the Microbiology Division of PPPB, the modern
systematic research facilities that would permit Indonesia to develop a national microbial reference
collection are presently lacking here.



-8 -
Research Facilities
2.16        Facilities for systematic research at PPPB are presently less than adequate. The
laboratory space used by the scientific staff is mostly cramped, unventilated, poorly lit, and lacking in
basic equipment. The availability of recent scientific literature and essential basic reference materials
for systematic research in Bogor (and in many cases nationally) is severely limited.
Information Systems and Management
2.17        Existing information on the fauna and flora of Indonesia is widely scattered in the form
of biological collections, unpublished reports and obscure scientific literature. Furthermore, there is
no electronic database for specimen label data from the botanical and zoological collections. If
transferred to an electronic format, this specimen label data could be more readily accessed, verified,
updated, combined with other information, and disseminated.
2.18        Indonesian institutions responsible for the collection and management of environmental
data are presently operating in a computing environment consisting mainly of scattered, stand-alone
PCs or isolated local area networks. There has been no attempt to introduce data transfer standards
nor do most institutions have access to wide-area network server systems, such as the INTERNET or
TELNET, that would facilitate the development of a distributed network approach to environmental
information management, favored by most system developers and endorsed by LIPI planners.
Management Structure
2.19        In the past, the responsibilities of technical staff have been vaguely defined and
uncoordinated, especially with respect to carrying out basic curatorial functions, resulting in some
large backlogs of unaccessioned specimens. Similarly, the efforts of the research staff have been
largely undirected, resulting in an arbitrary and unstructured research program determined more by
the interests and initiative of individual staff members than by the need for specific information about
high-priority groups of organisms.
Institutional Linkages
2.20        The identification of many groups of plants, animals and microorganisms requires
specialized expertise, reference collections, literature and equipment that is generally not available at
Indonesian universities and government institutions carrying out applied research. However, the
institutional linkages between the applied sector and the national herbarium, zoology museum and
microbiology facilities in Bogor historically have been very limited. This has resulted in a situation
where Indonesian researchers working, for example, in the field of agricultural entomology have in
the past been more likely to send an unknown insect to the Natural History Museum in London for
identification than to request assistance from their own national zoological museum. As a
consequence, it is unlikely that the information relating to such specimens will ever become available
to other users in Indonesia, and the cost and effort of seeking expert technical assistance is largely
dissipated.

III. THE LONG-TERM STRATEGY
A.   Mission
3.1        The mission of PPPB as it relates to biodiversity is to maintain and develop the national
systematic research collections and associated specimen-based information, to carry out collections-
based research, and to make this information base available to a wide range of users. This mission is
exclusive to PPPB, and is not a function of any other Indonesian organization.
3.2        Collections-based research subjects integral to this mission include systematic biology,
ethnobiology and study of other biota with economic potential, conservation biology, and ecology.
3.3        In addition to its own institutional research mission, PPPB has a national coordinating
role relating to all biodiversity-related scientific research carried out in collaboration with foreign
institutions or researchers.
3.4        PPPB's collections-based activities also include public exhibits and conservation
promotion.
B.   Priority Needs
Integrated National Biodiversity Information System
3.5        In 1991, LIPI together with the National Planning Board and the (then) Ministry of
Population and Environment recognized the need for an integrated national biodiversity information
system. The functionality of the system envisaged would in turn depend on maintaining a synergistic
effect between its core components (see Figure 1):
(a)  Inventory and monitoring;
(b)   Collections management;
(c)   Systematic research;
(d)   Information systems and management:
(e)  Integration of information from the various collections; and
(f)   Output and products.
Life Sciences Center/Complex
3.6        LIPI is in the process of developing plans for a Life Science Center/Complex in
Cibinong. It is anticipated that the Center/Complex will eventually house the present Research and
Development Centers for Biology (including both the national botanical and zoological collections),
Limnology, Oceanology and Biotechnology, together with the central facility of the National
Biodiversity Information Network (NBIN). In this regard, the Research and Development Center for
Biotechnology has already been transferred to new facilities in Cibinong, and it is plarmed to move
the Center for Research and Development for Limnology within the next twelve months. Plans to
move the zoological collections of the Research and Development Centers for Biology and



- 10 -
Oceanology in 1996, and to build a facility for the proposed NBIN, are presently under preparation
by GOT with assistance from the Government of Japan (GOJ).
Regional Institutional Development and Information Networks
3.7        It is recognized that the proposed GEF project is only the first stage in a continuing
process of strengthening Indonesian institutional resources for biodiversity inventory and monitoring.
Initially, (i.e., within the next five years), the focus would be on developing the core resources for
systematic botany and zoology at LIPI. A detailed review of present resources for systematic
microbiology in Indonesia would be carried out, and a strategic plan produced for the development
the Microbiology Division of PPPB. Future developments would include an increase in collecting
activities to fill geographic and taxonomic gaps in collecting.
3.8         Future development (i.e., within the next five to ten years) should lead to the
establishment of new regional centers for inventory and research, and to the growth of existing
reference collections and expertise at provincial universities. The regional centers will provide
services to local government, schools and industry, while at the same time maintaining close links
with the national center (PPPB) through the development of a wide-area electronic information
network.
Human Resource Development
3.9         To ensure rapid progress in the inventory and documentation of the biota of Indonesia
within a timeframe acceptable to biodiversity information users, it will be necessary to simultaneously
maintain or increase, nationally, regionally and worldwide, the number of trained systematic
researchers working on the fauna and flora of the Malesian region.
3.10        The recruitment and training of new systematic research staff has been identified as one
of the highest priorities of PPPB. Recent estimates by the management of PPPB indicate that over the
next 5-10 years the number of trained systematic biologists working in Indonesia needs to be
increased as follows:
Present No.       Number Required
PPPB        Nationally
Systematic botanists                 3            10              50
Systematic zoologists                5            45             150
Systematic microbiologists           0             10            120
Of equal importance to long-term human resource development will be the recruitment and training of
corresponding numbers of field collectors, curatorial staff with skills to sort and identify collections,
and data managers and data entry staff.
Inventory
3.11        Priorities for the collection of new biodiversity information will need to be decided on
the basis of three main criteria:
(a)  the need for site-based inventory, for:
*    assessing conservation status,



- 11 -
*     environmental impact assessment,
*     establishing, supporting and assessing conservation management practices, and
*    monitoring change;
(b)   the need for taxon-based inventory to provide an information service to, for example,
foresters, agriculturists, pharmacognosists and medical entomologists; and
(c)   the need to identify populations of rare and endangered species, and threatened habitats
that are poorly represented under the existing national conservation system.
3.12        Each of these requirements will demand a different biodiversity sampling strategy. In
the first case (a), geographically intensive sampling of all habitats in the target area would be carried
out with the goal of obtaining a species list of the systematic groups of conservation, and ecological
or economic importance. In the second and third cases, in order to establish the spatial distribution
patterns of a target species or systematic group, a wider geographical survey would be necessary
based, for example, on a stratified list of habitats inferred from large-scale vegetation maps, satellite
remote-sensing images, and soil and climate data.
3.13       It should be understood that the accurate designation of rare and endangered species and
their habitats could only be derived, a posteriori, from the analysis of known distribution patterns.
Monitoring
3.14       It is important to be able to differentiate between long-term trends, natural cyclical
variation in abundance, and statistical sampling errors. Monitoring biodiversity therefore requires a
consistent and replicable methodology that can accommodate both spatial and temporal change.
Essential to this process is sound baseline inventory of a carefully selected array of systematic groups.
To assess environmental impact at the local level, it may be necessary to initiate a program of regular
sampling on a site-by-site basis. However, to monitor large-scale environmental changes over time
effectively, it will probably be necessary to integrate biodiversity information systems with the global
change information systems, presently under separate development.
Information Systems and Management
3.15        To close the circle of biodiversity information transfer among systematic researchers,
policy makers, environmental managers and researchers in applied fields, it will be necessary to
develop a national electronic information network. The output from this information system, based
on the best available data, should be made readily and rapidly available to the users. Through the
introduction of electronic networks and information system and management tools, this data could be
rapidly updated, validated and refined.
3.16        The medium in which the information is accessed should be user-friendly, and the
format readily understandable by non-specialists. Spatial information should be map-based and, as far
as possible, biodiversity data should be collected and maintained in a form capable of being readily
integrated with other environmental information such as topography, climate, soils, and land use.
Systematic Research
3.17        The fauna and flora of Indonesia cannot effectively be studied in isolation. Because the
natural range of species does not often conform to political boundaries, the creation of robust species



- 12 -
concepts and maintenance of a stable system of names requires the study of species over the whole of
their natural biogeographic range. In the Southeast Asia region, this process was begun in 1950 with
the initiation of the Flora Malesiana project, the scope of which includes Indonesia, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, Brunei, Singapore, and Malaysia, and, in 1988, with the complementary
Fauna Malesiana project, which covers the same geographic area.
3.18        For Indonesia to establish a strong leadership role in systematic research in the Malesian
region will not only require a commitment to institution building, training and technology transfer,
but Indonesian scientists will need to participate on equal terms in the world scientific community.
To meet this goal, workers in Indonesia will need to have access to global electronic information
networks such as the INTERNET, and be able to travel to conferences and collaborating institutions
overseas. Foreign language skills, including proficiency in technical writing, should also be an
essential part of Indonesian scientific training.
Output, Products and Services
3.19        The goal of developing a national integrated biodiversity information system in Indonesia
is to make high-quality data available to a wide range of users--whether they be schoolchildren,
tourists, researchers, or politicians--in a variety of user-friendly formats. These products could range
from simple illustrated identification guides and handbooks, to maps produced by geographic
information systems (GIS), and interactive computer 'expert systems'. At the core of the system
would be a series of (predominantly specimen-based) databases containing all the available
information on the spatial distribution and abundance of the Indonesian biota. Augmenting the
biodiversity databases would be other kinds of spatial (map-based) data on land use, vegetation,
topography, soils, and climate. It is the integration and interaction of these different types of data
that would enable both site-based and species-based enquiries to be answered in a meaningful manner,
facilitating the decision-making process.
3.20        To complement, support and maintain accurate and up-to-date databases of Indonesian
biodiversity, it will be necessary to produce a number of computerized aids including bibliographies,
checklists, gazetteers, and glossaries.
3.21        In addition, Indonesian foresters, agriculturalists, ecologists, and conservation managers
need tools to aid the field identification of species with particular economic or ecological value.
Traditionally this has entailed the use of written keys and, even though these will continue to have
enormous value, they are mostly intended for use by systematic specialists. However, with the
widespread introduction of personal computers (PCs), the development of multiple entry, interactive
'expert systems' containing images of important field-oriented characters used in identifying the
organism in question would make it possible for reliable identifications to be made by non-specialists.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Objectives
4.1         The proposed project would strengthen the institutional capacity of PPPB to support
systematic biological collections, a basic reference tool for biodiversity inventory and monitoring.
The project would also make information from the collections available to external clients. The
project would establish the foundation required for PPPB to meet the expanding needs for biodiversity



- 13 -
information over the long-term, and would provide high priority information during the project
pe.iod. The main objectives would be:
(a)   to provide support for overall project management and coordination, in order to foster
both effective project implementation and long-term institutional transformation;
(b)   to restore and develop the collections and associated functions of the Botany and
Zoology Divisions;
(c)   to design and establish a computerized database of specimen-based data for collections
management, collection plans and development, and external use; and
(d)   to strengthen the capacity to coordinate and foster collaborative biological research
activities and client services.
B.   Brief Proiect Description
4.2         The project would be implemented over five years and would include the following
components:
(a)   General Project Management and Coordination. This component would comprise the
establishment of a steering committee, a project management committee, a project
implementation unit (including locally contracted specialists in project and financial
management), a technical advisory group (of international advisors with institutional and
technical expertise), a user advisory group (representative of external clients), short-term
advisors and trainers (in envirornmental health and safety, document restoration, data
field design, and specialized systematic biologists), a grants program for systematic
research and genetic resource conservation2, and a financing strategy study.
(b)   Systematic Collections and Research in Botany and Zoology. This component would
support the development of systematic collections and associated research in the Botany
and Zoology Divisions through:
(i) Human Resource Development: Provision of about 18 graduate-level scholarships
in systematic biology and about 11 overseas work-study programs, plus advice
and extensive on-the-job training for managers, scientists, interns, and technicians
in curation, taxa identification, field collecting, and user product development;
(ii) Collections Restoration and Development: Provision of building renovations,
furniture, archival supplies, 40 temporary employees and redeployment of 20
permanent staff to work as curatorial assistants in order to improve and expand
specimen storage, to improve the scientific organization of the collections, to
restore deteriorating specimens, and to stabilize the specimens as necessary before
moving them to new cabinets or buildings3 (these activities would include the

integration of the marine reference collections belonging to the Research and
Development Center for Oceanology with PPPB's terrestrial-based reference
collections);
(iii) Research Facilities: Building renovation and provision of essential scientific
literature and equipment in order to improve systematic biology research facilities;
and
(iv)  Publications and Products: Development of an illustrated technical glossary, a
computerized bibliography of written reference materials, a computerized
gazetteer, a database and handbooks covering specific taxa, national field guides,
and a specimen identification service.
(c)   Information Systems Management. This component would set up a computer database
and a local area network capable of basic specimen data entry, automated label
production, collections management functions, and information dissemination. This
system would complement and comprise a node of a wider network, which GOI plans to
develop. This component would comprise inputs of technical assistance, an overseas
work-study program, computer and network equipment and installation, software
development and support, and the establishment of a new sub-division with redeployed
and newly recruited staff.
(d)   Scientific Collaboration and Services. This component would provide a small amount of
technical assistance and office equipment to strengthen PPPB's capacity to manage
collaborative research, client services, and training programs.

4.3         The project would support the establishment of a steering committee, including inter-
agency representation, a project management committee, consisting of the project manager, the
project coordinators, and PPPB division directors, a project implementation unit, workshops (in taxa
priorities, data field design, and mid-project review), a technical advisory group, a user advisory
group, short-term advisors and trainers (in environmental health and safety and archival restoration),
a grants program for systematic research and genetic resource conservation, and a financial strategy
study.
4.4         Proiect Implementation Unit. A full-time project manager would head the Project
Implementation Unit and be responsible for overall project management. He or she would be
supported by a Financial Manager and a few PPPB clerical staff. In addition, the Project Manager
would receive support from a Project Management Specialist (with expertise in project planning,
project monitoring, and other project management skills) and additional office administration staff,
locally hired on a long-term contractual basis. A Financial Management Specialist, also hired on a
local long-term contract, would provide technical advice and training to the Financial Manager. A
short-term Collections Data Access Specialist, would analyze the range of existing policies, both in
Indonesia and overseas, regarding accessing and sharing biodiversity information and assist PPPB in
drawing up a set of criteria and procedures for determining appropriate levels of biodiversity
information access by potential database users, which would be summarized in a report.

4.5        Workshops. The General Project Management and Coordination Component would also
provide support for two workshops during project inception (to set taxa priorities and data field
definitions), which would help to establish clear benchmarks for measuring project progress in the
development of the database, and a workshop for the mid-project review.
4.6         Technical Advisory Group. A Technical Advisory Group (TAG), consisting of a Team
Leader4, a Botany Institutions Advisor, and a Zoology Institutions Advisor, would provide periodic
technical advice and guidance on curation and specimen-based database development, and information
systems and management (see Annex 4). Specifically, the TAG would:
(a)   advise on the development of appropriate institutional policies and protocols for
collections and information systems and management to bring PPPB's collections up to
international standards of curation and documentation;
(b)   visit PPPB at regular intervals throughout the five-year project to discuss progress and
advise, as necessary, on actions to be taken by PPPB to met any unforeseen events as
they arise;
(c)  recommend to the Project Manager appropriate short-term taxonomic and information
technology specialists;
(d)   advise on appropriate priority taxa and specimen data-entry fields for the database; and
(e)   assist the Project Management Committee in setting realistic benchmarks by which to
measure the progress of the project.
The involvement of the TAG would be relatively more intensive during the initial years of the
project, and would phase down as the technical and institutional capacity of PPPB increased in the
later years of the project.
4.7        UJser Advisory Group. A User Advisory Group (UAG) would meet at least semi-
annually to provide the project management committee with user feedback during the course of the
project. The UAG would comprise members who reflect the range of users of PPPB collections-
based information from the government agencies (e.g., Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Forestry,
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Mines and Energy, Ministry of Environment, BAPEDAL), academic
institutions, commercial firms (e.g., pharmaceutical firms, manufacturers of traditional medicine
(Jamu), forestry concession companies, agricultural supply firms, mining companies, energy
companies, and environmental assessment consultants), and non-governmental organizations (see
Annex 3).
4.8        Health and Safety Improvement. At the beginning of the project, two environmental
health and safety specialists, one with local and the other with international expertise, would review
the widespread use in the Botany and Zoology Divisions of toxic or potentially hazardous chemicals
such as mercuric chloride, naphthalene, paradichlorbenzene, lead arsenate, fornalin and naphthalene,
and make recommendations for the implementation of measures to reduce to a minimum the future
exposure of staff and visitors. The local specialist would also conduct training in the recommended
collections management procedures. PPPB ceased the application of mercuric and arsenic compounds

and paradichlorbenzene to collections in January 1994. PPPB has agreed to prepare, in consultation
with the environmental health and safety advisors, an environmental health and safety action plan by
April 30, 1995 (see Annex 4).
4.9         Document Archival and Restoration Methods. In the second year of the project, the
services of a specialist in contemporary archival and restoration methods would be contracted to
advise the Project Manager on improved methods of preserving books, photographs, illustrations,
specimens labels, and mounting media.
4.10        Research Grants Program. Competitive research proposals in the field of collections-
based systematic research and genetic diversity conservation would be invited from PPPB staff, with a
funding limit of Rp. 40 million (in 1994 equivalent) per proposal. These would be subject to
independent peer review, and awards totalling about US $490,000 (including contingencies) over the
five-year project period would be made by the Steering Committee on the recommendations of the
Project Manager (see Annex 3 Part C).
4.11        Financial Strategy Study. The project would support a financial strategy study. This
study would be carried out in the third year of the project to analyze potential funding sources and
funding mechanisms available to PPPB. Post-project budget projections would be drawn up based on
the need to maintain and develop the systematic research collections, and carry out associated research
and information and systems management activities. Recommendations would be provided to assist
PPPB in developing a strategy for achieving long-term financial sustainability. Although the project
budget does not include funding for other strategic planning and policy studies, it may be possible to
add one or more such studies during the mid-project review.
Botany Collections and Research Component
4.12        Within the Botany Division of PPPB, the proposed project would support human
resource development; collections renovation, maintenance and development; research facilities
upgrading; and the development of various publications and support products. The project would
involve only those sections of the Botany Division which focus on collections and associated
systematic research. A Botany Coordinator, appointed from existing PPPB staff, would manage the
project activities within the Botany Division (see Annex 3).
4.13        Human Resource Development. This support would consist of graduate-level
scholarships in systematic botany, overseas work-study programs, and local management training
programs; on-the-job training in taxa identification, curation, field collecting, and user product
development; and an internship program for staff from provincial universities.
4.14        PPPB would tailor the external training programs to the institutional and technical
requirements of the project, and to the needs of specific staff. For the graduate-level scholarship
program, PPPB would recruit approximately nine candidates for two-year overseas M.Sc.-level
training courses (or equivalent5) in systematic botany from a national pool of graduate botanists,
Most of these have been costed on the basis of nominal two-year overseas graduate scholarships,
plus, for three of the candidates, an additional two-year local Ph.D. program with an academic co-
supervisor. Project Management would have discretion to allocate available funds to provide some
M.Sc. scholarships at Indonesian universities, or one or more overseas Ph.D. scholarships, as
appropriate to the need of the best candidates. Further, M.Sc.-level students would be selected
for aptitude and motivation, on the assumption that a high proportion of these later would have an
opportunity to complete Ph.D. degrees.



- 17 -
including those already employed at PPPB (see Annex 3 Part D). Priorities areas for training would
include specialization in groups of plants of high conservation and economic importance such as the
grasses (including bamboo), palms (including ratans), timber trees (including gyrnnosperms, legumes,
dipterocarps, Ebenaceae, Meliaceae and Lauraceae), and fruit trees (including Moraceae,
Euphorbiaceae and Rubiaceae). Three- to six-month overseas work-study programs would be
provided in collections management and curatorial methods for the Botany Coordinator and two
Collections Managers, all of whom would be recruited internally. Depending on the experience and
needs of the Coordinator and the Collections Managers, local management training might be partially
or fully substituted for the work-study programs. Foreign language training would be supplied as
needed to the M.Sc. candidates, Coordinator, and Collections Managers.
4.15        PPPB staff and external experts would provide on-the-job training. From the second
year onward, the Coordinator and the Collections Managers would provide continuous in-house
training and supervision in herbarium methods to all project technical staff. During the second
through fifth years of the project, PPPB would invite up to eight international systematic specialists to
visit PPPB, for a total of 24 person-months. These international experts would provide specialized
mentoring in identification, collecting and preservation techniques of specialist plant groups. They
would also be expected to improve the level of scientific curation of the collections within their
specialist taxa group (see Annex 4). The project would cover the mentors' cost of travel, subsistence
and incidental expenses, indirect costs and, in some cases, honoraria. In each of years four and five,
an eight-week fieldwork training expedition for six junior staff members would be mounted, with the
emphasis on the collection and processing of high-quality specimens and field information. The
database fields would be used to guide collection of field data.
4.16        During the second through fifth year of the project, temporary internships6 in herbarium
management and curatorial methods would be made available to up eight graduate staff from local and
provincial universities. Interns would learn basic specimen preparation and collections management,
and would participate in on-the-job training programs in the collection, identification, and curation of
specialist taxonomic groups. The project would cover the cost of travel, subsistence and honoraria.
This internship program would begin to develop the human resources needed for future regional
biodiversity inventory and monitoring centers.
4.17        Collections Restoration. Maintenance, and Development. The project would support
building improvements, renovation, and expansion of specimen storage facilities, improvement in
scientific organization of collections, and restoration of deteriorating specimens.
4.18        Building improvements would be limited. During the first year of the project, the
windows of the herbarium would be screened to minimize the entry of harmful insects into the
building, and new specimen driers and specimen handling facilities would be installed in the
basement. A cooling engineer would be contracted to survey the feasibility of introducing climate
control (cooling and dehumidification) in the collections facilities. Should this be found to be
physically and economically feasible, air-conditioners would be installed. It should be noted that the
budget estimates are based on the cost of new stand-alone cabinets, but if air-conditioning should
prove to be feasible, it might be preferable to purchase compactor units in order to reduce to a
minimum the volume of air to be cooled.
4.19        Storage facilities would be renovated, expanded, and reorganized. The present storage
racks full of rusty metal boxes would be replaced by approximately 785 new metal cabinets, 750 of
6 Six to twelve months in duration.

which would be fitted with 21 pigeonholes for housing vascular plant specimens, and 35 of which
would have 55 pigeonholes for non-vascular plant (macro-fungi, mosses, liverworts, lichens and
larger algae) specimens. The contents of each pigeonhole would be placed in an archival quality,
sealable plastic bag and systematically frozen at -20C for three days to kill the adults, larvae and
eggs of all insect pests present in the collection. After rewarming to ambient temperature, the
bundles would be replaced--still in their bags--in the appropriate cabinets. The organization of the
specimens would be based on scientific principles.
4.20        Individual specimens would be restored. It is estimated that about 200,000 herbarium
specimens (about 20 percent of the dry collections) have become so brittle and friable that they
urgently require remounting on new archival quality, acid-free sheets. Although every effort would
be made to preserve the old specimen labels with the renovated specimen, in many cases new
specimen labels would also have to be produced to ensure legibility. Old, deteriorated species covers
would be replaced with new, clearly-labeled, protective archival genus covers. Additionally, around
8,000 deteriorating alcohol-preserved specimens of the morphologically complex flowers of the
orchid, ginger and Raffiesia families (including many irreplaceable "type" specimens) would be
transferred to new, airtight bottles with fresh preservative.
4.21        The Botany Coordinator and the two Botany Collections Managers would supervise the
restoration work. Twenty temporary herbarium assistants would be recruited and trained to carry out
this work. Temporary work areas would be set up on the second and third floors of the herbarium to
accommodate the additional staff carrying out the renovation of the collections.
4.22        Research Facilities. The project would support the cost of upgrading the present first
floor systematics research laboratory, including the installation of adequate work surfaces, storage
space, lighting, and an air-conditioning and ventilation system, and the purchase of research
microscopes and essential reference texts and systematic literature. Also during the first year, two
self-contained, well-ventilated and air-conditioned work areas' would be created on both the second
and third floors of the herbarium (four in all). These would be equipped with work surfaces,
binocular dissecting microscopes, networked computer workstations for data entry, and standard plant
identification texts. Supplemental support for travel, allowances, supplies, and specialized equipment
required for individual PPPB research activities would be provided through a competitive research
grants program for Systematic Research and Genetic Resource Conservation, which would be
administered under the general project management component.
4.23        Publications and Support Products. The project would support the production of an
illustrated technical glossary, a computerized bibliography of written reference materials, a field guide
to a nearby national park, a database and handbooks covering specific taxa, and an strengthened taxa
identification service (see Annex 5). More specifically, these products consist of:
(a)   a desk-top published Indonesian-language illustrated glossary of botanical technical
terms, cross-referenced in English and Dutch, which would facilitate access by PPPB
staff and other Indonesian researchers to the international systematic literature;
7 In September 1993, PPPB constructed the first of this series of workrooms on the second floor of
the Herbarium, in connection with a pilot inventory project funded by the U.S. National Science
Foundation and U.S. Agency for International Development. However, it is estimated that four
more such rooms will be required.



- 19 -
(b)   a computerized bibliography (with work partly undertaken in major libraries overseas) of
key systematic reference books, articles, and papers on Indonesian vascular plants which
would permit rapid searches to be made of the available literature;
(c)   a field guide to selected taxa at Gunung Halimun National Park;
(d)   a computerized identification aid and handbook to a selected group of species of
economic, ecological or conservation interest; and,
(e)   a taxa identification service which would meet specific accuracy and timeliness
standards.
Zoology Collections and Research Component
4.24       Within the Zoology Division of PPPB, the proposed project would support human
resource development; collections renovation, maintenance and development; research facilities
upgrading; and the development of various publications and support products. The project would
involve only those sections of the Zoology Division that focus on collections and associated systematic
research. A Zoology Coordinator, appointed from existing PPPB staff, would manage the project
activities within the Zoology Division (see Annex 3).
4.25       Human Resource Development. Similar to the Botany Division, this support would
consist of graduate-level scholarships in systematic zoology, overseas work-study programs, and local
management training programs; on-the-job training in taxa identification, curation, field collecting,
and user product development; and an internship program for staff from provincial universities.
4.26       As with botany, PPPB would tailor the external training programs to the institutional and
technical requirements of the project and to the needs of specific staff. For the graduate-level
scholarship program, PPPB would recruit approximately nine candidates for two-year overseas
M.Sc.-level training courses (or equivalent8) in systematic zoology from a national pool of graduate
biologists, including those already employed at PPPB (see Annex 3 Part D). Research topics would
focus on groups of organisms that are ecologically and economically important, and those that play a
role in environmental impact assessment and monitoring. Priority groups in Indonesia already
identified include freshwater and marine fishes, fish parasites (Isopoda and Copepoda), freshwater
prosobranch gastropods (Mollusca), decapods and gammerid amphipods (Crustacea), biting flies
(Diptera, including tabanids), insect herbivores and predators (including Coleoptera, Isoptera,
Hemiptera and Lepidoptera), and potential agents for biological control (including parasitic
Hymenoptera). As with botany, three- to six-month work-study programs would be provided for the
Zoology Coordinator and the seven Collections Managers, including the persons responsible for the
mammalogy, ornithology, herpetology, malacology, entomology, carcinology and ichthyology
collections. Depending on staff needs and experience, local management training might be partially
or fully substituted for the work-study programs. Foreign language training would be provided as
needed to the M.Sc. candidates, Zoology Coordinator, and the Collection Managers.
4.27       As with botany, PPPB staff and external experts would provide on-the-job training.
From the second year onward, the Coordinator and the Collections Managers would provide
continuous in-house training and supervision in museum methods to all project technical staff. During
the second through fifth years, PPPB would invite up to eight international systematic specialists to

visit Bogor, for a total of 24 person-months. These international experts would provide specialized
mentoring in identification, collecting and preservation techniques of specialist animal groups. They
would also be expected to improve the level of scientific curation of the collections within their
specialist taxa group. In each of years four and five, an eight-week fieldwork training expedition for
six junior staff members would be mounted, with the emphasis on the collection and processing of
high-quality specimens and field information.
4.28        As with botany, during the second through fifth year of the project temporary
internships' in zoological museum management and curatorial methods would be made available to
up to eight graduate staff from local and provincial universities. This internship program would begin
to develop the human resources needed for future regional biodiversity inventory and monitoring
centers.
4.29        Collections Renovation, Maintenance, and Development. The project would support
renovation and expansion of specimen storage facilities, improvement in the scientific organization of
the collections, and restoration of deteriorating specimens. It is currently anticipated that the
Government of Japan will fund a project to replace the buildings housing the PPPB zoological
collections with a new building in Cibinong, scheduled for completion by March/April 1996. The
GEF project schedule has been adjusted to accommodate the projected timing of the GOJ-funded
investments.
4.30        To improve the storage facilities, the project would provide major investment in new
cabinets, drawers, shelving, glass bottles, and curatorial materials. This investment would prevent
further physical deterioration of the collections, enable PPPB to physically sort and reorganize
specimens, permit the integration of the PPPO marine zoological collections, and allow for future
expansion. Further steps to improve environmental conditions and eliminate pests would also be
taken, although these aims would be partly achieved through the GOJ-funded provision of a new air-
conditioned building. Based on an assessment of the scientific value of the collections, six
high-priority areas have been selected for rehabilitation under the project, requiring the provision of:
(a)   metal cabinets and drawers for small mammals--shrews, mice, rats, squirrels and bats;
(b)   metal cabinets and drawers for birds;
(c)   glass bottles and tanks for wet specimens of reptiles, amphibia, fish and mollusks'";
(d)   metal shelving" for the wet collections, to provide space for reorganization and
expansion;
(e)   microscope slide cabinets for the parasitology slide collections; and
(f)   metal cabinets, drawers, and unit trays for the entomological collections, to provide
space for the reorganization of current collections and the curation of unincorporated
9 Six to twelve months in duration.
' Including the marine collections belonging to the Research and Development Center for
Oceanology.
It is proposed to renovate and utilize surplus metal shelving from the herbarium for this purpose.



- 21 -
materials. Microscope slide preparations of entomological material (e.g., dissections of
genitalia, essential for taxonomic research and critical identification) would be
transferred to custom-made cabinets and cross-referenced with the original dry, pinned
specimens in the collection.
The new metal cabinets would be of standard size throughout the collections, to facilitate the
repositioning of individual shelves. Similarly, the same size of drawers and unit trays would be used
throughout the entomology collections.
4.31        Dry individual zoological specimens need to be sorted and transferred to properly sized,
insect-proof cabinets--an extensive task in the case of the entomological collections. All the individual
wet zoological specimens need to be transferred to new, airtight bottles and fresh preservative before
being transferred to new cabinets.
4.32        The Zoology Coordinator and the seven Zoology Collections Managers would supervise
the collections renovation. Under the project, ten temporary museum assistants would be recruited to
assist with the rehabilitation of the entomological collections and four for the same process in other
areas of the Museum. On a long-term basis it is estimated that up to six additional trained technicians
or other staff will be required to maintain and develop the collections.
4.33        Research Facilities. The GEF project would provide dissecting and high-powered
microscopes, fibre-optic lamps, networked computer workstations, and equipment for a photographic
darkroom. Basic reference texts, including back copies of critical journals, would be procured.
Supplemental support for travel, allowances, supplies, and specialized equipment required for
individual PPPB research activities would be provided through a competitive research grants program
for Systematic Research and Genetic Resource Conservation, which would be administered under the
general project management component. It is anticipated that the provision of space for research
would be incorporated in the design of the proposed GOJ-funded zoology collections building in
Cibinong.
4.34        Supporting Activities. As with botany, the project would support the production of an
illustrated technical glossary, a computerized bibliography of written reference materials, a field guide
to a nearby national park, a database and handbooks covering specific taxa, and an strengthened taxa
identification service (see Annex 5). In the case of zoology, the glossary would include cross-
referenced terms in English, Dutch, French, and German, and would cover at least insects, fish, and
terrestrial vertebrates and mollusks. The bibliography of Indonesian Faunistic Research would be
able to be updated from on-line databases (see Annex 5).
Information Systems Management Component
4.35        Value for Collections Management. The project would provide the capability of PPPB
to capture in electronic format the basic biodiversity information contained in the collections (see
Annexes 3, 4, 5, and 6). As part of the rehabilitation and development of the biological collections,
computerized databases would be used routinely in managing the collections to produce (for example)
labels for specimens, and data on the location of biological material--both within the organization or
on loan to other institutions. Specifically, specimens sent to specialists for identification could be
efficiently tracked, and the best available names made available to other biodiversity information
users. In addition, a computerized database would provide new ways of checking and upgrading the
accuracy of specimen data. Further, the computerization of information would introduce both rigor



- 22 -
and flexibility into the organization of the collections by ensuring that all information would be
entered in a standard manner while providing access to large bodies of information.
4.36        Limited Coverage During Project but Sound Design for Long-term Needs. The five-
year project would only achieve coverage of limited taxa in the electronic database. However, it
would establish the foundation to enable full and functional entry, maintenance (including quality
control), and use of PPPB specimen data in a computerized system within the next twenty-five years.
During project inception, a workshop of PPPB staff, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), and taxa
specialists would determine priority taxa to be included in the database and would establish specific
project benchmarks, taking into account relative levels of accuracy, coverage, and costs and benefits.
Another workshop of PPPB staff, the TAG, and an expert in data field definition would determine
standardized fields of information which would meet long-term internal and external needs common to
all taxa categories. This workshop will also define field requirements for the specific taxa in the
project work program (see Annex 6).
4.37        Local Area Network and INTERNET Support. Under the project an institution-wide
local area network would be developed to provide a platform for databasing the information in the
collections and efficiently performing routine collections management tasks such as automated label
production. The institutional network would be capable of interfacing with national, regional and
global electronic networks such as the INTERNET. This facility, when complete, would give on-line
access to the rapidly growing international knowledgebase and bibliographic services regarding
biodiversity. Connection to the INTERNET would also allow--through e-mail and the electronic
transfer of data files--rapid and low-cost communications with scientific colleagues and institutions
worldwide. In the long term, incorporating data from collections in other institutions and from
literature would significantly raise the quality and quantity of biodiversity information available to
Indonesian users.
4.38       Compatibility with National Biodiversity Information Network. It is important to note
that the collections-based database system proposed under the GEF project would be designed to
interface with, and greatly complement, the development of the proposed Indonesian National
Biodiversity Information Network (NBIN). It may in fact comprise the first "node" of the proposed
NBIN-distributed network model, hence becoming the pilot for the whole system.
4.39        Technical Design. A short-term Collections Database Expert in experienced in
information technology would be recruited to perform a user-need analysis and advise on appropriate
software and hardware options (see Annex 4). The Collections Database Expert would also train the
Information Systems Coordinator on how to carry out this analysis, so that the Information Systems
Coordinator would be able to manage the process of updating and upgrading the systems in the
future. Specifically, the consultant would recommend a data management system that is capable of:
(a)   managing specimen-based records;
(b)   facilitating quality control of the data;
(c)   meeting all the foreseeable needs of PPPB for sorting and searching, and for exporting
records to other databases;
(d)   ensuring that the databases from the various collections are inter-compatible;
(e)   scaling-up to meet the database needs of PPPB for foreseeable future;



- 23 -
(f)  interfacing with community-standard geographical information system and image
processing software (such as ARC-INFO and ERDAS);
(g)  interfacing with local area and wide-area networks; and
(h)   being maintained through availability of adequate long-term internal and external
support, including upgrading and training.
4.40        Programming Support. In addition to the Collections Database Expert, it is estimated
that the development and support of an appropriate system would require a further two person-years
of programming effort, followed by eight months programming in the fourth year and four months in
the fifth year of the project. The Collections Database Expert would advise PPPB on appropriate
terms of reference for this programming support.
4.41        Gazetteer. To facilitate fast and accurate specimen data entry, the project would provide
support for the compilation of a computerized gazetteer of the names of Indonesian collecting
localities, with their geographical coordinates (see Annex 5).
4.42        Organizational Responsibility. Functionally, this component would involve the
establishment of a new subdivision in the Scientific Services and Information Division, since PPPB
does not currently have a subdivision capable of computerized database management. However,
internal reorganization will enable PPPB to create this subdivision without expanding the total number
of subdivisions within the affected division.
4.43        Staffing. An Information Systems Coordinator/Manager would head this new
subdivision and be responsible for the long-term development of database and network services.
Since PPPB does not currently have a staff member with appropriate qualifications, PPPB would
arrange the secondment or transfer from another government agency, or the recruitment of a suitable
candidate. Data Managers, one from the Botany and one from the Zoology Division, would be
appointed. The Information Systems Coordinator/Manager would participate in an overseas work-
study program (and prior foreign language training) as needed. The Information Systems
Coordinator/Manager would train the Data Managers to oversee data entry and day-to-day data
management (including quality control). A PPPB computer technician, who is currently responsible
for office computer maintenance, would be responsible for routine installation and maintenance of
computer hardware and software (see Annex 3).
4.44       Importance of Quality Control. As with any information system, the quality of the
biodiversity information output and products from PPPB will be determined largely by the quality of
data input. Since it is anticipated that the proposed GEF project would comprise an integral part of
the long-term development of future biodiversity information systems in Indonesia, it is therefore
essential that the project set the highest possible standards for the collection and management of
specimens and data. Establishing a policy, from the outset, of maintaining strict data quality control
should also prove more cost-effective than trying to validate, edit and refine the information in the
system at a later date.
4.45        Data Entry and Ouality Control. It is anticipated that a large part of the effort and cost
of developing a biodiversity information system would be invested in maintaining quality control over
the data entry process, including proofreading and editing. To facilitate this process, careful attention
would be given to:



- 24 -
(a)   designing appropriate data entry fields (para. 4.36);
(b)   producing taxonomic and geographical reference files of rigorously verified names
(paras. 4.15, 4.27, and 4.41); and
(c)   choosing a database design with built-in capability to flag "outlier" records in relation to
the known ecological and geographical range of the species.
During the project, two Database Managers would be designated and trained, with primary
responsibility for maintaining data quality in the botany and zoology databases.
4.46        Administrative Software Applications. The project would also provide five years of full-
time technical assistance from a Software Applications Specialist who would be responsible for
introducing, developing and maintaining a wide range of commercial database, spreadsheet and word
processing applications to increase the efficiency of managerial and administrative operations within
PPPB (see Annex 3).
Scientific Collaboration and Services Component
4.47        The project would strengthen the capacity of an existing subdivision within PPPB, the
Scientific Collaboration and Client Services Subdivision of the Scientific Services and Information
Division, to manage collaborative research, client services, and training programs. Under the project,
the subdivision head would serve as the Scientific Collaboration and Services Coordinator. The
Coordinator would be assisted by the respective Heads of the Scientific Collaboration Unit. Scientific
Services Unit and the Human Resources Development Unit (Annex 3 Part A). A Human Resource
Development Specialist would provide advice on training programs (Annes 4 Part A). The Technical
Advisory Group and the Software Applications Specialist would also provide technical advice. The
project would also provide office equipment.
4.48        The Coordinator, together with the Scientific Collaboration Unit Head, would have the
responsibility to develop the capacity of PPPB to foster, coordinate and monitor collaborative
biodiversity research nation-wide, and to develop Memoranda of Understanding and Research
Agreements between PPPB and collaborating institutions and individuals.
4.49       The Coordinator, together with the Scientific Services Unit Head, would facilitate PPPB
services involving inquiries and requests for services from GOI agencies, the general public, and
other external clients, and develop protocols for responding to these requests.
4.50       The Coordinator would also receive support from the Human Resources Development
Unit Head and the Human Resource Development Specialist, to coordinate administrative and
logistical aspects of the all graduate level scholarship programs and local external and on-the-job
training activities. These responsibilities would also include the fostering and mobilization of
additional financial support for overseas graduate-level scholarships that would supplement the GET-
financed scholarships. Logistical and administrative details of the work-study programs would be
handled by the technical assistance contract.

D.   Project Organization and Management
4.51       Project Management Authority. A full-time Project Manager would be designated from
within the senior management staff of PPPB who would be responsible for the smooth implementation
and performance of the project, and who would have overall financial and reporting accountability.
The Project Manager would report through the Director of PPPB to an inter-agency Steering
Committee, which would be chaired by a representative of BAPPENAS, and include a representative
of LIPI's head office (see Figure 2).
4.52       Project Management Committee. A Project Management Committee would provide the
main mechanism to coordinate project activities with regular PPPB line organizational structure. The
Project Management Committee would be chaired by the Project Director, with the Project Manager
serving as secretary. It would also comprise the project Botany, Zoology, Information Systems, and
Scientific Collaboration and Services Coordinators, the Financial Manager, and the five PPPB
division heads, with ex officio advice from the Technical Advisory Group, the Project Management
Specialist, the Financial Management Specialist, and the Human Resource Development Specialist.
The Project Management Committee would meet as often as necessary to deal with project activities,
and to ensure that schedules are adhered to, benchmarks achieved, and project goals met.
4.53       Staffing. Of the 115 positions required for the project, some 53 would be filled by
existing PPPB staff (from a pool of some 325 PPPB staff), some 13 staff would be seconded or
recruited, and some 49 staff would be locally contracted on a fixed-term basis. All 18 managerial job
positions for the project would be filled by existing PPPB personnel, with the exception of the
Information Systems Coordinator position, which would be filled initially by an employee seconded
from another LIPI agency. Locally contracted specialists would assist with project management tasks,
financial management, software applications, engineering design, and various publications and
products. New permanent staff would be recruited as required to participate in the graduate
scholarship program. Some 20 redeployed staff and 40 temporary employees would work as
curatorial assistants on the collections restoration and development, and data entry. This staffing plan
is feasible given PPPB's existing labor profile, the standard GOI civil service and contracting
regulations, and high retention rates of permanent staff. However, there are significant uncertainties
regarding the potential capacities of PPPB permanent and contracted staff. To address this concern
and facilitate smooth project implementation, the annual review of the work plan would include a
specific focus on staffing and associated financial requirements.
4.54       Managerial Positions. The key managerial positions consist of: the Project Manager,
the Financial Manager, the Botany Coordinator, the Zoology Coordinator, the Information Systems
Coordinator/Manager, and the Scientific Collaboration and Services Coordinator. Two Botany
Collections Managers, seven Zoology Collections Managers, a Botany Database Manager, a Zoology
Database Manager. a Computer Technician, a Scientific Collaboration Unit Head, a Scientific
Services Unit Head, and a Human Resource Development Unit Head, would also play important
managerial roles. The project Coordinators, Collection Managers, Data Managers, and Unit Heads
would be responsible to the Project Manager for supervising, on a day-to-day basis, the scientific and
technical quality of work carried out by personnel temporarily seconded or hired under the project,
including Interns seconded to the project from other institutions.
4.55       Reporting Channels. The two Botany Collection Managers and seven Zoology
Collection Managers would report to the Botany and Zoology Coordinators, respectively. The
Zoology Database Manager, Botany Database Manager and a Computer Technician would report to
the Information Systems Coordinator/Manager. The Scientific Collaboration Unit Head, Scientific



- 26 -
Services Unit Head, and Human Resource Development Unit Head would report to the Scientific
Collaboration and Services Coordinator.
4.56        Permanence of Managerial Positions. As currently envisaged, in the absence of a
follow-on project, the positions of the Project Manager, the Financial Manager, the Botany
Coordinator, and the Zoology Coordinator would exist only for the duration of the five-year project.
At the close of the project, the Information Systems Coordinator/Manager, the Scientific
Collaboration and Services Coordinator, the Computer Technician, the Scientific Collaboration Unit
Head, the Scientific Services Head, and the Human Resource Development Unit Head would revert to
their regular line positions in the PPPB organizational structure. By the close of the project, new
regular permanent line positions would also have been established within the PPPB organizational
structure for the Collections Managers and Database Managers.
4.57        Locally Contracted Specialists. Locally recruited specialists from the private sector,
who would be hired under long-term individual contracts, would be provided to assist project staff in
project management tasks, financial management tasks, software applications, and clerical office
work. The Project Management Specialist, probably recruited from the private business sector, would
assist the Project Manager throughout the five years of the project with administrative details
including data analysis and collection, budget preparation, and report preparation. The Financial
Management Specialist would provide advice, guidance, and in-house training to the Financial
Manager on budget control, financial information management, procurement and associated
contracting, disbursement procedures, arrangements for audits, and other measures as necessary
during the first three years of the project. The Software Applications Specialist, under the
supervision of the Information Systems Coordinator/Manager, would identify and adapt appropriate
software applications for project management, scientific collaboration and services, and other project-
related administration tasks as required. The Human Resource Development Specialist would provide
advice, guidance, and in-house training to the Human Resource Development Unit Head on the
administration arrangements for overseas scholarships and local training programs, and on the
mobilization of additional financial resources for overseas scholarships and other relevant training.
4.58       Management of Studies. The Financing Strategy Study would be directed by the
Steering Committee and administered by the Project Manager with support from the LIPI central
office and BAPPENAS in Jakarta.
4.59        Support from Technical and User Advisory Groups. The Project Manager and members
of the PPPB project management committee would be supported by the TAG and the UAG. The
TAG, comprising the Team Leader of the Technical Assistance Contract, a Botany Institutions
Advisor and a Zoology Institutions Advisor who would provide technical and institutional
development support and advice as required. The UAG, comprising members representative of the
wider user community for biodiversity information products, would provide feedback and direction on
the relevance and prioritization of project activities.
E.   Project Plannine, Monitoring, Evaluation and Supervision
Project Planning
4.60        Importance of Explicit Work Plan Goals. During the project's five years, benefits to
external clients would be limited. However, an overall policy framework, specific measurement of
project progress, and a few selected user products would help to justify the project and demonstrate
the potential benefits of further investments after the project period. Because of the current condition



- 27 -
of PPPB's collections and PPPB's limited existing capacity, the project would focus on internal
institutional development. Measurable services and products for external clients would be limited in
scope and would be achieved only in the later years of the project. Yet an explicit policy framework,
realistic and meaningful benchmarks, specific user products, and clear evaluation criteria would
enable PPPB to demonstrate, albeit on a small scale, the current and potential benefits of project
investments to external clients and to possible funding sources. The policy framework, benchmarks,
and user products would also establish the technical design foundation for further developments in
biodiversity information after the project period. Together, the policy framework, the benchmarks,
and the user products would establish the basis for monitoring project outputs and evaluating project
impact.
4.61        Design of Work Plan Goals. During project inception, PPPB would develop a work
plan and standards for measuring project progress through the formulation of the policy framework,
specific goals for the management of the collections and associated information, semi-annual
benchmarks for all five project components, user products, and evaluation methods (see Annex 6).
Specifically, these would comprise:
(a)   Policy Framework. The project management committee, with technical advice from the
TAG and Information Technology and Systematic Specialists as required, would
formulate overall institutional goals and policies'2 with respect to the development and
use of the systematic collections.
(b)   Physical Curation. PPPB would determine semi-annual benchmarks needed to reach the
five-year project goals for physical curation.
(c)   Database. PPPB would conduct two workshops, one to agree upon an optimal field-
structure for the specimen-based database developed under the project, and the second to
determine priorities and realistic goals for the scientific curation of the collections, and
the computerization of associated information, during the subsequent five-year, ten-year
and twenty-five-year periods.
(d)   Benchmarks. PPPB would develop a semiannual monitoring framework for semi-annual
progress reports which incorporates these goals (and related benchmarks involving the
production of written guidelines and protocols), establishes specific benchmarks for the
scientific collaboration and services (including training) and general project management
components, and delineates criteria and procedures for monitoring the effectiveness of
management policies and procedures, training programs, and other project activities.
(e)   User Products. Products for external clients would be achieved only in the later years of
the project. These products would be based on and mostly limited to priority taxa.
Possible products include preliminary species lists, measures of abundance and
distribution, identification reference tools and services, biota resource management
strategies, field guides, biotic resource prospecting, and identification of geological
indicator species.
12 The policy framework might be modeled along the lines of the Agricultural Sector Objectives
developed under the GOI-World Bank Agriculture Research Management Project.



- 28 -
(f)   Required Inputs. PPPB would specify detailed arrangements for staffing, career
development, budget, and other inputs required for the project, and delineate criteria and
procedures for monitoring the performance of staff and consultants.
(g)   Evaluation Methods. Appropriate criteria, methodology and operational plans for
measuring project impact would be developed. The evaluation criteria would build upon
the policy framework and project benchmarks, and also would address global impact.
The methodology might include measures to provide external, independent analysis
reflecting the interests of both the national and international scientific and user
communities. The operational plans would explore the possibility of a long-term
evaluation process that could be sustained over the next twenty-five years. All
evaluation exercises would be kept simple, reflecting the basic long-term goals.
4.62       Review of Work Plan and Progress Report Design. During project inception, the
Project Management Committee, with the assistance of the Project Management Specialist and the
TAG, would develop a suitable format for semi-annual progress reports that incorporate work plan
measurements. The work plan content and progress report format would be subject to review and
endorsement by the UAG, the Steering Committee, and the Bank by March 31, 1995.
Monitoring, Semi-annual Progress Reports, and Annual Review of Work Plan and Budget
4.63        Obiectives of Monitoring. The main objective of the semi-annual reports and of any
other monitoring which is required is to assist prompt managerial problem-solving. A secondary
objective is to provide a regular communication channel to the GOI (through the Steering Committee),
and GET funders (through the Bank) by: (a) providing information on project implementation status
and impacts; (b) demonstrating the effectiveness of project management; and (c) identifying issues
which require Steering Committee and/or Bank intervention. The Project Manager would be
responsible for ensuring that the reports meet these objectives, that they are timely, and that they do
not become a burdensome bureaucratic exercise.
4.64       Contents of Semi-annual Progress Reports. In addition to the day-to day internal
monitoring, the Project Manager would periodically review the progress of the project and submit a
semi-annual progress report to the UAG, the Steering Committee and the Bank. These progress
reports would incorporate measurements of project progress for all five project components, as
reflected in the policy framework, semi-annual benchmarks, and user products. They would also
include data on other aspects of project implementation status, such as staffing, technical assistance,
studies, training, budget, procurement, expenditures, and coordination mechanisms. The reports
would include explanations of the current status and problem-solving strategies.
4.65        Annual Review of Work Plan and Budget. During project preparation, there were
significant uncertainties regarding the potential capacities of PPPB project staff and local consultants.
To address this concern and facilitate smooth project implementation, PPPB, LIPI, and BAPPENAS,
with advice from the TAG, would annually review the work plan and budget required for project
implementation, with a specific focus on human resource requirements and associated financial
financial requirements, and would promptly carry out the recommendations of this review taking into
account the comments of the Bank.

Mid-Project Review, Completion Report, and Long-term Evaluation
4.66       Mid-Proiect Review. At the end of the third year of the project (i.e., early in the fourth
fiscal year), the Project Manager, with the assistance of the Project Management Specialist, the TAG,
and the Project Management Committee would prepare a Mid-Project Review. This review would be
a more detailed and comprehensive report than the semi-annual progress reports. It would provide
the opportunity to adjust officially project benchmarks and to make other changes in project design if
necessary. It would provide a channel for reporting initial measurements of project impact as
measured through the evaluation process. It would also incorporate and build upon the financing
strategic planning study, the collections data access report, and other relevant planning exercises. In
addition, it would provide the Steering Committee with the opportunity to expand the policy
framework for biodiversity information to cover institutional development outside of PPPB. The
Steering Committee would use the review exercise to develop coherent plans and proposals for the
next, post-project stage of developing biodiversity information in Indonesia.
4.67        Completion Report. Within six months of project completion, the Project Manager
would prepare a Project Completion Report on the basis of GOI and Bank guidelines. The primary
objective of the Project Completion Report would be to describe and analyze the state of the project
at, or shortly after, its completion, to compare the costs and currently expected benefits with those
expected at appraisal/project inception and thereby to contribute to an assessment of the effectiveness
of the project and the implementing agency. It would reinforce self-evaluation, would draw lessons
from experience and would serve as a mechanism to disseminate these lessons. It would include an
assessment of the original project objectives and design and of the methods used and decisions taken
in the course of project implementation. Topics covered would include project identification and
preparation, implementation, operating performance, financial performance, institutional performance
and development, and reevaluation of project impact and benefits.
4.68        Long-term Evaluation. While initial evaluations of project impact would be reported in
the Mid-Project Review and Completion Report, a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of
project impact would only be possible well after the project period. In order to facilitate such
evaluation and to address long-term development goals, PPPB will design evaluation criteria,
methodology, and plans which would contribute to its ability to achieve its twenty-five-year objectives
for the development of scientific information on biodiversity.
Supervision
4.69        The project would be supervised semiannually. In addition to the Bank task manager, it
would be desirable to include on these supervision missions, annually, at least one systematic biologist
with extensive experience in institutional development and collections management.
V. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING
A.   Costs
5.1        The total cost of the proposed project is estimated to be about US $11.4 million
(Rp 24.0 billion) with a foreign exchange component of US $5.0 million (Rp 10.6 billion). The cost
is estimated on November, 1993, prices and includes taxes and duties estimated at US $1.0 million
(Rp 2.0 billion). Baseline project costs (excluding physical and price contingencies) are estimated at
US $9.6 million (Rp 20.3 billion). Physical contingencies (to allow for possible design variations)



- 30 -
have been estimated at 5 percent for investment costs and 15 percent for recurrent costs. Price
contingency estimates assume increases in local currency costs of 5.5 percent per annum and increases
in foreign exchange costs of 2.5 percent per annum throughout the project.
5.2             The estimated project costs are summarized in Table 5.1, and elaborated in Annex 9 and
the Project Files.
B.      Financing
5.3             The proposed GET grant would finance 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs and
63 percent of the total project costs. The Government of Indonesia would need to contribute an
estimated US $1.0 million (Rp 2.0 billion) in taxes and duties, and US $3.2 million (Rp 6.8 billion)
in research grants, local training, and recurrent institutional operating expenses.

VI. PROJECT IMPACT
A.   Benefits and Justification
Institutional Benefits
6.1         The proposed project would accomplish the following:
(a)   Strategic and institutional transformation. The project would enable PPPB to become
one of the first examples in the world where the collection, organization, and
dissemination of biodiversity information would be driven by user need, integrated and
coordinated at a national level; and based on primary specimen-based data. The project
would also enable PPPB to take the first step in a long-term process to provide
biodiversity information adequate in scope and scale to the task of conservation and
sustainable development in a large, developing country with high biodiversity. The
project would make PPPB more effective and responsive, and would provide a model of
strategic and institutional transformation for similar organizations in both developing and
developed countries. The project would begin to address the severe lack of Indonesian
personnel trained in strategic management, systematic biology, database development,
and physical curation. It would provide an institutional model for the seamless
integration of fieldwork, collections management and information management. The
project would lay the foundation for future regional expansion of regional inventory and
monitoring of biological resources.
(b)   Improvements in the physical condition of specimens. The project investment in
collections and research would significantly improve the physical condition of the
collections. Under the project, PPPB would take definitive steps toward international
standards of physical curation. Unless immediate measures are taken to restore large
numbers of specimens that are deteriorating under tropical conditions, the Center's
extensive historical collections will shortly sustain irreparable damage, and large
amounts of valuable biodiversity information will be lost. In economic terms, it is four
to twenty times more cost-efficient to capture biodiversity information from the existing
collections than to collect new data from the field.
(c)   Database design and establishment. The database development would improve
collections management, enable collection plans and development, and facilitate external
use. The database would be state-of-the-art, and would provide a key part of the
scientific and institutional foundation required for a national biodiversity information
system. It would provide functional fields of information that meet internal and external
needs for the priority taxa that is in the project work program. The project would also
establish the basic database infrastructure required for long-term process of entering 100
percent of the data from PPPB's existing collections.
(d)   Fostering of scientific collaboration and research. The project would help to foster
scientific collaboration and research, beyond that which would be provided under the
project itself. This increased scientific collaboration and research would supplement
financial and expert resources, and be an important source of new specimens, data, and
human resource development.



- 32 -
(e)   Development of user products and services. The project also includes support for a
variety of products and services for external clients. These tangible products and
services would be based on, and mostly limited to, priority taxa, and might include
preliminary species lists, measures of abundance and distribution, identification reference
tools and services, field guides, compilations of ethnobiological data, and biotic resource
prospecting services.
Benefits of Biodiversity Information
6.2         The project would enable PPPB to become a leader in environmental data management
and enable GOI, non-governmental organizations, and commercial users to access priority biodiversity
information. This biodiversity information would provide a more factual basis for decision-making in
natural resource management, conservation, spatial planning, and environmental assessment. It would
also enable the identification of plants and animals with economic potential. The label information
associated with specimens in the collections include location, date of collection, soil type, elevation,
slope, proximity to water courses, associated species, and local uses. Applications of this label
information include:
(a)   Rapid assessments of the biological resources of specific locations, to be used in land-use
planning and ecosystem management;
(b)   Environmental monitoring to measure the impact over time of investments and other
human activities on ecosystems;
(c)   Identification and monitoring of rare and endangered species, and analysis of geographic
distribution patterns for biodiversity conservation;
(d)   Identification of unknown species such as newly introduced agricultural pests;
(e)   Repository of local knowledge about plant and animal uses, which is rapidly
disappearing; and
(f)   Database searches for prospecting plants and animals for various uses including
therapeutic drugs, food, biological controls, reforestation (e.g., mycorrhizal fungi), and
geological species indicators (e.g., discovery of mineral deposits and hot springs).
B.   Envirornental Impact
6.3         Building. Because no new building or construction would be funded under the GET
project, the environmental impact in Bogor would be negligible.
6.4         Collections Development. The collection of specimens from the wild under the
fieldwork training and guidebook production program would be carried out with full regard to the
need to conserve rare and endangered species. Selection of specimens for collection would exclude
those proposed for future inclusion in the IUCN Red Data Books for Indonesia, and those already
covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
(CITES) regulations. Further, all collecting would conform to current GOI regulations on the
collection and distribution of biological materials and information, as covered under Act No. 5, 1990,
Conservation of Living Resources and their Ecosystems.



- 33 -
6.5        It should be noted that one of the major benefits of the proposed collections-based
biodiversity information system at PPPB would be increased quantity, quality, and availability of
information on the distribution and status of rare and endangered species in Indonesia.
6.6         Hazardous chemicals. The use of toxic and potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic
chemicals to preserve collections from insect and fungal pests was ceased in January 1994. Specialist
health and safety advice would be sought, and active measures taken by PPPB, to reduce to a
minimum future exposure of staff and visitors to the residual toxic chemicals in the collections
(paragraph 4.8).
C.   Egual Opportunity
6.7         All recruitment and training under the project would be carried out on an equal
opportunity basis.
D.   Sustainability
6.8         A large portion of the project inputs would provide lasting benefits well after the close
of the project. A large part (21 percent) of the investment proposed under the project would be in
materials and equipment necessary for the efficient long-term curation and scientific management of
the national biological collections. Similarly, 41 percent of the proposed investment would be in
training personnel who would contribute to the long-term human resource needs of Indonesia. It is
currently estimated that approximately 37 percent of the total cost of the project would be met from
matching funds provided by the Government of Indonesia.
6.9         The project includes specific provisions to ensure adequate provision and allocation of
financial and human resources both during and after the project period. The annual review of the
work plan and budget (paragraph 4.65) would provide the mechanism to adjust, if necessary, the
Government's contribution. The Financing Strategy Study would analyze the financial resources
required to maintain and further develop the systematic collections, and to carry out associated
research and information systems and management activities, and recommend a strategy for how
PPPB could achieve long-term financial sustainability. The Government has agreed that incremental
operating costs at PPPB (currently estimated at US $200,000 over the five-year period, and subject to
adjustments based on the annual reviews and the Financing Strategy Study), resulting from the
project, would be met through long-term increases in the institutional budget. Recipients of training
provided under the project would be subject to the standard requirements of returning to Government
service for a three-year period. In addition, the Government would provide assurances that they
would also be employed in positions in PPPB where they could make full use of the training.
E.   Risks
6.10        The main risks or areas of uncertainty associated with the implementation of the project
are believed to be: (a) providing sufficient management support to carry out nearly fifty years of
deferred maintenance to the collections in Bogor in just five years; (b) recruitment, motivating and
training of sufficient numbers of new and existing staff to carry out the immense amount of work
involved in bringing the institution up to modern international standards; (c) establishing and
implementing new management plans for collections development and systematic research based on
user need and national priorities; (d) building institutional linkages and information systems that
would enable the fullest possible utilization of the collections; and (e) sustainability after the project.



- 34 -
6.11        The logistical aspects of the Zoology sub-project would be strongly influenced by a GOI
proposal, presently under development with the Government of Japan, to re-house the zoological
collections in a new, custom-built building in Cibinong. This move is presently scheduled to take
place around March-April, 1996. Close coordination would be required to avoid potential gaps or
duplication, and scheduling conflicts between the two proposed projects. GOI would assume
responsibility for coordinating these aspects, and for providing an adequate budget to rehouse the
zoological collections in adequate facilities should the proposed GOJ support not materialize.
6.12        The appointment of strong and experienced candidates to the positions of Project
Manager, Financial Manager, and four sub-project Coordinators would be critical to the success of
the project. To ensure one hundred percent of the effort of the key personnel would be spent on the
project, GET would provide honoraria for five years. In keeping with established institutional
practice, honoraria would also be provided to all other key project staff as extra compensation for
additional work performed during the course of the project.
6.13        The project would use a single contract arrangement for procuring specialized technical
assistance. The annual review of financial and human resource requirements would include a review
of the requirements for technical assistance and local specialists.
6.14        The project includes specific measures to strengthen linkages with users. These include
the establishment of a User Advisory Group, institutional strengthening of the Scientific Collaboration
and Services Subdivision, and a report which would analysis issues of interagency data access and
sharing. The Steering Committee would provide essential interagency coordination. The internship
program would strengthen linkages with provincial universities. The specialized technical assistance,
overseas training program, and on-the-job mentoring would strengthen linkages with international
research institutions. The collections training and field guide production program at Halimun
National Park would involve park staff and local NGOs. The user products developed with project
support would provide direct benefits to a variety of users.
6.15        As explained above, the project includes measures which address financial and
institutional requirements for the long-term sustainability of project investments (paragraph 6.8).
6.16        It should also be noted that the full benefit, in terms of improved conservation and
sustainable management of Indonesian biodiversity resulting from the implementation of this project,
would be contingent on future levels of investment in a range of complementary activities including:
(a) retroactive data capture from existing collections to computer databases; (b) increased support,
nationally and internationally, for systematic research on the biota of the region; (c) an increased rate
of inventory and collecting throughout Indonesia; and (d) the means to collect, integrate, analyze and
synthesize environmental and biodiversity information on a national scale and to disseminate
functional information projects to a wide range of users.

Overview of Institutions with Conservation
and Environmental Responsibilities
1.          At least eight agencies of GOI have major responsibilities for the environment--and
hence have a need for biodiversity information. These and other activities are coordinated by the
National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS) (see Figure 3):
(a)   The Ministry of State for Environment (LH) has broad responsibility for environmental
monitoring, conservation, and for the development of policy and planning.
(b)   The Ministry of Forestry (Kehutanan) has responsibility, under the aegis of the
Directorate General of Forest Protection and Nature Conservation (PHPA), for the
administration of all national parks and nature reserves in Indonesia (both terrestrial and
marine). Issues under Kehutanan' purview, such as forest research leading to
sustainable methods for forest utilization, reforestation, and the regulation of the private
sector in the logging industry, have major implications for the conservation of
Indonesian biodiversity.
The Forestry Research and Development Center (Puslitbang Hutan), Bogor, is engaged
in a number of joint research and sustainable forest management projects with
international development agencies (e.g., USAID, ODA). Puslitbang Hutan also
maintains the second largest herbarium in Indonesia, with more than 45,000 specimens
of commercial timber species, as well as modest collections of insects of importance to
forestry.
(c)   The Ministry of Agriculture has responsibility for a range of renewable resources
including food, industrial, and spice and medicinal crops; freshwater and marine
fisheries and animal husbandry; and for enforcing plant and animal quarantine
regulations.
(d)   The Ministry of Health carries out research on human parasites, vectors of disease and
methods for their control.
(e)   The Ministry of Research and Technologv has broad responsibilities for natural
resources inventory, and ecological and oceanographic research.
(f)   The Ministry of Trade regulates trade in protected plants and animals.
(g)   The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for water management, and for monitoring
and controlling air and water pollution.
(h)   The Ministry of Education and Culture has broad responsibility for environmental
education. Its Directorate General of Higher Education (DGHE) provides university
courses in the environmental sciences, supports research by faculty, and is closely
associated with the Environmental Study Centers (PSLs) located at many universities
throughout the country.



ANNEX 1                                    -44-
(i)   The Indonesian Institute of Science' (LIPI), Natural Science Division, has a major role
in issues of the environment and biodiversity both through the Research and
Development Centers and through the Center for Scientific Documentation and
Information (PDII).
Of the four Research and Development Centers responsible for biodiversity, the Center
for Biology (PPPB) is designated as a center for collections-based research. It is a key
partner in many regional biodiversity projects focused on Southeast Asia. PPPB is a
leading participant in the long-established Flora Malesiana Project, and it is currently
involved in the planning stages of a parallel Fauna Malesiana Project. The Plant
Resources of Southeast Asia project (PROSEA), which is producing a series of manuals
to the economically important plants of the region, has both a regional office and a
country office located in the Herbarium Bogoriense.
PDII, under the division for the Development of Scientific Infrastructure, maintains the
central LIP! library and coordinates scientific data management activities. For this
reason PDII has been designated by LIPI as the coordinating agency responsible for the
development of the proposed National Biodiversity Database.
All international collaborative research programs involving LIPI, and visits by foreign
researchers, are coordinated by the Bureau of Inter-institutional Cooperation in Science
and Technology (IPTEK) in the division of General Affairs.
2.         Non-governmental organizations. In addition to governmental agencies, there are a
number of non-governmental agencies (NGOs) with active programs in the area of conservation and
biodiversity. The Indonesian Environmental Forum (WAHLI) is an umbrella organization for in-
country NGOs. There are also a number of international conservation organizations with active
programs in Indonesia (e.g., World Wide Fund for Nature, Asian Wetland Bureau, International
Council for Bird Preservation, The Nature Conservancy, Wildlife Conservation International and
Conservation International.
LIPI is a non-departmental government institution, which is under the control of and reports
directly to the President. Its main tasks include assisting the President. Its main functions include
organizing research, providing guidance, providing services, and developing science and
technology. LIPI is headed by a Chairman who is assisted by a Vice Chairman and five deputies.
LIPI directs some 19 Research and Development/technical Centers, 8 Implementation Units, and
5 Bureaus.

DETAILED REVIEW2 OF PRESENT RESOURCES

- 47 -                                 ANNEX 2
Detailed Review of Present Resources
at the Research and Development Center for Biolog
A.   Institutioinal Overview
liiniian Resources
I.         ldividuals involved in systematic biology form a minority of the total staff employed,
eveni thouglh in terms of area, systematic work occupies the overwhelming majority of the space.
Similarly, considering the amount and scope of the work to be accomplished within the institution,
ther-e is an acute shortage of trained staff in collection management and systematic research. The age
structure is strongly skewed towards staff under forty.
2.          All traiied staff undertake a wide range of activities other than research, including:
*     )popular writing;
-    editing journals and books;
-    teaching in universities;
-     providinig advisory services, including identifications;
*     supervising student projects;
-    curating collections;
--    undertaking Government projects; and
*    assisting foreign scientists in the field.
3.          The amount of time spent on these activities varies, but the government projects wh;ch
are usually non-systematic in nature, can occupy as much as 80 percent of an individual's time.
Sonie of this work attracts additional monies that are important sources of funding for PPPB, and
supplemenit the income of staff.
4.          Promotion and career development for most staff is based on annual reports and an
assessmiient made every four years by a small group of senior researchers. This assessment is the
basis for awarding incentive payments, which may represent up to 50 percent of an individual's
salary. Payment of these incentives is nearly universal. Individuals lacking degrees, for example
teclhnicians, have experienced barriers to promotion.
Financial Support
5.          Any analysis of the nature of the institution, the availability of facilities, or lack of
training reflects the comparatively low level of financial support that PPPB receives for all activities,
not only systematic biology, even though improvements have occurred recently and the overall
operating budget from the Government has increased. Staff salaries are not included in this budget,
but are paid from central LIPI funds. It is frequently remarked that salaries in the government sector
tend to be lower than in the private sector and consequently it is difficult for PPPB to recruit and
retain the most able people in the labor market.
6.          For financial reasons, PPPB's purchase of foreign journals and basic texts declined over
recent years and finally ceased about three years ago. The fact that these texts or journals may no
longer be available anywhere in Indonesia seriously limits research. For similar reasons, regular
servicing of scientific equipment has not been maintained, and many potentially useful instruments
such as microscopes are no longer functional.



ANNEX 2                                     - 48 -
Organization and Management
7.          Each discipline represented in the different departments--systematics, ecology,
physiology--is headed by a senior researcher. There is no additional remuneration for this and
responsibility rotates. Although there are regular staff meetings to discuss work, these appear to be
more concerned with sharing information than providing a critical forum where research priorities or
progress can be evaluated.
8.          The choice of topic for personal research remains the prerogative of the individual staff
member. In contrast, government projects are organized centrally from PPPB, and are clearly in the
directed mode. Annual reports of government projects are published in a house journal in either
English or Indonesian (if the latter, then an abstract in English is provided).
9.          Training for senior and middle managers is provided centrally within LIPI at intensive
courses lasting up to three months.
Health & Safety
10.        Some of the wide variety of chemicals and equipment in use throughout the three
institutions are potentially hazardous to staff who work with the materials and to visiting scientists
who are exposed to them. However, there is little evidence that any special precautions are taken to
minimize the risks and only a few staff are even aware of the problems.
Chemicals
(a)   Hazardous chemicals are employed routinely in preservation of the collections, often in
high concentrations and in the form of 'cocktails'. These include mercurial and
arsenical compounds, naphthalene and PCBs. Contact is made with these chemicals by
handling specimens and breathing fumes.
(b)   Hazardous chemicals are kept on open shelves or in cupboards that are unlocked and
unsuitable for highly flammable substances.
(c)   Formalin (the use of which is now restricted in North America, Europe and Australia) is
used on open benches in the fixation of zoological material.
Equipment
(d)   Equipment such as autoclaves are not regularly serviced.
(e)   Fume cupboards are not always available to staff who use hazardous chemicals.
(f)   There are no laminar downflow workstations for handling potentially pathogenic
micro-organisms.
Work Practices
(g)   Work areas for staff are not isolated from the collections and their associated chemical
preservatives.
(h)   Staff eat and drink in areas highly contaminated with hazardous chemicals.
(i)   There is no safety training in the use of hazardous chemicals and equipment.

B.   Botany Division
Human Resources
11.         The Botany Division presently has a total of 98 staff, 30 (30 percent) of whom are
identified with the Taxonomy section. 15 (50 percent of the Taxonomy Section) of these individuals
have degree-level training in biology, including 7 (23 percent) with graduate-level training. 15
technicians support the maintenance of the botanical collections and the research and fieldwork needs
of 29 scientific staff in the Taxonomy and Ecology sections.
12.         The research interests of the degree-level staff include orchids (3 people), palms (1),
bamboos (1), legumes (3), citrus (1), Myrsinaceae (1), ferns (1), bryophytes and lichens (1), and
mycology (2). Three of the senior research staff regularly publish in scientific journals, but the
majority of the junior staff have a very limited command of foreign languages, which severely limits
their capacity to carry out independent research.
Buildings
13.         The botanical collections are housed in a spacious, four-story concrete building
constructed around 1965. The basement of the building is largely occupied by the Museum of
Ethnobotany, but it also provides storage space and access to three outside drying ovens used for
processing plant specimens. The first floor houses collections of dried fungi, bryophytes, lichens,
fruits and seeds; type collections of higher plants; a large collection of specimens preserved in
alcohol; the Botany Library; offices for administrative staff; office and laboratory facilities for
research staff; office space occupied by the PROSEA project; an air-conditioned room containing
several stand-alone personal computers; and a room used for mounting herbarium specimens. The
dried collections of Ferns and Seed Plants occupy most of the second and third floors. Much of the
fourth floor has been converted to provide office cubicles for the research staff, but these remain
largely unoccupied due to uncomfortably high day-time temperatures.
Facilities and Equipment
14.        Most of the systematic research staff work in a large, non-air-conditioned room on the
ground floor, which functions as both laboratory and office space. Storage space for books and
papers is lacking, and the available working surfaces are cramped and overcrowded. Access to
computer facilities is limited to a single stand-alone PC which is shared by all the staff in the Botany
Division; many of the junior staff are unfamiliar with its use. Several binocular microscopes are
available for general use by the systematic staff on the first floor, but all cytogenetic work is carried
out on a research microscope personally owned by one of the staff.
15.         Newly-collected herbarium specimens are usually temporarily preserved in alcohol in the
field, then dried, pressed and sorted on arrival at the herbarium. The present drying ovens are heated
by charcoal, which occasionally leads to the loss of specimens due to accidental fires. Poor air
circulation makes the drying process inefficient. Many of the plant presses in use lack adequate
straps, and thus it is impossible to tighten them enough to produce high-quality herbarium specimens.
The basement area presently used for processing incoming specimens is cramped, unventilated and
poorly lit.
16.        Working conditions on floors two and three, housing the higher plant collections, are hot
and uncomfortable during most of the day. The only facilities present are a few old desks and tables



ANNEX 2                                    - 50 -
used by the technical staff and by occasional visitors. Staff who work in this area presumably are
continuously exposed to mercury residues in the form of airborne dust from the specimens. There is
no access to microscopes, identification guides, or computers on the second or third floors.
Collections
17.        The majority of the vascular plant collections are housed in racks full of old metal
boxes, many with ill-fitting or missing lids. Approximately 6,300 (33 percent) of the original boxes
were replaced in the mid-1980s with custom-built metal cabinets. Many of the remaining 12,790
metal boxes are presently filled to capacity, leaving no room to expand the collection. Of the old
boxes housing the fungal, bryophyte (mosses and liverworts) and lichen collections, 990 (40 percent)
have been replaced by cabinets, leaving approximately 1500 boxes still to be replaced.
18.        The botanical collections also includes a large number of specimens preserved in
alcohol, contained in assorted glass jars stored on shelves in wooden cabinets. The majority of the
older jars have glass tops, sealed by paraffin wax, and require little maintenance. However, in recent
years, only poor-quality jars, manufactured for domestic use, have been available for making new
spirit collections, and the lids of these quickly corrode and leak alcohol vapor. The most important
research material in the spirit collection belongs to the Orchidaceae (orchid) and Zingiberaceae
(ginger) families, totaling approximately 6,800 and 960 specimens, respectively. This material,
including many type specimens, has become very brittle as the composition of the preservative has
changed with time. It is now so vulnerable to damage that it will need to be expertly restored before
it can be used again for research purposes.
19.        Except for material accessioned or remounted during the last few years, the dried
herbarium specimens of higher plants are mostly mounted on poor-quality, acidic paper. In some
cases, this has deteriorated to the point where the sheets and labels disintegrate with even the most
careful handling. Approximately 200,000 sheets (20 percent of the collection) are presently at risk,
and require remounting. In addition, it is estimated that there are approximately 200,000
deteriorating or inadequate species covers which will require replacement in order to safeguard the
collection during storage and handling.
20.        Between 1,500 and 6,000 new accessions have been added to the collections each year
for the past 10 years. However, the number of new specimens mounted, labeled and inserted in the
herbarium comprises only 52 percent of the total number of specimens collected, and the remaining
collections have built up over the past 5 years into a backlog of approximately 4,000 unmounted
specimens.
21.        Up to the present, all new specimens have been poisoned to a greater or lesser extent
using Sublimate (mercuric chloride) to reduce the incidence of insect attack. This procedure is not
100 percent effective, and there is evidence of considerable damage having occurred both to
unmounted specimens in storage, and to mounted specimens in the collections. Para-dichlorobenzene,
naphthalene and industrial fumigants have also been used on an ad hoc basis to deter insects, but
without any apparent lasting effect.



- 51-                                  ANNEX 2
C.   Zoology Division (Balitbans Zoologi)
Human Resources
22.        The total number of staff is approximately 70, organized under technical and research
staff, and working in the three disciplines of systematics, ecology and physiology. All the research
staff in the Zoology Division have degree-level training in biology, but less than one-third (13) are
identified with systematics and the greatest concentration of these are working on insect and vertebrate
groups. Amongst the junior staff, a number are studying for--or have just completed--a higher
degree, predominantly overseas, but only two of these have received training in systematics. The age
profile of the systematics research staff shows a gap between the senior and junior members, which
will have future repercussions on continuity in on-the-job training.
23.        The publication record of the research staff shows that only three (23 percent) have
published in international journals, while all have published articles or reports in-country. It should
be noted that the two most senior and productive members of the staff will shortly be retiring. To
place this publication record in a broader context, most publications on Indonesian fauna are produced
by foreign scientists, with Indonesians and the MZB making only a small contribution. The
publication of the zoological section of Treubia, the in-house journal of the Museum, has been
delayed for financial reasons. A few individuals are producing specialist newsletters and, in one
instance, a collaborative international journal, as a vehicle for their publications and a conimodity to
exchange for other publications.
Buildings
24.        The zoological collections are housed in two complexes, about one kilometer apart,
within the boundaries of the Kebun Raya, Bogor:
(a)  the North Museum, which was built originally as a guest house for the Istana (Palace),
Bogor and now houses the dry collections and staff working in entomology, ornithology,
mammalogy and herpetology; and
(b)   a complex of old buildings known collectively as the South Museum and housing the wet
collections, some dry material, libraries, taxidermy laboratory, and staff working in
parasitology, malacology, crustacea, ichthyology and herpetology. The office of the
Director and the public displays are also in this complex.
25.        Both sets of buildings are simple in design and construction and some are probably over
60 years old. All are suffering from a lack of general maintenance and upgrading: wood used in the
construction of the building is being attacked by termites, the roofs leak, and nowhere are there
functional screens to prevent the entry of insect pests. Air-conditioning is available only in the area
housing the insect collections in the North Museum and in one room of the South Museum which acts
as a communal instrument facility with a computer and microscope.
26.        In the North Museum, building renovations are being undertaken after extensive flooding
damaged the basement and collections, while the weight of the collections storage facilities caused
structural damage and necessitated modifications to the above-ground floors. Both these renovations
will provide only short-term solutions.



ANNEX 2                                     - 52 -
Facilities and Equipment
27.         Many research staff have individual offices and most collection areas have some room to
expand, but this space leaves much to be desired and is mostly inadequate for research purposes.
Nearly all the staff work in non-air-conditioned rooms, sometimes without windows, and many are
continuously exposed to a cocktail of toxic chemicals used to combat insect pests in the collections.
Difficulties arise when equipment sensitive to adverse environmental conditions, particularly humidity,
is stored or used regularly under these conditions.
28.         General laboratory facilities, including adequate bench space, running water and a stable
power supply, are lacking. The number of both high-power and dissecting microscopes is limited and
these instruments are sometimes poorly maintained or not functioning. Only one desk-top computer is
owned by the museum, although a few individuals have joined together to privately purchase their
own equipment or use a computer supplied by an overseas collaborator.
Collections
29.         The overall size of the zoological collections, consisting in part of unincorporated
material (including type specimens), is probably close to 500,000 specimens. The dry collections are
housed in wooden or metal cupboards and cabinets of varying size and construction. Except for a
few metal cabinets which were purchased recently, all of these cupboards and cabinets are at least 50
years old and many may be older than 80 years. All of the old metal cabinets used in entomology,
mammalogy and ornithology, for example, are badly corroded and distorted, and sealing gaskets have
deteriorated. Inside these cabinets, specimens are housed in metal or wooden drawers with or without
glass lids, or in cardboard boxes. There is no modular size of drawer between or within most of the
collections. Pests have been controlled over many years with a wide range of toxic chemicals
(including arsenic), used in an ad hoc manner and often in high concentrations. Humidity in the
drawers and cabinets is reduced by the use of quicklime (anhydrous calcium hydroxide), which must
be frequently replaced.
30.        In the case of the wet collections, material is stored in alcohol in glass bottles or jars of
many different sizes and styles--90 percent of which have badly corroded metal lids. Although
alcohol is used as a preservative, formalin is widely used for initial fixation of specimens. In the
Parasitology Laboratory, extensive slide collections are housed in a wide variety of boxes and
containers.
31.         There is considerable variation in the level of organization both within and between
collections. It can vary from being well-arranged in systematic order, with dry, wet, and slide
collections separate, to a state where material has been added in an ad hoc manner depending largely
on the availability of space rather than systematic position. In most of the invertebrate collections at
least, there is also a significant backlog of unlabeled, unsorted, or unprepared material which is
currently unavailable for research purposes.
32.         Catalogues are available for many groups, consisting mostly of handwritten cards or
ledgers, and although most have not been regularly maintained, a few have been transferred to up-to-
date, simple computer-generated databases. The information captured is usually very basic, covering
species name, locality, collector, date collected, the number of specimens and, for some groups of
organisms, a registration and collector's number. Only the recent collections contain more detailed
information on, for example, habitats. A series of publications on holdings of type material was
begun but has not been completed, although the information is available in manuscript form.



- 53 -                                  ANNEX 2
33.         For most groups of animals the collections are expanding slowly. The exceptions are in
areas where foreign collectors are working and making regular donations to the Museum.
Unfortunately, it must also be recognized that although all collectors working in Indonesia are
required by LIPI to deposit specimens in the Museum, they are often reluctant to submit valuable
material because of their concern about the long-term maintenance of the collections.
D.   Microbiologv Division
Human Resources
34.         Presently, most research activity within the Microbiology Division is in microbial
physiology and ecology. There are three main sections: agricultural microbiology, environmental
microbiology and industrial microbiology.
35.         The agricultural group contains eleven researchers and two technicians. Most of this
group's investigations have been concerned with root nodule bacteria (Rhizobium spp.) of legumes,
although some attention has been paid to nitrogen fixation of cyanobacteria associated with Azolla
plants and the dual inoculation of local leguminous trees (e.g., Albizzia spp.) with Rhizobium and
vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM).
36.          The environmental group consists of four research staff and two technicians. Apart
from studies of fungal decomposition of wood, they have worked recently on composts inoculated
with cellulolytic fungi and on the use of plant extracts (e.g., of Derris spp.) as microbial inhibitors.
37.         The industrial group is concerned with fungi active in the production of fermented foods
and with growing edible fungi (e.g., Pleurotus ostreatus, the oyster mushroom). There is a research
staff of nine graduates and two technicians.
38.         A new group was recently assigned to basic microbiology. Of three researchers, one
has been recently transferred from the Botany division and is still working partly with the
phytochemistry section of the Botany division. Of another three, one was until recently a "candidate"
researcher and the other two are still in this probationary category. There are four technicians.
39.         At present, eleven staff are studying overseas, in Australia, France, Germany, Japan,
New Zealand, UK, and USA, for M.Sc. or Ph.D. degrees. Topics under study include the
preservation of animal fodder, food microbiology, rumen microbiology, enzymes in Eug!ena gracilis,
microbial decomposition of chicken eggs and genetically-modified microbes. The current interests of
the host institution seem to be paramount in the choice of research topics. In many cases, returning
students do not pursue the subject of their postgraduate studies on return to Indonesia. It is estimated
that the total number of staff in the microbiology division is 51.
40.         Within the Botany Division collections, fungal systematics (especially the larger
Ascomycetes and endomycorrhizae) has been studied by two staff for many years. On the other
hand, no resources are allocated to the systematic study of non-pathogenic actinomycetes, algae,
bacteria and protozoa in Indonesia despite the importance of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria in rice
paddy systems and the potential value of actinomycetes and protozoans as biological control agents.
Thus there is a gross mismatch between the current level of systematic expertise and the huge range
of biological diversity in Indonesia and the needs of the agricultural and food industries.



ANNEX 2                                     -54-
Buildings
41.         The buildings housing the Microbiology Division are single-story and arranged around a
courtyard. Although the buildings are old, the general fabric appears to be sound and in a good state
of repair. Within the courtyard, there is a substantial and well-designed greenhouse in good
condition.
Facilities and Equipment
42.         The Microbiology Division is modestly equipped for microbiology; several important
items (e.g., microscopes and freeze-drying equipment) are non-operational. There is presently a lack
of resources to keep such specialized equipment in working order. The autoclaves are small and
cannot sterilize large quantities of materials quickly. Only a few air-conditioning units exist in the
laboratories. The division has one horizontal laminar airflow workstation and a containment room
with UV lights for fungal subculture work. In the mycological rooms of the Herbarium, there is one
good light microscope equipped with high-power objectives and one room is air-conditioned.
Collections
43.         The Microbiology Division has custody of more than 1000 isolates of fungi, bacteria and
cyanobacteria--the latter consisting of mixed cultures in soil and liquid nutrients. Specific names are
attached to 94 isolates of microscopic fungi, 12 basidiomycete isolates and 6 bacterial isolates. The
remainder are unidentified and, without microscopical examination it is impossible to judge how many
isolates are duplicates or contaminants. Most of the cultures are on agar slopes tubes plugged with
cotton wool. In the Indonesian climate, such cultures need to be subcultured frequently if stored at
ambient temperatures. The only available refrigerator, set at 5 C, is occupied by freeze-dried
ampoules of bacteria, principally Rhizobium spp. The viability of these cultures is unknown.
E.   Information Systems and Management
44.         At present a range of information management systems are used in the botany and
zoology collections, from partial card index catalogues and journal entries to recent, uncoordinated
attempts to enter data on computer databases. The production of labels for new collections is not
integrated with database development, which leads to situations where the data may have to be entered
twice for the same specimen. There has been no attempt to establish standardized data entry
protocols and data coding, either within PPPB or with collaborating institutions.
F.   Scientific Services and Information Division
45.         Within the present organizational structure of PPPB, responsibility for providing
information, including library services, and for coordinating scientific collaboration with external
agencies, falls under the Scientific Services and Information Division. Recently, the role of this
Division has been extended to include responsibility for coordinating and tracking all biodiversity-
related research--including systematic biology, ethnobiology and ecology--carried out by foreign
researchers in collaboration with Indonesian agencies. Thus, in future, all applications from foreign
biologists for research permits to work in Indonesia will be processed by PPPB.
46.         Present capacity at PPPB to coordinate and monitor research activities, including the
processing of progress reports and publications, is limited to a small office organized under three
subdivisions: Scientific Collaboration and Services, Documentation and Information, and Library
Services.



- 55 -                                 ANNEX 2
47.        In order to respond to the growing number of requests from outside agencies for
biodiversity-related information and services, and to streamline the coordination of administration of
international scientific collaboration, PPPB has recognized an urgent need to increase the capacity of
this Scientific Collaboration and Services subdivision. Minimum requirements include:
(a)  the development of institutional policies and protocols for collaborative research;
(b)   the provision of a database to track the progress of collaborative research projects;
(c)   the means to implement standardized research agreements and memoranda of
understanding with collaborating agencies; and
(d)   an increased commnunications capacity, including electronic mail, translation services and
the provision of a budget for local travel.
G.   Library Resources for Systematic Literature
48.         The main source for biology literature in Bogor is the Central Library of Department of
Agriculture, supplemented by specialist systematic literature housed within the Botany, Zoological and
Microbiology Divisions. In general, basic reference texts published in the first quarter of this century
are well-represented, although there is a lack of modern publications. Similarly, prior to 1988,
journals relating to systematic biology were relatively well-represented, but since that time most
periodical subscriptions have been discontinued. Recent supplements to a number of key systematic
reference works are also lacking.
49.         Due to lack of climate control and inadequate storage facilities, there has been a
significant deterioration in the physical condition of many of the older books over the years.
Technical advice on the timely restoration and curation of the libraries and associated archival
material, funded by GET, together with a GOI budget to cover increased recurrent costs associated
with air-conditioning, humidity and pest control, and possibly a program of selective de-acidification,
would almost certainly prove more cost-effective than attempting to replace damaged texts, many of
which are believed to be very valuable and/or possibly irreplaceable.
H.   Administration Division
50.         The Administration Division includes four units, with responsibility for Finance, Human
Resources and Training, Materials and Supplies Procurement, and General Services, respectively.
Personnel from each area would be responsible for different aspects of administration of the GEF
project, and additional human resources would be needed to meet the temporary increase in demand
for financial and contracting services and for human resource development during the five-year
project period.

Research Grants Program
Need for Systematic Research and Genetic Resource Conservation
1.         The conservation of the biological diversity of the Indonesian biota is a clear goal of
GOI (BAPPENAS, 1991; KLH, 1992). For this goal to be accomplished, it is essential that the
biology of the indigenous species be thoroughly understood. The scientific staff of PPPB need to take
the lead in studying the systematics of key taxa at all taxonomic levels. Subsumed within that goal is
the need to maintain diversity within animal, fungal, microbial, and plant species, i.e., genetic
diversity. Genetic diversity provides the resources necessary for selective breeding of domesticated
and potentially domesticated species, and low levels of genetic diversity place taxa at risk in the face
of habitat destruction. Genetic diversity may be manifest as subspecies and varieties or as
polymorphisms within species. The study of genetic diversity is dependent upon strong, well-curated
biological collections and associated specimen-based information systems. Computerization and
sharing of collection data enhance the management of a collection and its use. However, levels of
diversity and its significance have not been thoroughly studied, especially in tropical settings. For the
information archived within these databases to have maximum utility in conservation, it must be
translated through active research programs.
2.          Accordingly, PPPB is sponsoring a competition for collections-based research on
systematic biology and genetic resource conservation on important taxa of the Indonesian biota.
Proposals will be solicited once a year, with a specific deadline for application. Three ad hoc
reviewers will review and critique the proposals concerning the proposal's scientific merit and
whether it meets the research grant program criteria, and complete a brief review form. A Review
Panel convened by the Project Manager will review the proposals and the evaluations of reviewers.
Membership of the Panel will be experts in biodiversity from both inside and outside PPPB. Written
evaluations and recommendations of the Review Panel will be considered by the Project Manager,
who will make recommendations for funding to the Steering Committee. Each of the Principal
Investigators that have obtained a research grant shall enter into a contract with PPPB setting forth the
terms and conditions of the grant.
3.          The Project Manager will be responsible for monitoring scientific progress on any
awards and for ensuring that funds are disbursed and used for the purposes described in the research
proposal. Funds may be transferred between categories only through a written request from the
Principal Investigators to the Project Manager. Reasons for such transfers must be to enhance the
scientific value of the study. Monitoring will be via a series of year-end and project-end reports by
the Principal Investigators. PPPB would make provisions to adequately supervise all research which
is finalized after the project close.
4.         It is expected that the results of these investigations will be submitted for publication in
peer-reviewed, national and international journals.

Procedures and Criteria
Candidates for Graduate Degrees in Systematic Biology
1.         A crucial initiative in the GEF project would be to train graduate students in systematic
biology at overseas institutions3--either at a university or a museum associated with a university.
Selection of programs
2.   The taxa-focus of the scholarship programs (and associated selection of the appropriate
academic institution) should correspond to the overall project work plan priorities, as determined
during project inception. The project work plan should explicitly outline the relationship between the
focus of individual scholarship programs and the overall project work plan priorities.
3.   The period of instruction would normally last from two to four years and lead to an M.Sc. or
Ph.D. degree. Prior training in a foreign language, as appropriate, would be given in Indonesia.
4.    All overseas M.Sc. degree programs (or equivalent) should provide:
(a)  lectures, seminars and discussions on a broad spectrum of topics in systematic biology,
including molecular biology and computational biology;
(b)   a research project on a clearly defined problem relevant to the needs of Indonesia;
(c)  tutoring in writing technical research papers;
(d)   work study in museums or herbaria; and
(e)   opportunities for contact with a range of people in academia, libraries and museums--as
these people will provide the basis for future support.
5.         Where appropriate, this initial period of training would be followed by study for a Ph.D.
on the systematics of groups of organisms having high priority based on their conservation and
economic importance in Indonesia. It is expected that at least six of the graduate degrees would be at
the Ph.D. level. All local Ph.D. programs would include an overseas co-supervisor.
Recruitment and Selection of Candidates
6.         It is expected that individuals receiving this training would provide the focus for
systematic biology in Indonesia by the quality of their own research, the leadership they provide and
the stimulus given to new research students.
3 In some cases it may be desirable for a candidate to attend an Indonesian university, possibly with
an overseas co-supervisor.



ANNEX 3                                    - 86-
Part D
7.         Recruitment. About twelve new staff would be recruited through a nation-wide
advertised competition. Under existing Government regulations, graduate scholarships funded under
the GEF project would only be provided to new staff members after a minimum period of six months
probation and orientation within the institution. A small recruiting team of senior PPPB staff would
directly contact local and regional universities to solicit from members of the biology faculty
nominations of promising candidates from among the undergraduate population. Recruitment would
be carried out by means of exhaustive screening and interview.
8.         Selection. Current PPPB staff would be eligible to compete for the overseas
scholarships on an equal basis with the newly recruited staff. Standardized selection criteria for
overseas scholarships would be established a priori by the recruiting team in consultation with the
Project Manager and members of the Steering Committee, with advice as necessary from the TAG.
As a basic requirement, internal and external applicants should have graduated in botany, zoology or
an associated discipline and have some work experience. It would be vital that the candidates are
selected for their drive, determination and self-motivation, as well as their interest and aptitude to
proceed on to Ph.D. level research. It is expected that candidates for local and overseas Ph.D.
programs would first complete an M.Sc. program (or equivalent) at an overseas institution.
9.         PPPB would describe the resulting staff recruitment and scholarship selection criteria and
procedures in the initial project progress report.

Glossaries of Technical Terms
Need for Glossaries of Technical Terms
1.         Much of the scientific literature on the flora and fauna of Indonesia is written in English,
Dutch, and for zoology, German and French. There are presently no published Indonesian language
glossaries of technical terms in use in the systematic literature. Consequently, for non-specialist
Indonesian workers in the field of biodiversity research, much of the literature--including taxonomic
descriptions and identification keys--remains inaccessible.
Guidelines
2.         In the second though fourth year, the project would support the creation of a database of
technical terms used for the description of vascular plants and for the major groups of animals
(including at least terrestrial vertebrates, fish, insects and mollusks), with explanatory text in Bahasa
Indonesia. Where appropriate, the text would be illustrated with simple black and white drawings
that could be scanned into the database. At the end of the three-year period, printouts of the
glossaries would be produced using desk-top publishing methods. Electronic copies, which could be
updated and customized by users, would be distributed on request.
3.          The compilation work would be carried out by PPPB staff research and technical
illustrators, under the direction of a designated task coordinator who would report to the Project
Manager. The project would hire a full-time contract editor for three years, and obtain assistance as
necessary from specialists at Indonesian universities and overseas institutions. The editor would
require either a degree in biology or extensive experience of editing biological technical material, and
a knowledge of foreign languages.
4.          Funds are budgeted for the salary of the editor, ex gratia payments to contributors, and
hard-copy production and distribution costs.

Bibliographies of Key Systematic Works
Need for Bibliographies of Systematic Literature
1.         The scientific literature relating to the descriptions and names of Indonesian plants and
animals dates from the late eighteenth century through the present, and is scattered throughout
hundreds of periodicals and miscellaneous faunas and floras, many of which are not available in
Indonesia. It is therefore difficult--if not impossible--for Indonesian researchers in systematic biology
to determine what has already been published in their chosen field, and to locate appropriate
descriptions and identification aids. There is an urgent need for bibliographic research, at least on the
priority groups of plants and animals selected by PPPB for intensive study and collections
development. This need is particularly acute in the case of the zoological systematic literature, as it is
both more diverse and less well-documented than the corresponding botanical literature for the
Malesian region.
Guidelines
2.         In the second through fourth years, the project would support botanical and zoological
bibliographic studies on selected groups of plants and animals--corresponding to the groups targeted
as priorities in the setting of benchmarks for the first five to ten years. Since many of the key
reference works for this task are not available in Indonesia, a significant part of the work would need
to be carried out at the libraries associated with major herbariums and museums in Europe or North
America. The bibliographic references collected would be entered in a standard and consistent format
in a database, cross-referenced by taxonomic name and by author.
3.          Given the large amount of additional work and travel involved, it is anticipated that there
work would be a division of effort between PPPB research staff, short-term contract assistants and
overseas collaborators. It is anticipated that overseas collaboration would take place largely under the
aegis of existing arrangements within the Flora and Fauna Malesiana Projects. The task would be
coordinated by one staff member from Botany and one from Zoology, who would be designated by
the Project Manager and given overall responsibility for managing the project. Both coordinators
would require a good working knowledge of the basic systematic literature, and prior experience in
carrying out bibliographic library studies. In the fourth year of the project, a hard-copy version
would be produced by desk-top publishing and distributed on request. However, it would be
important that the database be maintained and updated by working systematists on the staff of PPPB,
who would use the resulting information as an integral tool for their research.
4.          The budget would provide for the contracting of up to six local assistants, foreign
collaborators, and library assistance overseas. It would also fund the cost of up to eighteen person-
months travel by Indonesian researchers to overseas institutions and libraries in order to consult
literature not available in Indonesia. It is important that this task be carried out in careful consultation
with the database design process, and use a field structure agreed upon at the database fields
workshop.

Computer Gazetteer of Indonesian Collecting Localities
Need for Computer Gazetteer
I.         In order to better understand the geographic distribution of species, and the spatial
relationships of Indonesian plants and animals populations to, say, topography or soils, it will be
necessary to translate specimen-based data into map-based data. To achieve this, the place name
associated with the collection locality--normally recorded as part of the specimen label information--
must be linked to a set of geographical coordinates. This process would enable the specimen-based
proposed PPPB database to be interfaced with GIS mapping programs, greatly increasing the power
and flexibility of the resulting biodiversity information system.
2.         However, in the Indonesian context, many of the historical collecting localities of
specimens in the Bogor collections have been recorded under place names which have since changed
or which were incompletely or ambiguously recorded. To compensate for this situation it will be
necessary to carefully research old maps and printed gazetteers, and to refer to original accounts of
collecting expeditions where available.
3.         To facilitate accurate and rapid specimen data entry, it is essential to develop a computer
file of commonly-used place names, with standard spellings, and associate these with carefully
checked coordinates. This file would provide a pick-list of options for the data entry operator, who
would only enter a new locality name after all known variants had been eliminated.
Guidelines
4.          Funds are provided in the second year to assist with the process of compiling a computer
gazetteer of known Indonesian collecting localities. The budget would cover only limited honoraria
and salaries of local staff, plus the cost of ad hoc materials such as maps and printed publications.
Two or more persons with an extensive knowledge of Indonesian geography, possibly contracted from
university or from other government agencies, would be needed to carry out this work under the
direction of a PPPB staff member designated by the Project Manager. The cost of procuring overseas
assistance, should this be necessary, is not covered in the budget. It is important that this task be
carried out in careful consultation with the database design process, and use a field structure agreed
upon at the database fields workshop.

Identification Manuals
Need for Identification Manuals
1.         To date, less than a quarter of the species of Indonesian plants, and probably less than a
tenth of Indonesian animals, have been scientifically described in floras, faunas and systematic
monographs. This means that, for the large majority of Indonesian biodiversity, identification keys
are not available. For workers in applied fields such as foresters, agricultural entomologists, and
ecologists, who do not have ready access to large reference collections and extensive libraries, there
is no convenient way to identify most organisms in the field.
2.          New computer software facilitates taxonomic coding, then produces automated, multiple-
access keys that use everyday language in written descriptions and can include computer-generated
illustrations. This makes it quick and efficient to generate both interactive computer and hard-copy
keys to aid the user in the identification process.
Guidelines
3.         In the fourth and fifth year the project would support the pilot production of one
botanical and one zoological identification manual to selected groups. Selection would be based on
user need and the need to chose groups that are neither too large nor too taxonomically complex.
4.          In the fourth year, a training workshop would be arranged for PPPB staff to learn a
suitable software package (such as DELTA, produced by CSIRO, Canberra), including the provision
of overseas trainers. Two work groups would be set up, one in Botany and one in Zoology, under
the direction of coordinators designated by the Project Manager. The coordinators should have
extensive systematic research experience and a good working knowledge of their chosen plant or
animal group. The work groups would be composed of two or three junior systematic staff who,
under the supervision of the coordinators, would use the Bogor collections and literature--
supplemented as necessary with loan material from overseas--to produce computer keys and hard-copy
descriptions and keys to their selected groups. Assistance from international specialists would be
sought as required, but any associated cost is not included in the budget.
5.         The products would be published, as appropriate, in the scientific literature.
6.         The budget covers the cost of an in-house training workshop, including the travel costs
and honorarium of an overseas trainer, plus honoraria for up to six PPPB staff and miscellaneous
production costs.

Field Guides
Need for Field Guides
1.         The need for simple guidebooks to Indonesian national parks was identified in the
Biodiversitv Action Plan (BAPPENAS, 1991), and further reiterated in discussions between PPPB and
PHPA. At present, most of the available information on Indonesian biodiversity is in the form of
specialized taxonomic monographs, written in English, Dutch, French or German, and often published
in obscure scientific journals. Visitors to national parks need non-specialist illustrated guidebooks to
the major groups of interesting plants and animals, written in Bahasa Indonesia. With geographic
scope of the publication limited to a single well-defined locality, the reader is not faced with the
problem of separating closely-related species which do not naturally occur in the same area, when
identifying an unknown organism.
Guidelines
2.          The production of guidebooks would be carried out on a pilot scale in the fourth and
fifth years of the project. The first phase would require a field survey of Gunung Haliman National
Park. Clearly-defined groups, such as birds, butterflies, mammals, trees, orchids or ferns, would be
selected for this purpose. Two six-week periods of fieldwork would be carried out by up to twenty
botanists, zoologists and technicians from PPPB, with assistance as appropriate from NGO volunteers
such as the Biological Science Club. Collections of unidentified plants, invertebrates and small
mammals would be made at this time, together with color photographs of the living organisms.
3.         In the second phase, checklists would be constructed for the selected groups--based on
field observations and collections, but also supplemented by records from earlier collections. Species
for inclusion in the guides would be selected on the basis of conservation and ecological importance,
as well as general interest and visual appeal. Detailed descriptions from scientific publications would
be edited for non-specialist readers and supplemented with illustrations and photographs.
4.          As far as possible, production of the guides would be kept technically simple and low-
cost, using desk-top publishing methods and camera-ready copy. It might be desirable to adopt a
booklet or ring-bound format that could readily be supplemented in future as guides to new groups
became available.
5.          The Project Manager would designate a coordinator on the PPPB staff for each group
of organisms to be covered in the guide. The coordinators should have a specialist knowledge and
prior field-collecting and research experience for their group. The assistance of international
systematic specialists would be sought as required (but any additional cost involved is not included in
the budget). A professional copy-editor, with prior experience with natural history publications,
would be contracted to assist with the final editing and production of the guides.
6.          The budget covers the cost of local travel, fieldwork and miscellaneous collecting and
photographic supplies, plus the cost of publication which includes the temporary services of the copy-
editor.

-115 -                                 ANNEX 6
Design of Work Plan Goals
Project Goals
1.         The proposed project would support the initial five-year segment of a 25-year GOI effort
to meet the increasing need for scientific information on biodiversity. Of the overall goals, the urgent
priority and the focus of the first five years is to strengthen the capacity of PPPB to handle
biodiversity information.
2.         The mission of PPPB, as it relates to biodiversity information, is to develop systematic
research collections and to develop and disseminate associated specimen-based information. Useful
working collections are the necessary basis for research on subjects including systematic biology,
ethnobiology as it relates to the study of other biota with economic potential, conservation biology,
and ecology.
3.          During the project's five years, benefits to external clients would be limited. Because of
the current condition of PPPB's collections and PPPB's existing capacity, the project would focus on
internal institutional development. Measurable services and products for external clients would be
limited in scope and achieved only in the later years of the project. Nevertheless, an explicit policy
framework, realistic and meaningful benchmarks, and specific user products would enable PPPB to
demonstrate, if only on a small scale, current and potential benefits of project investments to external
clients and to possible funding sources. The policy framnework, benchmarks, and user products would
also establish the technical design for further developments in biodiversity information after the
project period. Together, the policy framework, benchmarks, and user products would establish the
basis for monitoring and evaluating project impact.
Policy Framework
4.         The project design therefore includes a process in the first year that would define the
overall policy framework. During project inception, the Project Management Committee and PPPB
work groups, with advice if necessary from the Technical Advisory Group, would formulate an
overall institutional policy framework, modeled in simplified form on the Agricultural Research
Policy Statement developed for the World Bank's Agricultural Research Management Project and
comparable exercises as appropriate. This policy framework would define: (a) criteria for
determining PPPB's biodiversity information activities which would receive corresponding resource
allocation; (b) organization and management of these activities; (c) external linkages and
conmmunication; and (d) operational financing for PPPB's biodiversity information.
Work Plan Benchmarks
5.         The project design also includes steps to define specific benchmarks in curation
standards and database goals. These benchmarks would be set in the context of the policy framework
and be subject to review by the User Advisory Group.
6.         Curation Standards. Under the project, PPPB would take definitive steps toward
international curation standards. PPPB has already determined overall benchmarks for the physical
condition of its collections. In twenty-five years, PPPB aims to achieve 100 percent international
curation standards (e.g., restoration of all specimens that are seriously deteriorating--to the extent this
is economically and physically feasible--and establishment of climate control. Selected from this
overall goal, five-year benchmarks consist of:



ANNEX 6                                   -116 -
(a)   consolidating and integrating the (largely zoological) marine collections belonging to
PPPB with the collections belonging to PPPB;
(b)   restoring 100 percent wet zoological collections to international curation standards;
(c)   sorting and transferring the dry entomological collections to modular unit trays;
(d)   remounting and restoring 200,000 'at risk' dry botanical specimens restored;
(e)   replacing 100 percent of the species and genus covers in the dry botanical collections
with archival quality materials;
(f)   systematically freezing the whole dry botanical collection at -20- C for three days to kill
insect pests and their eggs and larvae;
(g)   restoring the wet specimens for orchids, gingers, and Rafflesia; and
(h)  transferring 100 percent of dry botanical and zoological collections to adequate, insect-
proof metal cabinets.
During project inception, the Project Management Committee and PPPB work groups, with advice if
necessary from the TAG, would determine the semi-annual benchmarks needed to reach the five-year
project goals.
7.         This improvement in curation standards is critical. Unless immediate measures are taken
to restore large numbers of specimens that are deteriorating under tropical conditions, the Center's
extensive historical collections will shortly sustain irreparable damage, and large amounts of valuable
biodiversity information will be lost. In economic terms, it is four to twenty times more cost-efficient
to capture biodiversity information from the existing collections than to collect new data from the
field.
8.         Taxa Priorities for Database Work Plan. PPPB would determine the taxa-specific work
program priorities for specimen-based data entry by taking into account estimated levels of accuracy
of the collections information, extent of species and geographical coverage of the collections, and
incremental costs and benefits of improvements. This determination of specific work program
priorities by taxa would require careful consideration and expert advice. During project inception,
appropriate PPPB staff, the Technical Advisory Team, and taxa specialists would participate in a
workshop which would set realistic benchmarks for taxa categories. The workshop would base work
program priorities on a matrix which illustrates the status and importance of PPPB's collections
information. This matrix would include rough measures of the status of collections information
specifying accuracy, species representation, and geographical representation, on a scale of 1 to 3
(1= high or numerous relative to total for specified taxa, 2=medium or patchy, and 3=low or
scarce), for years 0, 5, and 25. Taxa categories would be broad or narrow as appropriate. The
matrix would also include a ranking on scale of 1 to 3 for incremental costs and values, with 1 =low
cost or high value, 2 = medium, and 3 = high cost or low value. Once five-year benchmarks are
determined, PPPB work groups would set corresponding semi-annual benchmarks.
9.          Database Goals. Twenty-five-year goals for the database include:
(a)  fields of information for taxa in work program to meet internal and external needs;



-117 -                                  ANNEX 6
(b)   100 percent of data keyed into PPPB database, including quality control and
maintenance;
(c)   database upgraded as technical developments warrant; and
(d)   PPPB database fully integrated in national database.
Five-year goals include having well-functioning fields of information that meet internal and external
needs for taxa in work program. They also include developing a crucial part of the scientific and
institutional foundation for a national biodiversity information system. Fields of information for the
specimen-based database would be designed to meet internal and external needs over the long term.
During project inception, a workshop of PPPB staff, the Technical Advisory Group, and an expert in
data field definition, would determine standardized fields of information.
Products for External Clients
10.         Products for external clients would be based on and mostly limited to the selected taxa.
These products might include preliminary species lists, measures of abundance and distribution,
identification reference tools and services, biota resource management strategies, field guides, biotic
resource prospecting, and identification of geological indicator species. The User Advisory Group
would review the list of planned products for external clients. These products would be limited in
scope and available only in later years of the project. It will be important to keep project goals
realistic and expectations limited. The following paragraphs illustrate the range of products possible
within the next 25 years; products in the first 5 years would be selected from this list.
I1.         Protected Area Management and Environmental Assessment. Products relevant to
protected area management and environmental assessment include:
(a)   analysis of information in database (e.g., preliminary species list, measure of abundance
and distribution, identification of threatened and endangered species)
(b)   collections as a reference source for identification needed in inventory and monitoring
(including a specimen identification service);
(c)   staff expertise as a reference source not available at regional level; and
(d)   training.
12.        Biotic Resource Management. Products relevant to biotic resource management include
these products. In addition, PPPB would be able to analyze its database information to develop a
species-based genetic resource management strategy, in 25 years identifying a range of target taxa and
implementing conservation strategies. In 5 years, PPPB would be able to develop and help to
implement a conservation strategy for bamboo and a few other selected taxa.
13.        Conservation Promotion. Products relevant to conservation promotion include field
guides for national parks.
14.         Ethnobiology and Research on Economic Biota. Products relevant to ethnobiology and
research on other economic biota include:



ANNEX 6                                     -118 -
(a)   biotic resource prospecting;
(b)   identification and use of geological indicator species; and
(c)   collection of disappearing ethnobiological information.
15.         Environmental Planning. Products relevant to environmental planning, including spatial
planning and valuation, include provision of database information including species distribution and
ethnobiological and economic traits.

Notes on the Preparation Process of the Project
Origin of the Project
1.         For a number of years there has been growing concern--both within PPPB and in the
wider biological community--regarding the urgent need to renovate and safeguard the scientifically
invaluable collections of PPPB's Botany and Zoology Divisions. The national and international
importance of these collections, as the principal reference source for information on the fauna and
flora of Indonesia, was clearly recognized in the Biodiversity Action Plan for Indonesia (BAPPENAS
1991), which called for further investment in biodiversity collections restoration, maintenance and
development.
2.          The Biodiversity Action Plan "Project Profile #21 ", "Development of Systematic
Resources for Biodiversity Inventory", specifically recommnended the following actions:
(a)   Training for new systematic biologists and curatorial staff;
(b)  Improved facilities for the processing and storage of biological collections;
(c)   A computer data management and retrieval system;
(d)   An expanded collection program; and
(e)   A network of international collaboration for the exchange of data, specimens and
scientific reference material.
Administrative Arrangements
3.         In September, 1991, following a joint reconnaissance mission by the World
Bank/UNDP, GOI submitted a request for funds under the GEF Project Preparation Facility (PRIF) to
prepare a three-part project including a "Biodiversity Collections" component.
4.         Based on the outline provided in the Biodiversity Action Plan, PPPB subsequently
submitted an expanded concept paper, prepared with the assistance of the Arnold Arboretum of
Harvard University and the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, two of the participating agencies
identified in the original "Project Profile".
5.         Following UNDP approval of the PRIF in April, 1992, a Bank preparation start-up
mission visited Indonesia in June, 1992, to finalize the details of the preparation arrangements with
GOI. At this time it was agreed by GOI that the Arnold Arboretum would continue to take the lead
in coordinating the provision of technical assistance to PPPB in the preparation of the project.



ANNEX 7                                   - 122 -
Preparation
6.         In August and early September, 1992, a team of five consultants4 (including botany,
zoology and microbiology institutions specialists, and team leader) visited Indonesia for five weeks to
assist with PPPB with the preparation of the project. Over this period an intensive survey of existing
collections, facilities and staff resources at PPPB, and an informal survey of "user need" was carried
out.
7.         The process of user need consultation included meetings with representatives of
BAPPENAS; the (former) Ministry of State for Population and Environment; Ministry of Forestry
(PHPA and Forest Research Institute); Ministry of Agriculture (Institute for Medicinal Plants and
Spices Research); Plant Resources of Southeast Asia (PROSEA) project; Southeast Asian Regional
Center for Tropical Biology (SEAMO BIOTROP); Universities (University of Indonesia and
University of Pattimura, Ambon); LIPI (Center for Scientific Documentation and Information (PDII),
Research and Development Center for Limnology, Research and Development Center for
Oceanology, National Botanic Gardens); and various conservation NGOs (WAHLI, LATIN,
Biological Sciences Club, Asian Wetland Bureau, World Wildlife Fund, International Council for Bird
Preservation).
8.         The July, 1992, version of the Project Concept Document was reviewed, and a draft
management plan prepared in the form of a workshop discussion document. Topics covered in the
report included:
(a)   Human resource development;
(b)   Restoration and stabilization of collections;
(c)   Facilities upgrading and increasing capacity;
(d)  Introduction of a computer information system;
(e)  Institutional linkages with users;
(f)  International scientific cooperation; and
(g)   Proposed management plans for Botany, Zoology and Microbiology.
Workshop
9.         A three-day, international workshop, attended by about sixty persons, was held at the
beginning of September, 1992, at which the draft report was presented and feedback sought from
participants. A list of agencies and organizations represented at the workshop is attached. The first
day consisted of a tour of collections and research facilities at PPPB, Bogor.

Soegiarto, (then) Deputy Chairman for Natural Sciences, LIPI:
(a)  Introduction and background to GEF-Biodiversity Collections project; overview of draft
management plans for Botany, Zoology and Microbiology;
(b)   Perspectives of GOI agencies and NGOs; and
(c)   Perspectives of the international scientific community.
11.        On the third day, the workshop split into three working groups for Botany, Zoology and
Microbiology, followed by a plenary session. Discussion topics included:
(a)   Priorities for the development of systematic biology in Indonesia (including inventory,
collections, human resources, and information systems and management);
(b)   Coordination of systematic research with conservation and development needs;
(c)   National and international collaboration by PPPB with other research, conservation and
development organizations.
Follow-up and Reporting
12.        In August, 1993, a draft Preparation Report was completed by PPPB, with assistance
from the consultant team. This was subsequently approved by BAPPENAS on November 2, 1993.
13.        The project proposal was reviewed by a World Bank preappraisal mission, which visited
Indonesia November 9 - December 1, 1993, and several changes in project content were agreed with
PPPB and BAPPENAS. These changes were incorporated in a final version of the Preparation
Report.
14.        On the recommnendation of the preappraisal mission, PPPB held a further workshop on
January 10, 1993, to enable potential users to comment on the revised project proposal. In addition
to Government agencies and NGOs with an interest in biodiversity conservation, PPPB invited
representatives of the private sector, including Indonesian pharmaceutical firms, manufacturers of
traditional medicine (Jamu), forestry, agricultural, mining and energy companies, and consultants
specializing in environmental impact assessment. The inclusion of private sector interests in the
consultative process, including the proposed User Advisory Group, would be expected to lay the
groundwork for future studies on the sustainable management of biological resources, and promote
linkages between commercial users and the proposed biodiversity information network.

- 127 -                                ANNEX 8
Future Developments and Funding Opportunities
Introduction
1.         Through human resource development, collections development, and improved data
entry and management methods, the proposed project would lay the institutional foundation for a
national biodiversity information network in Indonesia. However, to maximize the benefits to
Indonesian biodiversity conservation, it would be desirable to support a number of complementary
activities which would be synergistic to the present GEF project component (see Figure 1).
Human Resource Development
2.          It is estimated (see para 3.9) that an approximately twenty-five- to thirty-fold increase in
the number of Indonesian trained systematic researchers will be necessary over the next decade. This
might best be achieved through the methodical recruitment of new systematic biologists from a
national pool of talented biology students in their senior undergraduate years at public and private
universities throughout Indonesia. A small team of recruiters would travel to provincial universities
on an annual basis to interview and test prospective candidates. This would be followed by a rigorous
procedure to identify the best candidates on the basis of their aptitude, academic records, desire to
train as systematists, and the recommendations of their university mentors. The final selection
decision would be made by a panel of leading Indonesian scientific educators and researchers.
3.         Once the finalists had been awarded scholarships to study overseas, a period of intensive
language training would follow. Candidates for higher degrees would be placed at institutions with a
prior track record of scientific collaboration and research in Indonesia, which could best offer training
compatible with the research priorities of Indonesia. The performance of both the student and the
academic institution in which they were placed would be carefully monitored.
4.         In the longer term, the capacity of Indonesian universities to train systematic researchers
should be strengthened. As an intermediate step, however, candidates for higher degrees could be co-
supervised in Indonesia by both local and foreign faculty.
Provincial Inventory and Monitoring Programs
5.         The majority of Indonesia's biodiversity occurs in the forests and reefs of the outer
islands. To inventory and monitor these areas more effectively, it would be desirable to set up
regional centers with access to local systematic expertise and biological reference collections. In most
instances these centers would probably be closely associated with the regional universities, and they
would play an important role in biodiversity education, inventory, research, and local planning and
land management. The regional centers would in turn be supported by the National Centers for
Systematic Biology (see para 3.5) in Bogor. The rapid and efficient exchange of information and
specimens between Bogor and the regional centers would require a national network of databases for
biodiversity and environmental information management.
Databasing Biodiversity Information
6.         It is known to be much more cost-effective to capture biodiversity information from
existing biological collections than to collect information de novo from the field. Investment is
required to enable the entry of selected data from the labels of up to 1.5 to 2 million specimens at the
national herbarium and zoology museum, and to validate, edit and manage this information in an
electronic format.



ANNEX 8                                   - 128 -
National Biodiversity Information Network
7.         The development of a National Biodiversity Information Network has been proposed (see
paragraph 3.15) that will serve to integrate biodiversity information with other environmental data,
and disseminate functional information products in a number of user-friendly formats to a wide range
of users.
Small Grants Program
8.         The development of a long-term facility to competitively award small grants to
Indonesian researchers is required that would enable them to:
(a)   attend overseas scientific meetings and conferences;
(b)   study at overseas libraries and collections; and
(c)   undertake local inventory and monitoring, and carry out individual systematic research
and collection development projects.
9.         One option, which recently has been explored in the context of a proposed joint GOL-
US-Japan Biodiversity Conservation Project, would be to set up an independent trust fund to generate
sustainable annual revenue for this purpose.
Regional Systematic Research
10.        A sound knowledge of the fauna and flora of Indonesia will only be possible through the
study of geographic variation within and between species over the whole region. This process was
begun in 1950 with the initiation of the Flora Malesiana project, the scope of which includes
Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines and Malaysia. The project, which has so far published
around ten volumes covering approximately fifteen to twenty percent of the flora, is an international
cooperative effort based on the voluntary collaboration of large numbers of systematic botanists
around the world. A complementary Fauna Malesian project, which was launched around 1988, is
still in the early stages of development and has the potential to fill the same role as the Flora.
11.        Both of these initiatives are likely to make important future contributions to the scientific
study of the biota of Indonesia, and will complement research carried out at the herbarium and the
zoological museum. However, the long time scale presently envisaged for completion of the Flora5
and Fauna are not commensurate with the needs of conservation. An injection of funds would make a
major impact in speeding up the rate of production.
International Scientific Cooperation
12.        Progress in strengthening institutional resources for systematic biology in Indonesia
would be enhanced through strong international scientific cooperation. Many of the basic resources
for systematic research--historical collections and libraries, and specialist expertise--are only available
at a few overseas institutions. To make these resources more widely accessible to Indonesian
5 At the present rate of progress, the Flora Malesiana would not be completed until the year 2250.
The Fauna--which unless strictly selective in the groups covered, could include several orders of
magnitude more species than the Flora--would not be completed in the foreseeable future.

researchers and students, a series of sister institutional relationships between Indonesian and overseas
organizations could be sponsored through bilateral agreements. To be fully sustainable, such support
should take into account the full economic cost of scientific collaboration and not depend upon an
'invisible' subsidy by one of the participating institutions.
Identification Aids
13.        The most important single factor limiting the rate of biodiversity inventory and
monitoring in Indonesia is a lack of trained systematic biologists (paragraph 2.9). Specialist expertise
in many systematic groups is limited, worldwide, to one or two persons. It would therefore be a
great advantage if this expertise could be made more widely accessible to non-specialists, such as
foresters, agriculturalists and ecologists who need a reliable way to identify organisms in the field.
The recent development of "expert systems" for biological identification provides the means to
construct PC-based, interactive, multiple-entry keys, with images of the important characters used to
differentiate between taxa. Support is required to bring together small groups of world experts to
"capture" their knowledge into an electronic format that can readily be distributed to PC users, or
printed out in the form of inexpensive 'desk-top published' hard-copy.
Checklists
14.         Basic working checklists of the names of species published in the scientific literature are
an essential precursor to both inventory and systematic research. These are urgently needed by
researchers in Indonesia, where even a rough estimate of the number of species present is not yet
available.6
Genome Bank of Indonesian Wildlife
15.        Molecular techniques are becoming increasingly important in assessing the viability of
populations of animals conserved by ex situ methods. The development of appropriate technical
resources to maintain genome banks and measure genetic variation will probably be essential if ex situ
populations of rare and endangered species, or even in situ populations with highly restricted ranges,
are to be maintained for indefinite periods.
Surveys of Plant Genetic Diversity
16.        The development of strategies for the in situ and ex situ conservation of genetic diversity
of selected plant taxa is of critical importance for long-term sustainable management of biological
resources for forestry, agriculture and pharmacognosy. Integral to this task is the ability to survey
genetic variation both within and between populations of the target taxa. There is a need to develop
Indonesian capacity to sample and elucidate genetic variation, using a range of morphological,
isozyme and molecular techniques, and to implement pilot projects for a range of high-priority woody
plant groups.
6 The best available estimate of the number of flowering plant species in the Malesian region
increased from 25,000 in 1989 to nearly 40,000 in 1992.
