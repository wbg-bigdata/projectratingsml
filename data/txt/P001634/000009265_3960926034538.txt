NORTHERN TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMHNRY
Borrowers                Republic of Malawi
Executina Asencv:        Ministry of Transport and Comunuications, Ministry
of Works and Supplies, and malwi Railways
Amounts                  SDR 11.1 million (3$13.4 million equivalent)
Termas                   Standard IDA Terms
Proiect Descriptions     The main objective of the project is to provide a
shorter and cost effective route to the sea for
Malawian Imports and exports by Improving the
Northern Transport Corridor (NTC) leading from
southern Malawi to the port of Dar es Salaam. The
project would also facilitate the expansion of
regional trade, principally between Malawi and
Tanzania and help develop Malawi's northern
region. The project includes improvement and
.ehabilitation of roads in Malawi and Tanzania;
construction of dry-cargo and fuel storage
transshipment facilities in Dar es Salaam and
Mbeya in Tanzaniat provision of fuel tank wagons
and tank containers to be used by TAZARA railway;
improvement of shipping services on Lake Malawi;
construction of a border post and weighing station
on the Malawi-Tansania border; and related
consultancies and technical assistance.  The
project would benefit the entire population of
Malwi through lower prices on a wide variety of
Imported products and through increased exports
brought about by more competitive export prices.
Risks:                   Possible risks includes (i) transit delays due to
possible procedural or other disagreements between
the two countries; and (ii) reduction in traffic
volume on NTC due to earlier than anticipated
opening of traditional routes to the sea. The
risk of transit delays has been minimized through
a bilateral transit agreement between the two
countries, covering transit procedures (signed on
August 15, 1987). In terms of the impact of
earlier opening of the traditional routes, NTC
will continue to remain cost competitive and
economically viablo for import and export traffic
for the northern and central regions of Malawi.

I, The TranaMort Sector
A. Transport and the General Economy
1.01      Males" is a landlocked nation dependent on a number of neighboring
countries f.or access to the sea. Historically, this access has been mainly
through Mosambique but transport difficulttes in recent years (para. 2.02)
have caused Malawi to divert traffic to the much longer and more costly
routes through other countries of the region. This problem has focussed
attention on improving access through a more economical northern transport
corridor (NTC), through Tanzania, with consequent substantial savings in
transport cost to Malawi.
1.02      Malawi is a long, narrow country with a land area of about 94,30O)
km2 and a lake area of 24,200 km2 (see Map IBRD 19422). The lake on the
eastern side of the country, some 600 km long, is important as a means of
transport and has considerable potential for further transport use. A major
escarpment runs th* length of Malawi, separating the lake plain from the
plateau to the west; altitudes range from 60 m above sea level in the
southern Shire Valley to over 2,500 a in the northern plateau. Rainfall
averages between 750 mm and 1,600 mu and Is relatively heavy in the plateau
areas.
1.03      Economic development of Nalawi, which has a rapidly growing (2.9X
p.a.) population of 7.15 million, was heavily concentrated, prior to 1970,
in the southern part of the country where nearly three-fourths of the
population lives. In 1971, the Government announced In a Statement of
Development Policies that high priority vould be given to achieving more
balanceb regional development. To this end, it moved the administrative
capital from Zomba in the south to Lilongwe In the Central Region, and has
undertaken several agricultural projects in the northern half of the
country, including major projects near Lilongwe, Salima and Karonga and
smaller projects around Kasungu and Mi4mba. The road network Is also being
upgraded in the Central and Northern regions, and further developmwnt in
these areas Is underway and planned. Since almost 90S of the population
lives in rural areas, and agriculture contributes over 90X of Malawi's
exports, rural development is a primary economic and social objective.
Notwithstanding the greater regional balance that has been achieved,
Blantyre in the Southern Region remains the leading commercial center of
Malawi.
1.04      Gross domestic product increased in real terms at the rate of 6.0%
per year over the period 1975-80. In 1980 and 1981 Malawi met with serious
difficulties due to world economic condition and GDP contracted by 61 over
those two years. Since 1982, recovery has been underway, with growth
averaging 3.21 through 1985. Per capita GNP was an estimated US$170 in
1985, and Malawi is classified by the United Nations as one of the least
developed countries of the world.

B. The Transport System
1.05      The transport system Includes an Infrastructure of about 13,300 km
of roads, 678 km of railway lines, 4 lake harbors and a number of lake
landing points, and 4 commercial airports. In addition, the system includes
about 29,000 road vehicles, 51 locomotives, 906 railway freight wagons and
passenger coaches, 11 lake vessels and a variety of commercial aircraft.
The principal features of this system ares a main road network of about
2,900 km concentrated-in the south but including an important link to the
north; the railway which lies entirely in the southern half of the country;
lake transport serving mainly as a north-south link; and air transport
handling principally domestic and regional passenger traffic. Road haulage
dominates internal transport. The railway, until recent yearst, carried
substantial amounts of export-import traffic between various Malawi points
and two Hosambique border transfer stations; this traffic has voaished,
however, because of closure of the Mosambique rail lines linked to the
Malawi railway. As a result of this disruption, Malawi's external trade
since mid-1985 has moved on other routes, particularly through Zambia,
Zimbabwe and the Republic of South Africa (RSA) (IBRD Map 19421).
Highway and Road Transport
1.06      The 13,300 km classified road network consists of 2,520 km of
paved roads (192) and 390 km of engineered gravel roads (32); the rest are
earth roads and tracks. In addition, there are about 2,000 km of as yet
unclassified feeder and crop extraction roads constructed to minimum all-
weather standard under agricultural development projects and an undetermined
length of additional unclassified earth roads and tracks in forestry
plantations and reserves and in national parks. Road density is about 141
km per 1,000 sq km or 2 km per 1,000 inhabitants which is above average for
East African tountries. The coverage is adequate for the country's present
needs, but road standards and conditions are not satisfactory. Although
some improvements have been made, principally by upgrading roads to paved
qtandard (712 increase in kilometers during 1975-84), low standard roads
pitvail, resulting in high transport costs. About 852 of tho paved and
improved roads are located in the southern half of the country, reflecting
the general pattern of regional imbalance in population and economic
activity.
1.07      The principal cities sad towns are connected by main roads and
about three-fourths of these roads are paved. During recent years,
construction of paved roads has concentrated on the 1,100 km north-south
spine road, the most important road in Malawi, running from Bangula In the
deep south via Blantyre and Lilongwe to Karonga in the far north. The only
remaining unpaved section is that between Champhoyo and Mbowe (50 km) which
is scheduled for completion by 1989 based on financing from the Africean
Development Bank (LfDB). Government is also undertaking rehabilitation of
other roads under the Bank's Fifth Highway Project (Loan 2363/Credits 1423
and SF-6-MAI). Further road rehabilitation is included in the present
project with work specified for the Balaka-Salima road, an important link
between the Blantyre area and the principal lake port of Chipoka.
1.08      The completion of the north-south spine road, which has been the
centerpiece of the Government's paved roads program, will mark a beginning



of a new strategy of expanding its paved roads network. The new paved roads
construction program for 1988189 being considered by the Government
indicates the strategy will be to upgrade roads which run parallel to the
north-south spine road and also to begin constructing east-west links
cutting across the country. The basic trade movement continues to be north-
south, with relatively riinor east-west traffic movement much of which
connects with the splne road or moves to Nchinji or Nwansa, the main outlets
to Zambis and Mosambique. Each new construction project will need to be
evaluated on its own-merit, but given the expected completion of the north-
south spine road, new policy direction as well as a standard method of
prioritizing various investments will need to be developed. The Association
is assisting the Government in this regard through the preparation of a
proposed First Infrastructure Project. Apart from the new construction
program, the Government will also continue its paved and unpaved roads
rehabilitation program with a view to eliminating the backlog of
rehabilitation works required on its network. Periodic and routine
maintenance programs are executed in a systematic and timely manner, and the
quality of the work is good.
1.09      The road vehicle fleet in 1984, excluding motorcycles, totalled
28,568 or 4 vehl-les per 1,000 inhabitants, above average for East Africa.
The fleet includes 10,673 goods vehicles, 14,431 passenger cars, 1,067 buses
and 2,397 other vehicles. More than two-thirds of the goods vehicles have
less than a 3-ton carrying capacity. Only 32 of the goods vehicles, mainly
owned by companies involved in international movement of freight, have more
than a 10-ton capacity and truck-trailer combinations are common on the main
routes. The great majority of trucks are owned by various private (75
percent of fleet) and public agencies (18 percent of fleet) for transport of
their own goods. Among transport companies hiring out their trucks, about
470 companies operate an aggregate fleet of some 1,400 trucks of 3-ton or
more capacity. More than 602 of these trucks are owned by small operators,
and 341 by 9 large operators with over 30 vehicles each. The average size
of the for-hiro fleet operated by small companies is 3 vehicles with an
average capacity of 7 tons, compared to 9 tons operated by large companies.
In addition to domestic truck operators there are a considerable number of
foreign operators transporting freight between centers within Malawi
particularly Blantyre and Lilongwe, on the one hand and foreign points such
as Lusaka, Harare, Durban and Dar es Salaam, on the other hand.
Railways
1.10      The main railway line extends from the southern border northward
through Blantyr- to Lake Malawi and then westward through Lilongwe to the
Zambian border. At the soutiarn border this line is linked to the
Mozambique rail line serving the port of Beira. An extension of the Malawi
railway to the eastern border is connected to the Mozambique rail line
serving the port of Nacala. Rehabilitation of the southern part of the
Malawi railway has been underway during the last several years with 8ritish
aid and is expected to be completed in 1988. The 1979 extension westward
from Salima to the Zambian border (210 km), financed by a grant from the
Canadian Government, will soon be furthor extonded to Chipata in Zambia
(about 25 km). Linking Malawi railway with the Zambian railway system would
require a costly construction of 390 km of track and such a project is
unlikely in the foreseeable future.



-4-
1.11      The railway's rolling stock, which in 1984 comprised 51
locomotives, 752 freight wagons and 79 tank wagons, handled a high
proportion of MC -St's exports and imports until recent years; this Included
nearly all of Malawi's Imports of o4troleum products. Traffic carried on
the railway In 1984 amounted to sbout 586 thousand tons of freight or about
121 million ton-km. Ralilway freight traffic in 1984 was only half the level
of 1980. This sharp traffic decline Is explained largely by the drop in
exports and imports handled by Malawi Railways (MR) between points in Malawi
and the Mozambique border as performance on the Mo2ambique rail lines
deteriorated. In contrast to freight traffic trends, the number of
passengers carried on the railway increased to 1.6 million in 1984, the
highest level ever attained. Until 1982, railway operations earned a modest
surplus but incurred sizeable losses in the years 1983-1986, due mainly to
the closure of Mozambique lines leading to ports of Beira and Nacala.
Lake Transport
1.12      Relatively little has been done thus far to realize the large
potential of Lake Malawi as a means of transport.  Freight and passtnger
transport on Lake Malawi is provided by a division of MR, Lake Service (LS).
The system includes not only a fleet of vessels but also a complex of 21
ports and landing points. Chipoka port is the only one served by the
railway; the ports of Chilumba, Nkhata Bay and Monkey Bay are served by main
roads. Construction of a new jetty at Dwangwa was begun in 1984, primarily
for sugar shipments. The lake vessel fleet consists of 3 passenger/cargo
ships, 3 cargo ships, 1 fuel tanker, 1 container pontoon, 1 oil pontoon, 4
barges and 5 tugs; among these, the vessel with the largest cargo-carrying
capacity is the 600 ton container pontoon. For ship repair, LS has a
maintenance facility at Monkey Bay which includes a slipway, floating dry
dock and pontoon jetty.
1.13      Freight traffic on the lake, as shown in Table 1.1, has fluctuated
widely in recent years but reached 39,100 tons or 13.1 million ton-km in
1984. In the same year, 188,400 passengers were transported by LS, a 42%
increase over the 1977 level. Freight revenues have historically exceeded
freight operating costs but passenger service has shown heavy losses over
the years because of extremely low passenger fareL.

1.14      The composition of freight traffic on the lake has varied widely
from year to year but during the past few years the principal commodities
have been fertilizer, fuel and maize which together have accounted for



three4-ourths of the tonnag. Cement snd ri,a are other notable traffic
items. Fuel and fertilizer move northward from Cnipoka principally to
Nkhata Bay and Chilamba while maixe and rice are trassported in the opposite
4irection. Traffic Imbalances are significant between the two principal
lake ports with heavier southbound than northbound traffic. Fuel is
transported in bulk while dry cargo is shipped largely as breakbulk. A
container service was Initiated in 1985 for NTC traffic.
1.15      Lake vessels are operated at speeds of 6 to 11 knots and since the
distance between Chipoka and Chilumba Is about 400 km, it would take
approximately 30 hours sailing time for a cargo vessel to make a one-way
trip. However, under present operations the vessels usually make calls at
Intermediate ports thus incroasing the total time for a trip between the
major ports. Vessels are available for service about 330 days per year and
ship maintenance, mainly done at Monkey Bay, requires 35 days per year.
Port operations as well as vessel operations are the responsibility of LS.
Fteight service is reasonably reliable and the rates for such services,
Including transshipment charges in the ports, are significantly lower than
rates for competitive road transport services (pars. 5.28).
Air Transport
1.16     Within Malawi, air transport accounts for far less passenger or
freight traffic than road, rail or lake transport but it nonetheless makes a
significant contribution to the economy, particularly in passenger movement
where travel time savings are important. Of the four azports with
scheduled services, Lilongwe handled the greater amount of traffic, followed
by Blantyre, Msuzu and Karonga. Lilongwe airport, completed in 1983, is
capable of handling long-range wide-body aircraft. In 1984, Lilongwe
airport accounted for 62Z of the 339,218 total passengers handled at all
Malawi airports while Blantyre airport handled only 33Z of the total. Air
Malawi, a Government-owned airline, provides some of the international
services and all scheduled domestic services. Several foreign airlines also
provide international services, and one local company and Air Malawi furnish
unscheduled domestic services.
1.17     Air Malawi's total passengers carried in 1984 of 127,541 was 392
higher than the 1978 level. Air freight increased more rapidly than
passenger traffic in this perlod because of the disruption of Malawi's
traditional transport routes through Mozambiqute rail lines and ports and
difficulties encountered in using alternative road and rail ro-xtes. Despite
these traffic increases, however, Air Malawi has shown heavy losses during
recent years, with the exceptions of 1981 and 1982.

C. TransDort Policy and Coordination
2.18     Nalawi's transport policy has had three broad alms   (a) to
Improve the administrative, social and economic integration of the country
by linking Its three regions with reliable all-weather connections; (b) to
support rural development by improving access to rural are-s; and (c) to
provide efficient links with external transport routes to Indian Ocean
seaports for exports and Imports. Substantial progress has been made toward
the first two of these objectives. In the case of (c), however, great
difficulties have been experienced because of serious disruptions in traffic
flow on Nozambique rail lines (see para. 2.02), problems beyond the control
of the Malawi Government.
1.19      To cope with the transport crisis that arose In 1982-83, the
Government In 1983 formed the contingency planning unit in the Ministry of
Transport and Comunuications to monitor international transport of Malawi's
external trade and to take appropriate steps to expedite the movement of
such goods. A specialist, financed by UNDP and the Bank's Fifth Highway
Project, also made recomendations for achieving, over the longer term,
lmproved means of transport; one of these recommendations was that the NTC
route be developed. Two other actions taken by the Government aimed at
alleviating the transit problem werei (1) engagement of consultants to
undertake a transport system study of the Blantyre-Dar es Salaam Corridor;
this was completed in July 1985 under financing by the Bank's Fifth Highway
Project; and (2) engagement of consultants to undertake detailed engineering
of the Raronga-Ibanda road link of NTC under EDF financing. Malawi
Government officials have worked closely with officials of transit
countries, transport companies, shippers and Importers In a continuing
program to expedite, on a current basis, the movement of Nalawi's transit
traffic and to Improve, over the longer term, vital access routes. The
success of the Government's efforts are reflected in the speed with which
the disruptive shortages of key Imports were reduced; the success in
lowering transport costs on the southern route to Durban (South Africa); and
the effectiveness of a monitoring and enforcement mechanism In maximizing
the load factors (i.e. ensuring return loads) on trucks moving goods in and
out of the country. Additionally, the Governmnt has been successful in
preparing the Investments necessary in developing NTC to the Port of Dar es
Salaam with the full cooperation of the Tanxanian Government (pars. 2. 10).

3-year rolling public sector Investment program which is revised annually
during budget preparation. The program for the fiscal years 1986-1988, as
shown in Table 1.3, indicates that transport in this period will represent
19S to 302 of total Investments and that road investments Will constitute
about three-fourths of the total investments in the sector.

Actual public investments in the transport sector, shown In Table 1.4, havo
recently been relatively low as indicated by the figures for the fiscal
years 1983184 and 1984/85 compared with data for either earlier years or the
program for 1986-1988. This represents a reasonable shift of investment
funds to productive sectors of the economy. The amounts Invested in roads
have risen modestly and have been more stable than those for other
subsectors.

1.21     Coordination of transport investment plans is the responsibility
of the Transport Planning Unit (TPU) of the Economic Planning and
Development Department (EPDD) of the Office of the President and Cabinet
(OPC), which reviews proposals put forth by the Ministry of Works and
Supplies (MWS) for roads and by the Ministry of Transport and Communications
(MTC) for other modes. The transport planning and coordination capability
has been strengthened by technical assistance financed under the Fourth
(Credit 1099-MAI) and Fifth Highway projects. The credit agreement under
the proposed project contains a covenant requiring that, the Government will
consult with the Association prior to undertaking any new investments in its
transport sector (pars. 6.01(a)).
D. Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.22     The Bank Group has been involved in Malavi's transport sector
since 1966 when Credit S-2-MAI was approved to help finance detailed
engineering of the Zomba-Lilongwe road (290 km). This was followed by the
First Highway Project (Credit 112-MAI, 1968, US$11.5 million) comprising the
reccnstruction and bituminous paving of that road, the refinancing of Credit
S-2-MAI, and a conrultants' study of road transport licensing regulations
and road-rail coordination. A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) of
the project (No. 946, December 15, 1975) concluded that all of the project's
objectives were achieved. Construction costs were within appraisal
estimates, although the road was completed about one year behind schedule.l/
Traffic was greater than projected at appraisal, and the rate of return was
conservatively reevaluated at 13S, compared with the appraisal estimate of
122. The consultant's study recomiaended deregulating road transport,
raising axle load limits to 9 tons, improving trassport statistics, and
relating rail tariffs more closely to economic factors, all of which have
been Implemented, although there Is scope for further refinement of rail
tariffs. The study expressed misgivings about planned rail projects, but
Government did not share IDA's reservations and proceeded with these
Investments. Both the consultants' study and the PPAR agreed that the
country mignt soon have an oversupply of transport services in the Blantyre-
Lilongwe-Zambian border corridor. The major recommendations of the PPAR
called for closer project supervision by IDA staff and rectifying the
negleet of lower class roads--although the PPAR did not question the
composition of the First Highway Project, noting that the "Zomba-Lilongwe
road ... is undoubtedly the most important highway in Malawi.' Both of the
recommendations made In the PPAR were addressed under the Second, Third,
Fourth and Fifth Highway Projects and in the agricultural projects financed
by the Bank Group.
1.23     The Second Highway Project (Credit 523-HAI, 1974, US$10.0 million)
originally comprised construction of the Lilongwe-Kasungu road (113 km) and
a pilot scheme for the improvement and maintenance of district roads serving
rural development in the Kasungu District. Both components have been
completed; the construction in March 1978, a few months behind schedule, and
the pilot scheme in September 1978. Substantial cost savings were made on
the construction component which were used to finance completion of the

pilot scheme in the Kasungu district and extension of the scheme to three
other districts, following the recommendations of a consultants' study which
evaluated the results of the pilot program. The four districts made up the
first phase of a District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP)
planned to cover all of Malawil's 24 di;tricts in three phases. This first
phase was completed in September 1981. According to the Project Completion
Report (PCR), the economic rate of return was estimated at 23 percent
compared with 14 percent at appraisal. Both the PCR and PPAR of the project
(PPAR No. Sec M84-617, July 6, 1984) found that it was successfully
implemented.
1.24      The Third Highway Project (Credit 758-MAI, 1977, US$10.5 million)
comprised construction of the Kasungu-Janda road (85 km) and a feasibility
study and detailed engineering of the Jenda-Mzuzu road.  The road
construction was completed in October 1980, a few months behind schedule,
and the detailed engineering in September 1980. The PCR concluded that the
quality of the physical components was satisfactory, but due to the general
deterioration in Malawi's economy in recent years, the economic rate of
return was then (1984) estimated at 8 percent compared with 14 percent at
appraisal. However, with the increased traffic generated by linking Malawi
to the TANZAM corridor, the traffic flows and rate of return are expected to
Improve significantly.
1.25      The Fourth Highway Project (Credit 1099-MAI, 1981, SDR 25.9
million or about US$33.0 million equivalent) comprised construction of the
Jenda-Luwawa Turnoff road (32 km), the Mbowe-Mausu-Ekwendeni road (32 km)
and spot improvements on the Luwawa Turnoff-Hbowe road (about 100 km), the
second phase of DRIMP extending the scheme to 10 additional districts, a
comprehensive study of Malawi's road maintenance needs, provision of minor
road maintenance equipment, construction of a new training facility for road
personnel, technical assistance in transport planning for TPU in EPDD and
overseas training of two of TPU's transport economists. This project was
completed in 1985. The PCR, completed in March 1987, concluded that the
objectives of the project were largely achieved and the project was
successfully implemented.
1.26      The Fifth Highway Project (Credit 1423, November 1983,
SDR 12.4 million or US$13.1 million equivalent, and IDA Special Fumd Credit
SF-6-MAI of SDR 13.1 million or US$13.8 million equivalent and Loan 2363-
MAI, of US$18.0 million equivalent) comprised the third phase of DRIMP,
implementation of a four-year maintenance and rehabiliiition program for the
main and secondary road networks, construction of a two-lane bituminous-
paved road between Luwawa Turnoff and Champhoyo, provision of weighbridges
and vehicles for axle load control, provision of equipment for an MWS
training center and consultant services. Implementation of the project is
well underway and proceeding satisfactorily.
1.27      Finally, transport components have been included in IDA projects
in other sectors (Annex 1).  Credit S-17-MAI, 1974, provided US$2.0 million
for planning and engineering of infrastructure for the proposed Viphya
timber exploitation scheme.  In addition, agricultural projects in the Lower
Shire Valley (Credits 114, 363 and 823-MAI) and the Lilongwe area (Credits
113, 244 and 550-MAI) and the more widespread National Rural Development
Project (Credits 857-MAI) have included improvement and construction of
about 4,000 km of feeder and crop extraction roads, while the Karonga Rural



- to -
Development Project oleo included port improvements at Chilumba and Chipoka
on Lake Malawi as moll as procurement of a self-propelled barge for the lake
service.
1.28      The Bank Group's involvement in the transport sector has been
largely in the highway subsector although its projects have included
significant technical assistance and studios concerned with tho entite
sector. Through a series of highway projects the Bank Group has made a
substantial contribution to the strenygthening of local institutions,
particularly in NWS, MTC, and EPDD; these efforts have enhanced
institutional capabilities for effective highway administration and
transport policy formulation. The strategy for highway development followed
by MWS over the past several years has been aimed mainly at (i) construction
of a basic road network with particular focus on development of a main
north-south road; (ii) improvement and maintenance of district roads; and
(iiI) strengthening of maintenance of the main and secondary road system.
The Bank's highway projects, from the First through the Fifth, accomplished
much with regard to items (i) and (li) and the Fifth Highway Project is also
contributing significantly to the realization of objective (iii). The
proposed project will contribute primarily to aims (i) and (iii) and in
addition will assist in the development of the lake transport subsector.
E. Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
1.29      Although the proposed project Is justified technically,
financially and economically, giving a high rate of return, the
Association's involvement is mainly justified on: (i) the contribution the
project makes In improving the macro-economic condition of Malawi through
improving the term of trade of Malawian goods, reducing foreign exchange
outlay on the transport cost of Importlexport goods, and assisting in
keeping down the domestic cost increases through reducing the cost of
imported materials; (ii) promoting institutional development by improving
the capacity of the Government and the private sector to manage and operate
a new transport corridor; and (iii) contributing to the Government's
sectoral policy objective of promoting greater economic integration of the
country through development of the northern region (least developed region
in the country) as a major origin and destination for Malawi's importlexport
traffic. Perhaps more important is the contribution the Association has
mLide In developing the concept of NTC as an alternative access to the Indian
Ocean, as well as coordinating donor participation and assisting the
Government in preparing a financial package for the project. The
Association has assisted the Government from the initial conceptual stage2l
through the formulation of terms of reference and financing the consultant
study on NTC, as well as provided continuous analysis of project features
and participated in numerous discussions and exchanges of ideas on NTC with
the Government. As a consequence, the Association has been requested by the
Government, as well as by the donors interested in the project, to assist
the Government in managing the final preparations of the project and its
implementation. The Association's catalytic role in managing and
implementing the project is crucial not only in terms of successful
implementation of the project but also to ensure maximum Impact of funds
being provided by other donors.

II. Tressport Routes Between Malawi and Indian Ocean Ports
A.  Existing Transport Routes
2.01      The several alternative routes available to Malawi for handling
Its external trade to and from Indian Ocean ports vary greatly in length and
reliability (IBRD Map 19421). Table 2.1 summari2es these routes and also
includes the two rail lines to Mozambique ports; although these latter
routes are closed as a result of disturbances in Mozambique, they provide an
important reference for comparison with alternatives. Recent traffic
diversion from the Mozambique routes to those serving the distant port of.
Durban has not only Increased transport distances dramatically but also has
increased the number of countries transited and has required the use of
relatively costly road transport for a part of the through movement.

2.02      Until recent years, the rail lines to Beira and Nacala handled
over 902 of Malawi's external trade, reflecting the clear advantages of
short distance, all-rail movement and one-country transit. In the late
1970's, frequent interruptions in service developed as a result of equipment
breakdowns and line failures, partly because of inability to repair
equipment and track and partly as a result of repeated attacks by armed
bandits. By December 1983, the line to Beira was closed and in July 1985
the line to Nacals was closed. The condition of these facilities is now
such that even if security were assured, some years would be required to
bring them back to their former capacity. Continuing security problem in
the areas transited by these lines make it mpracticable to rehabilitate
them in the foreseeable future. The Harare-BeIra rail line is still in
operation, secured by the Zimbabwean army, but since Zimbabwe traffic has
preference, no Malawi traffic is moving over this line.



- 12 -
2.03      There are a number of alternative routes for Malawi traffic
between Malawi and Durban, and over 90Q of the country's external trade
moved over these southern routes since 1985. The comparatively short road
route through the Tete area of Mozambique is presently unsafe because of
activities by armed bands but is used to a limited extent with armed truck
convoys. All of the other routes to Durban require road transport between
the Malawi-Zambia border and Lusaka, and the overall distances range from
3,467 to 3,806 km. The length of the principal all-road route is similar to
that of the best roadirail combination route. The choice of specific route
for a particular shipment depends on many considerations such as rates,
delivery time, capacity constraints, customs procedures and the like. A
large number of international truck operators are available to provide
transport services on this corridor for the entire route or for some segment
of a combination road-rail route.
2.04      Routes between Halawi and Dar es Salaam represent other options
for the movement of Malawi's external trade. Among them are circuitous all-
road and road/rail routes via Lusaka.  While somewhat shorter than those via
Lusaka and Harare to Durban, they are nonetheless more than 3,000 km in
length. Less use has been made of these routes to Dar es Salaam than those
to Durban because of the greater amount of transport related services on the
latter and greater reliability of transport in the southern corridor.
Seeking to shorten the distance to ocean ports, MWS opened a gravel road of
limited capacity in October 1984 between Karonga in Malawi and Ibanda in
Tanzania, which provided the first significant direct link between the
Malawi and Tansania road systems and thus reduced the road link between
Blantyre and Dar es Salasm to 1,789 km. Moreover, the TAZARA railway can
substitute advantageously for road transport over about half of this
distance, that is, between Hbeya and Dar es Salaam. While some
international traffic moves on the corridor, there are certain physical and
institutional limitations that cause many Malawian shippers and importers to
continue using the much longer but more reliable southern routes.
2.05      Among the limitations of NTC is the poor quality of the Karonga-
Ibanda gravel road, in part single lane, on which there are Bailey bridges
over two rivers near the international border. Another problem is the lack
of efficient transshipment facilities at the Nbeya railway station. Also,
there is a need to establish an inland cargo center outside the ort of Dar
es Salaan to expedite movement of Malawi's transit traffic. Witnin Malawi,
lake transport has the potential for carrying substantial exportlimport
traffic at substantially lower cost than road transport but this would
require additional vessel capacity and port handling facilities. These
various requirements will be met by the project.
B. Transport Costs on Alternative Routes
2.06      Comparative transport costs constitute a fundamental consideration
in evaluating transport routes. The historic routes to Beira and Nacala, as
shown in Table 2.2, reflect the lowest transport cost, among the routes
represented. Since the Mozambique routes are closed, however, the
appropriate comparison in terms of costs is between the southern and
northern transport corridors. It is evident that NTC represents
substantially lower transport costs than the route to Durban. For important
export items such as tobacco, tea and sugar, the costs on NTC are half to



- 13 -
two-thirds of the costs on the southern route. For fertilizer and general
cargo imports, NTC costs are about two thirds those on the southern
transport corridor and the cost advantage for petroleum products is even
greater.

Salaam Corridor," July 1985.
2.07      One of the concerns which arose during the preparation of the
project was the capacity of the Dar es Salaam Port and TAZARA to handle the
additional traffic generated by thrwighput of Malawian cargo. In regard to
the capacity of the Dar es Salaam port to handle the transit traffic of
falavi, the on-going Bank financed Tanzania Port rehabilitation project
(Credit 1536-TA) will increase the effoctive port capacity from 2.2 million
tons currently to 2.4 million in 1988 and 3.2 million tons in 1992 (at 1983
berth occupanc rate). Given the forecasted traffic throughput of the
current users,_ addition of Halawi traffic (81 of total forecasted port
throughput) will not add significantly to the borth side congestion.
Addition of Malawi traffic, however, would materially contribute to the
congestion of the storage area of the port, particularly in the container
stacking area. Significant increase of containerized traffic (802 increase
between 1988 and 1992) is forecasted for the port of Dar es Salaam. The
creation of a Malawi Cargo Center (MCC) at Dar es Salaam under this project
will avoid this potential problem by providing an inland cargo storage and
transshipment facility, dedicated to handle Malawian cargo (see para. 3.07).
In regard to the capacity of TAZARA to handle the forecasted Malawian
transit traffic, there are sufficient numbers of general covered wagons and
container flats to carry the traffic at normal availability levels. In
terms of its locomotive fleet, TAZARA will have enough capacity to carry the
Malswian traffic after completing the on-going locomotive rehabilitation
program. The main concern is whether a satisfactory availability of
locomotives and wagons can be achieved. One of the requirements for NTC
traffic to develop is the confidence of the shippers that a prompt and
regular service between Mbeya and Dar es Salaam will be provided by TAZARA.
31 Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire, Burundi and Rwanda.



- 14 -
A solution which has been devised to circumvent this potential problem is a
locomotive and wagon leasing contract to be agreed upon between MCC and
TAZARA. This possibility was discussed bet*ewn HR and TAZARA. TAZARA
(under a bilateral agreement (para. 2.10)) has a8reed to provide a scheduled
shuttle service between Mbeya and Dar es Salasm, dedicated to Malawi transit
traffic. Additionally, there is a general shortage of fuel tank wagons on
TAZARA and these will need to be procured to transport Malawi fuel.
C. Commodity Flows on Alternative Routes
2.08      The predominance of Mozambique routes in the flow of Malawi's
exportlimport traffic prior to 1983 is shown in Table 2.3.  In 1976, the
rail line to Beira handled two-thirds of the total traffic flow and the line
to Nacala nearly all of the remainder. Traffic on both these routes
declined sharply in later years; in 1984 only 152 of the traffic moved
through the Mozambique ports. By mid-1985, none of Malawi's importlexport
traffic was handled through these ports as increasing interruption       the
Mozambique rail lines led to closure.  In 1984, nearly two-thirds of the
external traffic moved over the Mchinji-Lusaka road. Most of the traffic
over the Mwanza-Tete-Harare road was transported in convoys with security
personnel providing protection. In the first 9 months of 1985, some 15,000
tons of traffic moved over NTC which was stimulated by the opening in late
1984 of the gravel road link between Karonga and Ibanda.

D. Need for Improvement of NTC
2.09      The transport of Malavi's external trade largely by southern
routes at costs greatly in excess of those on historical routes through
Mozambique has had a significant negative impact on Mslawi's export
earnings, import prices, balance of payments and other economic indicators.
The total lose to the economy in 1984 was at least US$50 million, or 201 of
the value of all exports, taking into account direct and indirect costs
including excess transport costs, procurement of replacement supplies, port
storage charges, interest on tied-up capital and loss and deterioration of
goods. Prospects for reestablishing the historical pattern of transit
traffic through Mozambique in the foreseeable future are not encouraging and
therefore Malawi needs to develop the best possible alternative means of
handling this traffic. Improvement of NTC represents a significant
opportunity to lower transport costs for Malawi's exportlimport trade. The
principal deficiencies of NTC are lack of a paved road between Karonga and
Ibanda, poor surface on some sections of the Ibanda-Uyole road, inadequate
transshipment facilities at the Mbeya rail terminal, inefficient facilities
in Dar-es-Salaam for transshipment of Malawi cargo between the port and
TAZARA railway, limitations in ship and port facilities on Lake Halawi and
the poor condition of a road link on the route between Blantyre and the
principal lake port of Chipoka. The project is designed to overcome these
various deficiencies.
2.10      Apart from the physical improvements required on NTC, the two
Governments and their related agencies (TAZARA, Tanzania Harbours Authority
(THA) and MR) had to agree on the procedures and regulations governing the
transit of Halawian cargo through Tanzania and the operation of various
transport facilities to be installed on NTC. A bilateral commission, made
up of high level Nalawian and Tanzanian goverrment representatives, has
finalized a detailed bilateral agreement governing NTC. It includes
agreement on documentation and procedures governing the transit traffic,
leasing of land for MCC, rates, charges and payment arrangements for various
services to be provided by TAZARA, THA and MCC, ownership of assets and its
maintenance, road transport agreement, right of transit, customs control,
visa and other privileges and restrictions. The Agreement, in particular,
includes protocols on (i) port operations, (1i) MCC and (iii) competent
authorities, as well as annexes on (1) road transport, (Ui) agreement
between Malawi Railways and TAZARA, and (iiI) Lease Agreement. It should be
noted that the road transport agreement which is incorporated as Annex I to
the bilateral agreement was signed by the two Governments on December 4,
1984 and has been in effect since. The Association reviewed and commented
on the draft final Agreement and considers it acceptable. The Agreement was
signed by the Minister of Transport and Communications for Malawi and the
Minister of Communications and Works for Tanzania on August 15, 1987, and
officially cleared the way for the NTC investments to be made in Tanzania.

E. Future of the Alternative Routes throuth Mozambigue and South Africa
2.11      Reactivation of the Beira and Nacala railways to carry Malawian
transit traffic is dependent upon the cessation of activities by armed bands
in Mozambique and the capacity of the lines to operate services after many
years of neglect and heavy damages. The Southern African Development
Coordination Conference (SADCC) has undertaken to formulate a program of
rehabilitating various transport corridors crucial to the Independent
Southern African countries. Work has already begun In two of the transport
corridors in Nozambiquet the Nacala Cor-idor and the Beira-Zimbabwe
Corridor. A consortium of French, Canadian, and Portuguese government aid
agencies has been formed to finance the rehabilitation of the Nacala
railway. The first phase (rehabilitation of 200 km of rail from Nacala to
Nampula) which began in mid 1983 is scheduled to be completed in 1987. The
remainder of the rehabilitation works (second phase) is expected to be
completed in 1989, barring any disruptions and delays. The Nacala line,
however, has carried a maximum of only 250,000 tons (302) of Malawian cargo
in the past. Until other aspects of railway operations are also improved
(e.g. maintenance capacity, rehabilitation of rolling stock and locomotives,
and manpowerimanagerial capacity) the Nacala transport corridor is not
expected to carry more than a third of the total Malawian importlexport
traffic. The other active rehabilitation program is the Beir, transport
corridor program (to Zimbabwe border). This corridor has been kept open,
despite many attempts to disrupt the traffic, by Zimbabwean security forces.
USAID and the Zimbabwe Government have begun rehabilitation of certain rail
sections and replacement of sleepers on this corridor. A large consortium
of donors (World Bank, USAID, EEC, Netherlands and Nordic group) have also
been formed to develop a rational investment program to rehabilitate the
entire corridor (including Beira port and railway and manpower development).
This work, however, will not have much importance for Malawian traffic, due
to the fact that this route will be used predominantly for transport of
Zimbabwian import/export traffic. The rehabilitation of Beira rail line to
Malawi border has not begun due to the security problems in the area. The
years of neglected maintenance and exte%sive damage done on this line by
armed bandits preclude the line from regaining its former capacity to carry
Nalawian traffic until the hostility has completely ceased and extensive
rehabilitation work carried out. Based on these circumstances, it would
take at least three to five years from cessation of armed activities in
Nozambique for Malawi to return to its traditional pattern of using the
Beira and Nacala corridors.
2.12      Another possible complication for Malawi's future access to the
sea is the possibility that the southern route to Durban will also be closed
to transit traffic. In a reaction to the international community's call for
sanctions, RSA has already begun limiting the access of neighboring land-
locked countries to its transport system and outlet to the sea. Complete
closure of the border is an eventuality which Malawi, as well as the
neighboring land-locked countries, may face. The affected countries
(namely, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, Swaziland and Nalawi) have begun making
contingency plans against such eventuality. The four main alternative
routes for these land-locked countries are through the ports of Maputo,
Beira and Nacala in Mozambique, and the port of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.
However, only the two transport corridors to the ports of Dar es Salsam and
Beira (from Zimbabwe) are currently open to traffic, and the other corridors
in Mozambique are closed due to armed bandit activities in the area.



- 17 -
2.13      Closure of the South African transit routes will force nearly 3
million tons of international transit traffic to be diverted to these two
ports, resulting in an unmanageable excess demand on the transit facilities;
the main constraints will be in the port capacities. In the port of Dar es
Salaam, significant congestion will be encountered until the end of 1989
when the on-going port improvement project (Cr. 1536-TA) will be completed.
In the port of Beira, apart from the security problem surrounding the
corridor, the proposed port rehabilitation project (scheduled to begin in
1988), will reduce the port throughput capacity by half until its completion
in 1990.  The net Impact of the two ,ort improvement works is that during
the period between 1987 and 1991, demand for transport services will
substantially exceed supply if transport routes through RSA were closed.
This in turn may significantly reduce the trade acetivities of the
independent Southern African countries.
2.14      In regard to the impact of such an eventuality on the viability of
NTC, there are three factors to consider. First, Malawi will have a certain
advrctage over Zimbabwe and Botswana in terms of having already negotiated
the various procedural requirements for using TAZARA and the port of Dar es
Salaam. Second, the required investments to operationalize NTC are ready
for Implementation. Third, nearly 1 million tons of Zambian traffic will be
diverted to the Tanzanian route if its access to the South African route is
diminished, causing significant reduction in availability of TAZARA services
for Malawian traffic. The third point is a major concern for Malawi, but
given that NTC would be the only available transit route for Malawi, efforts
to secure rolling stock and motive power from TAZARA would be the best
possible alternative. Another possibility would be to increase the use of
TANZAM Highway. The proposed NTC project, however, can only make an impact
in the medium term (two to three years). Under these circumstances, the
Malawi Government has begun to formulate a short term contingency plan to
use the existing facilities on NTC until the required investments are in
place. A few cargo handling equipment items will be procured and placed at
Mbeya for transshipment. A freight forwarding and cargo handling company
will be contracted to operate the equipment and to make arrangements with
TAZARA aud the Dar es Salasm port authority to expedite the transport of
Malawi cargo. Experience gained during this period will certainly enhance
the ability of the Malawian authorities to efficiently utilize NTC once it
comes into full operation.

III. The Proiect
A. Objectives.
3.01      The main objective of the project is to assist the Government of
Halawi in improving NTC, thus enabling the route to handle one-third of
Malawi's external traffic at reduced transport cost as compared with
alternative southern routes through Zambia, Zimbabwe and RSA. The anticipated
diversion of one-third of Malawi's transit traffic to the northern route is
expected to reduce the far-reaching economic Coats attributable to the use of
the lengthy and costly southern routes. An additional affect of the project
is that the development and operation of NTC will alleviate high transport
costs on the southern routes-for Malawi cargo by giving Malawi a stronger
bargaining position in seeking reduction of transport charges on the southern
routes.
3.02      In general, the project will contribute to the important objective
of developing improved transport links between various countries of Southern
Africa, thus facilitating the expansion of regional trade and industry. While
the primary purpose of the NTC is to handle the transit traffic of Ma:awi, it
will, in addition, serve as an expeditious route for trade between Malawi and
Tanzania. The development of such international links is one of the primary
goals of the SADCC. The project will also contribute to the expansion of
regional trade between Malawi and Tanzania, as well as to the Government's
policy objective of promoting greater economic integration of the country
through development of the northern region (least developed in Malawi).

C. Detailed Proiect Descrintion
Road Construction and Rehabilitation
3.04      The Karonga-Ibanda road (54.6 km), built quickly in 1984 as a high
priority link to the TANZAM corridor, will be upgraded from a narrow,
emergency gravel standard to two-lane bituminous-paved standard. Included
in the construction are two sizeable bridges over the Songwe and Kivira
rivers presently spanned by Bailey bridges.
3.05      Selected segments of the Ibanda-Uyole road (98 km) will be
rehabilitated. The existing road has some steep grades but the horizontal
alignment is relatively good. Its asphalt surface is also good except for
some sections amounting to 12 km between Ibanda and Tukuyu. Reconstruction
work will be done on those 12 km and, in addition, other spots as required
based on detailed survey.
3.06      The Salima-Balaka asphalt road (145 km), which has deteriorated
seriously throughout its length, will be rehabilitated. Though not a major
bottleneck in the corridor, it is a main connection to the lakeshore road
which is the preferred road for transporting NTC traffic, and also connects
the port of Chipoka and the major commercial city of Blantyre. The work
will include Improvements in road formation and drainage as well as
resurfacing and paving of the Chipoka access road (2.5 km).
MCCs
3.07      An inland freight station, MCC, is to be established outside the
port of Dar es Salaam to avoid the problems within the port itself of a
shortage of container storage area and the high incidence of loss and damage
to Malawi cargo. A site less than a kilometer from the southern port
boundary has been identified. The site would provide 10,000 m2 of covered
storage area for break-bulk cargo, and an open area for container storage,
providing 225 ground slots fo. containers based on gantry crane operation
and an annual throughput capacity of 45,600 T%U. Project Improvements
include concrete surfacing of 5,660 m2 of container stacking, 5,540 m2 of
break-bulk storage area, 6,020 m2 of maneuvering area, provision of adequate
lighting, construction of a workshop, construction of a 400 a port access
road and installation of 850 m of railway track within the storage area.
Equipment procurement includes 16 tractor trailers to move cargo between
shipside and MCC, 14 forklifts (3 tons each) and a gantry crane for
container handling. Optimal storage and equipment requirements were
determined on the basis of a system study taking into account traffic flows
and performance factors for equipmenr of various types.
3.08      At Mbeya another MCC will be constructed in the northwestern part
of the TAZARA railway station. A container stacking area of 1,970 m2 is to
be concrete-surfaced. A break-bulk stor6ge shed of 4,460 m2 will be
constructed as well as 4,800 m2 of maneuvering area and a workshop.
Equipment procurement will consist of 5 forklifts (3 ton capacity each), a
gantry crane for container handling, and workshop equipment.
3.09      The current residents at the designated site for HCC Dar es Salaam
will be resettled in an area 9 km outside the city center (para. 3.38).
Infrastructural Improvements are required on the new site. These Include:



- 21 -
(i) improvement of the .xisting road to gravel standard (3.0 kmn), (ii}
construction of a new gravel road (1.5 km); (iii) extension of electrical
line; (iv) construction of a borehole well; and (v) construction of a
dispensary.
Fuel Storage and Transshiument Facilities
3.09      Separate fuel storage and handling facilities for Malawi petroleum
protucts moving through NTC will be required because Malawi and Tanzania
have adopted different atandards for these products. In Dar &a Salaam
Malawi requires storage for petrol and diesel of 7,500 =3 and 14,000
respectively. A site identified for the fuel storage is located adjacent to
MCC Dar es Salaam. For jet fuel and illuminating paraffin, storage can be
shared with Tansania as the standards for these products in the two
countries are about the sase and no additional storage is needed; fuel
handling facilities in the port of Dar es Salaam for these products are
adequate for the needs of both Malawi and Tanzania.
3.10      In Mbeya, no fuel handling capacity exists; fuel storage of 1,900
=3 for diesel and petrol will be provided under the project adjacent to the
proposed site for MCC Nbeya. In addition, 5 unloading points will be
installed for emptying rail tankers and 5 loadiug points established for
filling road tankers. The optimum storage and pumping facilities were
estimated on the basis of a system study which took into account the
estimated flow of traffic and performance factors for pumping.
Railway Tank Watons and Tank Containers
3.11      In view of the limited inventory of tank wagons in the TAZARk
fleet and to ensure that such wagons are available for Malawi fuel transit,
the project includes procurement of about 22 tank wagons for the railway (to
be owned by MR and operated by TAZARA). These wagons will be sufficient to
move the anticipated volume of Malawi's diesel and petrol on the line. Jet
fuel, however, must be transported by a different tank dedicated to it to
ensure purity of the product. About 33 tank containers will be procured to
carry the estimated annual jet fuel throughput of 5,000 tons.
Improvements for LS
3.12      A new 600-ton pontoon vessel will be procured for LS, suitably
designed to carry the type of exportlimport traffic expected to move in
volume on the lake. The new ship will be capable of handling break-bulk,
containers, and fuel. Because of limited volumes of each type of cargo,
however, some compromise in design is required. For the commodity mix and
traffic levels projected, various types of vessels were considered and a
600-ton vessel with capacity to carry fuel, break-bulk and container was
cho3en as most suitable.
3.13      NTC traffic on the lake will be transported mainly between the
northern port of Chilumba and the southern port of Chipoka. The capacity of
Chipoka port will be expanded to accommodate the anticipated traffic. A
container stacking area of 730 m2 will be concrete-surfaced, break-bulk
storage of 670 m2 and workshop will be constructed; in addition, the port
will obtain a gantry crane, 3 forklifts (3 ton each) and minor changes in
the fuel handling system will also be made.



_ 22 -
3.14      The port of Chilumba w*ll require additional cargo handling
equipment, expanded storage capacity and a gantry crane. Specifically, the
port will be provided with 6 forklifts of 3 tons each, 1 forklift (6 tons)
and a gantry crane.  A container stacking area of 1,830 m2 will be concrete-
surfaced and a storage shed of 2,600 m2 will be constructed. Minor changes
in the fuel handling system will al60 be introduced.
3.15      Improvements are required in the ship repair facilities at Monkey
Bay to service vessels and shorten their annual overhaul periods. A new
jetty will be built to allow two vessels to berth on either side while also
providing direct access to the floating dock. In addition, a workshop will
be provided with suitable machinery and tools.
Border Post and Weighbridges
3.16      A border post and staff housing will be constructed and a
weighbridge installed at the Karonga-Ibanda road border crossing. As agreed
by the Malawian and Tanzanian governments, the border post will be opened
twenty four hours a day to allow continuous flow of traffic.
Consultancy Services
3.17      LS management is in need of strengthening in the fields of
marketing, positioning and schedu2ing of vessels, port operations and
maintenance and vessel repair. Therefore, the project Includes 84 man-
months of technical assistance for purposes of providing advice and training
In these Important areas.
3.18      Technical assistance is also included in the project for a project
coordinator and a financial controller (72 man-months) to enhance the
capabilities of IMC to coordinate project Implementation and facilitate the
flow of traffic over NTC, as well as to assist in establishing MCC.
3.19      Consultant services will be engaged for the purposes of
supervising the construction work and equipment procurement involved in
above-described project components. During negotiations agreements were
reached with Government that consultants for services in this project
component will bs employed under terms and conditions sctisfactory to the
Association (para. 6.01(b)).
Training of Transport Sector Personnel
3.20      Training for Government staff in the transport sector has also
been included for higher degrees in transport economics and several short
courses in areas such as transport management, economic and financial
analysis to be held at institutions such as the Eastern and Southern Africa
Management Institute (ESAMI) in Arusha, Tanzania.
Status of Proiect Preparation
3.21      Detailed engineering of the Karonga-Ibanda road which was carried
out by a Greek firm in association with a UK firm has been completed. The
contract for the works has recently been awarded. The detailed engineering
for the rbanda-Uyole road, undertakon by an Italian firm, has also been
completed. The Salima-Balaka detailed engineerlng, financed under the Fifth



-23-
Highway Project, has been completed. The tender documents were issued to
bidders In September 1987 and bids were received in early December 1987.
The preliminary engineering for the LS improvements and the MCC8 was
completed in July 1986. However, delays in completing the final engineering
and preparing the tender documents were experienced due to a change in the
sites designated for the MCCs and revisions to the design specifications for
equipment and civil works at the lake ports and the MCCs. The derasled
engineering and the preparation and issue of tender documents for all the
civil works and equipment components for the LS improvements were completed
in August 1987 and those for the MCCs are expected to be completed by March
1988. The contract for the preliminary and detailed engineering for the LS
improvements and MCCs was awarded to GITEC, the firm of consultants that
conducted the feasiblity studies for these components. Financing for these
works was provided by the Association under the Fifth Highway Project
supplemented by an advance from the Project Preparation Facility to cover
the increased scope of work as a result of the revisions in design
specifications and the changes in the site for MCC Dar es Salaam.
3.22.     The sites where the two MCCs and fuel facilities will be erected
have been identified. All the sites are under the jurisdiction of
respective City Councils (Dar es Salaam and Mbeya) and lease agreements for
each site have been prepared and are to be signed by MIHC (Malawi Railways
Holding Company) and the City Councils (included as a project condition for
the ODA grant). As for the Karonga-Ibanda-Uyole road, both governments have
agreed on the constructionlrehabilitation works to be carried out on this
road and have agreed under the bilateral agreement (para. 2.10) to maintain
the road once it is constructed. Total delay of 14 months was experienced
after negotiation in October 20, 1986 due to delays in signing of the
bilateral agreement (condition of Board Presentation) and complications in
securing the site for the construction of MCC Dar es Salaam.
Cost Estimates
3.23      The total cost for the project, including contingency allowances,
is estimated at IlK 252.5 million or US$109.8 million. Total cost includes
(a) physical contingencies of 101 of base cost on all items and (b) price
contingencies amounting to about 12.1Z of base costs on all itmem, ircluding
physical contingencies, for an estimated implementation period of 6.0 years
after Board Presentation. Escalation rates for foreign costs have been
applied to the foreign component and local escalation on the estimates for
local costs in the calculation of price contingencies (Table 3.1, footnote
bi).   Escalation estimate for local inflation in 1987 was 15S.  It is
assumed that any persistent divergence between local and foreign cost
escalation will be corrected by exchange rate adjustments. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at MK 209.2 million (US$91.0 million).
Identifiable taxes and duties are about HK 3.5 million (US$1.5 million), and
the total project cost net of taxes and duties is MK 249.0 million (US$108.3
million).
3.24      The length of the implewentation period is based on past
experience on similar projects as reflected in the relevant standard
disbursement profile. It is, however, possible that if the project is

implemented more efficiently and with fewer delays, the implementation
period could be reduced to 3.5 years. This would result In project costs
being reduced by about 82 or from US$109.8 million to US$101.0 million, and
improve the ERR by 51 to 211 (para 5.32).
3.25      The base costs are estimated as of December 1987 and have been
derived as follows:
(a) Road Construction and Rehabilitationt The cost estimates for
construction of the Karonga-Ibanda and Ibanda-Uyole roads are
based on quantities derived from detailed engineering and on
the consultants' estimates of unit costs, in turn based on
considerable experience from similar construction work In both
Malawi and Tanzania. The cost of the Balaka-Salima road
rehabilitation is derived from detailed engineoring and on the
consultants estimates of unit cost for similar work currently
being executed under the Fifth Highway Project. The foreign
exchange component is assessed at 70X of total cost for work
in Malawi and includes all elements except labor and taxes.
Work in Tanzania is considered as 1001 foreign cost.
(b) MCCs: The costs of the civil works are based on detailed
engineering and the consultants' estimates of quantities and
unit costs obtained from recently tendered contracts for
similar works in TanzaDia. The cost of the equipment is based
on information received from equipment manufacturers and
suppliers. The costs of civil works for the resettlement area
improvements are estimces based on recent experience in the
area.
(c) Fuel Storane and Handling Facilitiess The consultants
prepared detailed estimates of quantities. The unit rates
were derived from the consultants' data base on international
construction projects.
(d) Railway Tank Wagons and Tank Containers: Unit prices for tank
wagons and tank containers have been obtained by direct
enquiry from suppliers.
(e) LS Facilities: For the civil works, an early tender was
called for due to uncertainty in the strength of the existing
structures, particularly at the port of Chilumba. Bids were
received and found to be higher than the consultants'
estimate. The report has incorporated the most recent cost
data. The cost of the vessel has been estimated by the Bank
mission and includes prefabrication in the suppliers country
and transport to and assembled in Halawi. Cargo and container
handling equipment has been costed based on information from
suppliers.



- 26 -
(g) Consulting Servicess The technical assistance for LS and
project coordination will require a total of 131 man-months of
consulting seivices and has an estimated base cost of US$1.3
million. The total estimated cost also includes provision for
the cost of vehicles, local travel, and other minor expenses.
The supervision costs have been estimated at about US$6.0
million, corresponding to about 7S of the estimated
construction and equipment costs, which is in line with recent
experience in Malawi.
(h) Border Posts -The price of border post sad related housing to
be built at the border is based on actual cost of such houses
and post built by MWS's force account units.
(i) WeixhbridLe: The cost of the weighbridge was based on recent
quotations to MTC.
(j) Staff Trainings The costs of master's degree for two
candidates (48 man-months at $3,000 per month) and 35
candidates for training at ESAMI at $3,000 per course per
candidate have been based on similar components financed under
the ongoing Fifth Highway Project and the experience of MWS.
D. Financing
3.26      In view of the severe domestic resource constraints, the
Government contribution to the project financing would be limited to 102 of
the IDA-financed components (net of taxes) and to the tax component (US$0.8
million) on the KfW portion of the Salima-Balaka road. The project will
require external financing of about US$106.9 million to cover the foreign
exchange component of US$91.0 million and local cost amounting to US$15.9
million. The external financing will be provided as shown in Table 3.2,
through an IDA credit of US$13.4 million, an EDF contribution of US$20.0
million, a KflW grant of US$18.9 million, ODA grant of US$19.3 million, USAID
grant of US$18.0 million, and a Dutch grant of US$17.3 million.
3.27      The following conditions for financing will apply for the project:
USAID has stipulated (i) signing of project agreement between ODA (UK) and
Malawi Government and (ii) signing of the bilateral agreement between the
governments of Tanzania and Malawi, as conditions of disbursement.
Agreement with the Government was reached during negotiations that (i)
signing of the ODA (UK) grant agreement with Tanzania would be a condition
of IDA credit effectiveness (para. 6.01(c); and (ii) no later than September
30, 1988, all co-financing agreements between the Government and the donors
involved in this project shall have become effective (para. 6.01(d)).

E. Implementation and Procurement
3.28     Project execution will be the responsibility of;  (1) MTC with
respect to development of MCCs in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya, fuel
installations in Tanzania, liaison with both the Tanzania Government and
TAZARA and overall project coordination including technical assistance for
this purpose; (ii) MR in the case of tank wagons, tank containers and LS
vessel procurement, lake port improvements and technical assistance; (iii)
MWS regarding the road construction and rehabilitation works in Malawi and
construction of the border post and installation of a weighbridge; and (iv)
the Tanzanian Ministry of Communications and Works for road works in
Tanzania.4/
3.29     MTC and MR will take the lead in negotiating with suitable private
sector firms the necessary arran8ements for the operation of MCCs in Dar es
Salaam and Mbeya. One firm will undertake the operation of both MCCs and
an established oil company will take responsibility for the operation of
the fuel storage and handling facilities in the port of Dar es Salaam and
in the transshipment terminal at Hbeya.
3.30     Construction of the Karonga-Ibanda road and rehabilitation of the
Ibanda-Uyole road will be executed under unit price contracts awarded after
international bidding in accordance with guidelines of EDF and the Dutch
Government, respectively. The rehabilitation work on the Salima-Balaka
road will also be executed under unit price contract awarded after ICB in
accordance with guidelines of IDA. KfW has agreed to apply IDA guidelines
for selecting the contractor for the construction of the segment Salima-
Jct. M18 and the Chipoka access road.
3.31     The cargo handling equipment for lake ports and for the MCCs,
machinery and equipment for the Monkey Bay maintenance facility and tank
wagons and tank containers will be procured through competitive bidding in
accordance with the procurement guidelines of USAID. Civil works contracts
for Chipoka port and Chilumba port will be executed under unit price
contracts awarded in accordance with USAID guidelines. Procurement of the
lake vessel will be according to guidelines of KfW. MCC civil works and
equipment in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya will be tendered through competitive
bidding procedures satisfactory to ODA. Civil works contract for border
post will be procured following LCB in accordance with guidel.L. c of IDA.
As for the infrastructural improvements to be made to the resettAement
area, all construction, except the electrical extension and the borehole
well, will be carried out by the firm contracted to construct the MCC
facilities. TANESCO (Tanzania Electric Supply Company) will be sub-
contracted to extend the line to the resettlement area and a local drilling
firm will carry out the borehole construction. All works will be tendered
through competitive procedures satisfactory to ODA. Procurement
arrangements are summarized in Table 3.3.
3.32     In terms of ownership and operation of the various components,
with the exception of the road investments and border post/weighbridge, the
remainder of the investments will be leased to various parastatal and
private corporations for management and operation of the facilities. The
various entities involved are outlined below:
41 A detailed description of the road sector in Tanzania is presented in
the Staff Appraisal Report No. 5922-TA, dated December 13, 1985.

(a) MCCs and Fuel Facilities (Dar and Mbea).:  The facilities will
be owned by the Government of Malawi and vested in MRHC on
terms defined in Chapter 4 of this report. MRHC will, in
turn, lease the assets to a group of investors who will manage
the facilities. The actual day-to-day operation of the
facilities will be contracted to a private operator on a
competitive basis. Details of the ownership structure and the
operations of the facilities are given in Chapter 4.
(b) Tank Wasons and Tank Containers: These will be owned by MR
and leased to the fuel facilities operators. The actual
operation, i.e., haulage of wagons, will be done by TAZARA.
(c) Lake Facilities and the Pontoon: These will be owned and
operated by LS under MR.

3.33      All documentation for procurement under ICB, LCB and for
engagement of consultants, to be financed by the Association will be subject
to Association review prior to issuance of tenders and invitations.
3.34      A target implementation schedule is presented In Chart 1, the
details of which were agreed with Government at negotiations (para.
6.01(e)). The schedule shows en implementation period of about 3.5 years.
However, past experience indicates that a typical implementation period for
similar projects in the region is closer to 6.0 years (para. 3.24).
F. Disbursements
3.35      The IDA funds will be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 851 of total expenditures for civil works on the IDA-financed
portion of the Salima-Balaka road (Jct. 418 to Balaka);
(b) 851 of total expenditures for the border post; and
(c) 1009 of foreign expenditures and 501 of local expenditures on all
IDA-financed foreign technical assistance and supervision
contracts;
(d) 902 of total expenditures for local consultants;
(e) 1001 of total expenditures for staff training; and
(f) 1OOZ of total expenditures for refunding the Project Preparation
Advance.
All disbursements will be fully documented, except for contracts and
purchase orders of less than $50,000. Disbursement for items less than
$50,000 will be made against statement of expenditures, documentation for
Which would be held by the implementing agencies end to be made available
for inspection by supervision missions. An estimated schedule of
disbursements is given in Table 3.4. This schedule is in line with
comparable disbursements under previous Bank Group financing of specific
investment loans in Malawi. In order to expedite disbursement of funds
under the above categories of the Credit, a Special Account with a deposit
of US$1.0 million (an amount roughly equivalent to four months estimated
expenditures in US dollars) will be established and maintained in the
project entity's name in a commercial bank. The Special Account will be
replenished by the Association in accordance with agreed procedures.

0. Account tl. Auditing and Rkeortina Reouirements
3.36      Project accounts will be maintained by the three executing
agencies (MTC, MWS, MR) for their respective project components. In
previous Bank Group projects, accounts have been audited by the Auditor
General; as this arrangement has proved satisfactory, it would also be
followed under this project with regard to HTC and MWS and an international
accounting firm in the case of MR (para. 4.31). It was agreed during
negotiations that the Government will have all project accounts, as well as
the Special Account, the statement of expenditures and accounts of MRHC, PIR
and MCC Company, audited by auditors acceptable to the Association and to
have audited accounts, together with the auditors' reports, submitted to the
Association not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year for
MRHC, HR and MCC Company, and nine months for NTC and MWS (pars. 6.01(f)).
The Government has also agreed on progress reporting requirements, which
Include indices for measuring implementation, and the submission of a
project completion report, in a form satisfactory to the Association, not
later than six months after the closing date (para. 6.01(e)).
R. Environmental Impact
3.37      In general, the project would have beneficial effects on the
environment. In particular, paving the Karonga-Ibanda road will greatly
reduce dust which now adversely affects not only vehicle operators but also
many pedestrians on the highway and numerous people residing along the road.
Also, improved drainage will reduce the danger of soil erosion. As regards
lake transport, however, increase in navigational activities on the lake
through this project may affect the environment. These activities are
namely (i) increase of shipping traffic on the lake through addition of a
self-propelled pontoon to the fleet; and (Hi) increased traffic of petroleum
products (on the existing tanker). But the amount of traffic forecasted is
insignificant In comparison to the size of the lake (about 26,000 sq. km.),
and given the track record of LS in providing safe service for many years,
it is considered that the expanded services will not adversely affect the
quality of the water resources on Lake Malawi. Civil works umder the
project are limited to strengthening and paving of the existing jetties.
The existing fuel tanker is relatively new (1981) and is equipped with
standard safety equipment. During negotiations it was pointed out to the
Government that necessary precautionary measures should be taken to prevent
adverse effects on the environment from such accidents as oil spillage.
I. Resettlement of Squatters
3.38      The construction of MCC facility at Dar es Salaam will require
resettlement of people currently living on the designated site. At the time
of the project negotiations, the facility in Dar es Salaam was to be
constructed on uninhabited land outside the port area (owned by TAZARA), but
a change of plans in late 1986 moved the proposed facility to another site
that is inhabited by Tanzanian citizens. Since involuntary resettlement
appeared inevitable, the Association engaged a consultant specialist on
resettlement to visit Dar es Salaam and review the resettlement program of
the Government.



- 33 -
3.39      The assessment by the consultant,5  concluded that-the newly
designated site (adjacent to the original site) for the Dar es Salaam HCC
facility is an appropriate location for the project. This new site is
designated as an industrial development area by the Dar es Salaam City
Council and the area is rapidly becoming totally industrial; it is,
therefore, a matter of time before the romaining houses would have been
demolished and the current residents evicted.
3.40      The Association's assessment is that the resettlement practices of
the Tanzanian Govertment were generally acceptable and recommended that the
resettlement program, affecting some 3,000 people, should proceed according
to the existing practices, Including i) cash compensation for the physical
structures; and it) granting of land titles for the new housing plots in the
new resettlement site. In addition, since the resettlement site is less
developed than the current area, the Association recommended to improve the
infrastructure in the resettled area to maintain the same standard as the
present area. The recommonded improvements include i) improvements to the
road leading to the resettlement area; i) extension of electrical line;
iii) construction of a borehole well; and iv) construction of a dispensary.
The civil works Is estimated to cost about US$440,000 and an additional US$1
million for the cash compensation. The cash compensation will be paid by
the Malawi Government, while the recommended resettlement site improvements
will be financed by ODA under a separate agreement with the Government of
Tanzania.
3.41      The engineering firm carrying out the design of the MCC facilities
has been retained to carry out the engineering design required to carry out
the resettlement infrastructural works. ODA has undertaken an appraisal of
the above recommended infrastructure works and has included the financing
for them in a supplementary grant to the Tanzanian Government (para 3.27).

IV. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
General
4.01      A number of organisatiins are to be involved in future transport
operations on NTC and there is a need to evaluate whether these entities
will be financially viable. Among these organizations are trucking
companies which will operate between Chilumba (and other points In Malawi)
and Mbeya; current operations indicate that there are private companies
ready, willing and financially able to compete for this service. A number
of non-Malawian firms currently operating between Malawi points and Durban
are expected to follow the traffic as it is diverted to the northern route;
some Malawian firms also will probably participate in these operations.
TAZARA will charge rates for Malawi cargo which will adequately compensate
the railway, taking account of the costs involved.  Certain other entities
which will participate in NTC operations warrant some detailed consideration
of their financial prospectas MR, including its LS d'partment, and MCCs.
A. MR
4.02      MR was marginally, if erratically, profitable through most of the
1970s. However, since 1980, the company's financial performance has
deteriorated with losses increasing from NK 0.5 million in 1980 to around MK
6.0 million per annum in the fiscal years 1983 to 1985. This poor
performance has been due mainly to the sharp decline in the profitability of
the railway service as international traffic fell from a peak of 167 million
net ton-kilometers (712 of total goods traffic) in 1980 to 22 million net
ton-kilometers (212 of total goods traffic) in 1985, resulting from
disruption of the railway lines in Mozambique. The financial performance of
MR over the six year period to 1985.is detailed in Table 4.1.
4.03      Between 1980 and 1983, MR implemented a substantial capital
investment program totalling MK 78.4 million. About MK 61 million of this
investment was for the Salima-Lilongwe-Mchinji line extension which was
financed by bilateral grants to Governm3nt that were in turn granted to MR.
The balance of the program, mainly locomotive purehases, was financed mainly
by borrowings from the Government. Although the company's leverage remained
reasonable because of the financing of most of the investments by equity, a
combination of sharply deteriorating working profits, rising net working
capital Investments, and the interest obligation on increased long-term debt
contracted for the balance of non-grant financed investment led to mounting
liquidity problems. To alleviate these problems, the Government Increased
its financial support from under MK 0.3 million in 1979 to MK 2.7 million in
1982183, mainly through a rollover of interest due it.
4.04      Since 1983, recommendations of an ODA-financed management and
financial study commissioned in 1981 have been progressively implemented as
part of ODA's investment and technical assistance to MR. In particular, the
railway's investment programme has been sharply curtailed and investments
are now subject to more rigorous analysis. Working capital management has
Improved markedly and financial management is now clearly focused on
adjustments required by the redu;'d traffic level.

el Some rounding errors.
4.05     As part of this adjustment process, the Government has agreed to
the restructuring of MR's indebtedness to it. The terms of the
restructuring agreement provide for capitalization of MK 17 million of the
NK 48.9 million total debt to the Government and consolidation of the
balance of indebtedness into a new loun with effect from December 31, 1985.
Interest on this new loan was waived for 2 years.   This agreement is
favorable to MR, providing a sound financial performance benchmarks the
level and rate of the new loan was determined within the framework of MR's
forecast of performance after a 2-year adjustment period. Importantly, it
represents a first step towards strengthening the existing framework of
Government oversight by linking its future financial support to financial

performance requirements as opposed to subsidies through rollover of
interest payments as a means of covering losses.
4.06     Formal projections of MRe financial performance have not been
prepared since the focus of MR's involvement is LS, accounting for only a
small part of MRs total.activity. Howeoer, in the medium term, MR's
overall finanecal performance will-depend on the following factorss (i)
lncreased domestic traffic on the railways; (it) the performance of LS and,
in particular, its success in attracting NTC traffic to the railways as well
as to the lake service; and (iii) continued tight financial management.
4.07     ODA is currently Implementing a two-phase program of technical and
investment assistance to MR for railways service. Under the ongoing Phase
1, ODA will now provide an analyst to help strengthen the railway's
marketing function, rationalize the tariff structure In the light of current
circumstances, and more firmly orient the service to the requirements of the
domestic market. Phase 2, which commenced in 1986, involves rehabilitation
of the Salima-Balaka line which will strengthen the physical capability to
provide an integrated rail-lake NTC service. MR is keenly aware of the
significance of the NTC investments in LS both in terms of its impact on the
short-term cash position of MR and on its longer term benefit of greater
diversification of operations.
4.08     ODA's monitoring procedures for its investment program are sound.
It maintains a satisfactory capital expenditure review process and the
Association views as satisfactory its plans to agree on financial and
operational targets with MR to ensure that the minimum debt-service-
determined cash generation requirements from 1988 onward will be met.
B. LS
Financial Performance
4.09     Although LS is organized as a department of MR, its operations are
conducted largely independently. A senior MR manager combines
responsibilities for railway operations with overall responsibility for LS
operations. Otherwise, joint functions with railway operatioas are confined
largely to shazed accounting services. Thus joint costs are incurred only
in respect to accounting service and general management.
4.10     LS's recent operating and financial performance, summarized in
Table 4.2, has been poor with working losses in three, and operating losses
in four, of the last six years.

4.11     This poor performance ls-attributable mainly to  structural cost

efforts by Government and MR management to deal with these constraints.

4.12     Scheduled passenger service is provided by LS to numerous ports and
landings around the lake and as a consequence operating costs (predominantly
fuel) are largely fixed. At the same time, tariff levels for LS's passenger
services are severely linted by competition from bus service between many
points. The combined effect of high fixed costs and low tariffs has made it
difficult for LS to avoid large losses on this part of the business. It
thus appears that the lake passenger service is uneconomic and accordingly
the Government will require LS to restructure its passenger services.
4.13     The cargo service operates on a tramp (as offered) basis.  This
characteristic of operations has ensured that profits have been made despite
broadly stagnant traffic and the failure of tariff increases to keep pace
with fuel cost increases. Notwithstanding this comparatively good
performance, profitability could be substantially enhanced by more vigorous
marketing activities and improved vessel assignment practices.
4.14     LS began a container transport service in January 1985. This
service, based on the carriage of containers on a pontoon leased by LS from
Viphya Pulp and Paper Company, is oriented to Malawi export/import traffic
moving over the northern route. LS operates the pontoon between the two
lake ports of Chipoka (south) and Chilumba (north). The break-even level of
traffic per voyage is about 45Z of load capacity per voyage and the service
has been operating since July 1985 at significantly higher utilization
rates.



- 38 -
4.15     The existing level of tariffs in the cargo service Is considered
adequate. However, particular attention should be paid to obtaining
adequate tariff increases to offset cost increases, particularly fuel costs
(para. 4.28). There is little scope for increases in passenger tariffs to
improve the working performance of passenger services since such tariffs are
competitively set.
Traffic Pro1ections
4.16     The financial projections for LS have been prepared on two bases:
(i) forecasts of traffic on the lake with the proposed projectl and (i1)
forecasts of traffic on the lake without the project. The cargo traffic
forecasts for each of these cases and the incremental cargo traffic
attributable to the project are shown in Table 4.4 below. Forecasts of NTC
traffic and LSB8 likely share of such traffic are outlined in para. 5.11.
These forecasts are reflected in the 'with project' traffic forecasts. The
basis for the 'without project' forecasts are outlined in paras. 4.17 to
4.19 below.

4.17     Without the project, breakbulk cargo which currently consists
largely of fertilixers and agricultural produce is forecast to grow at 7.7S
p.a. from 1985 to 1989. This growth largely reflects the national
agricultural marketing organization ADMARC's increasing use of LS in
preference to more expensive road hauliers. With the full mplementation of
NTC project components in northern Malawi and Tanzania, fertilizer shipments



- 39 -
on the lake are forecast to decline substantially since most points in the
north of Malawi can be more economically served by road with fertilizer
imported through Tanzania. However, It is expected that, even without
additional investments in the ports, LS will attract NTC breakbulk traffic
because of Its cost advantage over road transport.
4.18     Container transport on LS is cheaper on a per-ton-kc basis than
road transport, transshipment costs being Included In both cases. LS
introduced a scheduled container service during 1985186. This service was
discontinued in 1987 because of low demand relative to the fixed cost of
operations. Shippers have been reluctant to use the route to any great
extent because of the erratic availability of trucking services between
Chilumba and Mbeya and handling problems at Mbeys. Nonetheless, the
shippers' perception of the potential reliability of the service offered by
LS has increased markedly.  Hence, even without the LS sub-project some
container traffic is expected to use the lake. However, the amount of such
traffic would be severely limited by lack of container handling equipment
and storage facilities at the ports and, in the longer term, by inadequate
vessel capacity. Currently, the lake ports do not have adequate facilities
to efficiently handle more than 20,000 tons of containerized traffic whilst
the effective capacity of the container vessel is .0,000 tons p.a. The
forecast of container traffic on the lake in the absence of the proposed
project investment Is based on the above factors and recent (October 1985)
evidence of containerized traffic on the lake.
4.19     Currently, all fuel movements on the lake are from the southern
lake port of Chipoka to the two main northern lake ports of Chilumba and
Nkhata Bay. Fuel movements on the lake were relatively depressed in 1985 at
about 5,000 tons due to severe fuel shortages in Malawi. Such movements are
expected to recover to about 8,000 tons in 1987, and, thereafter, stay
broadly constant to 1990. With completion of the NTC fuel handling
facilities in Tanzania, it is anticipated that fuel for areas now served
from the two northern lake ports will be supplied by road from Mbeya. This
will free the LS's only dedicated fuel carrier for transport of fuel
imported through Tanzania and destined for southern Malawi. Although the
existing container vessel also has fuel carrying capability it is unlikely
to be utilized for fuel transport since this would severely disrupt its
scheduled service thereby reducing its service reliability. Accordingly, in
the without project case it is assumed that fuel transport from 1990 onwards
is limited to the dedicated fuel vessels' Affective annual capacity.
4.20     Passenger traffic on the lake has grown at an average rate of 41
p.s. over the last decade. Growth in demand has been partly determined by
available passenger vessels capacity. Passenger vessel capacity was
increased by the commissioning of a new vessel in 1981. However, to reduce
the growing working losses incurred in the passenger services this increase
has subsequently been offset, in part, by reductions in the number of
voyages undertaken by the oldest and least efficient vessel in the fleet.
This vessel now undertakes only a few relief voyages a year. In addition,
the number of voyages undertaken by the next least fuel efficient vessel
have recently been gradually reduced. Consultants recently reviewed the
traffic prospects for the passenger service and the appropriate structure of
services to meet demand and contain working losses. The consultant's report
suggests that there is substantial latent demand for passenger services on



- 40 -
the lake. However, this demand because of its distribution cannot be
satisflod by expansion of the current levol and mode of services without
significant deterloration In the financial performanc, of LS. Accordingly,
It is assumed in this analysis that passengor traffic stays constant at the
1985 level through the projection period.
Financial Projections
4.21     Projected income and cash flow statements, based on the traffic
assumption detailed in pars. 4.16 to 4.20 above, 1987 costs and tariffs
(excluding container tariffs) escalated by projected domestic inflation
through to 1989 and incorporating tho effects of the project are summarized
in Table 4.5 below and detailed In Annex 2. Tables 2. 3 and 4.   About 63%
of the total value of investments under the project vill consist of building
and civil works structures   These assets have useful lives significantly in
excess of the most favorable term on debt by Government to parastatals (15
years). To ensuro a prudent capital structure it is assumed that overall
only about 601 of the value of investments in fixed assets is on-lent to MR.
The balance of investments is assumed to be passed on to MR, through its
holding company, as equity. No balance sheets for LS are available as
working capital data are not separately broken out from MR accounts and most
physical assets have been fully depreciated.

4.22     The above table shows that, based on assumptions that are believed
to be conservative, LSBs financial situation Is strengthened by the proposed
project. Debt service coverage is satisfactory in all years. Overall net
cash flow Is substantial enough to allow significant transfers of cash to MR
from 1991 onward.

Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analyses
4.23     The incremental financial rate of return under the project based on
the difference in cash flow between the 'with and Nwithout' project
forecasts is 101. This base case return is acceptable.
4.24     LS faces 2 major risks In undertaking this project.  These are
thats (i) the project costs may turn out to be higher than estimated end,
more significantly, (iU) the anticipated levels of NTC traffic on the lake
may not materialize. In regard to the first risk, sensitivity analyses
assuming a 101 increase in project capital costs have been prepared. These
show that the financial rate of return declines from around 10 to 92 with
such an event. The risk of an Implementation period for the project longer
than envisaged in the financial analysis is one of the potential sources of
cost overruns. In addition, anticipated project benefits will be deferred
with such an eventuality. The financial analysis for the LS investments
assumes a target implementation period of a total of 3.5 years. An
implementation period of six years, which reflects more general Bank project
experience in Malawi, will lead to a decline in the base case FRR on LS
investments from 101 to 91.
4.25     The risk that the level of fuel traffic on the lake will fall short
of the forecast levels is small sinces (i) the Goverament has already
decided to import 502 of Malawi's fuel requirements through Tanzania
assuming the fuel handling capabilities of NTC are developed; (Ui) LS
tariffs for fuel transport are cheaper on a per-ton-km basis than road
transport (Table 5.09, page 62); and (iii) the basic fuel handling
facilities are already in place in the main lake ports. There is, however,
the possibility that the NTC fuel handling facilities in Tanzania may not be
completed on time thereby deferring the introduction of NTC fuel movements
on the lake.
4.26    Although LS's tariffs for breakbulk and container movements are
cheaper than road transport rates, there is the risk that shippers may
prefer alternative routes or modes to an extent greater than forecast or
that the Malawian economy may not perform as well as the basis for the
traffic forecast indicates. However, it seems reasonable to assume that
choice of route will be largely on the basis of comparative cost and
reliability of service; the costs clearly favor NTC and the operation of the
MCCs is designed to assure reliability of transport on NTC. Overall transit
time on NTC should be less than that on southern routes. The impact of
traffic-related risks on the project's viability have been tested by
sensitivity analyses and the results are presented in Table 4.6.

- 42 -
4.27     In view of the adverse impact of project cost increases on the
project's viability, substantive measures have been taken to minimise
possible sources of increases in such costs. The cost estimates for the
civil works components are based on recently received bids and there is
adequate provision under the project for close supervision of all civil
works components. In respect of traffic related risks, the terms on which
the project assets will be passed on to HR will take account of the fact
that the project is a significant developmental venture. This will require
the potential risks to LS's ongoing financial viability to be carefully
balanced against the much greater returns to the economy (estimated economic
rate of return of 152). In this regard, Government agreed during
negotiations to transfer project assets to LS in the form of a mixture of
debt and equity on terms and conditions to be determined in consultation
with the Association. Further, LS's operations enjoy an important defensive
characteristic in respect to traffic declines: cash operating costs are
largely fixed and determined by voyage schedules which in turn are
ultimately determined by the amount of traffic expected to be on offer. In
the case of the proposed project container vessel, for example, the
operating cashflow break-even point when carrying containers but no fuel is
only 28% of its annual effective container load capacity of 42,000 tons.
The sensitivity analysis with regard to traffic declines assumes that voyage
schedules are maintained as in the base case to preserve a given level of
service. The impact of traffic declines on the FRR is significantly less
than indicated if account is taken of the flexibility in voyage scheduling
available. Under the project, LS's operations planning capability will be
strengthened to, amongst othe things, enhance its ability to make
appropriate decisions about oyage schedules given prospective traffic,
operating costs and tariffs.
4.28     Since the LS vessels' fixed costs are predominantly fuel, this
project's viability is very sensitive to fuel price increases not matched by
appropriate tariff increases or sufficient gains in traffic. Sensitivity
analyses indicate that a 10 p.a. increase in fuel prices unmatched by
appropriate increases in overall tariff levels decreases the base case FRR
from 101 to 52. To protect against the risk of inadequate tariff increases
to offset operating cost increases, agreement was reached with Government
during negotiations that LS would be set explicit financial performance
targets (para. 4.29). The attainment of such targets may necessitate,
amongst other measures, the commercially appropriate adjustment of tariffs
in the light of cost increases ane traffic prospects.
Financial Covenants
4.29     LS has in the past operated with only the broad financial
objective, mediated through the annual budget, of minimizing cash losses in
the passenger services and cash costs in the cargo service. LS assumed
little market risk. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the
Government that LS be set a formal financial objective of achieving a
working ratio of no more than 100% during the first year of project
implementation, 952 in the second year and 901 to the end of the
implementation period. To facilitate attainment of such an objective,
agreement was reached with Government that MR be allowed to restructure the
passenger service of LS over a period of three years (June 30, 1988 to June
30, 1991) to progressively reduce its working losses. Agreement was reached



_ 4k 
with the Government that the funds for the LS related investment will be
transferred to LS on a mixture of on-lending and equity contribution from
the Government on terms and conditions to be determined In consultation with
the Association (para. 6.01(g)).
4.30     During negotiations, agreement was reached with Government that it
will consult with the Association before undertaking any major investments
in vessels and In port maintenance facilities (para. 6.01(a)).
Auditin2 and Reportinx Requirements
4.31     MR's financial accounting and internal control systems for project
implementation are adequate to record and report project-related financial
transactions. MR's annual accounts are audited by a locally-based affiliate
of a reputable international accounting firm and are released within 6
months of the end of the financial year. The auditors are acceptable to the
Association. During negotiations, agreement was reached with HR that
project-related transactions be separately audited by its auditors and
furnished to the Association together with HR's audited annual accounts no
later than 6 months after the end of the finsacial year (para. 3.36 and
para. 6.01(f)).
C. MCCs
Proiect Description and Operation
4.32     MCCs will comprise two physically d stinct but organizationally and
operationally integrated facilitiess (i) the fuel storage and transport
facilities; (i$) the dry cargo goods transshipment terminals. The fuel
storage and transport facilities will consist of tank farms at Dar es Salaam
and Mbeya in southern Tanzania and a fleet of tank wagons and tank
containers to be dedicated to the transport of Malawi fuel. The dry cargo
transshipment terminals will consist of a road/rail terminal at Nbeya and a
port/raillroad terminal in the vicinity of the port of Dar es Salasm. The
operators of the MCC will operate a rail freight reservation service to
achieve optimum use of the existing TAZARA link between Hbeya and Dar es
Salasm. In respect of dry cargo movements, this service will initially
involve periodic booking of TAZARA wagons. However, it is expected to be
expanded to Include the lease of wagons from TAZARA to form unit trains
dedic*ited to the movement of Malawi Cargo. Agreement has been reached with
TAZARA under the bilateral agreement between the governments of Malawi and
Tanzania that it will facilitate such an arrangement.
4.33     For dry cargo operations, Malawi import cargo arriving by ship at
Dar es Salaam will be unloaded from ship side and transferred to MCC in Dar
as Saleam from where it will be shipped by rail to Hbeya. At Mbeys, the
cargo will be offloaded and stored for subsequent transfer by truck trailers
to Malawi. The reverse flow will apply to traffic from Mbeya. In respect
of the fuel operations, fuel will be railed in unit trains consisting of the
dedicated tanker wagons for diesellpetrol and tank containers on flats for
jet fuel from Dar es Salaam to Mbeya. The tank containers will be offloaded
to a segregated container park and the diesellpetrol pumped into the tanks
to await transfer to road vehicles for onward shipment to Halawi. The
investment in equipment in the facilities have been sized to attain timely
transfer of cargo from/to the port of Dar es Salaam and tolfrom road and
rail.



- 44 -
Organizational Structure
4.34     Three entities will be involved in the ownership and management of
the MCCss  (i) the Government of Malawi, (1i) MRHC, the parent company of
MR, and (lit) a mixed enterprise company comprising Malawi private sector
investors and two parastatals. Funding for the construction and equipment
of the facilities will be provided on a grant basis to the Government of
Malawi by ODA and USAID. The Government of Malawi will vest the assets in
MRHC. MRHC as the asset holding company will in turn lease the assets to
MCC Company which will be a company consisting of Malawi private sector
investors, MR and the Petroleum Control Commission (PCC), an oil industry
regulatory body with significant private sector oil company ripresentation.
MCC Company will be created specifically to manage the assets of the
facilities and to promote and market the use of such facilitfes and NTC.
4.35     MRHC will be responsible for supervision of the use of assets and
facilities to ensure that operations are consistent with the attainment of
optimal lives for the assets. NRHC will also be the primary party In
resolving disputes between MCC Company and TAZARA who will be providing the
critical railways link between Mbeya and Dar es Salasm. A substantial
reason for the Government to vest the assets of the MCCs In MRHC is that the
roles described above can be most appropriately discharged by a party with a
direct financial interest in the success of MCCs.  In the case of HRHC,
there is a further incentive to good performance since the financial
performance of its subsidiary's lake operations will be improved with the
success of MCCs.
4.36     The creation of MCC Company as a lessee company Is predicated on
the fact thac development of MCCs involves significant market and operating
risks balanced by substantial potential benefits to the country. These
risks make it unlikely that Maliwi private sector enterprises with
significant interests and experience in the transport and transport services
industry will invest directly in establishing transshipment facilities on
the scale and in the long-lived assets necessary to generate substantial
benefits to the country. Leasing of the proposed MCC facilities enables the
Government, through MRHC, to attract the necessary private sector expertise
and interest to the management and marketing of the facilities and NTC by
reducing the investment risk to be borne by such investors.
4.37     Malawi has a broad spectrum of transport services comp *ies.
Several of the largest of these companies have expressed a strong interest
in subscribing to the share capital of MCC Company. An ownership structure
with such a broad mix of companies will endow MCC Company with access, at
board level, to expertise in freight forwarding, freight brokerage,
transport services marketing, etc. In addition, such a balanced composition
of investors in the transport and transport services sector will ensure that
MCC Company, which will provide services complementary to such companies'
activities, will not be viewed as partial to the interest of any one
company. MCC Company will concentrate exclusively on developing NTC. This
is in contrast to the market position of the companies in the transport
sector, almost all of which have significant interests in alternative
routes. Finally, award of a lease to an entity like MCC Company In contrast



- 45 -
to a periodic awa.d of an operating lease to varying operators will ensure
continuity of operations which will be the best means of developing local
expertise in terminal and associated operations. The proposed structure of
MCC Company is acceptable to the Association.
4.38     It is envisaged that in its initial years of operation, MCC Company
will hire the services of companies experienced in dry cargo terminal
operations on the scale anticipated to manage the operations of the
facility. Similarly, the fuel tank farms will be managed on a day-to-day
basis by one of the oil companies currently operating similar facilities in
Tanzania. Although the terms of any management contract will be determined
on commercial grounds by MCC Company, the terms of the.leasing agreement
between MRHC and MCC Company will specify that award of such a contract be
subject to competitive bidding procedures acceptable to HRHC.
4.39     The financial arrangements between the Government, MRHC and MCC
Company have been designed such as to ensure that all parties assume an
appropriate level of risk and have a high incentive to make the proposed
system a success. In the case of MRHC, the terms on which the assets will
be vested in it recognize the different levels of market risk attached to
the dry cargo operations and the fuel storage and transport operations. The
transfer of all assets will be effected on the basis of 60% of the value of
the assets being assumed by MRHC as a debt obligation to Government and the
balance (40Z) of the value of assets representing an equity contribution by
Government in MRHC. The debt will be substantially on standard Malawi
Government lending terms to parastatals - 10 p.a. interest and 15 years
repayment period. Two classes of debt securities will be created: (i) one
reflecting the value of the fuel facilities assets transferred as debt,
(ii) the other reflecting the value of dry cargo terminals' assets
transferred as debt. There will be a grace period of three years from the
commencement of operations in respect of all debt service obligations on the
dry cargo assets related debt. Debt service on the fuel facilities related
debt will be due from commencement of the facilities' operations.
4.40     The Government has accepted the recommendation of an NTC Operations  l
Study Team comprised of staff from MTC, ODA and the Association that the
terms of the lease of the dry cargo terminals' assets by MRHC to MCC Company
should provide for an implicit rate of return on its total investments in
the facilities of 52 p.a. over the assessed lives of the individual assets.
In respect of the fuel facilities' assets, it is envisaged that the terms of
the lease of the assets to MCC Company will provide for an implicit rate of
return of 12% p.a. The lease payments on the dry cargo terminals' assets
will be deferred for three years from commencement of operations.
Thereafter they will be paid annually in arrears. The lease payments on the
fuel facilities will be due one year in arrears from the commencement of the
facilities' operations. The differential in payment terms and conditions
reflects the differential market risks faced by the two business segments.
Government has a defined policy of diversifying the country's source of
fuel. It is committed to acquiring 50Z of total domestic fuel requirements
through the port of Dar es Salaam. Accordingly the fuel facilities will
enjoy a high degree of assurance of adequate fuel throughput. In contrast,
the preference of the potential customers for the dry cargo facilities are
more diffused. It is reasonable to expect that it will take time to
demonstrate that the NTC is commercially viable. The lease agreement



- 46 -
between H1WC and MCC Company will provide for a minimum lease period. The
contingent lease payments for the lease period will be contractual
obligations of MCC Company to HRHC. Provisions for adequate resources to be
available or to be on call will be Incorporated in the Articles of
Association of MCC Company. To ensure that MRHC earns in total a
competitive return on its dry cargo terminals assets, the lease agreement
will provide for a pr*fit sharing arrangement in the first three years of
operations when the lease payments will be waived. Thereafter a modified
profit sharing arrangement will supplement its income from the basic lease
payment on the dry cargo assets.
4.41     The financial arrangements ensure that both MRHC and MCC Company
assume a measure of financial risk principally related to the total flow of
traffic. IMRHC will forego part of the resources used in supervising the us'e_
of the facilities and assets while MCC Company will lose part of its lease
payments and the fixed costs of operating and marketing the facilities if
traffic falls below certain traffic cashflow break-even levels judged
attainable (see paras. 4.44 and 4.45). On the other hand, because the total
costs of both entities are largely fixed, the rewards once the traffic
breal.-even levels are exceeded can be substantial. The arrangements,
however, recognize that this is a significant development venture where the
total returns to the country substantially exceed the returns to these two
entities (economic rate of return of 311 for the dry cargo facilities and
312% for the fuel facilities versus a total financial rate of return to MCCs
of 12X). Accordingly, it is reasonable that Government bears a substantial
portion of the investment risks if for unexpected reasons the venture does
not succeed at the levels anticipated. These arrangements are acceptable to
the Association.
4.42     To ensure success of the MCC concept, the organizations detailed
above should be in a position to participate as fully as possible in the
process of construction and acquisition of assets for MCCs and in detailed
definition of the terms of the working agreements appended to the bilateral
agreement on transit traffic facilitation. To this end, the Association
agreed with the Government and MR tbat by June 30, 1988 It will, in
consultation with the Association, take all measures necessary to: (i)
suitably amend the Articles of Association of HRHC to empower it to hold
physical assets and execute a subsidiary loan agroement; (ii) register MCC
Company as a limited liability company under Malawi company law and solicit
potential shareholders; and (iII) prepare a draft lease agreement between
NHEC and MCC (para. 6.01(h)).
Competitive Backzround
4.43     The primary consideration at this stage is to assess the long-term
financial viability of MCC and Its attractivoness to commercially oriented
investors. Hence, the financial analysis in this report focuses firstly on
assessment of the levels of traffic and pricing necessary to provide
adequate returns to MRHC and MCC Company and the related competitive
implications. Then the result of this analysis Is used in the forecast of
MCC Company's financial performance given the traffic forecasts for NTC.

4.44     In respect of the dry cargo operations of MCC Company, the cash
flow break-even levels of traffic to ensure that MRUC earns a 5S p.a. return
on its assets at various price levels for handling and storage of containers
and breakbulk cargo are detailed In Annex 3(a) and summarized In Table 4.7
below. The table is based on the assumption that the unavoidable costs,
both operating and capital of MCC Company are allocated to containers and
breakbulk cargo pro rats to their projected maximum traffic (attained In
year 2000). For purposes of this analysis, all general management costs are
assigned to the dry cargo operations.

at Assumed 12 tons per container.
4.45     The lease payments assumed in the break-even analysis imply a debt
service cover of about 1.Ox for NRHC at the indicated break-even traffic
levels.!/ Traffic generated over and above the break-even levels
contributes directly to returns on the equity invested in both MRHC and MCC.
The traffic projections outlined in Chapter 5 indicate that, subject to the
prices that can be charged for the services provided, MCC Company should
readily break even in overall operations and MRHC should be able to service
its debt.
4.46     For containerized cargo from the Blantyre area, the current cost
differential between the NTC route (using rail/lake in Malawi and road in
Tanzania) and the southern route to Durban is about MK 340-MK 450 per 12 ton
container in favor of the former. Cost savings from use of rail versus road
between Nbeys and Dar es Salaam amount to around MK llOO/container.
Currently, shippers do not benefit from savings realized by use of the
railways because of freight forwarders' uncertainty about the availability
of railway services and the poor transshipment facilities. Organizing and
financing a block train service on TAZARA specifically serving the two MCC
terminals with schedules, determined by the operator, should minimize
uncertainty of freight forwarders and permit a substantial widening of the
cost differential vis-a-vis the southern route as well as make the route
more cost-competitive with the Mozambique routes if and when the latter are
reopened. On the basis of the above, MCC handling charges for containers
could be very high and yet not erode the competitive advantage of using NTC.
61 Assuming equal annual payments over the life of the debt of MRHC.



-48-
4.47     For breakbulk traffic, the transport cost differential between NTC
(using TAZARA) and the southern route to Durban for cargo from south Malawi
Is about RK 100/ton in favor of the northern route. With full operation of
MCC, this differential vill be partly eroded by handling charges at MCC.
However, transport security will be considerably enhanced. Breakbulk
transport fromito northern Malawi, which is expected to comprise a
significant proportion of NTC breakbulk traffic, will enjoy significant cost
advantages over the use of the route to Durban. Overall, however, pricing
of MCC breakbulk handling services will be relatively sensitive to
competitive conditions on the alternative southern route to Durban.
4.48     For the fuel storage and transport segment of the business, the
cost of handling, storing and transporting fuel from Dar-es-Salsam to
Lilongwe (including the lake stretch) plus payment of a 42 commission on
such costs to MCC Company for supervisory, transport brokerage and
administrative services provided has been estimated at 23.0 tambalas/litre
for diesel and petrol for the levels of throughput projected for 1991.
These costs represent around 701 of the cost of such services on alternative
routes with RSA sourcing. The MCC's cost competitiveness is further
bolstered by the fact that a significant proportion of the fuel to be
delivered through NTC is destined for northern Malawi thereby necessitating
even shorter transit distances.
Financial Proiections
4.49     Projections of the financial performance of MCC Company based on
traffic projections for NTC outlined in Chapter 5 are detailed in Annex 3(b)
to 3(e) and summarized in Table 4.8 below. The financial projections are
based on the division of MCC Company's operations into two business segments
(dry cargo and fuel) reflecting their distinct operating charvcteristics.
For the dry cargo business segment it is assumed that handling charges will
be MK36/ton for breakbulk and MK450/container for containerized traffic.
These changes, representing respectively about 402 and 302 of the savings in
total transport costs (net of MCC projected handling costs) that will be
realised with establishment of MCCs for transport of breakbulk and
containers are considered reasonably conservative.  Jet fuel, which will be
containerized, is assigned to the dry cargo business and the related
handling services are assumed priced at a premium of 202 on container
tariffs to reflect its additional handling costs. For the fuel business,
all costs of operations incurred to third parties on diesel, petrol and
kerosene handling will be charged through to the oil companies. Commission
on such costs is assumed at 42 and is assumed to be based on (i) the
difference between the per litre FOB cost of product and the delivered cost
(excluding duty and surtax) to Chilumba in Malawi and (Ui) the estimated net
amount delivered based on the losses incurred on deliveries to Chilumba.
The commission rate is considered reasonable and its basis provides an
incentive for close supervision of operations by MCC Company. No account is
taken of the necessary investment and income from operating a unit train
service, although such operation Is likely to be financially viable.7/
7/ The basis of such service would be the charge of a premium on TAZARA
tariffs to shippers to offset the cost of leasing wagons from TAZARA and
provide a return on organizing the service.

- 50 -
common costs If this is assessed on a prorated traffic level basis. The
projected financial performance of the fuel handling business Is
satisfactory especially in view of the limited market risk assumed by MCC
Company.
4.51     The overall level of cash generation of the MCC. Is satisfactory.
Total cash generation increases from MK 2.4 million in 1990 to, MK 8.2
million in 2000. The proportion of such cash generation accruing to MCC
Company rises from MK 0.4 million in 1990 to MK 2.5 million in 2000.  MRHC's
debt service cover increases from 1.5 In 1993--the first yesr of full debt
service payments on all debt--to 1.7 in 2000. This level of cover is
acceptable.
Financial Rate of Return
4.52     The base case Financial Rate of Return (FRR) to the MCC sub-project
is estimated at 122. The gross rate of return on equity to MRRC is
estimated at 112.8/ The residual cash flow of the MCC Company after lease
payments and profit shuring is projected as rising from MK 0.4 million in
1990 to NK 1.7 million In 1995 and MK 2.5 million in 2000. This lovel of
cash flow generation should ensure that MCC Company, subject to its
aunagement and administrative costs in Malawi, earns an attractive return on
the investment it Is likely to make in the entity. The projected rate of
return on the Investment of all parties in MCC is thus acceptable on the
base case.
Sensitivity Analysis
4.53     The project faces 2 main ricks both in respect of the dry cargo
operations: (i) the price that can be charged for handling cargo to attract
the forecast level of traffic may be lower than indicated; and (it) the
level of traffic forecast may not materialize. In respect to the first
risk, the magnitude of the cost advantage of NTC over the southern route to
Durban for containerized traffic will be critically dependent on the extent
to which freight forwarders pass on the benefits of a more assured level of
service between Mbeya and Dar es Salaam to their customers. The
organisational and financial arrangements governing the MCC Company have
been partly designed to ensure that there is little Incentive for freight
forwarders and other Intermediaries to pre-empt the financial benefits that
should arise with improved service as a result of the MCC investments. The
cost advanttge for breakbulk is more marginal.  Sensitivity analyses
undertaken, however, indicate that a reduction in the charge for handling
and storage of breakbulk from the assumed 402 of expected savings through
use of NTC to 30X of such savings reduces the F%R to l12 and the return on
8/ Based on (i) profit sharing during the first 3 years of operation assessed
on 852 of the net income of the dry cargo operat;ons after deducting HK 0.5
million but before general management costs; (ii) supplemental lease
payments from the fourth year of operations assessed at 752 of the first NK
0.5 million gross profit tranches of the dry cargo operations 652 of the
second MK 0.5 million and 452 of incremental amounts thereafter; (1i1)
replacement investments financed with debt at 12S p.a. over 10 years on an
annuity basis; (iv) stream of 30 years of net cash flow attributable to
equity and terminal equity valuation of 2 times such attributable cash flow
net of the value of outstanding debt.



- 51 _
equity on MRHC to 62. These results should permit a small return on
Investment to MCC Company. The return on equity in ERHC is acceptable under
this scenario given the entity's risk-underwriting role. The result of
sensitivity analyses on the projected traffic levels are summarized in Table
4.9 below.
Table 4.9 Sensitivity Analyses on Traffic Levels

(3)  302 Reduction in Overall Dry Cargo Traffic    9             4
A sizeable decline In overall traffic will not severely affect the overall
financial rate of return. It will however, undermine the return on equity
in MRHC. Since the return on equity depends crucially on the profit sharing
and supplemental lease formula oenvisaged, such formulao will be subject to
revision as experience evolve" to protect the financial viability of MRHC
while ensuring an adequate Incentive for good porformance to MCC Company.
4.54     The project has been designed with particular  mphasis on
institutional arragements embodied in a bilateral agreement between the
governments of Tanzania and Malawi and a series of working agreements to
-nsure smooth transiting of Ealawi cargo through Tanzania and thus service
competitiveness with alternative routes. Adequate attention has been
devoted to organizational arrangements to ensure a high degree of efficiency
in the operation of the MCC facilities and a high level of commitment on the
part of MCC Company to mzrketing its services to local shippers and their
agents. These measures, In conjunction with tho intrinsically much lower
cost of transport through NTC are believed to be adequate safeguards against
traffic levels substantially lower than projected.
4.55     Finally, the financial analysis is based on a target implementation
period of 3.5 years. An implementation schedule of 6 years will load to an
increase in total investment costs in the MCCa of about 82 as compared to
the estimated costs of the target implementation schedule. The FRR under
such a longer Implementation schedule Lo estimated at 102. This FRR is
sufficient to allow an acceptable return on the investments made by all
investors in MCCs. Nonetheless, all necessary measures have beon taken to
ensure that the target Implementation schodulo is met and that the expected
ben-efits from the project are realised as soon as possible.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
General
5.01      The project is consistent with the Government's objectives in the
transport sector and represents a continuation of transport development
under previous projects financed by the Bank Group. Improvement of the
Karonga-lbanda road will continue the work begun in the 1960. to develop the
main north-south artery as an instrument of economic integration of the
three regions comprising Malawi. This road will attain special significance
as a key link of the NTC route for export/import trade of Malawi.
Rehabilitation of the Ibanda-Uyole road likewise will strengthen another
important link in this corridor. MCCs and fuel handling installations in
Tanzania will facilitate the flow of both dry cargo and bulk fuel traffic
over NTC# thus minimizing transport costs and adding to the reliability and
attractiveness of the route. Lake transport improvements will enable LS to
handle much of the export/import traffic at substantially lower cost than
alternative road transport. The Balaka-Salima road rehabilitation will not
only reduce the cost of transport for a portion of Malawi's international
traffic but also will provide notable benefits to domestic traffic.
A. Evaluation of Prolect Overall
5.02      The main benefits from the project (exclusive of the lake
component) are reductions in transport costs for a major part of Malawi's
export/import traffic which are based on forecast tonnages of such traffic
and the difference between the transport cost per ton with the project and
without the project. With the project, the traffic will be transported
between Malawi and the port of Dar es Salaa (about 1,800 acm) rather than by
the longer (about 2700-3600 km) and more costly route between Malawi and the
port of Durban. Since the 1985 closure of the relatively short railway
routes through Nozambique, about 901 of total export/import traffic has
moved through the southern corridor. To the shippers of this traffic with
assumed origin or destination in Blantyre, the savings in transport cost per
ton on NTC versus the southern transport corridor are MK 192 for fuel
imports, MK 115 for general imports and HK 103 for exports.81  NTC traffic
in 1995 is expected to reach 301,000 tons. On the basis of this traffic and
savings in transport costs per ton, forecasted savings in transport costs
for the diverted traffic in that year are projected at INK 26.8 million. The
traffic and thus the total benefits are projected to grow at a modest 3X
p.a. Sometime in the future, the railway lines through Mozambique will
probably reopen causing benefits from NTC to be somewhat reduced as
discussed below. In that case as well, however, the economy of Malawi will
benefit greatly from the reduction in transport cost attributable to the NTC
Project. Even with the Mozambique routes fully operational, NTC will remain
cost competitive for importlexport traffic of the-northern and central
regions of Malawi.
8/ The savings indicated are for road/rail route to Dar es Salasm. Savings
from use of lake route have not been included.



- 53 -
5.03      Additional benefits anticipated from the project include savings
in vehicle operating costs on normal (non-diverted) traffic and savings in
road maintenance costs on three sections of roads that will carry NTC
traffic; only in the case of the Balaka-Salima road are these benefits taken
into account in the benefit/cost analysis. In the case of the Karonga-
Ibanda road where only single-lane operation is possible on one segment,
some benefits in terms of time savings will occur as the improved road will
allow two-lane operation throughout its length; these benefits are not
quantified.
5.04      Further project benefits w.'1 derive from savings in transport
costs based on more extensive use of lake transport as compared with road
transport. The addition of a cargo vessel, various port improvements and
maintenance facilities, along with appropriate technical assistance, are
expected to result in a substantial increase in lake cargo. The benefits
from these investments are measured by the difference in transport cost
between lake service (including transshipment) and road transport, the only
alternative surface transport available. Differences in tra4sit time
between lake and road transport are about two to three days due to
transshipment requirements at the ports.
5.05      The direct beneficiaries of the savings in transport costs on
traffic diverted from the southern to the northern corridor will be the
shippers and receivers of freight. Because of competition, these savings
will be largely passed along to others through lower prices on a wide
variety of products, thus benefiting virtually the entire population. In a
similar way, the cost savings in lake transport versus road transport will
benefit nearly all population elements. Savings in vehicle operating costs
on improved roads, as well as reductions is vehicle operating time will
result in direct benefits to truck owners and operators; however, in view of
the competitive nature of the road transport industry, it is expected that
these benefits will be largely passed on as lower freight rates to the
shippers and receivers of freight. Farmers and consumers in the area of
influence of the roads are also expected to benefit from the reduced
transport costs. Some savings in road maintenance costs are also
anticipated which would be beneficial to the Government.
B. NTC Traffic Forecast
5.06      The forecast of traffic on NTC is a fundamental factor in the
economic evaluation of the project. Although the current level of Malawi
exportlimport traffic on the corridor is small, substantial traffic growth
is anticipated as the project is implemented. This section presents details
of this traffic projection and explains how the forecasts were derived. A
particularly important assumption underlying the basic forecast is that the
Mosambique rail routes to Beira and Nacala will remain closed until 1990 and
thereafter the routes will be gradually improved, permitting Malawi traffic
by 1993 to flow at a rate equal to half the potential route capacity level
and remain at that level in subsequent years. The rationale for this
traffic limit after 1993 is that there may well be continued banditry
interference with the operation of the lines and, in any case, the poor
condition of the facilities would probably seriously restrict the operating
capacity of both lines (particularly the Beira line) since rehabilitation
would be costly and time-consuming. Consideration Is also given to the
effect of variations in the reopening assumption on future levels of NTC
traffic.

5.07      National trade of Malswi Is forecast to reach 932,000 tons in 1990
and the pattern of origins and destinations is expected to remain much the
same as in 1985. For example, in the case of tea exports, 67Z was destined
for overseas, 31X for South African and 22 for regional markets while 94S of
the tea originated in the south of Malawi and 62 in the Mxuzu area.  In the
case of fertilizer importst 502 originated In RSA and 502 overseas while 36Z
of the product was destined for southern Malawi, 192 for the Kasungu area
and the balance for other locations. The traffic was assigned among various
routes taking into account comparative cost of transport on the routes.
Another consideration was the policy of the Malawi Government to spread
procurement and transport risks among available sources and routes. An
additional factor in traffic assignment was the time required not only to
build up capacity and operational expertise on NTC route but also to develop
shipper confidence in that route.
5.08      A forecast of commodity breakdown of NTC traffic in 1995 is as
follows: export commodities of 33,000 tons of tobacco, 20,000 tons of tea
and 72,000 tons of other goods; imports of 55,000 tons of fuel, 74,000 tons
of fertilizer and 47,000 tons of other commodities. Thus 125,000 tons of
exports and 176,000 tons of imports, cr a total of 301,000 tons, are
expected to move on the corridor In 1995. This volume is about one third of
Malawi's total exportlimport traffic. No sugar exports or coal imports have
been included in the rather conservative traffic forecast but it may be
possible to attract Dwangwa sugar exports to the route as well as other
traffic.
5.09      A commodity breakdown of future NTC traffic is shown in Table
5.01. About 332 of the traffic will be transported as breakbulk, some 502
will be containerized and the remaining amount will consist of bulk fuel.
The forecast represents half of potential maximum NTC traffic if the
analysis was based only on cost differential between southern route and NTC.

5.10     The foregoing estimates reflect the unlerlying assumption that the
Mozambique routes will reopen in 1988 and by 1993 will accommodate MalawA
traffic equal to half the potential capacity of those routes. If,
alternatively, it Is assumead that the Mozambique routes remained closed
indefinitely, the NTC traffic would be about 502 greater than this base
forecast. If the Mozambique routes are assumed to reopen fully in 1990 and
remain open thereafter, then the NTC traffic would be only 621 of the base
forecast.
5.11     Shippers of traffic on NTC have a choice between different
transport modes on certain sectors. Between Dar es Salaam and Mbeya where
railway and road transport are available, it is quite clear that all traffic
will be transported more cheaply on TAZARA than on the TANZAM Highway.
Between Chilumba and Chipoka it is also clear that traffic will move at
lower cost by lake than by road but since traffic origins and destinations
are widely dispersed within Malawi, only a third of total NTC traffic will
be transported by LS. Accordingly, the forecasted NTC traffic on the lake
Is about 108,000 tons in 1995 (Table 4.4). Relatively high proportions of
NTC fuel traffic (551) and NTC container traffic (471) are expected to be
transported on the lake while lower proportions of breakbulk will be shipped
by this mode.
C. Economic Analysis
Evaluation of Proiect Overall
5.12     The economic justification of the NTC Project Is based on an
assessment of economic costs and benefits with and without the project over
the estimated 20 year life of the major components. Since the cargo
handling equipment 'or MCCs and lake ports, as well as the equipment for the
maintenance facility, are assumed to have an economic life of only 7 years,
additional investments for replacement of such equipment are taken into
account in the economic analysis. Recognizing the uncertainty concerning
the future feasibility of operating on the traditional access routes through
Mosambique, particular consideration is given to determining the minimum
number of years required for the project to yield an acceptable Economic
Rate of Return (ERR).
5.13     The project investments In NTC are shown in Table 5.02.  The
Implementation period is assumed to be siX years, based on past experience
with transport projects as reflected in the standard disbursement profile,
with 81 of the investments occurring in 1988, 131 in 1989, 211 in 1990, 251
in 1991, 191 in 1992, and 142 in 1993. The project should begin to produce
some benefits in 1990 and full-year benefits in 1993. This would yield an
acceptable ERR of 162. On the other hand, if the Implementation period is
assumed to be 3.5 years, as indicated on the target implementation schedule
(Chart 1), the overall ERR will improve to 211. Analysis of the individual
components have been carried out for both, 6 year and 3.5 year
implementation schedule.  Additionally, a satisfactory ERR is indicated even
if one considers the economic life of the project to be substantially less
than 20 years. 6.5 years of project life are required to yield an
acceptable 101 ERR.

Economic Evaluation of Various Proiect Components
5.14     While the NTC project as a whole has been shown to be economically
justified with ERR of 161 (ERR of 212 for 3.5 year fimplementation), one may
question whether some particular component or components may be unjustified.
The purpose of this section is to analyse specific components and ascertain
whether each can be found to have an acceptable economic return. The
general approach has been as follows; first, consideration is given to the
Karonga-Ibanda-Uyole road improvement which Is assigned the highest
priority; benefits related to the road are based on the diverted traffic
that can be attributed to this improvement aloie. Second, this road
component and MCCa are then treated together, as the latter depends on the
former, and the larger volume of diverted traffic in this case is the basis
for benefit estimates for the Joint component. Third, the fuel handling
component is analysed separately and the benefits in this case are based on
diverted bulk fuel only. Fourth, the lake service component is considered
with benefits derived from the estimated volume of RTC traffic on the lake
attracted by lower transport costs on the lake than on the road between
Chilumba and southern points In Malawi. Finally, the Balaka-Salima road is
analysed with benefits largely based on vehicle operating cost savings for
normal and NTC traffic. Special care is taken to avoid assigning more
benefits to a particular component than is appropriate.
Karonta-Ibanda-Uvole Road
5.15     The most severe constraint on NTC at present is the unreliable
condition of the Karonga-Ibanda-Uyole road and the improvement of this road
is the most important single action that could be taken to attract a major
volume of traffic to the route. The improvement required is to upgrade the
poor gravel road between Karonga and lbanda to a two-lane paved standard and
to rehabilitate selected segments of the paved road between Ibanda and
Uyole. The efficiency and zeliability of transport on this vital road
depends on these improvements.
5.16     Malawi importlexport traffic on this route, with the improvement,
would attract traffic primarily with origins and destinations in the
northern and central part of Malawi. Following are traffic estimates:

This traffic, Increasing at 32 p.a., would be diverted from the southern
corridor route becaue of th* transport cost advantage of RTC, as Indicated
in the following comparison:

Corridor', July 1985, and mission estimatee.
5.17     The estimated benefits from the traffic diversion are derived from
the projected traffic volumes and the transport costs savings per ton. Thus
in 1995, the benefits are:
Table 5.05 Benefits from Karonta-Ibanda-Uvole Road

Tea                1,500
Fertiliser         5,504
Other Imports/
Exports          3,384
Total       10.388
5.18     The benefits and costs of this project component are shown in Annex
j and yield an 11 ERR (132 ERR for 3.5 year implementation).
Significantly, only the benefits from traffic diversion are taken into
account; savings in vehicle operating costs on normal traffic (non-diverted
traffic) and savings in road maintenance costs aro Ignored. Even if no
other project components are undertaken, improvement of the Karonga-Ibanda-
Uyole road would be viable.
KCCs
5.19     Investment in MCCs would clearly not be justified on the basis of
the present low level of Malswi transit traffic through Tanzania. Only if
the Karonga-Ibanda-Uyole road were improved would there be sufficient
traffic on the NTC to warrant development of MCCs. Thus the analysis of
MCCs is based on the assumption that the road component f undertaken
concurrently.
5.20     MCC. at Mbeya and Dar as Salaam will have a substantial impact on
the ability of RTC to attract Nalawi export/import traffic. Intermodal
transshipment points are vulnerable to delays of traffic and loss and damage



- 59 -
to freight. Thue, it is of special Importance to provide appropriate
equipment and facilities at these points and to organize transshipment
operations that will ensure the efficient flow of traffic along the route.
There is little doubt that the two centers will enhance the quality of
transport service on the routes they will expedite the flow of traffic thus
minimizing transit time, hold down loss and damage to goods and ensure
greater attractiveness of the route for Malawi shippers and importers.
Moreover, the greater efficiency of intermodal transfer, with MCC8, will
translate into lower transport costs than would otherwise occur.
5.21     Traffic on NTC has been estimated assuming that both the Karonga-
Ibanda-Uyole road and MCCs are implemented.  On this basis, the total volume
of Malawi dry cargo export/import traffic on the NTC is estimated as
follows:

(tons '000)

Total Dry Cargo                  212            246            286
This traffic would have origins and destinations within a broad area of
northern, central and southern Malawi.  With the development of MCCs as vell
as NTC road, NTC could compete even more effectively with the southern route
than in the case where only that road is undertaken.
5.22     Transport cost advantages of ITC over the southern route would be
substantial for the large volume of import/export traffic estimated. The
weighted average transport costs, by commodity, and the savings in such
costs are as follows:
Table 5.07 Transport Cost (includinx MCC Transshlpment)

These costs reflect the origins and destinations, within Malawi, that
account for the major traffic volumes of particular commodities.
5.23     Benefits from the NTC road/MCC component have been estimated on the
basis of the foregoing traffic projections and transport cost savings per
ton. AccordisZly, in 1995 the following benefits are derived:

5.24     The benefits a*. costs represented by the NTC road/MCCs are
presented in Annex 5. They yield ERR of 161 (211 ERR for 3.5 year
implementation). Thus, if only MCCs and the Karonga-Ibanda-Uyole road were
undertaken, the result would be an acceptable economic return.
5.25     The benefits and costs for MCCs alone are presented in Annex 5,
pate 3. The benefits are the differences between the benefit streams for
the NTC road and the NTC road plus MCCs.. The economic return is derived
based on the ilK 42.0 million investment cost for MCCs and the indicated net
benefits. On this basis, ERR is found to be 24S (31S ERR for 3.5 year
implementation).
Fuel Handlinz System
5.26     The import of fuel into Mlalawi via NTC depends on the completion
not only of the fuel handling facilities in Tanzania but also the Karonga-
Ibanda-Uyole road. Unless the NTC road were improved it would be
Impractical to operate large tank trucks over that road. Equally, the
import of fuel over NTC requires the installation of fuel storsge and
pumping facilities at both Mbeya and Dar es Salaamn. Therefore, -he economic
analysis of the fuel handling facilities (including tank wagons and tank
container) assumes that the NTC road is also Improved.
5.27     Fuel traffic has been estimated by GITEC consultants at 43,000 tons
in 1991, 55,000 tons in 1995 and 70,000 tons in 2000. The benefits
attributable to fuel handling facilities are the anticipated savin s in
transport costs on fuel when diverted from the southern corridor.91 Savings
in such costs are estimated on the basis of: (i) MK 192 per ton difference
between the IlK 447 on the southern route and MK 255 on NTC (weighted average
cost for distribution to the northern and southern regions by roadirail
91 Malawi has obtained small amounts of fuel from the Zambian refinery at
Ndola; this source is not expected to account for significant fuel
imports in the future because of the high delivered cost of fuel from
Ndola relative to that from other soutces.



- 61 -
transport); and (2) the estimated traffic. Thus, in 1995, for example, the
55,000 tons of traffic would represent benefits of HK 10.6 million. Fuel
traffic and benefits are estimated to increase at 52 p.a., stabilizing at
70,000 annual throughput (design capacity). The economic return is derived
ossed on the MK 22.3 million investment cost for the fuel facilities, tank
wagons and tank containers and the indicated net benefits. On this basis,
as shown in Annex 5, ERR Is calculated at 242 (322 for 3.5 year
implementation).
Lake Transport Facilities
5.28     Goods for transport between the nortnern port of Chilumba and
various points in southern and central Malaui can be moved either by lake
transport to and from Chipoka (and often further transshipped on road or
railway) or by road transport (combined in some cases with rail transport in
central and southern areas).  For particular shipments, the choice of route
between these alternatives rests largely on comparative transport cost. The
relevant costs to consider in this situation are those shown in Table 5.09
and the cost advantage of lake transport is apparent. Taking into
consideration these unit cost savings and an estimated 83,000 tons per year
of lake traffic in the first full year of operation (additional traffic
generated by the NTC), the total savings in that year are about MK 4.7
million and with a modest growth in traffic over subsequent years the
benefits and costs are as shown in Annex 5. The table includes replacement
investments in 1997 and 2004 for cargo handling equipment and workshop
tools, the length of life of which is estimated at 7 years.  ERR is found to
be 13X (15Z ERR for 3.5 year implementation). The traffic forecast used in
the analysis is detailed in Table 4.4.

Salima-Balaka Road Rehabilitation
5.29     The Salima-Balaka road is not only the principal highway link
between Chipoka port and Blantyre but also an important link to the
lakeshore road which is the preferred road for NTC traffic originating in or
destined for Blantyre. The lakeshore road is some 60 km shorter than the
north-south sp.ne route from Karonga to Blantyre, and the easier terrain
along the lake represents relatively low vehicle operating costs. The
Salima-Balaka road has been identified in the Government's Paved Road
Rehabilitation Program as the project of highest priority because of its
condition of critical deterioration.

5.30     Normal traffic (excluding NTC traffic on the Salima-Balaka road) is
shown in Table 5.10. Estimates for 1988 and subsequent years are based on a
traffic growth rate of 52 p.a. NTC traffic on the road has been estimated
at 45,000 tons or about 10 heavy trucks per day. The estimated traffic is
about 15 pereent of the total traffic destined for or originating in
Blantyre and the Southern Region; the remaining traffic will move by rail.
NTC traffic on the Salima-Balaka road is estimated to grow at 32 p.a., about
the same growth rate as for overall NTC traffic. Unit savings In vehicle
operating costs for various types of vehicles are praeanttd in Table 5.11.
Savings In vehicle operating costs over the 20 year life of the road,
derived on the basis of the foregoing data, are shown in Annex 5. Unit
savings in vehicle operating costs have been applied to both normel traffic
and NTC traffic. The ERR for the Salima-Balaka road is 142 (182 ERR for 3.5
year implementation).

Technical Assistance
5.31     No specific economic analysis has been undertaken for the technical
assistance component of the project because of the difficulty of quantifying
the benefits. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that these benefits will be
substantial. The diversity of the project components and the wide



- 63 -
geographic scope of the operating entities involved In NTC transport suggest
the importance of transport coordination for which technical assistance is
to be provided. The sharply expanded traffic level anticipated for LS
indicates the need for technical assistance to strengthen the functioning of
that service. Likewise, the introduction of the two MCCs requires technical
assistance to assure that these tmportant entities perform their critical
transshipment operations with maximum effectivenesz.
5.32     In summary, the economic returns for the project overall and for
the various components are as followst

D. Sensitivity Analysis
5.33     The sensitivity of the economic return to variations in the
estimated costs and benefits was determined and the results indicate that
even if the Mosambique routes were to reopen fully as early as 1990
(equivalent to about 40% reduction in NTC traffic), the total project would
still yield an acceptable ERR of 102. In the case of the Karonga-Ibanda-
Uyole road and MCC, ERR would be reduced to 102. For lake transport
component, ERR would be reduced to 91. In the case of fuel handling, ERR
would be reduced from 322 to 182, assuming reopening of Mozambique routes in
1990; thus, even if costs for such facilities rose considerably, as benefits
reduced, the component is likely to be viable.101 For the Salima-Balaka
road, the investment is justified without considering any diverted NTC
traffic (reduction of ERR from 141 to 12S). In case the construction costs
were to increase 151 over the estimates, ERR would still be acceptable.
Under a shorter implementation schedule of 3.5 years, rather than the 6-year
implementation, the project will yield a significantly higher ERR of 212.
Al" components i'ill yield satisfactory ERRs ranging from 131 to 321.
101 The assumption that the Hozambican routes will reopen In 1990 is an
extreme assumption and highly unlikely. Given the damage done to the
Beira line from lack of maintenance and war damages, it would take at
least two years from complete cessetion of guerilla activities to reopen
Beira. The Nacala line, which is currently being rehabilitated, has
never carried more than 301 of Malawi's external traffic.



-64-
S. Risks
5.34     The principal risk associated with the project is that the
governments of Malawi and Tanzania might fail to follow the various
agreements reached on the procedures to operate the NTC route. Possible
points of disagreement ore customs procedures for Malawi transit traffic,
charges for port services at Dar es Salaam, and freignt rates on TAZARA.
While these are notable risks, representatives of the two governments have
discussed these matters extensively and have signed a bilateral agreement
for operating the NTC route. The agreement, signed by Ministers of
Tran*port and Communicationz (Malawi) and Communications and Works
(Tanzania) on August 15, 1987, covers the particular agreements necessary to
effectively operate the NTC route. The development of this international
route is consistent with the objectives of the Southern Africa Development
Coordination Conference, of which both Malawi and Tanzania are members.
5.35     Another "risk* is the possibility that the traditional routes
through Mosambique will be reopened at an early date, thus causing some of
Malawi's traffic to move once again on those routes rather than on NTC. It
I.; unlikely that the line to Nacala will be reopened in the near future
given the security problem in Mozambique. Even if the problem is resolved
in the next few years, the line would require significant rehabilitation to
restore satisfactory operations. With reepect to the Beira line, even if
the security problem along the link to Malawi can be resolved, it is likely
that a significant proportion of the port capacity will be for use by
Zimlabwe. However, it should be noted that the NTC Project would still be
viable in the event that the Mozambique routes were to reopen in the near
future (para. 5.33). NTC will remain competitive for iuport/export traffic
for the northern and central regions of Malawi even after the reopening of
the traditional routes to the sea.

VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01    At negotiations, agreements were reached with Government on the
followingi
(a) The Government will consult -with the Association prior to
undertaking any major-investments in the transport sector,
including investments in vessels and port maintenance
facilities on Lake Nalawi (paras. 1.21 and 4.30);
(b) That consultants will be employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (par.. 3.19);
(c) Signing of the ODA (UK) grant agreement with Tanzania would be
a condition of IDA credit effectiveness (paras. 3.27);
(d) Not later than September 30, 1988, cofinancing agreements with
all the donors involved shall be effective (para. 3.27);
(e) A Project Implementation Schedule (para. 3.34) as well as
progress reporting requirements, and the submission of a
project completion report (para. 3.36);
(f) That all project accounts, including the Special Account, the
statement of expenditures of MRHC, MR and the MCC Company,
will be audited by auditors acceptable to the Association and
that the audited accounts together with the auditor's report
will be submitted to the Association not later than six months
after the end of the fiscal year for MRHC, MR and MCC Company
and nine months for MTC and MWS (paras. 3.36 and 4.31);
(g) Funds for the LS related investment will be transferred to LS
on a mixturo of on-lending and equity contribution from the
Government on terms and conditions to be determined in
consultation with the Association; and a formal financial
objective will be set for LS to achieve a working ratio of no
more than 10O1 during the first year of project
implementation, 95S in the second year and 90S up to the end
of the project implementation period.  To attain this
objective, the Government shall: (i) permit MR to restructure
the passenger services of LS over a three-year period (June
30, 1988 to June 30, 1991) to progressively eliminate the
working losses; and ({i) cause MR, before December 31 in each
of its fiscal years, to review whether it would meet the
requirements set forth in working ratio, and furnish to the
Association the results of such review (para. 4.29);



- 66 -
(h) In consultation with the Association, by June 30, 1988, take
all measures necessary to: (i) suitably amend the Articles of
Association of MRHC to empower it to hold physical assets and
execute a subsidiary loan agreement.between Goverment and
MRHC; (ii) register MCC Company as a limited liability company
and solicit potential investors; and (iii) prepare a draft
lease agreement between MRHC and MCC Company (para. 4.42).
6.02     The proposed project to suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 11.1
million (US$13.4 million equivalent) on standard terms to the Goveriment of
Malawi.

Assumptions Used in Financial Proiections
General
1.        The financial peojections (Annex 2, Tables 2-4) have been
prepared in terms of constant 1989 MK on a "with' and 'without" project
basis. The project Is assumed to be fully Implemented in 1990. Equipment
for the ports is assumed to have been purchased by March 1989. Technical
assistance provided under the project is assumed from March 1988.
Traffic and Vessel Assianment
2.        The traffic forecasts in the "without project' case are detailed
in the text and the pattern of traffic for the first projection year is
illustrated in Anex 2, Chart 1. The financial forecasts for the "without
project" case are based on vessel assignments that take into account the
pattern of existing cargo flows on the lake, relative vessel fuel
efficiences, distances between ports and vessel capacities. Vessel
capacity utilization rates per voyage are based on historic utilization
rates and the forecast traffic level patterns. The traffic forecasts in
the "with project" case are based on consultants' projections. Four
vessels are specificallv assigned to exclusive movements between Chipoka
and Chilumba. Operating costs are based on engineering characteristics of
these vessels and capacity utilization rates per voyage which are based on
the size and direction of forecast traffic.
Other Revenue
3.        Other revenue consists of income from work undertaken by LS for
outside entities, catering income and rent of houses to staff. Other
revenue is projected at 152 of the combined revenues from passenger
services and revenues from transport of breakbulk; this is a conservative
assumption in light of recent experience.
Accountinz Policies
4.        Depreciation is based on the historic cost of existing fixed
assets (primarily 2 vessels) and additions to fixed assets under the
project; depreciation is on a straight line basis at rates used by MR which
are considered appropriately conservative.
5.        Working capital requirements are based on the following payment
terms: (i) 30 days for transport of NTC container and fuel cargo and for
purchases by LS of goods and services other than fuel; and(ii) 15 days for
transport of breakbulk cargo and for purchases of fuel by LS. Technical
assistance costs are expensed In the year incurred.

Proiect Debt
6.        Tho project loan are aassmed to be made for 15 years - including
a grece period of 5 year - at an annual effectivo rate of Interest of 102.
Financial Rate of Return
7.        The financlal rate of return Is computed on the basis of
differences In cash flows betwen the "with project3 and "without project*
cases. Asset lives aros civil structures - 30 yr. *  vessel - 25 years;
gantry crsne - 15 yr..; port equipment - 7 years; tho project life used In
computing the rate of return is 30 years; assets are replaced at the end of
their useful lives1over the period assumed; residual values are based on
straight lino depreciation of such assetsg no residual value is assumed in
respect of civil works and buildings.

Operating Costs
Backtround
1.       The structure of Operating Costs detailed In this Annex are based on
assessed operating cycle times for equipment and estimates of labor costs and
complements based on similar transshipment operations In Tanzania.
2.       All costs are in U3 dollars and Tanzania shillings (Tsh).  At the time
of estimation of these costs (February 1986), the ruling rate of exchange
between Tah and US$ was TSh 15 - US$1. As of mid-1987 the Tanzania shilling
had progressively depreciat-d to about TSh 50 - US$1. There is as yet no
certainty as to the degree *f adjustment of wages in Tanzania to the
substantial depreciation oi the exchange rate since the costs were estimsited.
For purposes of estimation of operating costs, it is assumed that Tanzania
shilling denominated nominal wages and salaries will increase by 752 (152 p.a.)
between 1986 and 1990. US dollar denominated costs are converted into Halawi
Kuacha at the August 1987 cross-rate of MK1   Tash 21.7.
