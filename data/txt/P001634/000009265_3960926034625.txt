MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF MALAWI
FOR THE NORTHERN TRANSPORT CORRIDOR PROJECT
1.    The following report on a proposed development credit to Malawi for SDR 11.1
million (US$13.4 million equivalent) is slbmitted for approval. The proposed credit
would bc on standard IDA terms and would assist in financing the development of an
alternative transport route to the sea through the Northern Transport Corridor (NTC) to
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.  The proposed p.oject involves improvements to transport
facili,ies in both Malawi and Tanzania.  Total project cost is US$109.8 million and will
be financed through contribution from the European Development Fund (US$20.0 million),
and grants from U K. Overseas Development Administration (ODA - USS19.3 million), U.S.
Agency for International Developmer.t (US$18.0 million), the F.R.G. Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (US$18.9 million) and The Netherlands Ministry of Development Cooperation
(US$17.3 million).  The Malawi Government wculd finance the local project cost for the
iDA financed portion of the project and the local taxes (US$2.9 million).
-.    Background.  As a landlocked country, Malawi has always depended upon external
transport routes to reach the sea. The several alternative routes available to Malawi
var-y greatly in length, relab5ilitv and cost (see map).  From the main cormmercial center
o-   a-..'>re the distance to be4ra is 640 kim, .o Nacala 815 km, to Durban via Lusa&a
:,l) LA, ind to Dar es S aa n iG' ,J:n.  Traditionally, almost all exports and iwzrtzs
.ave n;,ovd through Mczambiquc to t..e ports of Beira and Nacala.  In the late 1970's
rrecuent interruptions in servfce developed as a result of equipment breakdown and lire
:l.-l-res, brougr.: ao-lt by poor maine.enance as well as repeated attacks by atmed
ar:cd.s.  Tne interruptions escalate4 to tie point where by December 1983, the rail' 'in.s
-o Seira wa.b closed, and in July  985, the line to Nacala was also closed.  As a result
of  .hese p:oblems, most of the export/import traffic of about 800,000 tons has been
diverted to South Africa, via Zimbabwe and Zambia at greatly increased costs.
s.    r.`e use of the so_thern route to South Africa has had a significant negative
?a.poct orn Maiawi's export ealnings, import prices and balance of payments.  With
a.'sport costs three to four t .nes higher than those on historical routes throgh
Xozambique, Malawi has incurred annual losses of at least US$50 million, or 20% of the
value of all exports. Improvement of NTC represents a significant opportunity to lower
-ransport cost for Malawi, with estimated savings in excess of 40% of the cost over the
ScAtnerr, route.  However, NTCh as not been used extensively because of inadequate
tran.sport facilities and infa!;tructure.  The principal deficiencies are lack of pave._
road link between Malawi and Tanzania, inadequate transshipment facilities at the Mbeya
rail terminal (TAZARt railway), inadequate facilities in Dar es Salaam for transshipment
of Malaw4 cargo between the port and TAZARA railway, limitations in ship and port
facilitries on Lake Malawi and tne poor condition of a road link on the route between
Blantyre and Chipoka (the prircipal lake port). The project is designed to overcome
tr.cse deficiencies.
Reactivation -f Lhe trad'  _o,al routes to Beira and Nacala ports is dependenrt upon
!.C Cessat ion of security po.roems i. Mozambique and the rehabilitation ot these  ines
c.rtm: r ranv years of neglect a:.i heavy dcmage.  Jnder the auspices of the Southern Africa
Dee popme..t Coordinatior.n Conf-ercnce (SADCC) and donor assistance, Mozambique has begun
Ore. iil tatio  worss or.  te t    a.  transport. corridors In Mozambique: the Nacoa:
-o:rrdor and the Beira-Zimbabwe (Corrior.  Despite these efforts, future prospects to:

management and maintenance are also considerably improved. Rehabilitation of the Beira-
Zimbabwe aection is weil underway but work on the Beira-Malawi section is not expected
to start until the cessation of hostilities.
5.    Pro1ect Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to assist Malawi with the
development of a shorter and more cost-effective route to the sea through increasing the
capacity of the NTZ route to handle about one third of Malawi's external traffic at
roduced transport costs as compared with the alternative southern route to South Africa.
The project will also contribute to the expansion of regional trade between Malawi and
Tanzania, as well as to the Government's policy objective of promoting greater economic
integration of the country through development of the northern region (least developed
in Malawi).
6.    Project Description.  The proposed project would: (i) strengthen and upgrade the
main road connection between northern Malawi (Karonga) and southern Tanzania (Uyole),
and rehabilitate a sectior of the road link between Blantyre (main commercial center)
and Chipoka (principal lake port); (ii) construct and equip the dry-cargo transshipment
facilities (Malawi Cargo Centers (MCCs)) in Tanzania, near the port of Dar es Salaam and
at the TAZARA railhead in Mbeya; (iii) construct and equip the fuel storage
transshipment facilities in Dar es Salaam and Mbeya; (iv) procure railway fuel tank
wagons to be used on TAZARA and tank containers fc- shipment of Malawian fuel; (v)
improve shipping services and cargo handling capabilities on Lake Malawi; (vi) construct
a border post and weighing station at the Malawi/Tanzania border crossing; (vii) provide
consultancy services and technical assistance for the implementation of the above
components; and (viii) training. The construction of the MCC facility at Dar es Salaam
will require resettlement of people currently living on the designated site (about 3,000
people). The Tanzanian Government has prepared a resettlement program which is
acceptable to the Association. The program includes cash compensation, granting of land
titles for new housing plots and infrastructural improvements in the resettled area.
ODA, which is the main financier of the MCC facilities, has agreed to finance the
infrastructural improvements and the Malawi Government has agreed to finance the cash
compensation.
7.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$109.8 million, of which foreign
costs total US$91.0 million (83%). Details of the project costs and the financial plan
are shown in Schedule A. Procurement methods, amounts involved, and the disbursement
schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of the Bank Group operations in Malawi are given in Schedules C, D and F,
respectively. A map of the alternative transport routes is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 6022-MAT, of January 27, 1988 is being distributed with this
Memorandum.
8.    NTC Operations.  The successful operation of the corridor depends upon the
efficiency with which the MCC transshipment facilities (including fuel storage) will
operate. To maximize the utilization of MCC facilities, an enterprise with at least a
49 percent combined equity interest from the major private sector transport operators
(freight forwarders) is being established to lease and manage MCCs. The balance of
equity inte.rest will be held by the Malawi Railways Holding Company (MRHC). The day-to-
day operations will be contracted to a private terminal operator.  Ihis arrangement will
enable the Government to attract the necessary private sector expertise in management
and marketing. Additionally, the lake shipping capacity on Lake Malawi will be expanded
to further reduce the transport costs, and technical assistance will be provided to
strengthen its operational and financial management.

9.    Rationale for IDA Involvement.  This project forms not only an integral part of
IDA's transport sector assistance strategy, but also is vital to improving the country's
macro-economic situation by (i) increasing the competitiveness and efficiency of the
Malawian economy through reducing the transport cost of import and export goods; and
(ii) promoLing institutional development by improving the capacity of the Government and
the private sector to manage and operate a new transport corridor. IDA, through its
sector work, has also played a key role in developing the concept of the NTC alternative
and has assisted the Government to mobilize the cofinancing necessary for the project.
It lhas also assisted in establishing a bilateral transit agreement between tie two
countries, the first of its kind in Tanzanie.
10.   Agreed Actions.  The Governmer.t has agreed on the following actions: (i) to
discuss with the Association the transport investment program prior to adoption of the
annual budget; (ii) to effect all cofinancing agreements before September 30, 1988;
(iii) to transfer funds for the Lake Service (LS) related investment to LS on a mixture
of on-lending and equity contribution from the Government and to set a formal financial
objective for LS for achieving a working ratio of no more than 100% during the first
year of project implementation, 952 in the second year and 90% up to the end of the
project period. To attain this objective, the Government shall a) permit Malawi
Railways (MR) to restructure the passenger services of LS over a three-year period to
progressively eliminate the working losses; b) cause MR, before December 31 of each
fiscal year, to review the requirement set forth for the working ratio targets, and
furnish to the Association the results of such review; (iv) to take all necessary
measures by June 30, 1988 to aj suitably amend the Articles of Association of MRHC to
empower it to hold physical assets and execute a subsidiary loan agreement between
Government and MRHC; b) register the MCC company as a limited liability company a,nd
solicit potential investors; and c) prepare a draft lease agreement between MRHC and
MCC. In addition, the Government has agreed to incorporating the signing of the ODA
grant agreement with Tanzania ,resettlement investments) as a condition of IDA credit
effectiveness.
11.   Benefits.  The benefits of the proposed project are estimated on the basis of the
transport cost savings generated from using NTC vis a vis the southern route ($20
million savings in first year of NTC operation). The estimated economic rate of return
for the whole project is 16 percent and the financial rate of return for investments in
MCC and Lake Services are 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively.
12.   Risks.  Possible risks include. (i) transit delays due to possible procedural or
other disagreements between the two countries; and (ii) reduction in traffic volume on
NTC due to earlier than anticipated opening of traditional routes to the sea. The risk
of transit delays has been minimized through a bilateral transit agreement between the
two countries, covering transit procedures (signed on August 15, 1987). In terms of the
impact of earlier opening of the traditional routes, NTC will continue to remain cost
competitive and economically viable for import and export traffic for the northern and
central regions of Malawi.
13.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the International Development Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
