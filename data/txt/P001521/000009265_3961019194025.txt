IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PILOT PROJECT
(Credit 2150-MAG)
PREFACE
1.          This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Agricultural
Extension Pilot Project in Madagascar, for which Credit 2150-MAG in the amount of SDR 2.8
million (US$3.7 million) was approved by the Board of Directors on May 31, 1990 and made
effective on March 22, 1991. The credit was closed on June 30,1995. Ninety percent of the
credit was disbursed, and the undisbursed balance (SDR 238,164) was canceled on January 15,
1996.
2.          The ICR was prepared by Ousmane Seck, Connie Luff and Christopher Trapman
of the Agriculture and Environment Operations Division of the Central Africa and Indian Ocean
Department of the Africa Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) and
reviewed by Nils Tcheyan, Division Chief AF3AE and Padmanabha Hari Prasad, project adviser,
Central Africa and Indian Ocean Department. This report is based, inter alia, on the Staff
Appraisal Report, the President's Report, the Development Credit Agreement, project supervision
and progress reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank
memoranda. The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by preparing its own
evaluation of the project's execution (Part II).






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PILOT PROJECT
(Credit 2150-MAG)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
A.          Project Objectives
1 .         The main purpose of the project was to test a sustainable extension strategy in six
pilot districts, covering the entire range of agricultural conditions found in Madagascar. The
project was designed to focus on the reorganization and training of the extension service, and to
establish closer links between extension and research. The objective was to define a cost-
effective approach to improve the quality of field services to provide the effective transfer of
agricultural technology to farmers, aimed at substantially and sustainably raising the production
and yields of Madagascar's major crops. If successful, this system was to be replicated in the
remainder of the country.
2.          The project objectives were consistent with IDA's strategy for agricultural
development that included support of the macro-economic and sectoral adjustment process, as
well as a sectoral investment program that focused on food security, extension and research,
livestock development, irrigation and environmental protection. The project preparation team
correctly ascertained that a national project was premature given the political instability and the
difficulties of the National Directorate for Agricultural Extension (DNVA), and redesigned the
project as a pilot operation. Project objectives were well-defined, although only limited
indicators were established in the appraisal report to evaluate the effectiveness of the extension
service.  Subsequently a systematic monitoring system  to measure the level of farmer
participation and the adoption rate of technical messages was perfected during project
implementation, and was adopted for the follow-on National Agricultural Extension Program
Support Project (Credit 2729-MAG).
B.          Implementation Experiences and Results
3.          Project Results. Although the first 2 years of project implementation were very
slow, the project achieved its main objectives. The links between the research and extension
services were strengthened; the farmers' priority extension needs were identified and addressed
more precisely than in the past, and the organization and efficiency of the extension system
significantly improved. The project demonstrated that a large number of farmers could obtain
good results at low cost with existing agricultural staff, systematic work programming, regular
training and joint diagnosis of results by farmers and field staff. Major increases in production
and yields were achieved without any cash investment, through use of techniques adopted
directly by farmers. The proportion of farmers participating in organized fortnightly visits by
front level staff (AVBs) rose substantially, in both percentage terms (from under 5 to over 20



ii
percent) and absolute terms (from about 10,000 to about 40,000). Over 120,000 farmers are
estimated to have benefited from the services provided, reflecting the impact of promoting the
establishment of contact groups and improving the scheduling of farm visits. A total of 16,000
demonstration plots were set up in 1994/95 compared to 9,000 in 1992/93. The project achieved
its objective of identifying a cost-effective system of agricultural extension, adapted to local
conditions in Madagascar.
4.          Project Implementation. Pilot extension activities were initiated in 1988 in three
extension districts financed by a Project Preparation Facility of US$750,000. The Project was
appraised in September 1989, the Credit (US$3.7 million) was approved in May 1990 and
became effective in March 1991. The first two years of project implementation were seriously
disrupted by political turmoil and civil service strikes. Numerous other constraints exacerbated
this situation, including:  (a) difficulties in providing counterpart funds to pay taxes and
contractual staff salaries; (b) problems in selecting and placing competent and motivated staff to
form the operational extension service; (c) slowness in procuring equipment and vehicles; and
(d) lack of a commitment to implement an efficient extension management system.
5.          However, major improvements in project performance were achieved in 1993
following the replacement of key staff to positions of responsibility at the central (DNVA) and
local (CIRAGRI) levels and improved borrower commitment to the implementation of project
objectives. In order to consolidate and properly evaluate the results of the pilot phase, the Bank
agreed to extend the project closing date by one year until June 30, 1995. During the project
period, an improved extension management system linked with tested principles of extension
was introduced in six of the country's 28 districts, affecting a total farming population of
260,000. The experience and lessons of this project have served as the basis for the follow-on
National Agricultural Extension Program Support Project (Credit 2729-MAG) that became
effective in November 1995.
C.          Summary of Findings, Future Operations & Key Lessons Learned
6.          Project Outcome. The results of the pilot project were assessed to be satisfactory.
Although initially project implementation was slow, the project achieved its main objectives. The
effectiveness of extension services has improved through fortnightly training of extension staff
accompanied by regular visits with contact groups by both extension and research staff.
Production and productivity of main season irrigated and rainfed rice and of interseason crops
increased, with the introduction of relatively simple technologies, many of which required little
or no cash investment. Net farm incomes using improved practices increased by almost US$400
per ha. Monitoring protocols and indicators were established to periodically measure the field
impact of project activities. Through demonstration of simple, low-cost technologies on mini-
plots, more and more farmers are becoming convinced of the validity of the recommendations
presented and showing increased interest in the program. Smoother progress towards project
achievements could have been obtained had there been a better programming of extension and



iii
training activities in the early years and if other donors and associated projects in extension and
research had been more closely involved in the implementation of the pilot project.
7.           Future Operations. Based on the encouraging results posted during the pilot
project after 1993, the Malagasy authorities decided to implement a first four-year phase of a
longer-term program designed to consolidate and extend the pilot project experiment to the entire
country. The Agricultural Extension Program Support Project (Credit 2729-MAG) will support
this effort, and additional Bank funding for extension could be considered if the program is
successful and remains a priority in the Country Assistance Strategy. The national agricultural
extension program will be introduced to the country's 28 extension districts over a four-year
period.
8.           The principal lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows:
(a)   The project demonstrated the feasibility of significantly raising the effectiveness of
agricultural extension management in Madagascar through the combined
application of basic management principles and the use of learning tools, such as
regular training and individual in-field demonstration plots;
(b)   The project demonstrated that, for the improvements to materialize, the extension
and training personnel must receive a minimum of material and financial support, as
well as a uniform system of benefits and allowances for field staff. This support
essentially consists of the provision of means of travel and operating equipment and
supplies, particularly fuel, defrayal of training and field visit costs, and provision of
office equipment and supplies. This implies the need for full Government
commitment, not only to secure counterpart funding, but also to ensure the
sustainablility of the project;
(c)   The feasibility of providing these resources on a regular basis depends, within the
overall budgetary and treasury constraints, on the Government's ability to rationalize
public investment in the sector and to coordinate donor assistance. To that end, the
Government has developed a national strategy for extension services and is trying to
integrate existing and future donor-funded projects into this strategy;
(d)   Finally, expansion of the pilot project experience was greatly facilitated by a clear
Governmental policy on the provision of cost effective and relevant farmer
extension services that depend on the coordination and harmonization of
independent field approaches and the development of cooperation among the
various entities involved (projects, NGOs, private sector).
(e)   The impact of intensive supervision from a full time specialist in the resident
mission only really made itself felt with the appointment of a fully experienced



iv
specialist in agricultural extension systems. The experience underlines the critical
importance of the selection of the appropriate candidate for such a post.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PILOT PROJECT
(Credit 2150-MAG)
PART 1:     PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.          General
1.          Madagascar has considerable potential for agricultural growth due to its low labor
costs, good soils and climate, an underutilized irrigation infrastructure, as well as the availability
of diverse ecological zones. A variety of temperate and tropical crops may be grown for both
domestic and export markets. Crop yields are uniformly low, creating strong potential to
increase yields on the basis of known technologies. However, Madagascar remains one of the
world's poorest nations. Inadequate economic policies since independence in 1960, coupled with
population growth of about 3 percent per annum, have resulted in the persistence of low per
capita income (US$230 in 1994).
2.          Agriculture is the most important contributor to the national economy. Rice is the
country's main staple and the major exports are coffee, vanilla, cloves and shellfish. In 1987,
when the Agricultural Extension Pilot project was prepared, the sector employed more than 70
percent of the active population and accounted for nearly 35 percent of GDP. Despite favorable
conditions for the development of most farm products, the sector's annual productivity growth
has remained relatively low (under 2 percent from 1986-1991). As a result, and with a steadily
growing population, Madagascar has been unable to produce enough to feed its 12 million people
and to benefit significantly from its comparative advantages in order to increase exports.
3.          Sustained sector growth has been severely hampered by the combined effects of a
number of major constraints. These have included: (a) inappropriate macroeconomic and
sectoral policies; (b) an unsuitable legal, regulatory and fiscal framework; (c) poor agricultural
services (research and extension) for promoting the transfer of technology; (d) the lack of reliable
transport and communication infrastructure linking farmers with markets; and (e) an agricultural
credit system ill-suited to the constraints and requirements of the rural sector.
4.          The Government has sought to address these constraints, in collaboration with the
Bank and other international development partners, through economic policy reform and sectoral
investment programs. The Bank's lending portfolio in the agricultural sector includes support
for six major projects (Research, Extension, Livestock, Environment, Rural Finance and
Irrigation Rehabilitation) that are designed to support increased agricultural productivity on a
sustainable basis. The Government is also developing, with Bank support, strategies for
strengthening rural infrastructure, focusing on feeder roads and market improvements. A key
element of the Government's rural development strategy is the establishment and effective
operation of a professional agricultural extension service as a means for increasing incomes of
rural farmers and raising agricultural productivity.

B.          Statement and Evaluation of Project Objectives
5.          Project Objectives. The main purpose of the project was to test a sustainable
extension strategy in six pilot districts (North Tana, South Tana, Miarinarivo, Antsiranana,
Mahajanga and Amparafaravola), covering the entire range of agricultural conditions found in
Madagascar. The project was designed to focus on the reorganization and training of the
extension service, and to establish closer links between extension and research. The objective
was to define a cost-effective approach to improve the quality of field services to provide the
effective transfer of agricultural technology to farmers, aimed at substantially and sustainably
raising the production and yields of Madagascar's major crops. If successful, this system was to
be replicated in the remainder of the country.
6.          Specifically, the project was to test the feasibility of significantly raising the
effectiveness of agricultural extension management in Madagascar through the combined
application of certain basic management principles and learning tools. These principles and tools
included: a structured and transparent organization based on cost-effective farmer/extension
agent and training ratios and clearly defined responsibilities at all levels of the hierarchy; a group
approach, so as to reach and train a larger number of farmers; establishment of fixed work and
farm visit timetables; systematic use of demonstrations to enable each farmer to judge the
relevance of the technology offered and the suitability of adopting it; and close cooperation
between researchers, farmers and extension agents, in diagnosing constraints and drafting
technical recommendations incorporating solutions adapted to local conditions.
7.          The project aimed to increase the ratio of Field Extension Agents (AVBs) to
farmers from a range of 25-195 farmers per AVB to a range of 200 to 250 farmers per AVB.
This ratio was to be area specific and adapted during project implementation to account for
factors such as population densities, settlement patterns, types of farming, and road conditions.
The overall percentage of farmers visited was to increase during project implementation from 15
percent to about 40 percent, without increasing the number of AVBs. In addition, the ratio of
supervisors to AVBs was judged to be high, and the project aimed to reduce this ratio to one
supervisor per 7-10 AVBs (SAR para. 3.04).
8.          The project investments, based on tested principles of extension management
organization, were to support (SAR para. 3.02):
(a)   reorganization and institutional strengthening of the extension service of the
Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Water and Forestry (MINAGRI).  This
reorganization was to involve the delineation of a single line of command, with the
AVB as the sole source of information to farmers, who otherwise often received
contradictory messages;



Part I: Project Implementation Assessment                                     3
(b)   systematic, on-going training of extension staff, monthly technology review
workshops among researchers, farmers and technical specialists and fortnightly
training sessions for AVBs;
(c)   development of close links between extension and research through adaptive
research and on-farm trials, with the active participation of farmers, in order to
diagnose constraints, establish priorities, formulate valid recommendations and
evaluate results;
(d)   strengthening of monitoring and evaluation capacity at both the central (DNVA) and
local (CIRAGRI) levels to provide timely information on the effectiveness of the
extension service with emphasis on monitoring project progress. Feedback from
farmers would serve as the basis to evaluate the performance of AVBs and the
appropriateness of the technical messages;
(e)   provision of funds for studying ways to reduce the Government's costs of extension
by more actively involving the private sector and the NGOs, exploring means to
lower the costs of the National Directorate for Agricultural Extension (DNVA), for
example by reducing excess personnel, and reviewing the possibility of cost
recovery mechanisms;
(f)   strengthening of financial management;
(g)   improvement of the DNVA's organizational and managerial capacity.
9.          Evaluation of Objectives. At the time of project preparation, a Government
analysis of the performance of the agricultural sector during the 1980's revealed that production
and productivity were declining while population was growing, leading to unsustainable farming
practices and environmental degradation.  The SAR attributed this poor performance to
Government's interventionist policies in pricing and marketing, high export taxes and a decline
in quality and coverage of its services to the sector (extension, research and irrigation), but
recognized that the Government had made a series of policy changes to improve the macro-
economic environment.  The project objectives were consistent with IDA's strategy for
agricultural development that included support of this macro-economic and sectoral adjustment
process, as well as a sectoral investment program that focused on food security, extension and
research, livestock development, irrigation and environmental protection.  The project
preparation team correctly ascertained that a national project was premature given the political
instability and the difficulties of the DNVA, and redesigned the project as a pilot operation.
Project objectives were well-defined, although only limited indicators were established in the
appraisal report to evaluate the effectiveness of the extension service. A systematic monitoring
system to measure the level of farmer participation and the adoption rate of technical messages
was perfected during project implementation, and was adopted for the follow-on National
Agricultural Extension Program Support Project (Credit 2729-MAG).

C.          Achievement of Project Objectives
10.         As a pilot operation to test a strategy for more effective agricultural extension
based on the specific conditions of the Malagasy agro-economy, the project achieved its
objectives. The links between the research and extension services have been strengthened
through the adoption of a common approach to participative diagnosis of farmer problems and
regular training of subject matter specialists by research staff. Farmers' priority extension needs
were identified and addressed more precisely than in the past by regular programmed visits by
extension staff, and the organization and effectiveness of the extension system significantly
improved. This judgment is consistent with that of the Agricultural Extension Program Support
Project Staff Appraisal Report of May 3, 1995: "... the pilot project has demonstrated that a
structured and systematic approach to agricultural extension, using existing resources and simple,
low-cost techniques within the direct reach of local technicians and farmers can have a rapid and
substantial impact on productivity and income and thereby help to alleviate poverty." The pilot
project has demonstrated that with available technology and a more effective extension service, it
has been possible to substantially increase yields in demonstration plots (para. 12) and more
broadly for about 45 percent of the total estimated farming population of 260,000 covered by the
project area. For example, in addition to favorable rainfall conditions and improved water
management from some irrigation improvements, extension services contributed significantly to
the increased production of 45,000 tons of rice between 1993/1994 and 1994/95 by introducing
early seedling transplanting and in-line planting techniques.
11.         The project utilized a total staff of nearly 500 agents, almost all employed
exclusively on field tasks. Depending on the number of farms in each project area and their
individual characteristics, the range of farmers per AVB rose from 25-195 before the project to
500-600, and the AVB/supervisor ratio from 2-3 to an average of 8. In parallel, the proportion of
farmers participating in organized AVB visits rose substantially, in both percentage terms (from
under 5 to over 20 percent) and absolute terms (from about 10,000 to about 40,000). Over
120,000 farmers (against 125,000 estimated in the SAR) are estimated to have benefited from the
services provided, reflecting the impact of promoting the establishment of contact groups and
improving the scheduling of farm visits. A total of 16,000 demonstration plots were set up in
1994/95 compared to 9,000 in 1992/93, which was a significant increase, if lower than the
objective of 25,000 plots set for 1994/95. The budgetary impact of the increased efficiency of
extension coverage offers hope for longer term sustainability of the service by government. Unit
costs of extension per farm family, which had been traditionally between twice and eighty times
higher under previous or ongoing projects, were less than US$6 equivalent annually (cost
includes salaries) (para. 30).
12.         Extension Services. The pilot project demonstrated that a large number of farmers
could obtain good results at low cost with existing agricultural staff, systematic work
programming, regular training and joint diagnosis of results by farmers and field staff. For



Part I. Project Implementation Assessment                                                5
example, rice yields on some 1,700 demonstration plots in farmers' fields, with good water
control, increased on average to nearly twice the yields on control plots using traditional
techniques. On more than 1,350 separate demonstration plots, where the technical improvement
was early transplanting of transplanting of seedlings (without improved water management),
yields were on average 53 percent higher than on control plots. In both cases, these results were
achieved without any cash investment, through use of techniques adopted directly by the farmers.
The gross margins generated by application of these techniques amounted to an equivalent of
approximately US$300 and US$125 per hectare, respectively.
13.           A representative selection of the 80 different technical messages outreached in the
pilot area, and the associated impact they had on farmers' yields in 1993-1994, is shown in Table
1.  The significant differences between yields on control (traditional methods used) and
demonstration plots (recommended methods), illustrate the potential for improving yields in a
variety of crops. The significant differences in yields between demonstration plots and control
plots resulting solely from the introduction of simple, low-cost technologies, are convincing
increasing numbers of farmers to try the improved techniques.

14.           Training. Regular training sessions were not implemented under the project until
1993, although sporadic workshops were delivered. Starting in 1993, a systematic training
program was introduced that followed a timetable set at the beginning of each season. The
monthly technology review workshops were led mainly by FOFIFA, FIFAMANOR and
FAFIALA research staff. The first day was dedicated to observation and analysis of the various
farming techniques in use, in order to identify exogenous solutions that would serve as a basis for



6                                             Part I: Project Implementation Assessment
recommendations. The second day was devoted to practical applications in farmers' fields. At
the end of each workshop, a data sheet of all the lessons learned in this process was prepared.
This information was used by the extension agents as a permanent technical reference source to
support field activities.
15.         Research.  On-farm research activities were systematically carried out in the
various regions. More than 700 test plots, covering some 10 different crops, were regularly
established during the season. These trials, which covered an average of about 60 topics per
season, were conducted under the direct responsibility of the subject matter specialists. Joint
monitoring and supervision missions, comprising research staff, extension agents and farmers
were carried out periodically during the crop year. Their purpose was to ensure the proper
execution of field operations and to gather the opinions and comments of participants, especially
beneficiary farmers, to accurately register their concerns as a basis for effective
recommendations. At the end of the crop year, a review meeting was held with the farmers and
extension agents in order to validate the results.
16.         Although there has not been an independent assessment of adoption rates, the
increased application of the technical recommendations relating to many of the farmers' major
concerns is readily apparent on the ground and is borne out in the fortnightly reports of the field
extension staff. The topics of greatest interest to farmers included the transplanting of young rice
plants (under 45 days), intensive rice-growing, stock selection, seed treatment, drill-hole sowing
on upland rice, choice of better-yield varieties, rice/fish-farming, rapid propagation of slips and
cuttings (cassava), seed densities, nursery management and fruit-tree maintenance, compost and
manure production techniques, animal habitat improvement, production and establishment of
fodder reserves, and soil protection and water management.
17.         Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring indicators were defined by the national
coordination unit to facilitate coordination of activities, and to track the impact and performance
of extension in the field. The advance programming of work at all levels of the hierarchy has
resulted in regular attendance by farmers at the regular demonstration visits conducted by the
AVBs, and in a steady improvement in the quality of supervision, reflected in greater interest and
involvement on the part of farners. A detailed evaluation of extension effectiveness was
conducted every 3 months and served as a major input in the design of the national program.
18.         Studies. The mid-term review decided to concentrate the efforts of the project on
getting extension staff effectively operating in the field and to reallocate funds to meet this
objective.  It was therefore decided to reduce the studies component to assistance in the
preparation of the follow-up project. The training activities included under this component were
maintained, but were to focus on means of reaching women more effectively.
19.         Financial Management System. During project appraisal it was recognized that
the Administrative Bureau (BAF) would need to be reorganized and that special assistance would
need to be given to both the BAF and the project CIRAGRIs in defining accounting and



Part I. Project Implementation Assessment                                   7
procurement procedures and in strengthening local capacity. In June 1994, the BAF was
reorganized and a head of the financial section was nominated. The delay in implementing these
measures led to poor accounting and budgetary management in the early years of project
implementation. Further improvements have been introduced, although belatedly, including a
decentralized financial management system and training of BAF and CIRAGRI staff.
D.          Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
20.         Pilot extension activities were initiated in 1988 in three extension districts
financed by a Project Preparation Facility of US$750,000. The Project was appraised in
September 1989, the Credit (US$3.7 million) was approved in May 1990 and became effective in
March 1991. The first two years of project implementation were seriously disrupted by political
turmoil and strikes in the civil service that preceded the advent of the Third Republic in 1992.
Numerous other constraints exacerbated this situation, including: (a) difficulties in providing
counterpart funds to pay taxes and contractual staff salaries; (b) problems in selecting and
placing competent and motivated staff to form the operational extension service; (c) slowness in
procuring equipment and vehicles, and (d) lack of a commitment to implement the detailed
stages of an extension management system.
21.         However, major improvements in project performance were achieved in 1993
following the replacement of key staff to positions of responsibility at the central (DNVA) and
local (CIRAGRI) levels and improved borrower commitment to the implementation of project
objectives. A notable characteristic of the new nominations was the number of women appointed
to positions of responsibility. By 1995, 50 percent of the central PNVA team were women. In
order to consolidate and properly evaluate the results of the pilot phase, the Bank agreed to
extend the project closing date by one year until June 30, 1995. During the project period, an
improved extension management system linked with tested principles of extension was
introduced in six of the country's 28 districts, affecting a farming population of 260,000. The
experience and lessons of this project have served as the basis for the National Agricultural
Extension Program Support Project (Credit 2729-MAG) that became effective in November
1995.
22.          Projectfinancing. The project had to contend regularly with a serious dearth of
counterpart funds, owing in large measure to the wide discrepancy between the available local
resources and the demands of the many ongoing projects. This situation led to substantial delays
in the financing of expenditures, notably local travel for extension agents, and operating
expenses. The May 1992 mid-term review concluded that substantial delays and irregularity in
paying field allowances were the most important implementation difficulty confronting the
project. At project appraisal this risk had been foreseen and a decision was made to support field
allowance payments with IDA financing on a declining basis (100 percent in year 1, 50 percent
in year 2, and 0 percent in year 3). At the mid-term review, the Bank decided that this decline
was too rapid for the local budget to support and agreed to increase the financing percentage for
field allowances to 1 00 percent, on the condition that the level of field allowances be reduced.



8                                           Part I: Project Implementation Assessment
23.         Delays in Procurement. Procurement for project motorcycles was substantially
delayed due to the Borrower's lack of compliance with IDA procurement regulations. Due to
this delay, AVBs were obliged to walk to farmers' fields and villages creating serious problems
for effective project implementation.
24.         Technical and organizational aspects. The project began to function better from
1993, as a consequence of (a) major structural changes made in the extension service; (b) a more
systematic process of technology generation and diffusion; (c) the training provided to the
extension agents and farmers; (d) the development-- though still weak--of collaboration with
other extension agencies, both public and private, operating in the same geographic areas as the
project; and (e) coordination of the various field activities and performance oversight.
25.         Concerning organization of the extension service, key personnel have been
appointed at the strategic command echelons. The entire project coordination team was replaced
in 1993 by personnel with greater authority and managerial ability. The basic organization,
comprising the extension agents and their supervisors, was radically overhauled and its staff
downsized to eliminate a large number of redundant personnel, who generally lacked the skills
needed to improve services to farmers. A special effort was also mounted to select subject matter
specialists with the ability to identify and resolve, in close liaison with research, the various
problems underlying farmer concerns and to ensure proper training of the AVBs.
26.         Links with the research service. Joint teams of researchers and extension agents
were established, at both the national and regional levels, to perform diagnostic work, prepare
and implement annual work programs, including field extension and research (trials and tests),
and develop training activities for subject matter specialists, AVBs and farmers. Regular
meetings between research and extension officials, at both the national and regional levels,
assessed the status of program execution and made necessary adjustments.
27.         Training of agents andfarmers. Clearly defined training programs were drawn up
annually, together with an execution schedule based on the major crop cultivation timetables.
Researchers, subject matter specialists and farmers met regularly in monthly technology review
workshops to exchange information on their experience with particular technologies. Workshops
were held to prepare and update technical protocols or data sheets that provided practical
guidance for the entire extension service staff. The knowledge so gained was then transferred by
the subject matter specialists to the AVBs at the fortnightly training sessions.
28.         Collaboration with other institutions. Cooperation with other donors was often
hampered by differences of approach and strategy. Notable improvements were made, however,
in developing synergy with certain projects, development agencies and NGOs following the
successful experience with start-up workshops in late 1994 in three new districts (Tulear,
Mahajanga and Diego Suarez), started under the new National Extension Program support
project. These workshops brought together representatives of all the projects, agencies and
technical services of a given district involved in extension, research or agricultural training



Part I: Project Implementation Assessment                                       9
activities, and afforded all participants an opportunity to share their respective objectives and
strategies. Given the success of these workshops, similar workshops will be held regularly and
gradually extended to all districts.
E.           Project Sustainability
29.          Based on the results described above, the project is sustainable. The extension
service is staffed entirely by former staff of the agricultural agencies who had responsibility for
the preparation and implementation of project activities. This base is being progressively
consolidated and secured through the institutional strengthening of the Agriculture Directorate
and the DNVA in the areas of coordination, monitoring and evaluation of project activities and
collaboration with non-governmental organizations.
30.          The unit costs of extension services per farm family under the project were
estimated to be FMG 24,000 (US$6.00). This estimate varies from between one-half and one-
eightieth of that of ongoing agricultural projects, according to a February 1994 study
("Evaluation du systeme d'enseignement de recyclage et de formation agricoles" BEST/CINAM
for PREFTEC/MEADR). Under the national agricultural extension policy, which was inspired
by the positive results of the pilot project experience, all extension activities undertaken by other
director-tes would gradually be integrated under the national agricultural extension program and
the elimination of duplicate activities should result in significant cost savings.  At full
development, the annual costs of extension would be US$7.5 million per annum, of which
UMS3.85 in recurrent costs (salaries, field allowances, maintenance and operating expenses).
This represents about 8 percent of total public expenditure for the agricultural sector in 1994, and
about US$3 million less than the government is currently paying for dispersed extension
activities, a factor which should considerably improve the Government's ability to meet its share
of the costs.
31.          The project's sustainability is strengthened by the many extension activities that
were implemented to introduce efficient tools and methods for upgrading soil fertility and water
conservation management. These activities, based on endogenous strategies already developed
elsewhere, produced durable positive changes in cultivation practices. Their countrywide
application should reverse the current depletion of agricultural potential currently underway and
lead to better uses of relevant technologies in line with farmers' needs.
F.          IDA Performance
32.          Project Preparation. The Bank's performance during project preparation was
satisfactory. The project design was consistent with the Government's long-term strategy to
achieve sustainable agricultural growth. The project was planned to complement IDA's strategy
for agricultural development that included support of the macro-economic and sectoral
adjustment process and a sectoral investment program (focused on food security, extension and
research, livestock development, irrigation and environmental protection). When it became



10                                          Part I. Project Implementation Assessment
apparent during project preparation that a national project was premature in light of the
organizational, managerial, technical and financial difficulties of the DNVA, the Bank supported
the Government's decision to use the project as a pilot operation to acquire experience and
improve the capability of the DNVA, and the project was redesigned appropriately.
33.         Project Supervision. Most of the regular supervision of the project was assured
by the resident extension specialist in the Bank's Mission in Antananarivo. He also provided
advice to the Director of Extension. However, it was only after the appointment of the third
incumbent to the post of extension specialist that the quality of this intensive supervision became
fully cost-effective. Turnaround of project impact and results followed the April 1993 mission of
the AF3AE Division Chief and the Bank's senior extension training specialist, which achieved,
among other things, agreement of the Minister of Agriculture to the replacement of key members
of the project coordination team and an action plan for intensified field supervision and regular
training. The permanent in-country assignment explains the higher than anticipated number of
staff weeks spent on supervision (Table 12 - Part III). Headquarters staff participated in 7
supervision missions. In December 1990, the Bank's agricultural extension unit (AFTAG)
assisted the Government in organizing a week-long training seminar to familiarize Malagasy
staff with the key concepts of extension policy. The Bank's disbursement department (LOAAF)
organized two training missions for Project Implementing Agencies in January 1991 and in
December 1994, to improve Madagascar's general procurement and disbursement performance.
G.          Borrower Performance
34.         Project Preparation. The relatively low level of borrower participation in project
preparation may have contributed to the lack of borrower commitment during the first years of
project implementation. This was corrected in the preparation of the National Agricultural
Extension Program Support Project (Credit 2729-MAG) where Government and Bank staff
prepared the project jointly and worked together to ensure that beneficiaries and stakeholders
were closely associated in the process.
35.         Project Supervision. The first two years of project implementation were seriously
disrupted by: (a) lack of counterpart funds to pay taxes and contractual staff salaries; (b) delays
in selecting competent and motivated staff both in project management and to form the
operational extension service; (c) slowness in procuring equipment and vehicles, and (d) lack of a
clearly delineated chain of command and the consequent dilution of responsibilities as well as
insufficient monitoring and evaluation of the services delivered to farmers. Aware of these
shortcomings, Government commitment improved from 1993 onward with the nomination of a
new project management team.
H.          Economic Evaluation of the Project
36.         The project shows an economic rate of return (ERR) of 24 percent, against 17
percent estimated at appraisal. The calculation is based on: (i) comparisons of production under



Part I. Project Implementation Assessment                                     11
with and without project scenarios; (ii) the incremental benefits derived from implementation of
the project, and (iii) assumptions of the adoption rate of new technologies and their related costs.
A sensitivity analysis based on a possible decline in adoption rates of 5 percent from 1996
onward and an equal variation in costs and benefits, lowered the estimated ERR to about 19
percent (Annex B).
1.          Assessment of Project Outcome
37.         The results of the pilot project were assessed to be satisfactory. Although initially
project implementation was slow, the project achieved its main objectives. The effectiveness of
extension services improved.  Production and productivity increased, and more efficient
technologies - including technologies that are environmentally sound and that often do not
require an important cash investment -- are increasingly being adopted by farmers. Monitoring
protocols and indicators were established to periodically measure the field impact of project
activities. Through demonstration of simple, low-cost technologies on mini-plots, more and
more farmers are becoming convinced of the validity of the recommendations presented and
showing increased interest in the program. Attendance rates at AVB demonstrations are high;
the number of demonstration plots almost doubled from 9,000 to 16,000, and the rate of
participation in the services delivered grew fourfold, from 5 percent to nearly 20 percent.
Exceptionally strong rice cultivation in comparison with prior years particularly attests to the
impact of extension activities, even after allowing for a favorable rainy season. The cumulative
impact of these activities, and those undertaken to improve water managernznt in the
rehabilitated irrigation schemes (PPIs), is estimated at an additional 45,000 tons of paddy
between 1993/94 and 1994/95 alone. Smoother progress towards project achievements could
have been obtained had there been a better programming of extension and training activities and
if other donors and associated projects in extension and research had been more closely involved
from the start in the implementation of the pilot project.
38.         The regular provision of several types of training activities, including monthly
technology review workshops and fortnightly training sessions, have contributed to
sustainability.  These activities provided refresher training to the entire service in the
understanding and skilled use of the principles and tools basic to the relevant methodological
approach, and enhanced the agents' technical and organizational skills, boosting their confidence
in talking to the farmers. At the same time, progressive redeployment of research staff in the
various agro-ecological regions and phased transfer of responsibility to the decentralized units
have helped develop close links between researchers, farmers and extension agents, and better
tailor programs to major farmer concerns. The mechanisms of collaboration between research
and extension services, and their mutual responsibilities in generating and disseminating results,
have been clarified.
39.         Periodic consultative meetings helped identify and develop bridges with various
projects, agencies and technical services and sharply reduced the sometimes negative
competition among various activities. One result of these discussions, was that project execution

was widened to include other agencies, including FAFIALA (bottomland slope development and
protection), FIFAMANOR (tubers and fodder crop development), and RAMILAMINA (better
rice field fertility management). As the program expands, similar agreements will be negotiated
in various regions.
J.          Future Operations
40.         In the past, attempts to redress the weaknesses of poor government services in the
agricultural sector by external donors resulted in the creation of a plethora of projects (more than
seventy in the 1994 PIP), exacerbating problems of coordination and sustainability. Subsequent
attempts to bring together all those involved in research, training and extension have provided
much improved local support and collaboration. Based on the encouraging results posted during
the pilot project after 1993, the Malagasy authorities decided to implement a first four-year phase
of a longer-term program designed to consolidate and extend the pilot project experiment to the
entire country. The Agricultural Extension Program Support Project (Credit 2729-MAG) will
support this effort, and additional Bank funding for extension could be considered if the program
is successful and remains a priority in the CAS.
41.         The national agricultural extension program will be introduced to the country's 28
extension districts over a four-year period. In addition to the 6 pilot extension districts, 3 new
districts became operational in 1995 and a further 7 districts will be operational in 1996 and
1997, respectively, with the remaining 5 districts to be launched in 1998. Almost 3,000 field
extension staff from both public and private sector sources will be involved by the fourth year of
the project with the objective of making extension services available to the country's
approximately 1.5 million farm families. To ensure smooth implementation, it is planned to
decentralize the management of the project to the provinces and agricultural districts of each
project area. Special emphasis will be placed on strengthening the producers' organizations and
developing relationships with the NGOs and the private sector, bearing in mind the comparative
advantages offered by each partner.
K.          Key Lessons Learned
42.         The principal lessons learned from this project can be summarized as follows:
(a)   The project demonstrated the feasibility of significantly raising the effectiveness of
agricultural extension management in Madagascar through the combined
application of basic principles and tools;
(b)   The project demonstrated that, for the improvements to materialize, the extension
and training personnel must receive a minimum of material and financial support, as
well as a uniform system of benefits and allowances for field staff. This support
essentially consists of the provision of means of travel and operating equipment and
supplies, particularly fuel, defrayal of training and field visit costs, and provision of



Part l. Project Implementation Assessment                                       13
office equipment and supplies. This implies the need for full Government
commitment, not only to secure counterpart funding, but also to ensure the
sustainability of the project;
(c)    The feasibility of providing these resources on a regular basis depends, within the
overall budgetary and treasury constraints, on the Government's ability to rationalize
public investment in the sector and to coordinate donor assistance. To that end, the
Government is focusing its strategy around a "prograrn approach" in order to reduce
the number of ongoing or future projects, to enhance their efficiency in the field and
to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort;
(d)   Expansion of the pilot project experience was greatly facilitated by a clear
Governmental policy on the provision of cost effective and relevant farmer
extension services that depend on the coordination and harmonization of
independent field approaches and the development of cooperation among the
various entities involved (projects, NGOs, private sector).
(e)    The impact of intensive supervision from a full time specialist in the resident
mission only really made itself felt with the appointment of a fully experienced
specialist in agricultural extension systems. The experience underlines the critical
importance of the selection of the appropriate candidate for such a post.

REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PILOT PROJECT
(Credit 2150-MAG)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.          Project Implementation
1.          The project comprised extension of a first pilot project financed by the World
Bank in October 1987 and executed in the CIRAGRIs (agricultural districts) of Antananarivo,
Miarinarivo and Moramanga with IDA technical assistance. At the end of this pilot phase, the
project covers a total of nine CIRAGRIs: those of Tana Nord, Tana Sud (because of its huge
size, Antananarivo was split into two districts), Miarinarivo, Moramanga, Ambatondrazaka,
Amparafaravola and, more recently, Antsiranana, Mahajanga and Toliara. The project got off to
a difficult start owing to the socioeconomic situation that prevailed in Madagascar in 1991 and
1992. The Agricultural Extension Directorate was reorganized at the end of the first pilot project
to make it more efficient and fit it to meet the future demands of transition to the national phase
of the current project. The successive internal reorganizations of MINAGRI did not take these
PPVA concerns into account.
2.          Regarding financial management, the project officials were greatly hampered by
the delay in setting up the special account: the expense allowances were not paid promptly,
settlement of suppliers' invoices was delayed somewhat (the field agents are no longer motivated
to continue, and the project has trouble in finding suppliers willing to accept its order notes).
3.          In July 1993 the MINAGRI project officials were compelled to change the entire
coordination team because of the unsatisfactory results being obtained. Since then the results of
the 1993 off-season, the 1993/94 season, the 1994 off-season and the 1994/95 season have been
substantiated in figures. The various extension ratios were revised and adjusted in the interest of
greater efficiency. Collaboration agreements were signed with the various project partners.
4.          The most recent results posted by the PPVA led the World Bank to agree to the
Malagasy Government's request that the project move on to its national phase. The first
expansion of the project took place in the CIRAGRIs of Tulear, Majunga and Antsiranana. Start-
up workshops have been conducted to determine if all the ongoing development projects in these
regions and the PPVA are complementary. The expected results are very encouraging.
5.          Concerning equipment, the PPVA suffered substantial delays: the 182 motor
cycles for which a call for bids was issued in late December 1992 were not received until June
1995, on the eve of project closure.



Part II: Project Review From Borrower's Perspective                           15
B.           Project Results
6.           The activities carried out during this pilot phase mainly comprised:
(a)   instituting and developing links with research (FOFIFA or other agencies involved
in research);
(b)   setting up a more cost-efficient structure and organization (determination of
standards and ratios);
(c)   training of the extension agents to improve their grasp both of the system generally
and of extension techniques and methods;
(d)   setting up an M&E system. as the basis for retargeting the extension activities and
measuring their impact.
7.          Technical results. Despite the initial difficulties, technical gains were posted in
the field. The technical activities focused mainly on:
(a)   setting up demonstration and test plots, essential tools for persuading the farmers to
adopt the various messages. The pilot phase successfully demonstrated that the
application of simple messages by a number of farmers, with the consequent
multiplier effect, can yield very cogent results (an incremental 13,000 tons of paddy
in the season 1993/94 and 35,000 tons in 1994/95);
(b)   supervision of the extension agents to help them perform their work properly. An
efficient system of supervision at each echelon was set up, making it possible to
correct certain errors in time and prevent them from spreading elsewhere;
(c)   monitoring field performance and measuring message adoption rates. (Tables of
results appended).
8.           Training provided. Despite the lack of a training plan, several types of training
were provided during this pilot phase:
(a)   extension service initiation training for the entire team;
(b)   monthly technology review workshops (AMRTs) and fortnightly training sessions
(FQs). These AMRTs are more or less firmly established as periodic and
continuing training activities. The workshops are beginning to be held regularly
with the participation of various resource persons (research service, NGOs or other
specialist services), depending on the training topics suggested by the constraints
identification studies. The main topics of these periodic training sessions relate
essentially to the upgrading of production techniques.
(c)   specific training sessions, on topics vital to the proper conduct of the extension
activities that could not be covered in an AMRT program;
(d)   training sessions on teaching techniques and methodology, to enable the extension
agents to transmit the messages effectively;



16                                 Part II: Project Review From Borrower's Perspective
(e)   study trips and regional workshops and seminars (both in Madagascar and abroad)
to allow the extension service officials to compare extension methods and introduce
improvements into the project.
9.          Collaboration agreements. The project used the services of specialist agencies to
conduct training sessions for its extension staff and carry out specific extension activities. To
that end, collaboration agreements were concluded with:
(a)   FAFIALA, concerning tanety development and protection (in year 3);
(b)   the NGO RAMILAMINA, concerning the use of azolla (year 2);
(c)   FIFAMANOR, concerning the cultivation of potatoes, sweet potatoes and fodder
crops (year 2).
10.         Collaboration with the Ministry's other directorates and technical agencies was
also beginning to be effective: the staff of these directorates were acting as resource persons
during the monthly workshops and participating in the diagnosis and monitoring of field results.
11.         Financial results. The delay in setting up the special account (three years after
project start-up) seriously hampered the financial management of the project. Project operating
expenditures were limited by the inadequacy of the counterpart funds available to pay the various
duties and taxes.
C.          Borrower Performance
12.         It was agreed that the PPVA staff would undergo continuing training and testing
following which agents deemed to be incapable of improvement would be taken out of the
project. The expected impact of this measure was limited by a number of administrative,
political and social factors.
13.         There is a shortage of personnel in the field but an over-abundance in the large
cities. For the same reasons as mentioned above, personnel redeployment took place on only a
very small scale (assignment of supervisory staff to a Firaisana lacking in social infrastructure
(hospital, school, etc.) is often a difficult decision. Most of the basic extension agents are
contractual staff and therefore not assignable).
14.         The counterpart funds were never adequate or released on time. For example, the
motor cycle spare parts accepted in June 1995 are still being held in customs because of
inadequate funding. The annual allocations to the project barely suffice to pay salaries and a tiny
fraction of taxes and duties. Purchases of operating supplies and spare parts by National
Coordination was limited by lack of sufficient counterpart funds to pay the taxes and duties on
them.



Part II. Project Review From Borrower's Perspective                           17
15.         The opening of a special account at a primary bank greatly helped the project
settle its invoices and pay off its staff travel allowance arrears. A weakness noted, on the other
hand, was the failure to decentralize the Special Advance Accounts (Caisses d'Avance).
D.          Outlook
16.         Experience during this pilot phase yielded a number of lessons concerning ways
of improving the various components of the national phase of the project in order to achieve its
objective of enhancing the quality of life in the rural areas. They point to the need to:
'a)   implement decentralization so as to confer accountability on the regional services
(the PROVAGRIs and CIRAGRIs);
(b)   improve coordination with the other ongoing projects and the other agencies active
in rural development (NGOs and public services);
(c)   upgrade the project's budgetary and financial accounting, taking into account the
external audit recommendations;
(d)   furnish the various categories of personnel with material support;
(e)   strengthen the diagnosis process in order to refine the extension messages and
thereby tailor them more closely to the farmers' real needs;
(f)   step up the results to be obtained in order to remunerate the resources deployed;
(g)   consolidate the program M&E system and information circuit;
(h)   monitor the impact of the extension activities by measuring the rates of adoption of
the messages by the farmers;
(i)   consolidate clear supervision responsibilities and organization at each level;
G)    ensure regular and continuing training of the extension agents.

ANNEX A: SUMMARY OF AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS
1.          The audit reports on the various National Agricultural Extension Program
(PNVA) credits (PPF-486, MAG-2150, FNDE 99-46-G, 91-01, Malagasy Counterpart Fund)
were unqualified by the auditors but provided the following recommendations, most of which
were acted on by the project coordination unit:
(a)   systematically post all fixed asset acquisitions to the accounts (with date of receipt)
and carry their value (value net of tax per invoice) to the fixed assets ledger, and
note therein all transfers to users;
(b)   post to the ledger all requests for reimbursement against the special account as
recorded in the certified statement of expenditures;
(c)   prepare the statement of financial condition for Credit 2150(a) MAG as of
December 31, 1994;
(d)   keep accounts of the Counterpart Funds at the PNVA central office so as to allow
regular monitoring of the Malagasy Government's contribution per CIRAGRI
(accounting charge, etc.) [and] transfers from the Counterpart Funds;
(e)   obtain from the Treasury's External Relations Service (SREET) the serial numbers
of transfer orders and requests for withdrawal of funds;
(f)   obtain the World Bank statements from the Treasury (Ministry of Finance);
(g)   obtain a copy of the statement of the corresponding bank from the Central Bank of
Madagascar (BCM);
(h)   maintain a continuous statement for Direct Drawings and the Special Account;
(i)   prepare a bank reconciliation statement at the end of each month;
(i)   have the expenditure charge categories checked (by the official in charge) before the
expenditures are posted;
(k)   number each operation in step with its registration in the books;
(1)   record all payment references in the books (payment orders and BRs);
(m)   attach all pertinent vouchers to each request;
(n)   conclude service arrangements between the DALF chief and the comptable
depositaire whenever necessary;
(o)   prepare an inventory of the assets acquired under the project;
(p)   find suitable premises for installation of the data processing equipment in order to
avoid its under-utilization and otherwise make sure that it is operational (training of
agents, etc.);
(q)   return all unused equipment to the central store, drawing up minutes of proceedings;
(r)   locate the equipment acquired under the project;
(s)   draw up minutes of proceedings for all transfers of equipment by the holders and the
comptable depositaire;
(t)   have the inventory listing signed and dated by the comptable depositaire;
(u)   draw up an official declaration of loss for all equipment lost and send a copy to the
National Coordinator of the project;
