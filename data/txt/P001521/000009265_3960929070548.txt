MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PILOT PROJECT
*  1.     The following memorandum and recouendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of Madagascar for SDR 2.8
million (US$ 3.68 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The
*          proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and
would constitute a three-year pilot phase of a long-term development effort
to increase the efficiency of the agricultural extension services in
Madagascar. It is part of a broader long-term strategy aiming at
sustainable agricultural development through modernization of agricultural
practices, environmental measures and population policies. The project
would put particular emphasis on replicability and financial
sustainability.
2.        Backgrounds Agriculture is Madagas_r's main contributor to the
national economy. It employs some 85% of the population and accounts for
801 of export earnings. Agriculture has generally performed poorly in the
1975-87 period, w^ith growth rates well below population growth. This is
reflected in a continuous decline in per capita income and in environmental
degradation. The main reason for this poor performance has been the
Government's interventionist policies in pricing and marketing, as well as
high export taxes, while at the same tlme allowing its services to the
sector (research, extension, and roads and Irrigation maintenance) to
decline in quality and coverage. As a result, performance of agricultural
support services have become gradually paralysed due to weak management,
poor inter-agency coordination, severe financial constraints on the
operating budget, overstaffing, and lack (of sequate training and
incentives. The Government is now considering making the institutions
responsible for basic agricultural services more effective as well as
reducing reliance on autonomous operations. The National Agricultural
Research Project, approved by the Executive Directors in mid-June 1989, and
the proposed Agricultural Extension Pilot Project concentrate on ways to
improve research and extension and their links with other services. The
proposed project has also been designed to support activities under the
Environment Program, approved by the Executive Directors on April 17, 1990.
3.        Initial Pilot Activities:  Pilot extension activities were
initiated in 1988 in three extension districts to prepare a national
extension project. Activities, however, did not take off in earnest until
April 1989, because of procurement delays, lack of timely funds, and late
staff assignments. As sufficient evidence was not available, further
testing was required of the adaptability, replicability and sustainability
of the proposed extension strategy in the Malagasy context, where several
donors finance projects with separate extension structures (including IDA
Cr. 1337-MAG). The Government therefore decided that the project would
serve as a pilot operation to provide the necessary experience, assess
various extension approaches, and build up the DVA.



4.        Despite the short testing period, definite improvements are
visible in both work organixation and management. maps and programs of
visits are curreitly used by most agents. The organization of farmers In
groups has become the dominant vehile, of extension as opposed to the
earlier method of visits to individual farmers. Training program have
been established on the basis of ability tests taken by all field staff in
the three pilot extension districts in February 1989. Bi-monthly traliing
essions of extension agents have been instituted and are adhered to,
whereas monthly workshops for Subject Matter Speciallsts (Techniclins
Formateurs or TF) are becoming more regular. During the main season, area
specific messages were extended for rice, malze, groundnuts and In some
areas cassava. During the 1989 winter season, technical messages were
being extended for wheat, potatoes and vegetables, leading to marked
Improvements In yields, where recowaendations had been properly
implemented. In ord-r to continue progress, the extension districts
stressed the need for closer links with research, especially In the area of
testing and plant protection.
5.        Rationale for IDA involvements Madagascar's overall economic
growth will continue to depend on Increasing productivity in the
agricultural sector. IDA has been assisting Government in this sector
through the Agricultural Institutions Technical Assistance Project (Cr.
1249-MAG) and its follow-up, the Second Agricultural Institutions
Development Project (Cr. 1709-NAG) under which funding was provided for the
preparation of the proposed project. Continued support by IDA, both
technically and finanially, would be essential to achieving success in
Improving the extension services and thus Increasing agricultural
productivity as part of IDA's overall strategy to contribute to sustainable
agricultural growth and environmental protection. Furthermore, the project
would support IDA's strategy to help Government refocus its area of
intervention away from production to the efficient provision of services.
The project complements the IDA-financed National Agricultural Research
Project (Cr. 2041-MAG) and the Enviroament Program (Cr. 2125-MAG).
6.        Proiect Obiectivess The project would serve as a pilot to test
an extension strategy In 5 extension districts with particular emphasis on
adaptation to the Malagasy context (dealing with groups rather than
individual farmers, gradually suppressing the supervisor level, and
capitalizing on the comparatively high literacy rate in rural areas),
sustainability in light of public finance constraints, and possible future
replicability nationwide. The project would therefore initiate and test
the viability of a long-term action plan for agricultural extension. The
project would strengthen Government extension services, promote general
principles of sound field management to ensure efficient and cost effective
extension, and harmonize various approaches adopted by other donors and
non-governmental organizations. Strengthening Government extension
services would mainly entail improving staff competence through regular
training, gradually decreasing the overall number of personnel whenever
warranted, keeping lean teams of competent staff at the MINAGRI, and
involving provincial levels. Harmonizing the various approaches to
extension would, however, not be synonymous with standardization. Rather,
it would provide the opportunity to select the most cost effective
approaches as results become available, on the basis of an in-depth
evaluation to be carried out at the end of year 2.

7.        Project Descriptions  In order to achieve the above objectives,
the project woulds (i) reorganize end strengthen extension servicen in 5
of the country's 23 extension districts, including Ambatondrazaka,
Antananarivo, Amparafaravolo, Miarinarivo and Moramanga; (ii) provide
systematic in-service training for project staff at all levela; (iII) focus
adaptive research on validation and diftusion of economically and
environmentally sound technology; (iv) strengthen the monitoring and
evaluation capability at both the central and regional levels; (v)
strengthen financial management; (vi) improve organizational and managerial
capacity of the DVA; and (vii) make funds available for studies, an in-
depth review of the project and alternative approaches to extension at the
end of year 2, and the preparation of a follow-up project that would draw
on the results of the project review. The study program is intended to
look expressly for ways to reduce the cost of extension to the Government
throught (i) involving the private sector and NGOs more forcefully; (ii)
seeking for ways to reduce costs at the DVA, e.g. by reducing excess
personnel; and (iii) reviewing the possibility of cost recovery mechanisms.
Also, both MINAGRI and IDA would carefully monltor the project's actual
costs. During project lplementation, emphasis will be put on natural
resources management, including watershed management and anti-erosion
measures.
8.        The project to be carried out over three years would provide
funding for civil works, technical assistance, consultancies, studies,
vehicles and equipment, and training. Total project cost is estimated at
US$5.41 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$1.1
million (211). A breakdown of estimated costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Madagascar are given in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 8334-MAG, is being
distributed separately.
9.        ARreements reached:  At negotiations, the following agreements
were reached: (i) adherence to accounting and auditing arrangements; (ii)
scope and implementation of the in-depth project review at the end of
implementation year 2; (iii) establishment of Government funded accounts
for the DVA and the five extension districts; (iv) adequate field
allowances would be paid to DVA staff needed for project execution and the
corresponding budget allocations would be made; (v) terms of reference,
cost estimates and arrangements for executing the studies would be prepared
by DVA and submitted to IDA for arproval; (vi) DVA would submit to IDA for
approval its budget and work program, no later than September 30 of the
preceding year; and (vii) MINAGRI would take the necessary measures to
ensure that funds are available from which the salaries of contractual
workers would be paid during the first quarter of each year.
10.       Benefits:  The proposed project is expected to benefit about
125,000 farm families directly and an unknown number through spillover
effects. In the short-term the main benefits would include improved
efficiency and higher effectiveness of the DVA extension service. Criteria
for measuring such achievements would be (a) increased collaboration



- 4 -
between DVA and the research agency, (b) a greater knowledge of farmers'
demands and concerns by extension agents, and (c) the elaboration sad
implementation of measures to streamline the organization. In the long-
te.m, the project would improve farmers' productivity, increase incomes for
the rural population, increase food security, and would be a main tool in
stemming environmental degradation.
11.       Risks:  The risks Include those usually assoclated with
extension projectst (a) Inadequate and/or untimely provision of budgetary
resources by Government (even though the relevant incremental cost per farm
family appears high at US$7.68, it compares favorably with several self
standing projects in Madagascar); (b) staff of low competence; (c) the
possible inability of extension and research services to produce messages
which farmers value in the short run; (d) slower than expected adoption
rates by farmers of the recommended technical advice; and (e) poor inter-
agency coordination. To minimize these risks emphasis will be put on
strengthening financial and management capabil'.ties at both the central and
the extension district levels; reinforcing links between extension and
research; preparation of annual work programs and related budgets; and an
in-depth review of the project with emphasis on impact, sustainability and
replicability at the end of year two. The adequate provision of
counterpart funds will be reviewed annua; I in the framework of the Public
Expenditure Program. In addition, a Bank staff member has been assigned to
the Resident Mission to specifically advise on project implementation.
12.       Recommendation:  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
