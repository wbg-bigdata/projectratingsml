I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.1.1 Country and sector background: El Salvador’s unique setting – highly volcanic and isolated
from Central America’s Atlantic forests – supports many diverse species of vertebrates, plants, birds and
other life which persist despite the country retaining just two percent of its primary forest vegetation. The
globally and regionally significant biodiversity within the Natural Protected Areas System (NPAS),
managed by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), is threatened, reflecting
population pressures and land-related struggles which have resulted in widespread encroachment into
protected areas (PAs) and consequent deterioration and destruction of habitats through forest conversion,
pollution, and over-exploitation of natural resources. 1 At the time of appraisal in 2005, some of the
smaller protected areas within the NPAS no longer contained sufficient natural/near-natural habitats to
merit special protection status. Despite the global, regional and national significance of its biodiversity
resources, El Salvador had/has the least amount of land and water area formally protected of all countries
in the Mesoamerican Biodiversity Hotspot (about 75,500 ha, 4.6% of the national territory).

1.1.2 Challenges facing the NPAS: The NPAS’ goal was to protect these remaining areas but it faced
many challenges: (i) most NPAS lands - about 118 protected areas totaling about 40,000 ha - were “paper
parks? with inadequate legal framework or physical protection and no managed buffer zones; (ii) the
institutional framework governing these lands was confusing and even though MARN was responsible for
the entire NPAS it had legal title over only 7,072 ha; (iii) the quality and type of environmental goods and
services and biodiversity resources protected were not well known, making their management and
prioritization difficult. Refinement of the NPAS National Strategy, definition of priorities and greater
stakeholder consensus regarding this strategy, and conservation, were essential; (iv) MARN lacked the
legal tools to properly manage/consolidate the NPAS and El Salvador lacked experience in addressing
human settlements in PAs. A methodology was needed to identify illegal and legal settlements within
PAs and regularize the latter; 2 and (v) MARN’s acute resource constraints, both human and financial,
threatened its ability to consolidate the NPAS, and land tenure needed clarification. The legal limbo had
led to invasions of state-owned, unoccupied lands by poor rural groups.

1.1.3 Rationale for Bank assistance: The rationale for the Protected Areas Consolidation and
Administration Project (PACAP) was linked closely to the objectives of the second Land Administration
Project (LAP) which was to systematically assess land tenure nationwide. This had important
implications for the NPAS since proposed LAP II activities included extensive geographic data collection,
determination of land rights, and cadaster/registration of all national lands. LAP II provided a unique but
limited window of conservation opportunity to advance MARN’s biodiversity agenda. Further, the
Government of El Salvador (GOES) was keenly interested in working with MARN, CNR and the Bank to
take advantage of this opportunity and formally-requested Bank assistance to prepare the PACAP. The
Bank’s competitive advantage in regional land issues with 20 years of experience in Central and South

  The PAD inadvertently used “national? and “natural? inter-changeably throughout for the Spanish acronym SANP (Sistema de
Areas Naturales Protegidas or Natural Protected Areas System (NPAS)). The ICR opted for “natural? because it is both the
wording in the Grant Agreement and an accurate translation of the acronym. Both words refer to the same policy instrument and
system.
2
  Both natural protected areas (NPA) and mangroves were considered PAs in which private or public entities could conduct
MARN-approved activities. Mangroves were managed as sustainable use areas where residents could secure land rights as
concessions with management plans. In NPAs, the new Law did not permit new human settlement once areas were established as
protected, except for the natural reserve category where no human settlement whatsoever was permitted.


                                                             1
America, and in Global Environmental Facility (GEF) operations in the region including the Meso-
American Biological Corridor (MBC) also drove the project rationale.

1.1.4 The PACAP was partially-blended with the Bank-supported LAP II, whose planned, massive
collection of land-related data was seen as a foundation for large-scale conservation including the
consolidation of protected areas, developing a strategy for addressing irregular settlement within the PAs,
a link to MARN’s information catalog and the data needs of the PA system, and as promoting MARN’s
agenda of consolidating key conservation areas and other PAs under the NPAS.

1.1.5 GEF support was warranted because PACAP would: conserve globally and regionally-significant
biodiversity including critically-endangered species and systems; enhance Salvadoran sections of the
MBC and overall NPAS; support piloting and consolidation of two PAs and develop a strategy affecting
all of them; capture lessons from the piloting exercise for future scaling up; and, complement the GEF-
supported Payment for Environmental Services (PES) Project. Without the GEF increment, local efforts
alone had not been sufficient to secure conservation of the PA system.

1.2 Original Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

1.2.1 The Global Environmental Objective of PACAP was to conserve El Salvador's globally
significant biodiversity by strengthening the natural protected areas system and consolidating two priority
protected areas (see footnote 1).

1.2.2   Key performance indicators were:

    x   Natural protected areas system strategy improved and pilot-tested (see footnote 1);
    x   Two pilot areas consolidated and effectively managed (Tracking Tool score of at least 40 for
        35,600 ha in Bahia de Jiquilisco and 1,917 ha in Lago Guija San Diego-Las Barras;
    x   Biodiversity benefits established in at least 12,400 ha: (i) for Bahia de Jiquilisco PA, at least
        11,000 ha of mangrove or associated humid forest within the core protection zones to have
        negligible deforestation compared to baseline (less than 1% over five years); and (ii) for Lago
        Guija San Diego-Las Barras, at least 1,400 ha of dry tropical forest or associated riparian forest to
        have negligible deforestation compared to baseline (less than 1% over five years).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

1.4.1 The beneficiary pool was broadly-defined and inclusive. A participatory social assessment
identified project beneficiaries/stakeholders as: (i) specific focus groups such as very poor families mostly
with un-regularized land rights and displaced by the civil war, and peasants; (ii) wealthy people holding
legal but irregular titles in areas subject to MARN’s jurisdiction; (iii) MARN itself; (iv) the National
Registry Center (CNR, the LAP implementing agency); (v) municipal offices; (vi) non-governmental
organizations (NGO); and (vii) Community Development Associations (ADESCO). All were expected to
benefit from knowing the location of NPAS boundaries, the identity of legal titleholders to the land, their
rights in regard to this land, and its use restrictions. Other cohorts included were civil society - the local
and national population expected to benefit from an improved PA system – and the regional and global
populations likely to gain from the conservation of biodiversity.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

1.5.1 The Project was a grant funded by a US$5.0 million GEF contribution, partially-blended with the
LAP II Bank Loan (P086953) in an amount of US$5.0 million. Total project cost was US$13.4 million
including Government counterpart of US$3.4 million. The Project had three components supported by six
sub-components, as follows:

Component 1: Strengthening of the NPAS (est. total cost US$5.4 m of which US$1.40 m GEF) to
enable its long-term sustainable management by consolidating the existing strategy for the NPAS in
partnership with all relevant stakeholders and through development of an adequate institutional and legal
framework for the administration and management of the NPAS. Sub-components were: (i) Consolidation
of the NPAS strategy; (ii) Strengthening of the legal and institutional framework; and (iii) Public
dissemination and awareness campaign.

Component 2: Consolidation and Management of Pilot Protected Areas (est. total cost US$7.1 m of
which GEF US$2.9 m) financed the development, testing and finalization of a methodology to
consolidate two pilot Protected Areas including their delimitation, demarcation and regularization, and to
develop and implement management plans for their sustainable use. The results of this component were
expected to feed into the consolidation of the NPAS Strategy (Component 1). Sub-components were: (i)
Characterization and delimitation of pilot PAs; (ii) Legalization and regularization of pilot PAs; and (iii)
Management plans for pilot PAs.

Component 3: Project Administration (est. total cost US$0.9 m of which US$0.7 m GEF) financed
project management mechanisms including project coordination, planning, and monitoring and evaluation
(M&E). The M&E system was to be the same as that developed for the LAP II. The system was to be
strengthened to include key indicators to measure GEF project performance.

1.6 Revised Components

1.7 Other significant changes

1.7.1 LAP II was approved by the Bank’s Board in March 2005 but never became effective. The Loan
Agreement was terminated on September 18, 2006 due to the failure of the National Assembly to ratify
the Loan within 18 months of Board approval. This event meant a project focused more tightly on MARN
– leveraging CNR support where possible – and unable to capitalize on the information intended to be
collected, and the enabling political environment likely to be created by LAP II. PACAP reverted to a
design set aside at appraisal. 3 The impact on PACAP is discussed further in this report.

1.7.2 The Grant Agreement was amended through a 2nd order Restructuring in May 2010 as follows: (i)
created a new disbursement Category 4 for Community Subprojects under Part B of the Project; (ii)
reallocated US$200,000 from Category B to the new Category 4; and (iii) included community
participation and quality-based selection as eligible procurement methods (the latter for procurement of
consultants). Also, the prohibition on involuntary physical relocation, already in force under the Project
was made more explicit in amended legal documents. The justification provided was the inadvertent

   As stated in the PAD Section 6, “a protected areas project focused only on MARN, without any link to CNR and the LAP II?.
This was rejected at appraisal because the Bank Team believed it would miss the opportunity to capitalize on the information
collected, and the enabling political environment created, by the LAP II.

omission of community subprojects from the Grant Agreement despite being described in the PAD.
Further, communities were part of the Project’s Resettlement Process Framework and the restructuring
was seen as supporting the Project’s Safeguards obligations.

1.7.3 The Bank agreed on May 20, 2012 to extend PACAP’s closing date by 12 months to June 29,
2012 to compensate for delayed effectiveness and permit further progress on key activities. A second
request for a six month extension was denied by the Bank essentially because Bank management felt that
six months would not have been sufficient for the Project to achieve its more ambitious objectives,
particularly legal.4

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Background analysis and lessons learned:

2.1.1 A series of events had provided a positive enabling environment for addressing threats to globally
significant biodiversity protected within the NPAS. First, the Protected Areas Law, on hold for 25 years,
had finally passed in 2005, providing MARN with the legal framework needed to oversee the PAs, as
well as significant political capital. Second, the Bank-supported Land Administration Program (LAP)
was mid-way through completion of the cadaster and registry of national lands, considered a priority for
the new government of the period. Preparation of the LAP II identified the importance of clarifying land
tenure issues in and around (potential) PAs without which LAP’s efforts to address all national lands
would not succeed. CNR, the LAP’s implementing agency, had involved MARN in that project including
a component for demarcation of three PAs. While MARN’s participation in the LAP was historically
limited by its capacity, the Bank felt that a partially blended operation with GEF funds would boost
consolidation of the NPAS by exploiting opportunities under the LAP.

2.1.2 The Project was also linked closely to the GOES agenda in the Pais Seguro Program which
defined actions to enhance the environment for future generations and ensure that national development
was environmentally and socially sustainable. It also responded to the country’s biodiversity priorities as
set out in the 2002 National Strategy on Biological Diversity whose priorities included a biological
information system and consolidation of the NPAS. The Project also supported the draft Protected Areas
Strategy (2005), the proposed National Land Use Development Plan which sought to create 15
Conservation Areas (CA) to incorporate the fragmented NPAS within a larger landscape, and the new PA
Law which provided the legal basis to consolidate the NPAS.

2.1.3 The FY05-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) acknowledged the need to consolidate El
Salvador’s legal and regulatory framework for the environmental sector. The Project would contribute to
the third objective of the CAS - enhancing security and reducing vulnerability. By supporting
consolidation of the NPAS, along with strengthening its institutional and legal framework, the Project



4
   The decision-making process was marked by lack of communication between the Bank and Government. MARN maintains
that a meeting in San Salvador in 2012 with Bank financial officials and representatives of several Bank-supported projects
showed that delayed launching combined with lack of understanding about Bank procurement and FM procedures was common
to all of them and that capacity considerations should have been built into implementation plans/schedules.




                                                            4
would contribute directly to addressing biodiversity conservation and sustainable resource use, and to
reducing environmental degradation and vulnerability to natural disaster.

2.1.4    Lessons learned: The lessons of other GEF and non-GEF projects heeded in project design were:
(i) an adequate, enabling legal and regulatory framework with human resource and institutional capacity-
building to boost sustainability; (ii) fostering inter-institutional coordination and avoiding ad hoc
approaches, reflected in the planned close collaboration with CNR via LAP II; (iii) activities and projects
which clarify legal and physical land rights in/around protected areas, demarcate and consolidate
protected areas, and support conservation-friendly productive investments; (iv) creation of conservation
areas (CA) to address a primary source of biodiversity degradation and better-manage a highly
fragmented PA system; (v) proven sustainability and thus inclusion of alternative activity, biodiversity-
friendly subprojects; and (vi) broad stakeholder inclusion as key to conservation success reflected in
PACAP’s stress on participation, local organizations and consultation.

Project design and quality at entry:

2.1.5 Political events in the country and cancellation of LAP II, along with six other new Bank projects
also awaiting legislative approval, led to an effort by Bank management to keep PACAP alive as a
standalone grant to preserve a dialogue with GOES at a difficult time in the relationship. 5 The decision to
proceed without LAP II may have affected the Project’s quality at entry by: (i) leaving MARN with a
complex and innovative project, key elements of which exceeded its capacity and buy-in; (ii) not
conducting a reassessment of its feasibility without LAP II/CNR and possibly restructuring it up-front;
and/or (iii) not focusing on building ownership for the operation beyond MARN, e.g., involving the
Ministries of Fisheries, Tourism and Agriculture. That said, there was reason to believe that important
outcomes could be achieved to support the burgeoning conservation agenda in El Salvador.

2.1.6 GEO and Outcome Indicators: The GEO was complex but rational and aligned with country
and sector strategies. The PACAP focused on the GEO as an incremental benefit financed with GEF
resources. 6 The higher level objectives – not expected to be measured within the life of the Project –
sought to enhance the environment for future generations and ensure that national development was
environmentally and socially sustainable. Key Indicators however, did not fully capture the scope or
meaning of the GEO and several were unrealistic. For example, for the purposes of this Project, protected
areas consolidation and management represented a much broader set of activities than those captured by
the Tracking Tool. While this instrument is widely used and recognized, supplementary indicators may
have been useful. Similarly, while it could be assumed that reducing deforestation could prevent the loss
of biodiversity, more precise measurement was needed to gauge the actual “biodiversity benefits
established? as a result of persistent tree/vegetative cover. Further, the Bank Team realized that indicators
were deficient in strategic areas: local natural resources management (NRM), participation, biological
information and conflict resolution, but no change was made. Some indicators over-reached, e.g.,
expecting to quantify by end-project the revenues raised from natural resource use concessions, visitor
fees and other cost recovery mechanisms from pilot areas within a still-nascent NPAS lacking defined
priority areas. The project emphasized adaptive management meaning that high quality M&E was needed
to feed results into improving project design during implementation. The two pilot areas were selected as
representing the conditions faced by most PAs within the NPAS, thus promoting future replication.

2.1.7 The two main components were effectively inter-dependent, the idea being that outcomes on the
ground under Component 2 would feed into the legal, policy and strategic goals under Component 1. The


5
    PACAP as a Grant needed approval by only a simple majority of the Assembly.
6
    The Project Development Objective (PDO), also included in the PAD, was intended to be achieved by LAP II.

                                                              5
Project demanded heavy investment in consultants, productive inter-institutional partnerships and
communication, and the commitment of local stakeholders, especially the residents in the parks whose
support would be captured through a combination of awareness-building, organization and investment
incentives. Project design inadvertently omitted from the Grant Agreement a disbursement category,
financing and appropriate procurement provisions for planned community investment subprojects in the
pilot PAs based on local Management Plans (Component 2, subcomponent 3). Restructuring in 2010
corrected this.

2.1.8 Participation: As mentioned in 1.4.1, a social assessment conducted in each pilot protected area
identified all key stakeholders with an interest in project design and implementation, and efforts were
made to incorporate them throughout the project cycle. Further, six participatory workshops, national and
local, convened national agencies, municipalities, the private sector, ADESCOs and NGOs to gauge how
to integrate national conservation objectives with land regularization and PACAP’s specific objectives.
The Project was committed to early and frequent stakeholder consultation to mitigate or prevent social
impacts and potential conflicts arising from regularization activities in the pilot areas.

2.1.9 Risk assessment: Risks were correctly projected based on projects with similar/related design
both in El Salvador and other countries, but downplayed in some cases. Mitigation measures were
generally sound. Risks related to land tenure conflict were realistic, and in practice, the mitigation
measures described were effective in minimizing new conflict and resolving existing conflicts through
alternative measures. Counterpart funding was not mentioned as a risk but GOES performance was
inadequate in practice. Notably, the vast majority of project activities were procurement-dependent and
the MARN/PACAP team had no prior experience with Bank procurement rules/ processes, but
procurement capacity was not a stated risk.

2.1.10 GEF Operational Program Goal and incremental costs: The Project contributed to all four
GEF Operational Programs (OP) by strengthening the Salvadoran protected area system which included
arid and semi-arid, coastal and marine, forest and mountain ecosystems. The Project specifically
supported OP2 (Coastal and Marine Ecosystems) and OP3 (Forest Ecosystems). Activities in the Bahia
de Jiquilisco Conservation Area were to help the conservation and sustainable use of El Salvador’s largest
area of mangrove forests; in the Lake Guija San Diego-Las Barras Protected Area Complex the Project
would support the conservation and sustainable use of the freshwater biodiversity of Lake Guija and the
largest dry tropical forest in El Salvador, a high priority eco-region. The Project also supported GEF’s
Strategic Priority 1 (Catalyzing Sustainability of Protected Areas). Further, by piloting the conservation
of two PAs and heavily stressing learning and adaptive management, it also supported SP4 (Generation
and Dissemination of Best Practices), integrating results into a redefined National Protected Areas Policy.

2.1.11 The incremental cost – the difference between the baseline scenario and the GEF Alternative -
was US$10.0 million to be financed partly by the US$5.0 million GEF Grant which would fund the
conservation of globally significant biodiversity, and US$5.0 million from the LAP II Bank loan to fund
data collection, land demarcation and other local benefits.

2.2 Implementation

Factors affecting project implementation:




                                                    6
2.2.1 The cancellation of LAP II impacted on the Project’s ability to achieve its objectives. 7 The
central issue was how PACAP would be implemented in the absence of broader LAP II activities and
CNR’s leadership, once the decision was taken to execute it as a standalone. CNR was a strong,
technically and politically well-positioned institution with the mandate to address land issues broadly,
was the key institution driving the design and approval of the GEF Grant/PACAP, and had a crucial role
in technical training. 8 When LAP II was cancelled, CNR’s support evaporated and PACAP was weakened.
CNR’s relationship with the Project was distant and not always cooperative, despite a signed
memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two institutions. MARN was committed to the PAs –
its traditional sphere of influence - but without LAP II, was not in a strong position to lead the political
dialogue around land issues and struggled to address them, politically and technically, throughout.9 Bank
missions tried to promote dialogue with CNR and encourage its support for the Project. The Bank team
states that CNR recognized (mostly at the technical level) that its participation made sense and its
engagement with MARN on project issues improved considerably in the final year when CNR joined
MARN in a new, high-level Technical Roundtable.

2.2.2 The demise of LAP II took US$5.0 m of planned blended financing off the table. These funds were
intended to advance the administration of all PAs nation-wide through their delimitation and through
cadaster and aerial surveys/data collection for MARN’s use. When LAP II did not materialize: (i) core
counterpart activities were defined to include only those necessary to achieve GEF-specific objectives and
indicators; (ii) “full implementation? came to include only demarcation of the 40 PAs reflected in the
relevant intermediate outcome indicator, not PAs nationwide; (iii) on the grounds that the Project’s
objectives, scope and indicators remained the same, the Bank secured from GOES some US$2.63 million
in counterpart financing to ensure implementation of the now-standalone project, especially Component 2,
in addition to US$2.2 million of in-kind contribution.10

2.2.3 Project design, specifically the land regularization and legal aspects, was highly innovative in the
Salvadoran context and as a standalone exceeded MARN’s technical and operational capacity and failed
to achieve its full buy-in. Further, the policy shift in 2009 from a traditional concept of conservation as
intrinsically good, to “inclusive conservation? stressing its social function, was good for and consistent
with the Project but it put the onus on MARN to commit to new ideas including legal solutions,
regularization of residents inside the parks, and greater focus on risk management. Also, while GOES did
not block the Project, nor did it wholeheartedly support it, for reasons associated with the political
sensitivity of land regularization. While MARN orchestrated impressive achievements under Component
2 and made some headway under Component 1, it was not sufficiently committed to the legal and policy
side to proactively translate the results of the former into the bigger NPAS legal and policy framework
goals sought by Component 1, at least during the life of the Project. That said, MARN’s formulation of
the new National Environmental Policy and Strategy, and its Strategic Action Plan 2013-2018, will draw
on specific achievements under Component 2 of PACAP.

2.2.4 Inter-institutional coordination and communication issues, and bureaucracy, periodically
hampered efficient dialogue and decision-making. Internal communications were difficult and MARN


7
   The Grant Agreement placed MARN as GOES’s representative but contemplated the participation of other institutions, most
importantly CNR but also ISTA (Salvadoran Institute for Agrarian Transformation). Once LAP II was cancelled, both institutions
viewed PACAP as “just another client?, as noted in the Client’s Completion Report.
8
   CNR was intended inter alia, to train MARN/PCU in technical aspects of the cadaster, delimitation and demarcation. Once
CNR was out of the picture, there was no institutional support for these functions
9
   MARN, not CNR, had the mandate to resolve conflicts within state lands. Without MARN’s involvement, key parts of the
country would remain with unresolved tenure status.
10
    See letter to Recipient of April 10, 2007. LAP II was the additional financing to ensure full implementation of the Project,
especially Component 2. Its cancellation saw the Bank ask GOES to allocate some US$2.63 million to ensure implementation.

                                                               7
senior authorities’ efforts to introduce a more effective use of human and financial resources encountered
resistance and resulted in personnel turnover. Decision-making tended to be centralized and bureaucratic
which impacted negatively on procurement and contract management; as noted elsewhere, the Project was
heavily dependent on consultant services. The MTR mission observed communication problems both
within the PCU and between MARN and the PCU. MARN personnel were urged to become more
involved, creating the institutional ownership essential to strengthening the NPAS over time, and to open
up communication on specific, project-related issues both with the Bank and the PCU.

2.2.5 Related to the above, frequent turnover in MARN and PCU personnel affected the Project
trajectory but the restructuring of MARN improved PACAP’s institutional capital. The Project was
prepared and executed under two different Governments, and had four Coordinators from preparation
through closing. Similar changes occurred in the Regional Units. Of the eight professional positions
comprising the PCU, only two were occupied by the same person for more than one year. Some specialist
positions remained vacant for several months. High turnover of key staff in 2011-2012 associated with the
looming closure of the Project disrupted project execution. MARN’s restructuring improved PACAP’s
institutional standing as well as internal coordination and synergy in the last phase of the Project.

2.2.6 Consolidation of the Bahia de Jiquilisco pilot PA - a larger and more complex area than San
Diego and San Felipe-La Barra - was hampered by delayed delimitation. Due to the socio-economic
conditions of many residents of the pilot PAs, their dependence on park resources and uncertainty about
project intentions, project delimitation and demarcation efforts and work plans required re-programming
to intensify consultation and negotiation with affected communities and private sector groups, to avoid
social conflicts and/or preempt their spread. Delimitation was also delayed by major tropical storm
systems (Ida, Agatha and 12E) which hit coastal areas including Bahia de Jiquilisco, halting field work.
Some inputs from MARN to the firm doing the field work were of poor quality, requiring additional
effort to enable use. The firm also lacked resources to pay for sufficient field workers due to MARN’s
dependence on CNR for review and approval, which was not the latter’s priority. To resolve this difficult
impasse, MARN and the firm signed a contractual addendum providing for a 70% payment for products
received/approved by the PCU, with the 30% balance dependent on CNR approval.

2.2.7 Other issues affecting PACAP’s execution: Other factors, bureaucratic and to some extent
political, affected project execution. These included: (i) the initial 18-month delay in declaring
effectiveness and slow launching period affected hiring of all key personnel at headquarters and in the
regional offices; (ii) transition to a new Government in 2009 slowed implementation of project-related
activities in MARN to permit the customary review/adjustments of policy priorities by the incoming
government; and (iii) GOES was slow to allocate funds for the field work, the Project’s core activity, and
availability of counterpart funding was delayed.

2.2.8 Mid-term Review (MTR): Principal conclusions of the MTR conducted in April 2010 were the
following: (i) implementation status was rated Unsatisfactory due to exceptionally slow execution and
disbursement, but its objectives were considered still valid and achievable with an extension and action
plan; (ii) MARN’s efforts to have GOES reassign some US$1.7 million to finance urgent technical
services had not progressed; (iii) visible activities in the countryside were needed to retain the
commitment of local participatory organizations who were growing skeptical of the Project, with the risk
of eroding MARN’s credibility and ability to conduct further interventions; (iv) many inefficiencies were
noted in the administration of contracts which also affected the achievement of project objectives; (v)
poor communication between the Project and MARN was noted and the Bank urged improvement to
avoid duplication of activities and greater synergy between existing initiatives. The MTR missed the
opportunity to restructure some of the more complex, long-term objectives and indicators of the Project –
achievable with the support of LAP II – resizing them to the scope of the GEF.

                                                    8
2.2.9 The resulting MTR Action Plan focused on resolving contracting issues upon which many project
activities depended, including: hiring permanent FM and Procurement specialists; completing the
Prioritization Study; securing an agreement between CNR and MARN, and MARN with ISTA;
contracting cadaster, delimitation and demarcation field work; developing and launching the publicity
campaign; hiring mapping, local development, land tenancy and legal specialists; and, resolving
counterpart funding delays hampering critical field work. With few exceptions, PCU/MARN’s
compliance with the Action Plan was good when verified by the Bank six months later, demonstrating
considerable institutional growth.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

2.3.1 M&E design: M&E was critical to a pilot project which used adaptive management and needed
a flow of results to improve design during implementation. Project M&E was dependent on the newly-
designed automated LAP II system which was to track expenditures and progress for both administrative
and technical functions. The PACAP M&E system was to be strengthened based on the LAP II model and
would have a subsystem generating indicators for physical execution, components, and outcomes of the
GEO. A baseline would be established, updated at mid-term and year 5. A Mid-term Review study was
required. Data sources for intermediate outcome indicators would be MARN and CNR, field reports by
contractors, CNR’s Registry and Cadaster Information System, and results from participatory field
monitoring. The PCU would have overall responsibility for this system.

2.3.2 Implementation and utilization: With CNR out, MARN had to build its M&E capacity
independently, and successfully did so. Basic monitoring was conducted through regular meetings with
PACAP’s Regional Offices in the two pilot PAs and field verification. The Project MIS, managed by a
designated unit within MARN, collected, compiled and updated key project databases, presenting each
Bank supervision mission with fully-updated Key Performance and Intermediate Outcome Indicators, an
excellent performance. This data was used for training, publicity and dissemination, consultation, and
analysis, and permitted MARN/PCU to maintain close control over activities and progress. The large
number of local and regional workshops convened by MARN/PCU provided an effective forum for
dissemination of project experiences and emerging results. However, the M&E experience needed to be
institutionalized in MARN to inculcate results-based planning post-PACAP. (See Annex 2).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

2.4.1 Safeguards: The Project was a Category B with an Environmental Assessment (but not a full
Environmental Impact Assessment), and triggered OP 4.01 (Environmental Assessment), OP 4.04
(Natural Habitats), OP 4.11 (Cultural Property), OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement), and OP 4036
(Forests). The Project EA built on that developed for LAP II, conducted by recognized experts in 2004.
Even though no involuntary resettlement was likely to occur under the Project, it was possible that some
people living in or adjacent to the project pilot areas might encounter restrictions on access to natural
resources. Before effectiveness, MARN signed a letter committing to not carry out involuntary
resettlement, and the amended Grant Agreement later included a provision (section 3.01 (f)) in this regard.
Also, a Process Framework was developed to assist beneficiaries during the formulation and
implementation of their Management Plans.

Results:

Environmental (OP4.01): Environmental evaluations were conducted in all pilot areas before project
launching, resulting in a baseline from which to measure environmental indicators. Indicators/targets
were exceeded in both pilot sites (Section 3.2 and Annex 2).

                                                    9
Natural Habitats (OP 4.04): The Project effectively protected eco-systems in both pilot areas: (i) In the
Guija Complex, the tropical dry forest - a threatened eco-system in the Americas - was protected and
extended; (ii) humid and aquatic forests in the Bahia de Jiquilisco pilot area were also protected, ensuring
their capacity to provide eco-systemic services including: refuge for commercially valuable marine
species (fish, shellfish and crustaceans); protection of the only breeding site in Central America of
Rynchops niger; and protection of marine grazing/breeding grounds in Bahia de Jiquilisco, e.g., the Carey
Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricate).

Cultural Property (OP 4.11): Six recognized pre-Hispanic sites in the Guija Complex dating from 600-
1525 CE were formalized as touristic and educational resources within the Park, potentially benefiting
several local communities with PACAP subprojects.

Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12): Delimitation activities in the pilot areas and mangroves in areas of
PACAP intervention identified human settlements.

Forests (OP 4.36): The proposed PA National Management Strategy and Management Plans for
Protected Areas prepared by PACAP for MARN were developed within the framework of the National
Environmental Policy and congruent with MARN’s Program for Ecological Restoration of Eco-systems
and Landscapes. The draft Management Plan for Bahia de Jiquilisco was also developed based on
MARN’s proposed Coastal Marine Development Policy.

Fiduciary performance:

2.4.2 Financial management (FM): The Project received regular FM supervision. Initial supervision
in 2008 revealed recordkeeping and reporting issues supporting a rating of Moderately Satisfactory (MS),
subsequently upgraded to Satisfactory in 2009 but downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory in 2010
mainly due to a prolonged vacancy in the Financial Specialist position and resulting lack of updated
financial records. The FM rating was upgraded in April 2012 from MU to MS primarily due to the
contracting of the specialist, enabling preparation of the required financial reports to a higher standard,
although minor shortcomings in FM arrangements remained.

2.4.3 Audit: Audits were generally Unqualified or Qualified Exception with no serious accountability
issues, but sometimes delivered beyond the due date as a result of slow contracting of auditors.

2.4.4 Procurement: Procurement post-reviews (PPR) through 2010 found multiple issues affecting
procurement performance - mostly internal - despite having organized seminars and workshops on Bank
procedures. There was persistent confusion about the Bank’s no objection procedures, delays in analyzing
technical proposals, and in evaluating, negotiating and executing contracts especially for consultants.
Procurement in this period was rated High Risk/Moderately Unsatisfactory (MU) with the Bank
expressing concerns about lack of governance. Procurement was affected by the overlapping
requirements of Bank procurement rules and those of the Client’s Public Administration Acquisition and
Contracting Law (LACAP) causing bureaucratic delays. As acknowledged by the PACAP team, these
were avoidable as LACAP itself states that excluded from the Law are acquisitions and contracts financed
by resources provided under agreements signed by the State with other states or international
organizations which have established procurement processes to be followed in their execution.
Performance improved over time. The PPR in 2011 found no issues in processes reviewed, while a
Procurement Capacity Assessment found that the PCU/MARN was capable of implementing the Project
using an interim, MARN-financed procurement specialist but kept the MU rating until the permanent
specialist was actually hired. A PPR in April 2012 found no issues in processes reviewed, upgrading the
rating to Moderately Satisfactory.

                                                    10
2.4.5    Two issues created tension between the Bank and MARN: (i) as noted in the Client’s Completion
Report, the Bank’s no objection to extension of the closing date was delayed until some 10 days prior to
scheduled closing, which obligated MARN to cancel a series of advanced procurement processes due to
uncertainty that the Project would continue. Reinstating suspended procurement processes in the
remaining period was complicated, exacerbated by the length of the closing date extension which MARN
believes curbed PACAP’s ability to complete key activities and fully-disburse the Grant right when its
implementation capacity had strengthened; and (ii) critical field work in the pilot PAs was delayed due to
the contracted firm’s inability to pay for sufficient workers (see 2.2.6). Also, the firm selected to do the
work was paid 100% with counterpart funds and hence used national procurement rules, processes over
which the Bank had no control. The remaining tasks then spilled over into 2012 while the national budget
did not. This situation was resolved by using other, unused project funds.

2.4.6 Projects costs and financing: Total project costs were lower than expected at appraisal for the
GEF portion even without LAP II. Total cost was US$4.92 million compared to an estimated US$5.00
comprising GEF Grant funding of US$3.96 million and Client contribution of just over US$954,000,
about 28% of what was expected at appraisal under the blended operation with LAP II, and 36.3% of the
counterpart amount agreed with GOES following LAP II cancellation. Lower costs were due to: (i) over-
estimation of areas to be covered by field regularization activities; (ii) the non-completion of certain
activities. Subcomponents 1.2 (legal and institutional framework) and 1.3 (public dissemination and
awareness campaign) were a fraction of anticipated (11.3% and 8% respectively) due to non-performance;
and (iii) time ran out and the Bank did not approve a second extension of the closing date to complete
activities. Component 2 costs were about 17% higher, and administrative costs were 28% lower than
expected. At the time of ICR finalization, an amount of US$15,807.79 was pending refund to the Bank.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

2.5.1 Transition arrangements including O&M: While the Bank team discussed post-project
arrangements with MARN in broad terms, no formal transition plan was agreed. Communities/entities
with subprojects were advised about the importance of maintaining the equipment and practices
transferred, and received specific training on O&M. In the case of fishing-related subprojects, markedly
better fish yields and incomes from improved practices will likely promote good O&M and sustainability.

2.5.2 Sustaining reforms and institutional capacity: The sustainability of reforms depends heavily
on basic factors such as commitment, capacity and recurrent budget. The NPAS is partially consolidated
with much work still to be done. MARN has the capacity and tools (e.g., Strategy, Action Plan,
Prioritization Study, delimitation and demarcation models, databases, Park Ranger system) needed to
complete consolidation and improve management, but will need to foster close collaboration with CNR
and other relevant institutions to establish the legal framework and related aspects, and strive for greater
operational efficiency. The MARN/CNR Technical Roundtable and the MARN/ISTA high level forum
established before closing are promising developments. As noted earlier, MARN needs to build
partnerships with other relevant Ministries including Agriculture, Tourism and Fisheries. At the local
level, the COALs and ADESCOs, along with a wide range of civil society entities, have greater
awareness of the NPAS’ objectives; initial evidence suggests that local buy-in was significant but its
durability may be fragile. Nationally, evidence suggests GOES has not promoted conservation-oriented
land use outside legal PAs.

2.5.3 Next phase: Based on Government’s priorities, and as established in the Country Partnership
Strategy 2010-2014 (CPS), the Bank does not envisage any follow-on operation, at least for the remaining




                                                    11
period of the CPS.11 The CPS Progress Report notes however, that El Salvador is increasingly embracing
the global climate change agenda both on mitigation and adaptation. El Salvador is participating in
activities led by the Bank’s Forest Carbon Partnership Fund, helping to develop a vision for managing
and monitoring its forest resources and to prepare for forest carbon transactions, to which the PACAP
achievements have direct relevance. MARN’s plan is to move ahead in 2013 to begin restoration of about
1.0 million ha of natural areas, find financing for a planned project under the REDD agenda (Reducing
Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries), and the Program to Restore Eco-systems and
Landscapes in the Bahia de Jiquilisco.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: High overall relevance

3.1.1 PACAP’s objectives remain highly relevant to El Salvador and to the conservation of globally
significant bio-diversity and eco-systems. Its design remains appropriate to achieving those priorities but
the original, blended approach and design were more optimal and likely to enhance the depth and
sustainability of project achievements. Project objectives are not reflected in the current CPS for the
reasons cited in 2.5.3, but this does not reduce their urgency or the need to ensure that NPAS
consolidation activities are completed and institutionalized.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

3.2.1 Achievement of the GEO was partial and is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory overall, although
this does not diminish the Project’s many important achievements which the ICR believes position the
MU rating at the borderline of Moderately Satisfactory. Lack of commitment to the Project’s legal goals
and other factors undermining sustainability are the basis for the conservative rating.

3.2.2    Indicator 1: Natural protected areas system strategy improved and pilot-tested: 12

Partially achieved: The following were achieved: (i) an updated Strategy and its Action Plan were
finalized using project-tested and generated inputs and experience including the project-financed
Protected Areas Rationalization and Prioritization Study (WICE, 2011), the Management Plans (including
24 alternative livelihood demonstration subprojects in the pilot PAs), and broad-based stakeholder
dialogue; (ii) the draft Strategy was consulted within MARN and with co-management organizations and
other local stakeholders but not (by closing) at the inter-institutional level or with national stakeholders;
(iii) the evolving consolidation strategy was pilot tested in San Diego-Las Barras and Bahia de Jiquilisco,
with the exception of the regularization of PA residents, with notable achievements in each case; (iv) 68
terrestrial areas and one marine area were delimited (173%) and transferred to MARN as protected areas;
(v) preliminary draft regulations for the new Protected Areas Law were updated based on project
findings/results and were under review by MARN but not yet approved. Products generated by the project
are informing the development of additional, broader policy instruments, e.g., the updated NPAS strategy
is supporting development of the National Biodiversity Strategy and the National Environmental Strategy
and related Action Plans, to be finalized in 2013; (vi) based on the draft NPAS Strategy, MARN assessed
the inter-institutional agreements needed to operate the NPAS under MARN’s Ecosystem and Landscape

12
    The PAD Main Text shows the indicator as above, while the Results Framework omits the pilot-testing element. See also
footnote 1 regarding use of “natural? vs. “national?.

                                                          12
Restoration Program but did not reach the stage of preparing draft agreements; (vii) the
publicity/information campaign was finally launched in August 2012. Up till then, the Project conducted
local mobilization and training events, and educational field days, to promote conservation themes and
stakeholder cooperation. Stakeholder acceptance of a conservation role in the parks was a major project
achievement.

3.2.3 Prioritization study: The Rationalization and Prioritization Study for the NPAS includes
analysis of conservation- and biodiversity-friendly sustainable activities, as well as modeling the
comparative social and ecological “weight? of conservation areas to help MARN estimate recurrent and
investment costs of existing PAs and of bringing additional lands in.13 The study team also performed a
series of rapid ecological evaluations (REE) to identify conservation gaps. The technique is used to get an
overall view of the biodiversity in a specific location, but can only detect species which are conspicuous
and generally focuses on detecting vertebrates. Species by nature rare, threatened or not visible have low
probability of detection using this method. To boost the potential of the methodology, the WICE team
conducted REEs in the seven least-studied conservation areas, detecting inter alia, two species of bats not
previously reported in El Salvador (Peroteryx kappleri, Diclyduras albus) and two species of frogs not
reported in the last 40 years (Hyalinobatrachium fleishmanni, Incilius ibarrai). Despite the high degree of
fragmentation of ecosystems in El Salvador, these results confirmed the existence of globally important
biodiversity validating conservation efforts.

3.2.4 Indicator 2: Two pilot protected areas consolidated and effectively-managed (Tracking Tool
score of at least 40 for 35,600 ha in Bahia de Jiquilisco and, 1,917 ha in Lago Guija Complex San Diego-
Las Barras).

Partially achieved: Tracking Tool scores reached and surpassed revised targets established by the MTR
reflecting effective management of the two areas (see Annex 2). For purposes of this Project, however,
protected area consolidation encompassed a broader set of activities and requirements than those covered
by the Tracking Tool, reflecting the innovative nature of the operation. Specifically, consolidation under
the Project included not only the delimitation and physical demarcation of the pilot areas, the
development and implementation of participatory management plans, and co-management, but also the
regularization of eligible residents through the granting of authorizations for their land use and the
issuance of appropriate legal instruments to recognize and allow their presence in the pilot PAs. The
Project achieved most of these targets with the exception of: (i) the demarcation of the Bahia de Jiquilisco
pilot area (the more critical delimitation was completed); and (ii) regularization of eligible residents.
Options for regularization were developed but the draft Regulations to the Protected Areas Law, which
incorporate the options, were still under review by MARN at closing.

3.2.5 Additional information: In addition to the gains described above, the Project contributed to the
consolidation and effective management of the pilot PAs through the following: (i) development and
pilot-testing of elements of the evolving NPAS Strategy to consolidate two pilot PAs with the longer-term
goal of applying that Strategy nationwide; (ii) collection of complete socio-economic census data and
environmental information for both areas; (iii) completion of aerial photography and mapping of
boundaries for both areas; (iv) delimitation and demarcation of the Guija Complex, and delimitation of
Bahia de Jiquilisco; options were presented for inscribing mangroves in the CNR registry; (v) a PA
Registry was created in MARN (not yet linked to the CNR Registry); (vi) effective conflict resolution
using the Project methodology/framework: 95% of the San Diego-Las Barras pilot area was without land
tenure conflict by end-Project. Of the four municipalities delimited in Bahia de Jiquilisco (about 50% of

Machado, Linares, Cisneros/WICE, San Salvador, 2011.

                                                            13
the total pilot area), 99.7% had no land tenure conflicts by end-Project; and (vii) five areas in San Diego-
Las Barras and four areas in Bahia de Jiquilisco totaling 3,815 ha were legally established as PAs through
Ministerial resolutions. 14 By end-Project, 29 Park Rangers hired by MARN were operating from the two
regional offices, one per pilot area, but recurrent budget is uncertain and these numbers will probably be
reduced. 15

3.2.6 Revenue generation: Economic and financial aspects of the Project proved a tough challenge for
the PCU/MARN. The Results Framework called for an estimate of “the amount of revenues raised from
sustainable natural resource concessions, visitor fees, and other potential cost recovery mechanisms?.
This indicator was unrealistic, lagged throughout and was not achieved. A mechanism for full cost
recovery was not established, nor was a systematic process for raising revenues in the PAs (admission
fees are administered directly by the Ministry of Finance). Immense efforts are still needed to position
the PAs for any organized revenue-generating activities. No determination has even been made about
where it makes sense to allocate resources, but the important Prioritization Study does set parameters and
priorities which will help Government to do this. The planned funding and concession study was not
conducted. The Project did strengthen MARN’s institutional capacity for planning the long-term human
and financial expenditures needed to sustain the system, and for evaluating alternative financing sources.

3.2.7 Local participation: The strengthening and monitoring of the Local Support Committees
(COALs) in municipal forested areas promoted a sense of ownership among local people in the
management and use of resources because their involvement was needed inter alia, to help identify,
manage and resolve tenure conflicts. Citizen participation in project execution also proved important in
channeling reports/complaints of unauthorized activities: deforestation, construction, and timber
extraction from mangrove and other forests. It also created an organizational platform for citizen
management and coordination and, as it turned out, social capital formation, an important project
achievement and sustainability factor. 16

3.2.8 Subprojects: The Project grant-financed 24 alternative livelihood, productive subprojects in
Bahia de Jiquilisco and San Diego-Las Barras supporting solidarity groups, NGOs, ADESCOs and
fishing cooperatives with financing totaling about US$240,100, or an average US$10,000 per subproject.
Restrictions on natural resource use contemplated in the Management Plans had the potential to deepen
the poverty of park residents who depended on the forests and fishing grounds for subsistence. The
solution was to include such populations as active agents in the protection and conservation of the pilot
areas, using subprojects as an incentive. Some 45 proposals were received and 24 financed (eight in San
Diego-Las Barras and 16 in Bahia de Jiquilisco). Investments were small and unlikely to generate
significant income in most cases; their value lay more in demonstrating conservation-friendly ways of
performing familiar activities. An exception was artisanal fishing activities using improved practices in
Bahia de Jiquilisco where fish yields increased by up to 275%, with similar increases in incomes. Other
interesting examples included specialized help to local residents to restore the aquatic eco-system in the
Matapan Lagoon, clogged with excessive growth of water lilies, using the lilies as material for crafts and
fertilizer. Participating groups/organizations reported that these experiences were formative and that




14
   Mangrove areas are protected through the PA Law and form part of the NPAS. MARN is considering having mangroves
registered in the name of the State through an appropriate legal mechanism developed by the project.
15
   Park rangers were paid by the Project in both pilot areas. The Bank team stressed the importance of MARN assuming the cost
of contracting the guards and absorbing them into its permanent staff. Government had promised to finance the costs of PA
protection.
16
    Social capital formation was not formally measured but extrapolations can be made based on beneficiary responses to wide-
ranging questions, behavioral changes, and observed multiplier effects.

                                                            14
executing their subprojects had strengthened organizations especially their capacity to manage/administer
resources, had generated income, and built environmental awareness. See also Annexes 2 and 5. 17

3.2.9     Indicator 3: Biodiversity benefits established in at least 12,400 ha.

Fully-achieved: The minimum acceptable rates of deforestation over 5 years in Guija Complex and Bahia
de Jiquilisco (1,400 ha and 11,000 ha respectively) were exceeded with forest cover
increasing/regenerating in both target areas. Biodiversity benefits stemmed from the aggregate effects of
educational events, training, community mobilization within the parks, participatory field days, and
investment incentives to avoid deforestation and destruction of biodiversity in the most important “core?
zones. 18 The indicator was measured at end-project using ortho-photos of pilot areas taken in 2009,
RapidEye satellite images of the entire national territory in 2011, and the experience gleaned from
multiple physical verification events in the countryside throughout the project period. Results were:

     x    Bahia de Jiquilisco: Analysis shows 18,423.89 ha of salt forest cover in good or very good
          condition, while the 11,000 ha estimated in 2005 were found to still be in equally good condition.
          Deforestation had been kept to zero in critical conservation sites with an additional 7,423.89 ha of
          coverage over the baseline in good or very good condition, a recovery of 67.5%.
     x    Lago Guija Complex San Diego-Las Barras: The 1400 ha baseline of dry tropical forest and
          associated aquatic forest was taken from the 1,387 ha estimated in 2005. Analytical comparison
          using satellite images revealed 1,603.8 ha of tropical forest, corroborated by field verification,
          representing a recovery of 216.25 ha or 15.56%.

3.3 Efficiency

3.3.1 Ex-post economic analysis. The ICR economic analysis updated the quantitative valuation of
some of the benefits in the without and with-project scenarios where current data were available and
reasonable assumptions could be made. Quantified benefits included (i) carbon sequestration and (ii)
fisheries. The period of analysis was 2005-2024 and the discount rate 12%. For the rest, a qualitative
discussion was provided. A key finding affecting the analysis related to the deforestation rate in the pilot
areas. Based on information obtained from World Bank and FAO assessments, the pilot areas'
deforestation rates in the without-project scenario were significantly reduced. This had a strong effect on
the estimated incremental carbon sequestration and fishery benefits.

3.3.2 The analysis shows that avoided loss of the pilot protected areas’ carbon sequestration capacity is
the largest benefit accruing due to the Project, even taking into account the much more modest
deforestation in the without-project scenario than assumed in the PAD. It is estimated at $4.78 million -
$25.92 million. (The lower figure reflects the voluntary carbon market value, $4.50/ton of the avoided
carbon sequestration loss; the higher value reflects the social value of carbon sequestration, $20/ton in
1995 terms.) Fisheries benefits are also significant and result from lower deforestation, which reduces
sedimentation of the lakes in San Diego-Las Barras and more sustainable fishing practices that are
believed to be achieved through extensive public awareness-raising in the project area and specific
investment subprojects. Fuel wood benefits could not be estimated due to data unavailability. The sum of

Concepcion, Ejecucion y Evaluacion de os Subproyectos? (MARN/PCU, 2012), with summary of beneficiary attitudes and
satisfaction levels in Annex 5.
18
    A recent Bank study on El Salvador describes a dramatic reduction in deforestation nationwide in the period from 2005 to
2012, raising the question of attribution. While this is not intended to diminish project achievements in the pilot PAs, it suggests a
broader trend was afoot (but the Ministry of Agriculture and MARN were unable to point to any single policy or program to
explain this phenomenon). See: Country Land Assessment: El Salvador, World Bank 2012 (Draft).

                                                                 15
the carbon sequestration and fishery benefits exceeds GEF and GOES project expenditures at a net
present value ranging between US$3.64 million and US$25.56 million.

3.3.3 Financial analysis. An analysis of the post-project financial situation of the Natural Protected
Areas System (NPAS) shows that annual variable costs, estimated at US$7.4 million significantly exceed
revenues, which are slightly above US$2.0 million. MARN relies on budget allocations to cover these
costs, while revenues from park user fees, licenses and concessions are being derived from three parks
only and amount to some $54,000 annually only. No such revenues are being collected in the two project
beneficiary parks. In conclusion, at this time the financial sustainability of the NPAS has not been
established.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

3.4.1 The justification of overall outcome rating is as follows: (i) Relevance: Project objectives, design
and technical approach were and remain directly relevant to the consolidation and sustainability of El
Salvador’s NPAS. However, project design was complex and highly innovative in the El Salvadoran
context and exceeded MARN’s capacity to execute it in full and alone without the support of the LAP II
operation and CNR; (ii) Achievement of GEO: The project partially achieved its GEO. While the Project
had many successes under Component 2, it was unable to translate these outcomes/tools into the
important legal, policy and land regularization elements/objectives of Component 1 which was only
partially executed. The critical issues are thus sustainability and government ownership of and
commitment to the envisaged legal framework. This does not detract from the ongoing dialogue between
the Bank and GOES on the Forest Partnership, and on advancing the REDD agenda in which a key
counterpart is MARN; (iii) Efficiency: In regard to project efficiency, the economic analysis summarized
in 3.3 and Annex 3 shows carbon sequestration and fishery benefits exceeding GEF and GOES project
expenditures. In regard to financial benefits, annual variable costs significantly exceed revenues within
the NPAS and thus the latter’s financial sustainability has not yet been established.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

3.5.1 PACAP had no explicit poverty objectives but the testing of small subprojects in the Guija
Complex and Bahia de Jiquilisco showed that poor families/communities residing within and around the
PAs, with evolving awareness of the goals and rationale for conservation, could become an organized
force in improving natural resources management and promoting conservation and biodiversity with the
prospect in some cases of income generation, albeit modest. Further, the participatory COALs (Local
support Committees) and ADESCOs (Community Development Associations) were able to convene local
stakeholders around conservationist themes. Local people were increasingly willing to denounce
unauthorized settlement or deforestation activity and to participate in environmental educational events
and field days. In aggregate, a marked increase in social capital was demonstrated (see 3.5.4).

3.5.2 Gender was not a project focus but participatory evaluation of the subproject investment
experience shows positive results. About 42% of female beneficiaries had participated in administrative
decision-making about their subproject and a similar percentage had participated in its planning and
execution. Even so, researchers urged greater effort in future to plan specific formative activities and
awareness-building on the theme of gender. It is not known how many subprojects were female proposed
and led.




                                                   16
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

 3.5.3 Institutional growth was evident in the evolving capacity of MARN and the PCU to implement
complex activities with greater agility and technical skill over time. This was evident in the final year and
particularly for MARN through its first experience working directly with park residents through the
subprojects. Establishing the MARN/CNR Technical Roundtable was also a sign of institutional
maturation. This said, the constant problems of inter-institutional coordination and internal dysfunction
associated with unusually high turnover of senior personnel and key technical/other staff, bureaucracy and
persistent issues affecting contracting and related functions combined with the complexity of the Project
itself, reduced the potential for further institutional growth.

3.5.4 At the local level, improved organization motivated by a sense of empowerment and genuine
appropriation of the project’s conservation goals boosted the status and legitimacy of the COALs,
ADESCOs, participating cooperatives and NGOs. Institutional growth was also demonstrated by the
following: increased capacity of groups/entities benefiting from subprojects to manage and administer
funds; already demonstrated efforts to seek legalization as cooperatives and to form strategic alliances
with the municipalities and other local organizations for commercial, conservation and social purposes;
expressed awareness of the importance of maintaining their investments; and new-found readiness to
approach local authorities about observed environmental infractions and community needs.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

3.5.5 The extent of the social capital gains suggested by responses in evaluative workshops designed to
capture beneficiaries’ views was positive and unexpected although the ICR acknowledges that such
impressions are not hard evidence of social capital formation and the durability of these gains is uncertain.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

3.6.1 Beneficiary workshops: A series of workshops using a structured format to gauge beneficiary
organizations’ attitudes evaluated the 24 alternative production investments. While the evaluation
separates the responses by area, the main results are similar for both and the findings below are a
synthesis (see also Annex 5): (i) 100% of participants from both pilot areas agreed that quality of life had
improved as a result of their subproject and all said their subproject had helped conserve and protect
natural resources; (ii) all reported having implemented various activities to restore eco-systems:
reforestation, artificial reefs (arrecifes); and improved drainage in mangrove areas; (iii) improved fishing
practices paid off: in all cases fish yields increased, ranging from 33% to 275%, and incomes increased
within this same range; (iv) about 42% of women said they had participated in decision-making on
administrative processes, subproject planning and execution; (v) most beneficiaries believed subproject
execution had strengthened their community/local organization, capacity to administer financial resources,
generate income and understand natural resources conservation and biodiversity; (vi) most organizations
felt that institutional strengthening and knowledge acquired from numerous training sessions were the two
most valuable benefits; and (vii) among the environmental benefits: increased production of fish from
eco-friendly methods, utilization of native species in reforestation, and reduced environmental
contamination.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial

4.1.1 The project fell short of establishing the required legal and institutional frameworks, putting the
long-term sustainability of project achievements at risk. However, these risks are reduced to varying

                                                     17
degrees by PACAP’s infrastructure and capacity-building investments which resulted in: (i) increased
awareness and participation of local stakeholders (in particular, residents of the two pilot PAs) in
environmental management; (ii) use for decision-making of the environmental and geographical
information and data collected by MARN, CNR and others; (iii) collection and organization of land
tenure conflict-related information generated by the Project; (iv) actual resolution of conflicts in key cases
through field work, awareness-building and information dissemination/workshops; (v) improved
collaboration between MARN and CNR in later stages of the Project, permitting expedited approval of
PA delimitation plans and their registration in the cadaster/registry system; (vi) substantial completion of
the updated strategy for sustaining the NPAS, and its Action Plan; (vii) implementation of 24 sustainable
livelihood subprojects by communities within the pilot PAs demonstrating the viability of continuing to
live within areas subject to environmental conservation/restriction; and (viii) as noted earlier, products
generated by the Project are informing the development of additional, broader policy instruments, e.g., the
updated NPAS strategy is supporting development of the National Biodiversity Strategy and the National
Environmental Strategy and related Action Plans, to be finalized in 2013.

4.1.2 Regarding financial stability of the NPAS, although a mechanism for full cost recovery was not
put in place (and was not an explicit objective), the project strengthened MARN’s institutional capacity
for planning for the long-term expenditures necessary (human and financial) to sustain the system, and for
evaluating alternative financing sources. Budget resources are a critical uncertainty.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1 Project preparation was handled cost-effectively and took just one year. Project design was
innovative and consistent with the direction of GOES sector policies and institutional framework as well
as the Bank’s CAS, integrated/blended with a complementary operation to leverage technical, political
and strategic support. While the failure of LAP II could not have been predicted, it immediately focused
attention on project complexity, on the unpreparedness of the executing ministry MARN to manage such
a project on its own, and on the lack of a contingency plan to support a standalone project. Restructuring
might have been explored to reduce scope by eliminating certain complex, longer-term objectives, and
rationalizing performance indicators. Even at the Mid-term Review, a more optimal opportunity to
restructure given several years of implementation experience, this was not done. The Results Framework
matched project objectives in scope and difficulty but the design of indicators to capture the full
implications of consolidation and of biodiversity conservation was too limited, while other indicators
reflected unrealistic expectations regarding readiness to launch in the pilot PAs.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.2 Project supervision is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory when looking beyond the strong
performance of the supervision team to overall Bank performance where more could have been done to
support the project in achieving its results. Basic supervision is rated Satisfactory, characterized by
regular, well-documented missions, a focus on fiduciary capacity and performance, and on trying to
promote inter-institutional cooperation and internal communication. Team members consistently worked
with the Client to track/update all project indicators over time. Project design would have leveraged a
normal IDA supervision coefficient but when LAP II was cancelled, the project received only the modest



                                                     18
GEF allocation. The Team raised this as a risk (which it was given the project’s land issues) but PACAP’s
status as a GEF largely precluded additional resources. 19

5.1.3 Balancing these factors: (i) the Bank should have done more to manage the expectations
associated with a smaller, standalone GEF project by restructuring it at Mid-Term to eliminate or re-
dimension complex elements beyond MARN’s capacity. The Bank Team maintains however, that MARN
was capable of asserting control over the innovative activities but lacked the commitment; many of the
responsibilities to move on land regularization inside the PAs were MARN’s irrespective of LAP II: 20 (ii)
with hindsight, Bank management should have been more involved in finding positive approaches to
implementation support; (iii) the Bank’s dialogue with GOES could have been more supportive and
forceful once that dialogue reopened but the Project had lost priority internally; (iv) more positive, less
rigid procurement support should have been provided, thereby possibly avoiding unnecessary delays and
tension. An example was the Bank’s delayed no objection to project extension causing MARN to have to
cancel advanced procurement processes, but it appears this delay was really intended to pressure the
Recipient to finally hire a permanent procurement specialist. Finally, there was a lack of clear
communication regarding a possible further six month extension. Despite positive signals given during a
visit by Bank Executive Directors impressed with the Project, an extension was not granted.

5.1.4 On this last point however, the ICR doubts that the critical legal and regularization activities still
pending would have been completed under an extension because the real problem was commitment, not
time and resources. The Project team maintains that the less than optimal support from the Bank on the
issues mentioned above - especially procurement – did not affect the activities that would have ensured a
better sustainability outcome. The Project team encouraged MARN to make progress on the innovative
land aspects to achieve greater impact but probably should have accepted that MARN/GOES were not
ready and the overall approach should have been more gradual and less ambitious.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.1.3 This rating takes into account a Moderately Satisfactory preparation performance which
acknowledges the strong rationale for blending PACAP with LAP II but suggests, with some ambivalence
given the difficult country context, that the cancellation of the latter might have provoked an immediate
revision of PACAP’s ambitious vision, scope and scale to avoid downstream problems. Supervision
performance involved a more complex series of events where the basic task of team supervision was
handled well but undermined to varying degrees at the overall Bank level by missed opportunities, undue
rigidity, and erosion of internal support.

5.2 Borrower
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.1 As noted earlier, the Project was prepared and executed under two administrations with divergent
visions of national development. Government performed well during preparation and supported the
planned collaboration of PACAP with LAP II. However, LAP II’s cancellation and its implications for
PACAP should have prompted efforts by GOES to persuade CNR (and ISTA) to collaborate with MARN
given the importance of the expected integration effects and the need for MARN to grow institutionally.

imperfect. In addition, the prolonged stand-off on budget for the delimitation and demarcation activities
pushed into 2012 had a negative impact on project execution. Government’s ownership of PACAP was
and remains, weak. Counterpart funding was problematic, mainly due to Government’s delayed allocation
of funds to project activities. The result was a difficult implementation environment with repercussions on
certain project activities, reflected in disbursement of 80% of the Grant.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.2 MARN was instrumental in contributing to the many project achievements. Its main failing was
its centralized, bureaucratic decision-making and processing, and difficulty adjusting to new challenges
affecting the future of the PAs and their effective management. Its relationship with the PCU fluctuated
(the two entities were not synonymous), and internal communication was weak resulting in tension both
horizontally and vertically within the agency over time. Its ownership of the Project’s important legal
reform aspects was weak. 21

5.2.3 The PCU performed well within the constraints affecting inter alia, its leadership and staffing
which suffered repeated turnover. Its institutional capacity had evolved markedly by the final year and
under the leadership of a capable, final Coordinator. The Project was technically and operationally
challenging and heavily dependent on contracted specialists; the PCU lacked any prior experience with
Bank projects and (as with most GEF operations) had to learn on the job. Procurement and contracting
were a constant issue. The PCU merits praise for its comprehensive, well-structured approach to the
community subprojects and for quality M&E products including a strong Completion Report providing a
candid review of factors influencing the project and its outcomes, and an equally good analysis of the
community subprojects including beneficiary opinions on key issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

5.2.4 This rating weighs the Recipient’s achievements despite the challenging circumstances of a
project executed under conditions different to those envisaged at approval, against a mix of technical,
financial, operational and institutional factors which affected implementation progress, and limited the
achievement of specific activities important for the long-term sustainability of the NPAS.

6. Lessons Learned

6.1.1    The following are among the more important project lessons: 22

         This project raised issues concerning blended versus standalone projects and the Bank’s
effectiveness in delivering on the latter. Dependence on another operation for financing and technical
expertise may be risky even when the justification is compelling – as in PACAP’s case - the operation is
Bank-supported and the lead agencies are influential and well-connected. The justification for the
standalone was far weaker and the decision entailed many implementation difficulties. Blended projects
should have mitigation measures – including restructuring if appropriate - should such an operation not
proceed or for some other reason, the linked approach does not function.


21
   The MARN/PCU Team feels that while the initial phase of the Project saw difficulties integrating PACAP into the Ministry
and deciding the structure of the nation’s natural patrimony, the Project was steadily assimilated over the period and project
management stabilized over time, despite intra-institutional tensions.
22
   See Client Completion Report (MARN/PCU 2012) for additional lessons.

                                                             20
         Inter-institutional coordination and open internal communication are essential for
conservation and biodiversity interventions which rely on broad consensus and solidarity to maintain
momentum. While the fallout from electoral turnover is usually beyond a project’s control, the Bank can
play an important supportive role in fostering inter-agency partnerships to expand the network of
stakeholders able to support agencies involved in difficult and controversial operations, and to expand the
institutional partners for the longer-term sustainability of critically important frameworks such as the
NPAS.

        Changes in higher level positions within the project coordination unit must be accompanied by
an intense, accelerated induction process to build understanding concerning the project concept,
methodology, stage of achievement, and difficulties encountered prior to the changeover. This is essential
to generate and strengthen channels of communication among project authorities and related institutions,
and garner commitment.

        Mobilizing citizen participation can have major impacts on the sustainability of otherwise
controversial conservation activities. Local buy-in stemmed from a mix of mobilization efforts around
environmental themes, education and hands-on field training, direct investment incentives and
participatory analysis of project experiences. The pay-off was park communities’ willingness to detect
and report deforestation, clandestine settlements and other damaging activities in the PAs. It also created
an organizational platform for local project management and coordination, for conflict resolution, and for
piloting successful alternative activities. The unexpectedly strong indications of social capital formation
were an important collateral benefit of the Project.

  The draft ICR was sent to the Borrower for comments on November 30, 2012. Following a video-conference (held on
December 12, 2012) between the Bank and Recipient teams to discuss the Bank’s draft ICR, the Bank received a set of informal
written comments from the Recipient team, all of which were incorporated or taken into account during finalization of the ICR.
However, the Recipient did not subsequently send the requested formal letter and thus no additional comments are presented in
Section 7 above or letter entered in Annex 7. The informal comments are filed in the Project archive/WBDOCS.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1     The Project was a grant funded by a full-sized US$5.0 million GEF contribution, partially-
blended with the LAP II Bank Loan (P086953) in an amount of US$5.0 million. Total project cost was
US$13.4 million including Government counterpart of US$3.4 million. The following presents the
outputs from each component/subcomponent and summarizes the context and experiences where relevant.
Annex 1 shows the planned and actual costs of each component/subcomponent.

2.2      Component 1: Strengthening of the NPAS (est. total cost US$5.4 m of which US$1.40 m
GEF) to enable its long-term sustainable management by consolidating the existing strategy for the NPAS
in partnership with all relevant stakeholders and through development of an adequate institutional and
legal framework for the administration and management of the NPAS.

Sub-component 1.1: Consolidation of the NPAS Strategy

   x   Rationalization and Prioritization study of the NPAS was completed;
   x   Products delivered: Work Plan; preliminary criteria for PA prioritization; updated eco-systems
       map; rapid ecological evaluation report; final preliminary criteria report; conservation objects;
       preliminary proposed NPAS models; and proposed strategic lines of action for NPAS
       management.
   x   Update of the NPAS Strategy and its draft Action Plan were completed, and the draft strategy was
       consulted within MARN, but there was insufficient time to hold consultations at the national level
       with institutional stakeholders.
   x   Delimitation of PAs surpassed the Project target (at least 40 PAs and mangroves delimited) – 68
       terrestrial areas and one marine (mangrove) area.
   x   These areas were transferred to MARN and declared as PAs.

Subcomponent 1.2: Strengthening of the Legal and Institutional Framework

   x   Options for regularization of residents of PAs were developed.
   x   The project team updated draft Regulations for the new Protected Areas Law based on project
       results and submitted draft to MARN for review but was unable to get draft Regulations finally
       approved and in effect by closing.
   x   High level forum was established between MARN and ISTA to facilitate the exchange of
       information and expedite the transfer of potential PAs.
   x   MARN-CNR technical round table was established to expedite approval of field work products.
   x   Based on the draft, updated NPAS Strategy, MARN would assess the inter-institutional
       agreements required to operate the NPAS.

Subcomponent 1.3: Public Dissemination and Awareness Campaign

   x   Aide Memoires suggest that the original indicator was considered too difficult to measure and
       was substituted by the call for a communications campaign.
   x   A baseline survey indicated that public knowledge of the NPAS Law was zero.




                                                  24
    x    Communications campaign was launched in August 2012. 26 The contract for its design was
         terminated as the draft product presented by the firm did not correspond to MARN’s vision and
         strategy. A new proposal was prepared before closing and MARN obtained funding for its
         execution. The campaign was too late to benefit the Project but will be an important sustainability
         factor in keeping the project vision and methodology in front of diverse national, regional and
         local stakeholders.

2.3     Component 2: Consolidation and Management of Pilot Protected Areas (est. total cost
US$7.1 m of which GEF US$2.9 m) financed the development, testing and finalization of a methodology
to consolidate two pilot Protected Areas including their delimitation, demarcation and regularization, and
to develop and implement management plans for their sustainable use. The results of this component
were expected to feed into the consolidation of the NPAS Strategy (Component 1).

Sub-component 2.1: Characterization and Delimitation of Pilot PAs

    x    Socio-economic and environmental diagnoses/census were completed for both pilot PAs (San
         Diego and San Felipe La Barra, and Bahia de Jiquilisco).
    x    Mapping of official boundaries was completed for both pilot areas.
    x    The cadaster and registry were completed for one pilot area (San Diego and San Felipe La Barra).
    x    MARN also created a Protected Areas Registry which by closing had not yet been linked to the
         CNR database.
    x    Delimitation and physical demarcation of one pilot area (San Diego-Las Barras) completed;
         115.72 km were demarcated (100%), equivalent to an area of 18.7 km2.
    x    Delimitation of second area (Bahia de Jiquilisco) was completed but physical demarcation had
         not occurred (delimitation is far more important).

2.4      Pilot-testing supporting an updated NPAS Strategy: The Project developed and pilot-tested
elements of the evolving NPAS Strategy to consolidate two pilot PAs with the longer-term goal of
applying that Strategy nationwide. The results of and lessons learned from pilot testing were used to
further inform/enhance the Strategy (see Component 1 above) under a process of feedback. The updated
Strategy thus included elements related to Project activities on the technical side (e.g., data collection,
management plans, alternative sustainable livelihoods), and institutional side (e.g., more broad-based
stakeholder dialogue, agreements for effective implementation of the Strategy). In addition, the Project
helped to start analyzing the human and financial resources which would be needed to implement the
Strategy and its associated Action Plan.

Subcomponent 2.2: Legalization and Regularization of Pilot PAs

    x    Options for the regularization of PA residents were developed and reviewed by MARN but had
         not been adopted by closing (which was to occur through approval of the Regulations of the new
         PA Law).
    x    Five areas (pilot area of San Diego La Barra, and four areas of Bahia de Jiquilisco (Chaguantique,
         Nancuchiname, Isla San Sebastian, and Hacienda Caballito – 3,815 ha) were legally established




26
   This output would be expected to support the goal of “at least 10% of the national population is aware of the new Protected
Areas Law and regulations?.


                                                             25
         by Ministerial Resolution as PAs, corresponding to 79% of the total area to be declared as PA; the
         only remaining area to be declared was Normandia.
     x   Mangrove areas are protected through the PAs Law (art. 9) and form part of the NPAS, and as
         such do not require a separate decree for their legal protection. However, MARN is considering
         having mangroves registered in the name of the State to enhance legal protection, through an
         appropriate legal mechanism developed by the project.
     x   Tracking Tool scores demonstrating improved consolidation and management of the two pilot
         PAs met or exceeded all targets (as adjusted by Mid-term Review), as shown below:

    The Tracking Tool applied in 2012 contained a higher number of indicators than the version applied in 2005 and 2010 and
thus comparisons might be affected by the different methodologies, explaining the apparent reduction of the points assigned to BJ
(a) and the lower points for GC (b).

Subcomponent 2.3: Management Plans for Pilot PAs.

    x      The number of protected area field staff in each pilot PA by closing was as follows: 5 park
           rangers in San Diego La Barra and 24 in Bahia de Jiquilisco, hired by MARN; and,
    x      Fully-staffed regional project offices were established in each pilot area.
    x      No progress was made on establishing cost recovery mechanisms or raising revenues from the
           parks. This goal was overly ambitious for a nascent NPAS still under construction and certainly
           for the pilot areas.
    x      Implementation of existing Management Plans resulted in 24 community subprojects (see 2.4).

Community Subprojects:

2.5      The Project grant-financed 25 alternative livelihood, productive subprojects in Bahia de Jiquilisco
and the Guija Complex, supporting solidarity groups, NGOs, ADESCOs and fishing cooperatives with
financing totaling about US$240,100, or an average US$9,600 per subproject. Subprojects were grounded
in a Social Assessment which identified the demographic and socio-economic characteristics, forms of
organization and social participation, and possible risks of conflict from project operations - especially
from land legalization activities – in the two project areas. Restrictions on natural resource use
contemplated in the Management Plans had the potential to deepen the poverty of park residents who
depended on the forests and fishing grounds for sustenance. The solution was to include such populations
as active agents in the protection and conservation of the pilot areas, using subprojects as an incentive.

2.6      Methodology: Park communities were consulted on suitable types of investments and a
minimum structure for their proposal and execution which included a 15% beneficiary contribution in
cash or kind. Subprojects financed were consistent with local Management Plans. Strategic areas of
support were biodiversity, low impact tourism, aquaculture and agro-forestry activities. Subprojects were
expected to also capture three cross-cutting themes: territorial governance through participation and social
capital formation; human development focusing on gender; and environmental education to change
attitudes and practices affecting natural resources. Legal community organizations were publicly invited

                                                       27
to submit proposals and eligibility criteria applied to both the type of subproject and proponent
organizations. Financing of US$5,000 to US$10,000 was available, up to a maximum of US$25,000 in
exceptional cases. Importantly: (i) each subproject came with training including operation and
maintenance; (ii) each was evaluated by the PACAP area technical teams inter alia, for compliance with
Bank Safeguards and for positive impact on beneficiaries’ living conditions; and, (iii) results were
disseminated at participatory “subproject achievement fairs? including beneficiaries, municipal authorities,
government representatives and NGOs.

2.7      Results: Some 45 proposals were received (13 in San Diego-Las Barras and 32 in Bahia de
Jiquilisco) and 24 were financed (eight and 16 respectively). Investments were small, unlikely to generate
significant income in most cases, and valuable more for demonstrating conservation-friendly ways of
performing familiar activities. Even so, fishing activities using improved practices in Bahia de Jiquilisco
saw increased fish yields ranging from 33% to 275% with similar increases in incomes. An emblematic
example is fishing using explosives. In Bahia de Jiquilisco, local organizations helped to identify and
locate groups using such methods, built awareness through education on the protection of marine coastal
resources, then supported change with financial and technical incentives/subprojects and organizational
support. It is estimated that this effort reduced by 60% the number of fishermen using explosives, reduced
the physical risk to fishermen, and limited the destruction of mangroves for shrimp cultivation. Similarly,
excessive growth of water lilies in the Metapan Lagoon (San Diego - Las Barras) was disrupting
navigation, tourism and productive activities. Specialists designed methods to help local residents restore
the aquatic eco-system and use the lilies as material for crafts and soil fertilization. Participating
groups/organizations felt they had experienced a formative process and executing their subprojects had
strengthened organizations, capacity to manage/administer resources, generated income, and built
awareness of natural resource protection and conservation. See table 2.5.1.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

General Comments on the PAD Economic and Financial Analysis:

3.1      The PAD economic and financial (E&F) analysis consisted of an economic analysis of the project
on various sectors in the pilot project areas and a financial analysis of the MARN Natural Protected Areas
System (NPAS) that the project aimed to strengthen. This chapter reviews both analyses and updates them
to the extent possible.

Original Economic Analysis

3.2      The economic analysis prepared at appraisal was detailed and comprehensive, covering various
sectors on which the project was expected to have an economic impact. Specifically, for each of the
protected areas, project benefits were derived from: (i) avoided loss of carbon sequestration as a result of
reduced deforestation; (ii) conversion to sustainable fishing coupled with reduced deforestation; (iii)
sustainable firewood production; and, (iv) sustainable agriculture and aquaculture. The assumptions made
in the calculations were generally reasonable, although some appeared questionable, as discussed in more
detail below. More importantly, a major shortcoming of the analysis appears to be its failure to include
the economic benefits that would have accrued in the without-project scenario from the conversion of
mangroves and other forested areas to alternative land uses, although the cost of their conversion in terms
of reduced carbon sequestration and reduced support to fisheries was estimated. Alternative land uses that
generated economic benefits before the project and would have continued to do so without the project
included notably agriculture, urban settlements, and fishing. Their exclusion from the analysis led to an
overestimation of project benefits.

3.3    At a discount rate of 12 percent and a 50-year period of analysis, the net present value of
incremental project benefits was estimated at US$34.9million.

Ex-post Analysis

3.4     The ICR economic analysis updated the quantitative valuation of some of the benefits in the
without and with project scenarios where updated data were available and reasonable assumptions could
be made. The with-project scenario was updated based on hindsight on which project inputs, outputs, and
outcomes actually occurred and when, and which outcomes are likely to occur in the future. Similarly the
without-project scenario was updated partially based on information on similar areas outside the project
areas. Quantified benefits included: (i) carbon sequestration and (ii) fisheries, both of which depended
strongly on the rate of deforestation assumed. For the rest, a qualitative discussion was provided.

3.5      Where the benefits and costs for both scenarios could be quantified, 2005-2024 was adopted as
the period of analysis. This shorter period is justified since (i) any values after about 20 years are
“discounted away? by the 12percent discount rate; and, (ii) a 50-year period of analysis necessitates
assumptions about investments that would have to occur to ensure that benefits continue to accrue; yet he
project has no control over whether such investment would be actually carried out. Unlike the PAD
analysis, commodity price data were not adjusted to inflation, because the prices are all quoted in US
Dollars.

3.6     The PAD E&F analysis assumed a constant 1,128 ha annual deforestation in the mangrove areas
in the without-project scenario. This area was equivalent to a 5.8 percent deforestation rate in 2005; but
the percentage increased each year as the assumed remaining mangrove area declined. This assumption
was based on the findings of Vaglio et al (2003) 28, from which the analyst estimated nationwide annual
mangrove deforestation rates of 0.8 percent until 1996 and 5.8 percent from 1996 onwards. However, the
findings of the 2010 FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment and a 2012 World Bank El Salvador
Country Land Assessment differ significantly from these figures. Specifically, in the FAO
Assessment, the average annual deforestation rate was 1.43 percent from 2000 to 2005 and 1.47
percent from 2005 to 2010. The World Bank Country Land Assessment, based on satellite images and
ground verification, found that deforestation occurred at an annual rate of 1.5 percent from 1998-2008
and 0.17 percent from 2008-2011. Comparing the two Assessments, the World Bank Assessment
concludes that the sharp decline in annual deforestation rates likely started after 2005 but no later than
2008. The maps presented in the Country Land Assessment clearly indicate significantly lower
deforestation in the two project protected areas between 2008 and 2011. However, they also show similar
reductions in other protected areas in the country, suggesting that even without the project deforestation
might have been significantly lower than assumed in the PAD analysis.

3.7     Therefore, in this analysis, for the without-project scenario, for the mangrove areas a lower
annual deforestation rate of two percent is assumed. For the non-mangrove forests the corresponding rate
assumed is 1.5 percent. These assumptions take into account both the PAD analysis finding that the
mangrove deforestation may have been higher than the non-mangrove deforestation and the World Bank
finding on the overall country-wide deforestation rate before 2008, the year when any project activities
would become effective in counteracting deforestation.

3.8     In the with-project scenario, it is assumed that mangrove deforestation is reduced gradually from
two percent in 2005 to zero percent from 2008 onwards. Consequently, the mangrove forest area remains
18,492 ha from 2008 on, which is consistent with the project outcome that 18,424 ha of mangrove forests
are in good or very good status, reported in the Informe Final de Implementacion de Proyecto (August
2012). A similar assumption is made for the broadleaf forests, except from 2008 the annual deforestation
rate will be 0.17 percent to account for the fact that most broadleaf forests are outside the core
conservation area. Both assumptions are consistent with Map 6.2 in the World Bank Country Land
Assessment, which shows that minimal to no deforestation occurred from 2008-2011. It is assumed that
the deforestation rate during 2008-2011 will continue throughout the period of analysis (Table 1).

San Diego – Las Barras

3.9     The PAD E&F analysis assumed annual deforestation of 49.5 ha, which was equivalent to 2.8
percent of the forest area in 2005, from 2005-2010. It further assumed that from 2011, the deforested area
would increase by one percent until the entire area would be deforested in 2036.

3.10    In the ICR ex-post analysis, for the without-project scenario an annual rate of deforestation of 1.5
percent is assumed. For the with-project scenario, it is assumed that from 2005 to 2008 the rate will
decrease from 1.5 percent to 0.17 percent. The latter rate is assumed to persist through the end of the
period of analysis (Table 1).

Carbon Sequestration

3.11    Deforestation causes loss of capacity to sequester carbon. As in the PAD E&F analysis, it was
assumed that per hectare carbon sequestration is 200 tons in the case of mangroves and 213.48 tons in the
case of broadleaves. These figures were applied to the annual lost forest areas to derive the volume of
carbon lost annually, which was then assigned an economic value using two different prices: 29 (i) the
average price of a emission reduction right in the voluntary carbon market - $4.5/ton as in the PAD
analysis; and (ii) the social value of carbon sequestration, calculated to take into account the damage
caused by climate change - $20/ton in 1995 prices, adjusted by the US consumer price index, to current
years. (The PAD analysis used a constant $20 value.) The same method was applied to both with and
without project scenarios in both project areas. The annual benefits thus calculated are presented in Tables
A1 and A2.

3.12    The present value of incremental carbon sequestration benefits in the with-project scenario over
the without project scenario were calculated as $3.74million - $25.66million for the Bahia de Jiquilisco
and as $37,000 – $257,000 for San Diego Las Barras.

Fishery benefits

Bahia de Jiquilisco

3.13     The PAD E&F analysis estimated averted loss in fisheries revenues thanks to the halting of
mangrove destruction in the with-project scenario, by assuming a linear relationship. It further assumed
that the fishing level was five percent higher than the sustainable level and would, under the project, be
reduced to sustainable levels. In the without-project scenario, the fishing levels would remain constant
through 2008 despite the decreasing mangrove area; then in 2009 it would be reduced by 17 percent and
then decrease at the same rate as mangrove destruction.

3.14  In the ICR analysis, the without-project mangrove destruction rate is less than assumed in the
PAD analysis, as discussed above. Consequently, the sustainable level of fishing decreases at a lower rate.



29
  In calculating the lost carbon sequestration capacity as a result of deforestation, the PAD E&F analysis incorrectly
multiplied the total area of forests in the protected area with the per hectare tonnage of carbon sequestered. Rather it
should have multiplied the annual area lost to deforestation with tonnage of carbon sequestered per ha.

                                                          35
Furthermore, the ICR considers the PAD assumption that overfishing would continue to increase relative
to the sustainable level, resulting in a 33% overfishing rate in 2008, unrealistic. Rather the ICR assumes
that actual fishing would be five percent above the sustainable level throughout the analysis period. For
the period 2012-2024 an average annual inflation rate of 3.5 percent, which was the average in 2001-2011,
is assumed. In the with-project scenario, it is assumed that between 2008 and 2012, overfishing declined
gradually to the sustainable level, and from 2010 fishing levels are sustainable, reflecting increased
awareness among the fishermen and stricter controls. In both scenarios, it is assumed that the relative
shares in overall catches of artisanal and industrial fishing stayed as in 2003. The flow of total fishing
values are presented in Table A3.

3.15    The present value of the incremental benefits of the project is estimated as $2.13 million.

San Diego – Las Barras

3.16     The PAD E&F analysis made two critical assumptions: i) In the without-project scenario, the
fishing volumes in Guija and Metapan would decrease at the same annual rate as the assumed rate of
deforestation, based on the presumption of a strong relationship between the pollution of the two lakes
and the rate of deforestation. It is noted that the PAD analysis assumed no overfishing. (ii) in the with-
project scenario, the fishing volumes would remain at the 2005 level, consistent with the assumption that
deforestation would stop as soon as the project began in 2005. The implicit assumption is that the volume
of fishing in 2005 corresponded to sustainable levels.

3.17     In the absence of contradicting information, the ICR analysis adopted the same assumption about
the without-project scenario. For the with-project scenario it also assumes that the fishing volume will
trend in the same manner as the forest area. The present value of the incremental benefit was estimated as
$308,000.

Fuelwood

Bahia de Jiquilisco

3.18     The PAD E&F analysis estimated the value of fuel wood extracted from the protected natural
areas for the without and with-project scenarios. For the without project scenario, the PAD analysis
assumed consumption of 40m3 per family for two significantly different assumptions on the number of
families living in the protected area’s core and buffer zones and using firewood (2,166 vs. 7,050 families
in 2005). Under the lower population estimate the firewood use was found to be below the sustainable
extraction level, while under the higher population estimate, 2.4 times the sustainable level was extracted.
The analysis predicted that given this level of use, available fuel wood would run out in 2020 and 2017,
respectively. (But this projection is based on the use of an incorrect annual population growth rate of 7%
as opposed to the correct rate of 1.7% indicated in the report.) In the with-project scenario, it was
assumed that each family would be allocated a fuel wood extraction quota, which would be in line with
sustainable use levels in 2005. Furthermore, the project would provide soft loans to families for the
purchase of gas stoves. In both cases, the benefits were valued using the price of gas stoves and kerosene
used to achieve the same amount of cooking value as with fuel wood.

3.19    An ex-post analysis quantitative analysis was not possible as information about the actual
populations in and around the protected area was not available to the ICR team. It can be said however,
that the incremental benefit of the project is likely to have been less than estimated in the PAD E&F
analysis since the deforestation rate was likely much lower in the without-project scenario than assumed,
as discussed earlier. Furthermore, the project did not assign any quotas for wood extraction. Nevertheless,


                                                    36
the project through its provision to resident families of 112 “ecological stoves?, which burn wood more
efficiently, will likely have reduced wood extraction rates and thereby helped reduce deforestation.

San Diego – Las Barras

3.20    In the PAD E&F analysis, the population figure, 36,266 or approximately 7,716 families was
estimated based on the 1993 census. The fuelwood benefits in the without-and with-project cases were
estimated using a similar methodology as in Jiquilisco.

3.21    The ICR considered that the population estimate of the PAD analysis was unreliable given large
population movements between 1993 and 2005. In the absence of updated figures, a quantitative analysis
could not be carried out. It is noted, however, that as in Jiquilisco, the fuelwood related benefit and cash
flows are likely to be much smaller than in the PAD analysis given the lower deforestation rate assumed
in the without-project scenario. Unlike Jiquilisco, in San Diego Las Barras no ecological stoves were
provided to the residents.

Other Impacts

3.22    Foregone alternative land uses in both pilot areas. In the without-project scenario,
deforestation caused by people clearing land for agriculture, dwellings and other purposes would lead to
positive values associated with these land uses. This value could not be estimated due to data
unavailability.

Bahia de Jiquilisco

3.23     The PAD E&F analysis predicted that without the project, the loss of forest cover may lead to
such depletion of groundwater reservoirs and thus drinking water wells that by 2020 it would be
necessary to put in place infrastructure to transfer drinking water from outside the area for the families
living in and around the protected natural area. The present value of the cost of such investment was
estimated at $615,000 over a 50 year period. With the project this cost would be averted. In this analysis,
this averted cost was not considered since, in hindsight, deforestation is unlikely to have been so dramatic,
as discussed above.

San Diego – Las Barras

3.24     The PAD analysis estimated the cost of soil erosion, which it assessed as 19 metric tons for
hectare per year in the without-project scenario, by valuing one metric ton at $100. For the with-project
scenario, the analysis assumed that 140 producers would adopt soil conservation measures, which would
result in a 90% reduction of erosion. The ICR concluded that the project did not lead to this benefit since
none of the sub-projects introduced soil conservation practices. Regardless, the ICR considers the
assumptions related to the effectiveness of such practices, namely 90 percent reduction, unrealistic.

National level benefits

3.25    The project invested in the strengthening of the national level MARN/NPAS. As discussed in the
main part of the ICR, the investments led to limited capacity improvement. This capacity, if strengthened
further with necessary legal and institutional backing, would help El Salvador conserve its biodiversity
values and ensure sustainable natural resource use in and around the pilot and other protected areas.

Small grant sub-projects

3.26    Annex 1 presents a detailed account of the sub-projects in both pilot protected areas. Given their
small size and limited financial information available about them, it was not possible to conduct any type
of economic or financial analysis of them.

Project Costs

3.27    The total project cost was $4.91million, of which $3.96million was funded by the GEF and
$0.95million by the Government of El Salvador. The approximate disbursement of these funds is
presented in Table 2.30 At a 12% discount rate, the present value of the project expenditures as of 2005 is
$2.57million.

Conclusion

3.28    The ICR analysis has shown that avoided loss of the pilot protected areas’ carbon sequestration
capacity is the largest benefit accruing due to the project, even taking into account the much more modest
deforestation in the without-project scenario than assumed in the PAD. It is estimated at $4.78million -
$25.92million. (The lower figure reflects the voluntary carbon market value, $4.5/ton of the avoided
carbon sequestration loss; the higher value reflects the social value of carbon sequestration, $20/ton in
1995 terms.) Fisheries benefits are also significant and result from lower deforestation, which reduces
sedimentation of the lakes in San Diego Las Barras and more sustainable fishing practices that are
believed to be achieved through extensive public awareness-raising in the project area and specific
subproject investments. Fuel wood benefits could not be estimated due to data unavailability. The sum of
the carbon sequestration and fishery benefits exceeds GEF and GoES project expenditures at a net present
value ranging between 3.64 million and 25.56 million (Table 3). The NPV would be somewhat lower if
the value of the alternative land uses in the without-project scenario could be estimated.

Financing of the MARN Protected Natural Areas System

3.29     At the PAD stage, a financial analysis of MARN’s Protected Natural Areas System (PNAS) was
undertaken to assess its financial viability. The analysis included a cash flow assessment with a projection
until 2015 that included the incremental revenues and costs associated with the PNAS consolidation. The
sum of (i) projected incremental costs, including investment, personnel and operations and maintenance
(O&M) costs, and (ii) strategic investments, such as management plan development, ecotourism
infrastructure development, awareness-raising, ranged from $0.43million in 2006 to $3.23 million in
2015. 31 In comparison, MARN’s total general budget, allocated by the Ministry of Finance and made
available from various environmental funds, amounted to $3.8 million in 2005. The PAD therefore
pointed out the need for additional revenue sources and suggested park entrance fees, sale of
authorizations and concessions, as well as taxes for international air departures, water consumption and
hydroelectric energy use. The Project Results Framework included as one of the outcome indicators for
Component 2 “Amount of revenues (in US$) raised from sustainable natural resources use concessions,
visitor fees, and other potential cost recovery mechanisms?.

3.30    Post-project financial situation, MARN/NPAS’ annual variable costs significantly exceed its
revenues. 32 The variable costs are estimated at $7.4million and include salaries and social contributions
for 246 staff members and O&M costs (Table 4). Costs would increase significantly if investments in the
parks, estimated at appraisal at more than $6.5million over a 9 year period, were included. Revenue
sources include
5    allocations from the national budget; and
6    entrance fees, cabin rentals, and sports hunting licenses, and sale of plants and timber. Such revenues
     are collected only at three of the country’s parks, namely Montechristo, Conchagua and Impossible.
     They are transferred to a central extra-budgetary Fund for Special Activities at MARN, from where
     they are allocated to various activities and investments across the PNAS.33

3.31    Revenues from these two sources amounted to slightly over US$2.0 million (Table 5) annually in
2010-2011. Additionally, MARN counts on international projects, such as the Environmental Investment
Fund for the Americas, the Environment Fund of El Salvador, and the GEF UNDP Small Grants program,
for investments in the park buffer zones. The MARN communication estimates the annual flow of funds
from these sources at US$5.0 million, although it does not provide details on these funds and the small
investment projects they have financed or plan to finance.

3.32    At the level of the two project beneficiary protected areas, annual staff costs amount to over
$100,000 in Bahia de Jiquilisco and about $32,000 in San Diego Las Barras (Table 6). In addition,
operations and maintenance costs are incurred, which were not specified in the MARN communication.
These costs have to be funded from the NPAS overall budget as neither of these parks collected any user
or concession fees in 2010 or 2011.

3.33    MARN has informed the ICR team of its strategy to increase NPAS revenues through a larger
budgetary allocation and increases in user charges, and by increasing the productive capacity of the
protected areas that have such potential through partnerships with the private sector and municipalities.
MARN developed in cooperation with UNDP the Incorporation of Biodiversity in fishing and tourism
project and the Water Fund Program aimed at protecting watersheds, which will contribute to the
strengthening of protected areas (income generation for some protected areas and sustainable
conservation activities of water resources). MARN is also working on finance management through the
Ecosystem Restoration and Landscapes with Jiquilisco township, Cerron Grande, and Montañona being
the geographic areas of focus.

Cost Effectiveness Analysis
3.34     A quantitative cost effectiveness analysis is extremely difficult in the case of biodiversity projects
given due to difficulties in quantifying outcomes related to biodiversity conservation. The GEF therefore
advices to qualitatively assess alternative approaches that would yield the same result, in a manner similar
to the “alternatives considered? framework in the World Bank PAD (GEF, 2005), An attempt is made at
such an assessment ex post looking at the alternatives identified I the PAD.

3.35     The PAD considered three alternatives to the design that the project supported and concluded that
none would achieve the objective as well as the blend of the GEF grant and the LAP II project: Of these, a
“stand alone? project focusing only on MARN, without any link to CRN and the LAP II is most
intriguing, because it is the approach that the project resulted in when LAP II was canceled. As discussed
in the main body of the ICR, consequently the project outcomes could not be realized to their full extent.

3.36     Another interesting point relates to the attributability of one of the key project outcomes to
project interventions. As discussed in detail at the beginning of the annex, the reduction in deforestation,
which is associated with biodiversity benefits, is likely have to have occurred largely even without project


                                                      40
interventions, notably the delimitation of protected are boundaries, employment of guards in the park area
enforcing the boundaries and non-use regulations, and public awareness raising. This brings to mind the
possibility that the same result may have been achieved at a lower cost. However, it should be kept in
mind that the external factors that led to reduced deforestation across the country may subside again
making these interventions indispensible for continued limited or no use of core forest areas.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

5.1      MARN/PCU organized a series of meetings in each pilot PA to obtain the views of
individual beneficiaries which were then consolidated. The goal was to find out if threats to the
integrity of biodiversity were reduced and how PACAP contributed to the sustainable
development of communities and population in the pilot areas. The following are aggregate
results of workshops conducted for each pilot PA.

Bahia de Jiquilisco

5.2     Three meetings were organized based on where beneficiaries were located in each pilot
PA. Meetings was presided by a speaker, secretary and moderator. Ten people from each
participating beneficiary organization were invited to attend.

General:

    x   50% said their subproject was their first experience in direct execution of a subproject.
        Participation was divided 264 men and 231 women representing 314 boys and 372 girls
        under 18.
    x   100% agreed that quality of life had improved as a result of their subproject and 100%
        said their subproject had helped conserve and protect natural resources.
    x   Participants considered they had contributed to reducing environmental contamination
        through environmental education days, campaigns to clean water bodies; implementation
        of dry latrines; and, wood-saving stoves.
    x   All participants agreed that they had been influential in keeping vigil over natural
        resources and reporting infractions;
    x   All reported having implemented various activities to restore eco-systems: reforestation,
        artificial reefs (arrecifes); and improved drainage in mangrove areas.
    x   From the organizations reporting economic results: fish yields increase ranging from 33%
        to 275%, and incomes rose according to much the same range.
    x   About 47% of men and 44% of women considered that the experience strengthened their
        intellectual capacity.
    x   Most believed subproject execution had strengthened their organization, capacity to
        manage funds, administer financial resources and generate income, and built awareness
        about natural resources conservation.
    x   About 42% of women said they had participated in decision-making about administrative
        processes, and about the same percentage had participated in planning and execution
        decisions.

Main obstacles:

    x   Late disbursement of funds to beneficiaries was a dominant theme of responses about
        problems, along with turnover in administrative staff responsible for a subproject;
        problems with financial settlement of the subproject (e.g., submission of accounts); and
        lack of clarity in the subproject formatos.
    x   Implementation obstacles included lack of technical capacity to implement subprojects,
        and difficulties purchasing certain materials not available in El Salvador.




                                               50
Main achievements:

   x   Organizational strengthening, capacity to manage resources and projects.
   x   Environmental awareness-building and protection.
   x   Increased technical capacity.
   x   Reduced incidence of respiratory ailments and drainage of stagnant water areas.
   x   Increased production and incomes (in selected cases) and greater family economic
       security.
   x   Beneficiaries agreed that they had improved their fishing practices, reduced deforestation
       and destruction of mangroves, and damage to local fauna.
   x   Community members trained in environmental matters tended to transmit that
       information to other members.

Productive capacity:

   x   Families with low resources were able to generate additional income;
   x   Four groups had organized as a cooperative since their subproject of which two groups
       had formerly fished using explosives;

Synergies created via subproject execution:

   x   Numerous examples of cooperation from mayors and public authorities in providing
       environmental education and training, clean-up campaigns, security and transportation of
       artificial reefs.
   x   Cooperatives exchanged experiences, youth groups provided environmental awareness-
       building to the local population.
   x   Many cases of local bodies, churches, ADESCOs participating in subproject execution.

Strategies for continuing after the Project closed:

   x   Most beneficiary groups said they planned to seek support from other institutions to
       strengthen their subproject and increase their incomes.
   x   Local organizations/cooperatives are helping with maintenance services, overseeing use
       of the eco-stoves and keeping vigilant on deforestation, planning to prepare new projects
       and train communities.

Beneficiary evaluation of PACAP Team:

   x   Beneficiaries were generally very satisfied with support received from the PACAP Team
       especially technical assistance and level of communication.
   x   Financial training was particularly appreciated, as was basic training in administration.
   x   Attendance at meetings and timeliness was however, criticized by beneficiaries.

San Diego and San Felipe Las Barras

   x   Most subprojects in this pilot PA executed subprojects falling into two strategic areas:
       low-impact tourism and biodiversity.
   x   Numbers of participants in the workshops were 785 men and 640 women (representing
       80 boys and 77 girls under 18), a much larger number than Bahia de Jiquilisco in a
       smaller pilot area.


                                              51
   x   All reported strengthened capacity to administer, execute and account for resources.
   x   Six of the eight participating organizations had never directly executed a subproject while
       the other two had over three such experiences each.
   x   Leaders of organizations which had implemented subprojects considered their
       subprojects had reduced environmental contamination through sanitation improvements,
       community-wide clean-up, and cleaning of waterways.
   x   The eight organizations had received a total 57 environmental training events.
   x   Participants had conducted a series of activities to reduce pressure on forests most
       commonly: clean-up campaigns, new fishing techniques.
   x   The three forest eco-systems - dry, alluvial and humid - were benefited by organizations
       executing subprojects. Clean-up campaigns in all three types of forest were part of
       beneficiaries’ counterpart contribution and helped keep areas clean and attractive for
       visitors.
   x   Five of the eight organizations had conducted reforestation on a total 24.5 ha.
   x   One organization with a fishing subproject using improved nets permitted by law had
       doubled fish yields and trebled income since the before-subproject situation.
   x   87% of beneficiaries reported that their intellectual capacity had increased since the
       experience.
   x   49% of men and 51% of women representing the eight organizations had participated in
       different themes imparted through the preparation, decision-making, administration and
       execution processes.
   x   All participants felt the subproject experience had strengthened their financial skills and
       this was evident in early errors committed which were shown to be overcome in the
       second round of financial reporting.
   x   57% of men and women said they had participated continuously in administrative
       processes.
   x   46% of women said they had participated continuously throughout the subproject period.

Main obstacles:

   x   All eight organizations agreed unanimously that the main obstacle was the protracted
       delay in each of the disbursements (subproject financing was paid in installments).
   x   Due to this situation, many activities could not be carried out as planned and there was a
       huge delay between the start of a subproject and its completion, with pending activities
       conducted at other times.
   x   Review of financial reports (by MARN/PCU) was also very slow and acquisitions
       encountered difficulties because providers in Metapan would not accept checks for small
       purchases.
   x   Among the more significant limitations of executing organizations was their weak
       administrative capacity.

Main achievements:

   x   Most organizations felt that institutional strengthening and knowledge acquired from
       training sessions were the two most valuable achievements.
   x   Beneficiary groups felt that the goods acquired, intellectual strengthening and new
       practices learned, were also valuable and strengthened them institutionally.
   x   Among the environmental achievements, beneficiaries cited: increased production of fish,
       utilization of native species in reforestation, reduced environmental contamination.



                                              52
   x   Increased production and incomes (where relevant), benefits at both the individual and
       family level, and improved living conditions were cited by all participants.

Synergies with other activities/programs:

       x   Many local and national governmental agencies participated in numerous supportive
           ways to work with beneficiary organizations including through training, education,
           evaluation, local environmental clean-up, and formalization of credentials of some
           organizations such as new cooperatives.

Sustainability:

       x   Most of the organizations participating in the workshop believed that seeking other
           sources of support after PACAP was a sound option and some are already looking for
           strategic alliances with other local organizations which have certain activities in
           common.

Beneficiaries’ views on the PACAP PCU:

       x   A majority said PACAP support – monitoring, supervision and technical assistance
           delivered from the two PACAP regional offices - was excellent.
       x   They found that the regional coordinator and specialist personnel provided timely
           attention and technical oversight in the countryside, and support to technical reports.
       x   They found the objective support provided by the technical staff valuable, although
           MARN’s financial specialist did not provide technical assistance for the management
           of funds, just training.

Lessons learned from both pilot areas:

   x   Cooperatives learned the value of training in simple accounting as valuable for their
       access to future, similar opportunities.
   x   The organization is the development base of the community and beneficiaries learned to
       bring forward ideas to help the community. Organization also enables communities to
       tackle more difficult projects, and they now know how to prepare the documents needed
       to apply to other programs with resources.
   x   Strength lies in unity and when organized as cooperatives, they have greater weight when
       they approach institutions. They can now move ahead because they don’t need to go
       back to fishing with explosives.
   x   Coordination/collaboration with other community associations results in better
       management of projects.

A. Executive Summary of Client’s Completion Report (Informal Translation)

Background:

7.1     El Salvador contains an impressive diversity of species and ecosystems with consequent
potential to provide eco-systemic services represented by over 19 different eco-systems according
to UNESCO’s eco-system classification. However, this natural wealth has not been appreciated
or supported adequately to diminish the environmental and social vulnerability which affects the
country, particularly in regard to global climate change which threatens Central America.

7.2      However, the natural eco-systems in El Salvador with the least human intervention are
highly fragmented and dispersed in 13% of the national territory, and less than 1% is under any
form of management which guarantees the protection of its capacity to provide eco-system
services. This situation has led to recent Governments, and particularly the current, to change the
paradigm concerning management of natural protected areas, which has historically been focused
on protecting natural spaces from the threats resulting from human occupation, alteration of
forests, and the contamination and over-exploitation of natural resources. Given that these
conditions exist, they are the product of unordered development models of development which
obligate a re-thinking of the management of natural areas as promoters of processes to restore
landscapes which galvanize the provision of eco-system services to decrease national
vulnerability.

7.3     In response, the Government of El Salvador (GOES) implemented the Consolidation and
Administration of Protected Areas project (PACAP), approved by the World Bank Board of
Directors on November 29, 2005. PACAP was financed through a non-reimbursable Grant of
US$5.00 million from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) complemented by GOES funding
of US$2.632 million. The designated Government executor was the Ministry for Environment
and Natural Resources (MARN) with the participation of other institutions, principally the
National Registry Center (CNR) and the Salvadoran Institute of Agrarian Transformation (ISTA)
in accordance with the Grant Agreement TF055925 between GOES and the World Bank signed
on 15 May 2006 and published in the Official Diary Volume No. 375 of June 7, 2007, which
marked its operational launch. PACAP was planned to conclude in five years on June 30, 2011
and was extended to June 29, 2012.

7.4     The global environmental objective (GEO) was to conserve globally significant
biodiversity in El Salvador, strengthening the NPAS and consolidating the two priority protected
areas. The indicators expected from the GEO were:

7    Natural Protected Areas System strategy improved and pilot tested;
8    Two pilot areas protected, consolidated and effectively administered (Tracking Tool score of
     a min. 40 for 35,600 ha in Bahia de Jiquilisco, and 1,917 ha in the Lake Guija Complex San
     Diego-La Barra);
9    Benefits of biodiversity established on a minimum 12,400 ha:
            ¾ For the Bahia de Jiquilisco Conservation area, a minimum 11,000 ha of
                mangroves and associated humid forest within the protection zones of the
                nucleus/core will have deforestation below 1% over 5 years.

              ¾ For the Guija Complex, San Diego-La Barra, a minimum of 1,400 ha of dry
                tropical forest or associated riparian forest will have deforestation below 1% over
                5 years.

7.5       To achieve these indicators, the Project had three components:

Component 1: Strengthening the Natural Protected Areas System (NPAS), focusing on
promoting an efficient and sustainable administration over the long term in natural protected
areas, as well as the use of their resources, using an eco-system approach and with the inclusion
and participation of all relevant actors. Component 1 was divided into three sub-components:
    x 1.1: Consolidation of the NPAS strategy
    x 1.2: Strengthening the legal and institutional framework
    x 1.3: Public Information campaign and awareness-building

Component 2: Consolidation and Administration of Pilot Protected Areas designed to
consolidate pilot areas through the development, validation, and application of an innovative
methodology for the management of natural protected areas. Pilot areas for PACAP intervention
were:

      x   Guija Complex in Matapan, Santa Ana Department
      x   Bahia de Jiquilisco, Department of Usulutan

The consolidation of pilot areas included the delimitation and demarcation of natural areas and
the regularization of eligible residents through strategies, mechanisms and rules for the
occupation of State lands. The results of this component were used to consolidate the entire
protected areas system included under the first component. Component 2 was divided into three
sub-components:

      x   Characterization, delimitation and physical demarcation of pilot natural areas;
      x   Legalization and regularization of two pilot natural areas;
      x   Implementation and updating of management plans for two pilot natural areas.

Component 3: Project Administration focused on the mechanisms for administering the Project,
including planning, financial administration and procurement, as well as monitoring and
evaluation.

Factors affecting project implementation:

7.6     Various factors affected the achievement of sub-component targets. Some were under
the control of the Bank, others by GOES/MARN, and other factors were beyond the control of
any agency.

7.7      The main factors within the Bank’s control which affected project implementation were
changes in the composition of the Bank team and consultants who brought different opinions and
directions for PACAP implementation, and the lack of monitoring of recommendations of the
MTR which suggested extension of the Project to June 2013, and subsequently not permitting
further extension to December 2012.

7.8   GOES affected project implementation by not doing more to build ownership in
complementary Government institutions which could have supported MARN, which was part of


                                                 56
the commitment established by the Grant Agreement. This is reflected in the scant participation
of ISTA and the complicated/complex participation of CNR.            MARN, as Government’s
implementing agency, affected project performance through its slow, centralized decision-making.

7.9     To these factors one can add extreme climatic factors such as tropical storms in the
Pacific Ocean (Ida November 2009) and Agatha (May 2010), and the tropical depression 12E
(October 2011) affected the continuity of fieldwork in general.

Results, Effects and Impacts:

7.10    Despite factors which affected the implementation of 100% of expected targets, all
environmental indicators were achieved and financial execution was 80.4% of the Grant. The
principal results were:

Component 1:

    x   Rationalization Study of the natural protected areas and analysis of conservation gaps;
    x   Management Strategy for the natural protected areas and Biological Corridors of the
        country;
    x   Legalization of 69 natural protected areas;
    x   Draft regulations for the Protected Areas Law

The PACAP publicity campaign was not carried out in full, but the project financed a campaign
to protect forest life and produced 5,000 copies of the Protected Areas Law.

Component 2:

    x   Management Plans for both pilot sites;
    x   Delimitation, demarcation and monumentation (signs) of the National Park San Felipe
        Las Barras (1,870.16 ha);
    x   Delimitation of the mangrove forests of the Bahia de Jiquilisco PA (22,919.57 ha), and
        associated humid forests (1,876.4 ha) of Nancuchiname, Normandia, Ghaguantique, Isla
        de Mendez and Hacienda El Caballito;
    x   Implementation of 24 productive subprojects with local communities to improve their
        economic incomes through the use of sustainable natural resources;
    x   Consolidation of the COALs in all natural protected areas and mangroves

7.11    Locally in both pilot sites active social “platforms? were established as a result of 192
dissemination events in which participated some 2,410 women and 5,260 men. MARN
intervened, with the Public Ministry, in over 200 cases of denunciations of environmental damage
in the PAs which resulted in preventing deforestation and new, irregular human settlements
without transgressing the rights of anyone and complying with all the Bank’s Safeguards through
participatory conflict resolution mechanisms.

7.12    The information generated by PACAP and the active participation of its members was
used for other development processes prompted by GOES such as the Territories for Progress,
FOMILENIO 2, Consultations of the National Environmental Policy, and formulation of the
National Coastal-Marine Development Policy.

Evaluation of the performance of the World Bank and GOES:

7.13     The World Bank has criteria to evaluate the performance of the Bank in the design and
supervision of the Project, and to evaluate Government’s performance in implementing the
project, and of the local implementation agency. These criteria are described in the Guide to the
Preparation of Implementation and Results Reports, updated October 5, 2011.

7.14    In regard to the design of PACAP, the Bank showed Highly Satisfactory performance,
although its supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory. In the general context of GOES
participation in project implementation, GOES’ performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, as
is MARN as the local implementing agency. Based on the Guide’s criteria both the Bank and
GOES/MARN demonstrated Moderately Satisfactory performance.

Lessons learned and recommendations:

7.15     Changes in senior project staff in key posts such as the General Coordinator should have
been accompanied by an intense process of induction from MARN and the Bank to build
understanding in the shortest period concerning the difficulties and changes needed by PACAP
during its previous implementation stage. This would have generated a better channel of
communication within a framework of greater understanding between different authorities and
institutions and the Project’s General Coordinator/Coordination.

7.16     GOES in general and MARN in particular have a centralized decision-making structure,
probably induced by the responsibilities implied in trying to achieve Laws and complying with
requirements of the State Controller – Court of Accounts of the Republic of El Salvador. This
centralization provoked major delays in decision-making, and for MARN Titulares, in this case,
taking decisions required analysis of the processes by corresponding functionaries; these same
were total over-worked and the processes were reviewed by various levels of intervention in
incredible detail to ensure that no law was transgressed that could be detected by the Court of
Accounts. Probably, decision-making processes in GOES and monitoring responsibilities for
execution and the consequences of same, merited re-engineering to delegate operational decisions
and/or increase the number of staff of government institutions which verify the validity of the
processes for those responsible for making decisions.

7.17    The financial and procurement processes of the Bank and GOES have points of
coincidence/similarity and differences. Throughout the Project, there were delays in these
processes due to interpretation of the rule to be applied, such as: the Ley Organica de
Administracion Financiera del Estado (Lei AFI), the Law for Acquisitions and Contracts of the
Public Administration (LACAP), and Bank rules. Training events provided by the Bank in Bank
procurement and financial management rules, need to be continuous, at least annually and when
there is a change of personnel, and should be directed not only to project staff but to all
government staff related to these processes so that all are clear on the respective rules and when
each of them should be applied, and including financial management and procurement units
within MARN, other implementing agencies, Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of External
Relations.

7.18    Processes for land administration related to the determination of title of tenancy,
delimitation and cadaster, among others, are closely related themes in MARN. The identification
and qualification of lands with potential to come in under the NPAS, the management of conflicts
between colindrantes, owners, tenants and occupants, the declaration of a PA and its inscription
in CNR, are continuous processes in MARN for which this Ministry should have an land


                                               58
administration unit with professionals specialized in geodesic techniques, cadaster, and land
legislation. Such a unit would permit MARN to address denunciations/complaints about
contamination, deforestation, inadequate management of solid waste and requests for concessions
with geo-referenced field data and with precise analysis. This unit should be composed of a team
of trained professionals similar to the team supervising the delimitation under PACAP.

7.19     During PACAP implementation opinions circulated about the need or not to declare salt
forests as PAs because the existing legislation gives them protection. Analysis by the legal
assistant and the land administration specialist, based on discussions with CNR in the technical
round-table and the consultancy in management of the residents of the PAs led people to
conclude that, even though the PA Law confers protection on these forests, there are legal gaps
which permit the registry of State property with CNR on behalf of individuals, obliging MARN to
pursue judgments to prove that the land belongs to the State, and protection of these forests if
there would have been changes in land use. However, declaration of PA status for salt forests and
their consequent registration with CNR would impede the registration of these properties with
CNR by individuals adds a solid legal surety which will save the State the effort and cost.
