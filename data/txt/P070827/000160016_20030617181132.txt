 2. Programdevelopmentobiective (see Annex 1)
 The development objectives of the Bahia Education Program are to:                      (a) improve fundamental and
 secondary school outcomes, as measured by improvements in dropout and promotion rates and student
 performance on standardized tests; and (b) increase access to secondary school, as measured by an
 increase insecondary enrollments.




  "Fundamental" school throughout this document refers to grades 1-8, which inBrazil i s known as the "fundamental

B. Strategic Context

1. Sector-related CountrvAssistance StratePv (CAS) goal supportedbvthe uroiect
   (see Annex 1)
Document number 24182-BR                    Date of latest C A S discussion May 20,2002
This Project directly contributes to the achievement o f the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in
Brazil by promoting the universal completion o f primary education in one o f the poorest and most
populous states in the country. The overall CAS goal i s to promote sustainable long-term growth,
alleviate poverty and reduce income inequality in Brazil, while the specific education sector goal o f the
CAS is to achieve universal primary education by 2007 and improve educational performance in basic
subjects, particularly Portuguese and Math. Targeting efforts to improve educational access and quality
for the poor is also a high priority. The CAS update report (commenting on the March 2000 CAS)
concluded that CAS goals were being implemented effectively and the goals remain appropriate. Since
the new government took power in January 2003, the Bank has been discussing the preparation o f a new
CAS, schedule for delivery inOctober 2003.


The program is in line with CAS goals in its emphasis on improving school outcomes and student
achievement levels.           The program addresses the goal o f universal primary education by improving
education quality, thereby lowering the high dropout and repetition rates that characterize the Bahian
education system. The program also adheres to CAS goals in its geographic focus on Bahia and explicit
targeting o f fundamental schools inthe state's 100 poorest municipalities. Located in the Northeast, one
o f Brazil's least developed regions, Bahia i s home to an estimated four million people living below the
poverty line. Enrollment rates at both the primary and secondary levels in Bahia remain lower than the
countrywide average, and only four percent o f the adult population in Bahia has completed secondary
school, creating a serious lack o f human capital for the economic development o f the state as a whole.

The program is also in line with the integrated development approach proposed by the Bank and
coordinated with the State government. This approach seeks to integrate all Bank projects in Bahia,
regardless o f sector, under a single coordinated vision centered on four key lines o f action: fighting
poverty, improving govemance, increasing competitiveness, and preservingthe environment. Workshops
held inOctober and December 2002 gathered government stakeholders from each o fthe State Secretariats
to discuss integration across sectors along these lines o f action. From these meetings it was clear that
projects inthe human development sector (education and health) correspond to the priorities o f the state.
This project will assist infurthering the development o fthe state's integratedapproach by devoting funds
o f institutional development to activities targeted at sharpening the state-level integrated strategy.

A central pillar of such coordinated approach to development has been called "Gente da Bahia" and it
focuses on combating poverty and inequality by placing emphasis on education, culture, health, public
safety, and access to water and sanitation. This project, and a simultaneous health project beingprepared,
are at the heart o f the Gente da Bahia strategy and respond to the key interest o f the state o f improving

quality o f schooling. Inaddition, through this project the state i s raising the capacity in municipalities to
increasingly assume responsibility for basic, primary education (grades 1-4).

2. M a i n sector issues and Government strategy
M a i n Sector Issues
Because educational change happens slowly, many o f the sector issues described in the Project 1 PAD
continue to challenge Bahia at the start o f Phase 2, although some improvement is already noticeable.
This section updates information presented previously and provides justification for the second phase of
the Bahia Program and the continuation ofthe same design.

Low enrollment and completion rates
Education is compulsory in Brazil through the fundamental cycle (1st to 8th grade for the 7-14 age
group). Bahia has created thousands o f additional school places in the last decade, increasing net
enrollment rates from 85.8 percent in 1991 to 97.8 percent in2002. To attain universal levels o f primary
school enrollment the government must now focus on: (a) poorly distributed school places; (b) high
repetition leading to dropout; and (c) lack o f demand by parents or children. Persistent students
nonetheless are making their way through the system: from 1996-2001 the number o f students completing
the fundamental cycle inpublic schools inBahia increased by 135 percent.

As students move though the fundamental cycle inever greater numbers, demandfor secondary education
has increased dramatically: enrollment at the secondary level increased by almost 80 percent from 1997-
2001. Nevertheless, enrollment rates remain low: only 16 percent o f the 15-17 age population inBahia is
enrolled in secondary school. The distribution o f secondary school places i s highly unequal, resulting in
disparities among and between income groups, interior and coastal regions, and urban and rural areas.
Low enrollment rates at the secondary level are attributable to: (a) high repetition rates at the primary
level, leading to large age-grade gaps and rising opportunity cost o f schooling; (b) lack o f relevance; and
(c) insufficient supply o f secondary places.

High repetition and age-grade distortion
Bank-supported sector work and other studies confirm that students who repeat are more likely to repeat
 again and eventually drop out.2 In the case o f Bahia, repetition rates for the fundamental cycle are 18
percent, while two-thirds o f students are older than they should be for their respective grade. Inthe first
 grade alone, 47 percent of students are two years older (or more) than they should be. Intotal, students
 age 20 or older represent almost 14percent o f enrollments inthe fundamental cycle. Age-grade distortion
 is the cumulative result o f late-entry to school (especially in rural areas) and chronic grade repetition
 across the Brazilian system.

Low teacher andprincipal qualifications and skills
 Untilrecently, there have been no uniform standards for appointing school principals inBahia. Instead,
 principals were frequently appointed through mechanisms that ignored their qualifications and skills.
 Under the first phase o f the Bahia project, more than 9,000 principals were trained in management and
 leadership skills and subsequently tested in their competence levels in these areas. Inthe last year, o f a
 total o f 373 principal appointments, 67 were certified by the Bahia project, demonstrating an initial
 movement on the part o f the government toward valuing management skills and formalizing the principal
 appointment system. It is expected that the certification process will be formalized via legislation during
 Phase2.

 Teacher qualifications are also low: nearly 10 percent o f grade 1-4 and 60 percent o f grade 5-8 teachers
 do not have the minimumqualifications requiredby the National Education Law (LDB) which states that
 by 2007, primary teachers (1-4) must hold at least a normal school teaching certificate and lower

 of Brazil." June 1997.

Bahia Education Project (Phase Ii)                                                                            Page 5



secondary teachers (5-8) possess a teaching certificate and diploma in their area o f specialty. At the
secondary level, nearly83 percent lack the requireduniversity-levelteaching certificate.

Lack of relevance and low quality
Qualitative research conducted in Bahia3 has revealed that children and adolescents recognize the
connection between higher levels o f education and better jobs. Nonetheless, there is also a clear
disconnect betweenwhat is taught in the classroom and students' experience outside o f school, either at
home or inthe workplace. This lack o f relevance is a contributing factor to bothrepetition and dropout. In
a 1996 Living Standards S ~ r v e y23 percent o f poor 7-14 year olds and 41 percent o f poor 15-17 year
                                        , ~
olds who were out o f school cited "lack o f interest" as their main reason for not attending. While the
changing economy has led to increasing demand for education credentials, it has also increased the
number of low-pay, low educational employment opportunities, thereby increasing the opportunity cost
(especially for the poor) o f remaining in school. Secondary school students, whose profile includes a
diverse range o f age groups, interests, and work-study situations, should feel that their education is worth
the time and effort invested. Finally results from the student assessment conducted under Project 1
indicate that more than half o f fourth and eight grade students do not possess the minimumproficiency
levels in mathematics (53.2 and 54.4 percent). InPortuguese, 41.5 and 46.7 percent o f fourth and eighth
grade students do not meet the minimumproficiency levels.

Weak municipal-state system coordination and lack of schoolfocus
The presence o f a state education system and 417 municipal education systems without effective
coordination makes the administration of public schooling in Bahia unnecessarily inefficient in
responding to common challenges. These dual administrative systems often function inparallel making it
difficult to optimize resources, engendering inequality o f opportunities, and facilitating the practice of
politicalpatronage. Many municipal education secretaries and state-level officials do not see the school as
their primary client, serving instead other political agencies (such as the mayor, governor, or local
legislators). This lack o f focus on the school is reinforced by the highly centralized nature of state and
municipal systems. Centralized institutions determine all aspects o f policy, from curricular initiatives to
teacher training, and rarelypromote school level autonomy or initiative.

Inadequate physical inputs
The Bahia School Facilities Survey (BA-LSE 2001/02) demonstrated that none o f the 5,139 fundamental
cycle schools in the 100 poorest municipalities possessedthe minimum infrastructure or physical inputs
necessary to meet the state-defined minimum conditions for learning. Schools that are incomplete in any
one o f the essential elements for their category (based on the number o f students and classrooms) are
considered unable to provide children with the opportunity to learn. As indicated by 1999 SAEB results,
schools with inadequate physical inputs also tendto demonstrate much lower levels o f achievement.

Poverty relatedfactors
At the start o f Project 1 about 4.6 millionBrazilianyouths betweenthe ages of ten and seventeenworked
and attended school, while 2.7 million worked instead of attending school. Federal and state programs
such as the Bolsa Escola (Student Stipend) have helpedto increase attendance, but have not significantly
reduced the share o f children that work. Continued widespread poverty directly affects both student
performance and incentives to go to school, as parents compare the benefits o f an additional income
earner and household support against future gains from additional schooling (of marginal quality).

Government Stratew
Education has been among the Federal Government's top priorities in recent years. Federal efforts to
address long-standing issues in the education sector include: (a) amendment of the Constitution, and


  Portela e Bastos, "Educaqfo, Escola e Comunidade," 1997, Gurgel, "Ditos Sobre Sucesso Escolar" 1998 and Gurgel,
"Ditos Sobre Evasfo Escolar 1997. I'

passage o f a revolutionary education financing law (FUNDEF) designed to address inequities in
education funding by guaranteeing a minimum per-student expenditure across the nation for students in
grades 1-8; (b) passage o f the 1996 Education Law (LDB), which further defines government spheres o f
responsibility in the provision and financing o f education and establishes minimum pre-service training
qualifications for teachers; (c) direct transfer o f federal funds to schools, in an effort to increase school
autonomy and effectiveness; and (d) improvement o f education quality, through a national assessment
system (SAEB), a textbook quality and distribution improvement program, and national standards for
curriculumdevelopment, includingnew curricular guidelines for the secondary level.

The Government of Bahia is committed to raising educational quality and outcomes within the new
realities o f Brazilian education legislation and finance. The Government o f Bahia developed an ambitious
education program ("Educar para Vencer") with the objective o f providing all Bahians with access to
quality basic education. The program has six main lines o f action, as follows: (a) correction o f student
flow, reducing the age-grade distortion from 68 to 34 percent; (b) teacher development, through distance
education and training; (c) professionalization o f education management by way o f certification o f school
principals and teachers interested in management; (d) establishment o f minimum operation standards for
schools; (e) redefinition o f the State Government's role within the education sector as a provider o f
technical and managerial assistance to all schools (both state and municipal); and (0training o f municipal
secretaries o f education to manage their schools in an effective manner. The Bahia Education Program
focuses on some o f these actions, as well as the cornerstone effort o f the government's poverty alleviation
strategy: Faz Cidadao (described inC.2).

Inaccordance with the guidelines ofthe LDB,responsibility for preschooleducationandthe initial grades
o f the fundamental cycles (grades 1-4) are gradually being transferred to municipalities. To support
municipal systems in their new responsibilities, SEC has provided training and support for municipal
secretariats in 271 municipalities (of a total of 417) by means o f the Municipal Secretariat Management
Training Program. The State Government of Bahia has also put considerable effort into expanding access
at the primary level, since 1998 an average o f 500,000 new school places are offered each year. At the
secondary level 23 new model schools will have been inaugurated by the end o f 2002, providing places
for 33,120 students.

3. Sector issuesto be addressed bv the Droeram and stratepic choices
The main sector issues addressedby the Bahia EducationProgramunder both Phases 1and 2 include: (a)
reducing repetition and dropout through improvements in school quality; (b) meeting the increased
demand for secondary education; (c) improving educational management; and (d) targeting the poor. For
a detailed description o f how Project 2 follows from Project 1please see section C.2.

Quality
Improvement inthe quality and relevance o f schooling is essential for creating an environment for student
success. The Bahia EducationProgramembraces the notion that school autonomy accompanied by strong
community involvement in schools is the best avenue to improve school quality. As a result, secondary
and primary school quality are addressed principally through the promotion o f a School Development
Process (PDE) and the financing o f direct school grants to increase autonomy and efficiency. This
approach addresses the repeated lack o f relevance o f centrally-designed investments while making
schools more purposeful institutions. By means o f direct school grants, schools are able to acquire inputs
and materials and enhance human resources. In addition, the state supports investments in state and
municipal fundamental cycle schools in order to bring them up to minimum operational standards' in

'Theminimum
~~




                    operational standards model functions as a checklist that specifies the essential inputs and human
resources needed for schools to function and offer children the opportunity to learn. Schools are surveyed usingthis
checklist, and then investments needed to bring each school up to standard are specified and costed out. This model is
also being used inthe Salvador metropolitan microregion as part o f the FUNDESCOLA program.

Bahia EducationProject(Phase II)                                                                         Page 7



terms o f basic inputs and infrastructure: prerequisites for children to have the opportunity to leam at
school. Finally, the program supports shorter-term efforts to reduce age-grade distortion and dropout
through special "accelerated classes," designed to give multiple repeaters the extra help needed to "catch
up))to their peers.

Access
As discussed above, Brazil implementedthe FUNDEF in 1998, which guarantees a minimuminvestment
per fundamental cycle student. One outcome of this policy has beenthe shift o f significant resources from
the state to the municipal level, as more fundamental cycle schools fall under municipal administration.
Though this change has strengthened chronically under-funded municipal fundamental cycle schools,
there is widespread concern about fundingsecondary education. The Bahia Education Programaddresses
both the growing demand for access to secondary school and the unequal and inefficient distribution o f
the supply o f secondary school places. Three strategies are usedinBahia Program: (a) reorganization of
existing school places and a more accurate determination o f the need for additional space; (b) expansion
o f existing schools and classrooms; and (c) new school construction. Expanding secondary access
increase educational opportunities for poorer populations, irrespective o f their geographical location as:
(a) wealthier regions have more private schools, leaving public school places to lower income groups; and
(b) inpoorer areas where there are no private schools, school places tendto be occupiedbyhigher income
groups.

Management
School effectiveness research suggests that the educational environment has a significant impact on
student achievement. An effective educational management system provides: (a) clear standards for
schools; (b) strong support systems that assist schools in achieving these standards; (c) consistent and
objective assessmento f schools; and (d) consequences (good and bad) for schools which achieve or fail to
meet their targets. The Bahia Education Program promotes effective management of the school system
with the aim of elevating overall quality, equity, and efficiency. The key areas o f action are: (a) increased
accountability through the extension o f a school-level student assessment system and (b) improved
mechanisms for selection, recruitment, and training o f education managers at all levels. Finally, assisting
municipalities to increase their capacity to manage education has become an important role for the
secretariat o f Education, a role that i s heavily supported through the Educarpara Veneerprogram.

Poverty
Education investments in Bahia have consistently met with difficulties in attending to the poor. This
program breaks this tradition o f under-investmentinthe poor by: (a) focusing significant investments in
the 100 poorest municipalities; (b) investing in special programs ("accelerated classes") for overage
children with a history o f school failure, among which poor children are disproportionately represented. A
more complete analysis o f the social and poverty issues particular to Bahia and how this program
addressesthem can be found inAnnex 11.The program design and choice o f sector issues also takes into
account several federally-sponsored programs from which Bahia is currently benefiting. The most
important o f these are the World Bank-financed FUNDESCOLA program, which focuses on
improvement o f education quality at the fundamental cycle level, and the Inter-American Bank-financed
Escola Jovem project, which i s supporting curricular reform and the expansion o f access at the secondary
level. A table summarizing the sector issues to be addressedby each project is presented below.

Considerable care has been taken to avoid duplication and ensure complementarity across projects. The
proposedprogram, for example, does not address expansion o f access to the fundamental cycle, as it was
determinedthat this needwas adequately coveredthrough ongoing efforts by the SEC, municipalities, and
the federal government both separate from and in conjunction with the FUNDESCOLA program. Both
the proposedBahia Education Program and the EscolaJovemProject are investinginaccess to secondary
schooling; however, demand for secondary is believed to justify this level of investment and Bahia has
agreed to coordinate both projects by targeting them for distinct geographic areas. Whereas both
FUNDESCOLA and the proposed program are promoting school autonomy through the use o f PDE,

Bahia EducationProject (Phase Ii)                                                                      Page 8



FUNDESCOLA initially covers only fundamental schools inthe Salvador metropolitan region, while the
Bahia Education Program targets fundamental cycle schools in the 100 poorest municipalities as well as
secondary schools. The use o f similar methodology and instruments should simplify project
implementation for the SEC, while testing the strategy in widely different geographic and institutional
settings shouldprovide valuable feedback as to its strengths, limitations, andpossibilities o f expansion.




4. Programdescription
The Bahia Education Program consists of complementary strategies designed to improve school quality
and outcomes, expand equitable access to secondary education, improve systemmanagement, and address
longstanding inequities in educational opportunities. As described above, these strategies include: (a)
focused attention on school conditions inpoor municipalities; (b) promotion o f the School Development
Plan (PDE) and School Improvement Grants (PMEs) as the main instruments for improving school
autonomy; (c) the promotion o f accelerated classes, to diminish age-grade distortion in the fundamental
cycle; (d) use o f microplanning to maximize use o f existing space and as a pre-requisite to additional
building; and (e) promoting greater school focus and accountability in system management through the
use o f planning tools, performance contracts, recruitment standards and objective evaluation information.

Through Project 1, the Government o f Bahia: (a) provided minimum operation standards to schools in
poor municipalities; (b) designed and tested establishment o f School Improvement Plans (PDE) in
primary schools, secondary schools, and regional offices; (c) initiated the provision o f secondary school
places through reorganization of the system and some initial construction o f classrooms and schools; and
(d) designed and implementedinterventions to enhance system management (i.e. system-wide assessment
o f students; selection, training, and certification o f school leaders).

Through Project 2, the Government o f Bahia will: (a) expand the implementation o f PDEs in schools; (b)
expand the provision of secondary school places; and (c) consolidate the student assessment and
leadership certification systems initiated in Project 1. The following table summarizes the activities
completedunder Project 1and those to be implemented under Project 2.

C. Project Description Summary6

1.Project components (see Annex 2 for adetailed descriptionandAnnex 3 for adetailed costbreakdown)
1.Improving School Quality
1.1Assuring minimum operational standqrdsfor schools
Through Project 1 the state has ensuredminimumoperational standards for 184 state and 192 municipal
fundamental cycle schools located in the 100 poorest municipalities through a transfer o f resources for
small repairs. Inaddition, by March 2003 the Project will have delivered school equipment to 187 state



  This Project Description Summary refers to the investments planned under Project 2 of the APL. InAnnex 2, the
activities for the full APL Program(that is, Project 1 and2) are described.

Bahia Education Project (Phase II)                                                                     Page 10



and 3,7 17 municipal fundamental cycle schools. Project 2 will complete this process by delivering
equipment and furniture to an additional 2,100 classrooms inthe state o f Bahia.

1.2 Supporting the implementation of School DevelopmentPlans (PDE)
Under Project 1, a team composed o f SEC personnel, municipal education staff, and outside consultants
have beentrained to guide the implementation of the PDE process. These teams have worked with school
principals, central, and regional administrative staff throughout the PDE process and have been
responsible for: (a) training o f selected school staff inthe elaboration o f the PDE; (b) mobilization o f the
school and community; and (c) evaluation and monitoring o f the implementation o f the PDE. The PDE
process benefits both fundamental and secondary schools. Project 1 supported 2,500 schools in
developing their PDE plans; Project 2 will continue to support these schools.

1.3 Financing SchoolImprovement Projects (PME)
School Improvement Projects (PME) are developed from the completed PDEs. The PMEs are submitted
to a forum o f technical educational authorities for evaluation, andifapproved, the school receives a direct
transfer o f funds to develop its project. In Project 1 404 public fundamental cycle schools and 537
secondary schools received a transfer for their PME project. It is expected that under the second project
493 fundamental cycle and 638 secondary schools will receive a PME transfer. The amount o f the transfer
depends on the number o f students inthe school (see Annex 2 for details).

1.4 Implementing Accelerated Classes
The implementation o f a broad program o f "accelerated" or "catch up" classes for over-age children in
grades 1-8 is a key policy o f the current government. This priority i s consistent with the findings o f a
2000 World BanWIDB study on secondary education in Brazil. In Bahia, the first Project financed the
implementation o f the program in 279 municipalities (9,281 classes). Through Project 2 an estimated
18,000 classeswill be implemented, benefiting students throughout Bahia.

1.5 Expanding Gestar
Gestar is a curriculum and in-service teacher training program developed by Fundescola and aligned with
the new National Curriculum Parameters. Included in this project as an immediate response to the low
student performance identified by the state assessment, Gestar provides practical, usable materials and
training to improve teacher practice inmathematics and Portuguese. The Project will expand the program
to some 6,000 teachers in65 municipalities.

1.6 ImprovingIndigenous Education
Seeking to improve the quality o f teaching and learning in indigenous communities, the second Bahia
project will finance the construction o f six classrooms, the establishment o f minimum operational
standards in38 classrooms, and distribution o f teaching and learning materials to students and teachers in
38 schools (see Annex 11 for more information).

2. ExpandingAccess
2.1 Planning andproviding additional schoolplaces
Inorder to ensure the articulationandoptimaluse ofexisting state, municipal, andprivateresources and
facilities, the state conducted a supplyldemand analysis exercise and, based on the results, financed a
structural reorganization o f the secondary school system. New classroom and school construction has
been undertaken only when revealed as absolutely necessary through the reorganization process.
Structural reorganization o f the system provided 52,7 12 additional places within existing facilities in
2001. Project 2 intends to continue to expand secondary school places through the construction o f 104
additional secondary school classrooms inunderservedareas.

3. Strengthening Educational Management
3.1 Strengthening Educational Assessment
Under project auspices, the SEC initiated the development of an assessment system (Performance
Evaluation Program). This system follows the SAEB model, but allows for school-level analysis. The
system covers all urban schools within the state system (with 4' and 8" grades) and has been offered for
voluntary participation to municipal schools. Project 1 has financed system development and the initial
applications o f the exam (2001). InNovember 2002, 2,911 schools in 273 municipalities participated in
the state assessment(approximately 305,000 students).

In addition to the annual student evaluation, the Bahia Project supported a Continuous Assessment
Program, whereby three times a year tests were distributed to lower primary teachers (Grades 1-4) to use
intheir classroomlessons. Participatingteachers also received a rubric and sample lesson plans basedon
the materials inthe test. Intotal 2,783 fundamental cycle schools participatedinthe program under Phase
1. It is expected that some 4,000 schools will participateinthe program under Phase2.

3.2 Institutiona1strengthening of Educationa1Management
Recognizing its role as a source o f technical assistance to the entire education system both municipal
                                                                                              -
and state -the SEC and its regional offices (DIRECs) are inthe process o f reorienting their mission away
from administrative supervision and toward fi-ont-line technical support to state schools and municipal
secretariats serving under-performing schools. For this purpose, all 33 DIRECs have prepared Regional
Education Development Plans (PDD). These PDD plans are complementary to the school-based PDEs
and identify activities to be implementedto meet the goals o f such regional plans. Project 1 financed the
preparation o f the PDD and a first transfer o f funds to DIRECs for the implementation o f the activities
described in their plan. Project 2 will monitor the implementation o f these plans and provide technical
assistance to DIRECs for achieving the goals they set for themselves inthe PDD plans.

Inan effort to upgrade the quality and commitment of educationmanagers at the school level, SEC has
designed and implemented a new system o f school principal certification. This system includes: (a)
minimum academic qualifications for school principals; (b) a standardized exam to assess school
leadership skills o f all current and potential school principals; (c) leadership training accompanied by a
series o f tests; (d) certification upon successful completion o f training; and (e) periodic re-certification to
ensure updated skills. Investments under Project 1 established the certification system and resulted in
9,000 trainees (1,135 o f which were certified). Project 2 seeks to train more than 20,000 school staff
members (including principals, specialists, pedagogical coordinators, literacy teachers and school
secretaries).

Inorder to expand schoolautonomyfor schools withdemonstratedmanagementcapacitythe project will
pilot a program to transfer all non-salary resources to secondary schools. The amount o f the transfer will
follow the PME amounts and will include resources for payment o f recurrent expenditures (electricity,
water, etc.) as well as small repairs and equipment purchases. This pilot i s not financed by the Bank loan
but is part o fthe project as the government requested the Bank's technical assistance andmonitoringand
evaluation.

Project 1 provided support to finalize the implementation o f SIIG (a school system level software
program developed under the Northeast Projects). As the state moves the focus o f its efforts ever closer to
providing support to schools, Project 2 will support the delivery o f federally-developed school-level
software systems SAEMEC and SIDE. These school-level systems will be deliveredand implementedin
 1,000 state schools.

3.3 Financingproject management
The SEC (through COPE) i s responsible for the administration o f the project. The project finances those
COPE operating costs and consultant expenditures directly relatedto project activities.

3.4 Project monitoring and impact evaluation
The SEC is responsible for monitoring o f the project. To do this task, the project will finance institutional
development activities to be conducted at the State-level in order to assess the ways in which the project
is fitting into the larger state development strategy. Workshops, training, and studies are part o f this
coordinated effort. For the impact evaluation, SEC will commission studies to evaluate the mid-term
progress and final impact o f the project. (See Annex 2 for additional information)

2. Kev policv and institutionalreforms sumorted bv the Dropram
The Bahia EducationProgramhas beendesignedto support federal and state government programs and to
assist education management at the municipal and state levels in meeting the requirements o f recent
national legislation. Relevant reforms include:

LDB
Brazil's 1996 Education Law stimulates innovation and initiative on the part o f educational agents in
order to avoid excessive bureaucratization, gives priority to primary education, and strengthens the role o f
the municipality in the provision o f grades 1-8. Clearly outlining the responsibilities and roles o f each
division o f government, the LDB has been an important step inclarifying accountability and settinghigh
standards at all levels o f education. The Bahia Education Program supports implementation of the LDB

Bahia Education Project (Phase II)                                                                   Page 13



through its efforts to improve state and municipal cooperation and management, as well as support o f
increased state responsibility inthe provision and financing o f secondary education.

FUNDEF
The FUNDEF, approved by the National Congress inDecember o f 1996, established January 1998 as the
startingpoint for national FUNDEFimplementationwithin each state. The FUNDEF sets up fixedcriteria
for allocating funds with the aim o f raising standards o f opportunity, quality, and equity of education.
Instrumental inassuring equitable resources among and betweenmunicipal and state systems, in2002 the
FUNDEF guaranteed R$418 for each grade 1-4 student and R$440for each grade 5-8 grade student.By
working directly with the 100 poorest municipalities in Bahia (those for whom the FUNDEF has
dramatically increased educationfunding), the proposed program should help ensure that newly available
resources for fundamental cycle educationare used to best effect.

School Autonomy and Accountability
Federal education policy over the last few years has emphasized increased autonomy for schools,
manifest in the direct transfer o f federal resources to schools begun in 1995. Concurrently, the federal
government has financed and implemented a state-of-the art system for assessing student achievement
across the nation. The Bahia Education Program extends these strategies to the state level, through PDE
process and financing o f school grants, as well as the development o f a school-level assessment system to
complement the national sample-based one.

New Federal Curricular Guidelinesfor SecondaryEducation
In 1998, the federal government issued new curricular guidelines for secondary education. These
guidelines end the traditional division between "academic" and "technical" education, emphasizing the
need for a single, basic-skills oriented track at the secondary level. While 75 percent o f the curricular
content i s given in the guidelines, the remaining 25 percent i s to be defined by individual schools, in
accordance with the needs and interests o f their clientele. Through support for the PDE process at the
secondary level and expansion o f Gestar at the primary level, the program should help schools better
assess these needs andrefine their curriculum, improving overall relevance for students.

Development Integration in the State of Bahia
The Bahia Education Program supports the State o f Bahia in deepening its integrated strategy for
development, by monitoring its actions and impact vis a vis such strategy, and by providing some
resources to conduct work targeted at promoting and expanding such integrated strategy.

Faz Cidadio!
The Bahia Education Program supports the Bahia State Government Program, Faz Cidadiio! to achieve
its objectives ineducation inthe 100 poorest municipalities. The objectives o f the program are to improve
the living conditions and create additional income opportunities for the least developed municipalities in
Bahia, creating self-sustainable communities by means o f local development. The programfurther aims to
increase the well-being o f the citizens o f the selected municipalities through the improvement in social
services, especially in the areas o f education, health, public safety, employment, infrastructure, and
agriculture. Selection criteria for the 100 municipalities was based on a social and economic index similar
to that o f the UNHuman Development Index and conducted by the Bahia Department o f Economic and
Social Studies (SEI).

3. Benefits and target population
The principal beneficiaries o f the Bahia Education Program are: (a) fundamental cycle students in both
state and municipal schools within poor municipalities, who are either inor enteringschool between2000
and 2006 inBahia (approximately 500,000 students); (b) students ingrades 1-8 instate schools who have
a history o f repetition, and who will benefit from accelerated classes (approximately 330,000 students);
and (c) students in or entering state secondary schools from 2000 to 2006 in Bahia (approximately 1
million students). These young people will benefit from an education system endowed with an increased

Bahia Education Project (Phase II)                                                                   Page 14



number of school places, adequate learning materials, autonomous schools, and more effective
management at all administrative levels. Both municipal and state primary and secondary systems will
realize the benefits o f improvedmanagement, including: greater efficiency inresource allocation, demand
drivencurriculum design and professionaldevelopment, a shift inaccountability to the local community,
capacity to innovate and anticipate change, and greater professionalism.

4. Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

The implementation arrangements that are in place for Phase 1 will continue into Phase 2. The Bahia
Education Program is expected to be implemented over a 5 year period, from April 2001 (Project 1
effectiveness) through July 2006 (Project 2 closing). Project 1 i s expected to close in June 2003, while
Project 2 will likely become effective in July 2003. The program will continue to be subject to regular
evaluations every six months; an intense evaluation is being completed in anticipation o f the end of the
first project inorder to evaluate progress on implementation and assess performance triggers.

The state SEC is the principal executing agency for the program. As executing agent, SEC receives
financing for program administration. SEC's main responsibilities include: (a) financial oversight o f the
program; (b) coordination with line departments, regional offices and external agencies responsible for
program activities; (c) coordination with municipal governments participating in the program; and (d)
overall monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure program quality and effectiveness. For the civil
works component, SUCAl3, the state civil works agency, has primary executing responsibilities and
oversees the contractors performingthe construction. For the student assessmentcomponent, a unitwithin
the Federal University o f Bahia (UFBA)has beenproviding technical assistance. The SEC also contracts
out the implementation o f certain activities such as the school staffcertification program.

SEC has developed a Project ImplementationPlan (PIP) for each o f the program phases that describes the
operational guidelines to address the above implementation responsibilities. The PIP is accompanied by
an operationalmanual for school constructionwhich provides guidelines for the civil works component o f
the Project. At the core of SECs strategy is COPE, a program implementation unit which has the
incentives to: (a) integrate program activities within the wider array o f SEC activities and projects, and
(b) enhance andutilize the capacity of line units and external agenciesto implementprogram activities.

Overall responsibility for program implementation will continue to rest with COPE. COPE is also
responsible for other ongoing donor supported projects within the SEC (e.g. Escola Jovem,
FUNDESCOLA), and thus will play an important role in ensuring the complementarity and coordination
o f activities across projects.

Responsibility for program financial management rests with a designated financial management unit
under the supervision o f COPE. A similar arrangement is exists for the procurement unit.Responsibility
for program activities is delegated to technical coordinators who work directly with the SEC line units or
external agencies (e.g. private firms, NGOs, universities) assigned to actually implement activities.
Technical coordinators play a key role inmonitoringquality, trouble shooting implementation issues, and
ensuring that project resources are applied effectively. Finally, SEC uses performance agreements as a
key instrument to ensure accountability. Under the PDD sub-component, each DIREC has signed a
performance agreement with SEC. Under the PDE and certification sub-components, SEC is signing
performance agreements with school directors. Finally, in those cases when municipal schools are too
small to adequately implement the MinimumStandards for rehabilitation, the correspondingmunicipality
i s responsible for doing so and has signedan agreement with the SEC.

D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered andreasonsfor rejection
Continuing current design versus re-conceptualizingtheproject
The current design has proven to deliver the outputs and outcomes that were intended. Additionally, a
visible build up o f the technical capacity at the Education Secretariat is clearly observable as an
externality o f the project implementation and design. As a result, and given the Secretariat's
implementation capacity and experience, re-conceptualizing the project design was rejected as an option
for phase 11.
APL versus TraditionalProject Design
The Bahia Education Program was originally conceived along traditional project lines. Two factors led
the project team to seek a more flexible project instrument. The first factor was the relatively untested
implementation capacity o f the SEC in Bahia. Although the SEC participated in Bank-financed projects
(Northeast Basic Education 111, and currently FUNDESCOLA 2), this was the first state-level Bank-
financed project in education for Bahia. The lower level o f exposure and more flexible sequencing o f the
APL made it an appealing choice. The second factor was the financial uncertainty facing Brazil as a
whole, and the federal government's understandable caution regarding the amount o f debt (as guarantor)
it is carrying at any one time. Under the APL design, both state and federal governments loweredinitial
exposure and commitment fees, and have now moved forward to request additional funds only as
implementation and performance triggers have beenmet.

Poverty TargetingDemand versusSupply
The program's approach to targeting is primarily a geographic one and is also supply-side oriented. The
program works with the 100 poorest municipalities, investing in school inputs and planning processes.
Other alternatives considered addressedthe demand side o f access. One promisingstrategy to attract and
maintain poor children in school i s the bolsa escola program. This federal program provides stipends to
families o f eligible fundamental cycle children so long as they are enrolled in school (though monitoring
o f attendance has proved nearly impossible). Given these existing efforts, it was decided to keep the
BahiaEducation Programfocused on improving the supply-sideof the educationequation.

Quality
Alternatives for improving the quality o f basic schooling for all included: (a) establishment o f a
completely bottom-up school-driven method for determining needs and resources; and (b) implementation
of a entirely top-down model in order to ensure effective control at the state level. The fully bottom-up
alternative was rejected based on the evaluation o f capacity at the school and system level that indicated
that school principals are not yet politically or technically capable o f adequately expressing and rapidly
attaining their needs for school inputs within the structure o f the current system. High levels of control
and centralized management at the state level would further preclude school principals from effectively
ensuring the best interests o f the child.

The second altemative o f a completely top-down method for ensuring school quality was rejected as prior
project experience and education sector evaluations have demonstrated that local interests need to be
considered in order to ensure effective implementation and use. Inthe case o f school inputs, definition o f
minimumstandards at the state level, followed by a school-by school survey, will help to guarantee that
school needs are met while reducing costs due to mass purchase and distribution. Curriculum reform was
also rejected as the state has already made efforts in this area in accordance with the recently launched
national curricular parameters.

Teacher developmentand compensation
An explicit teacher training initiative is not considered in the project as Bahia's teachers are benefiting
from training through the ProformaGEo Project (financed by FUNDESCOLA), through the IDB-financed
Escola Jovem Project, and other state-wide initiatives financed by the State o f Bahia. Nonetheless, the
project indirectly does provide resources for teacher development through two main mechanisms: (a) the

Bahia EducationProject (Phase II)                                                                     Page 16



PDE, which can include teacher training activities, and (b) the Accelerated Classes, which rely onteacher
training, supervision, and support for their success. Nonetheless, immediate tools for teachers interms o f
implementation of the new curriculum parameters is included in the project under Gestar. Interms o f
teacher compensation, the recent implementation of FUNDEF has strongly modified the structure and
level o f teacher compensation inBahia (as well as in Brazil as a whole). Inthis regard, the Bank's role
over the coming years should focus on the development o f knowledge and analysis o f data to assess the
success or failure o f FUNDEF's intervention and its effect onteachers.

Access
Alternatives for the provision o f additional secondary school places included reorganization o f the
existing system without allowance for additional school places, and construction o f school places without
microplanning. The first o f these was rejected as it was determined that reorganization o f the existing
structure would not be sufficient to ensure equitable access for all. Construction o f additional school
places is to be contingent upon the results o f microplanning as technical criteria in school construction
(based on area o f coverage, population density, and inaccordance with existing school specifications) has
been o f secondary priority in educational planning. Transparent placement of schools and school
expansionhas helped minimize the politickingthat has traditionally accompanied school construction.

Management
Several alternative approaches to management reformwere considered. First, an input intensive approach,
focusing on administrative infrastructure was examined. SEC and its district offices are relatively well-
equipped with modern communications, information management, and transportation facilities, thus
additional investments would add little value. Second, a capacity building approach focused entirely on
SEC staff, a strategy employed in past Bank supported projects was deemed inappropriate given SEC's
programmatic emphasis on decentralizing greater resources and autonomy to schools and regional
authorities. Focus, therefore, was needed on building management and leadership skills among local
managers and school leaders. A third alternative was to focus institutional strengthening interventions
entirely on state organizations and personnel. However, as SEC reorients its role toward overall
responsibility for quality across the state and municipal systems, it was recognized that the success o f the
state system would depend highly upon the management capacity o f municipal governments to deliver
highquality education at the primary level. To that end, efforts to improve inter-system coordination and
to create incentives for municipal governments to reach higherstandardso f service delivery are viewed as
essential to creating apublic system that functions inan integrated, effective manner.

Other EducationLevels
Preschoolprograms
The LDB establishes that preschool education is primarily the responsibility of municipal governments.
The importance of preschool education programs and their impact on future student success have been
 examined in Brazil and other countries and cannot be overlooked. Before embarking on a state-wide
initiative for this sub-sector, however, it is important to learn from the municipal experiences that the
Bank is evaluating inother regions o f Brazil.

Adult education
The costs associated with adult education, in terms o f developing facilities, training, and hiring of
teachers and income foregone are very high. This project is based on the government's affirmation that
provisiono f quality basic educationto all children is o f highest priority. Furthermore, the ongoing success
 o f AJABAHIA, an adult literacy program, precluded the needfor further investment.

Higher education
 The option of including higher education as an alternative for project investment was explored in two
 ways: (a) as a possible sub-sector o f investment, and (b) as a sub-sector where control or reduction o f
 investment is promoted such that overall macroeconomic and fiscal adjustment is achieved without
 affecting investment in fundamental and secondary education. Investment in higher education was

  discarded as it does not directly respond to the priority given to poverty alleviation, the chief target of
  Bank support for social development. As outlined in the CAS, regional development, especially in the
  Northeast, is to be focused on early childhood development, primary, and secondary education.

  3. Lessonslearned and reflectedinthe prowam design
  Following the lessons learned from the design and implementation process o f the Northeast Basic
  Education Projects (NEBE 2, FY1993, Loan 3604-BR and NEBE 111, FY1994, Loan 3663-BR), prior
  Bank experience in Brazil including EDURURAL, FY1980, Loan 1867-BR), sector work, and other
  intemational experience, the Bahia Education Program incorporates those aspects that were successful in
  achieving their intended objectives, avoiding those aspects that, upon evaluation, were deemed
  incomplete or unattainable. Of special value have been the lessons learned in the implementation o f the
  phase Io f the Bahia Education Program. More specifically, the project reflects the following lessons:

  Institutional CapacityBuilding
  The recent implementation track record of the Secretariat o f Education of the State o f Bahia with the
  phase 1 o f this project is a success story. Through very close supervision and technical assistance from
  the Bank and a strong ownership at the technical and political levels inthe State, the Secretariat was able
  to tum around an wide-spread image o f inefficientbureaucracy andheavy politization. Capacity building
  from the Bank came inthe form o f a Bank Task team that acted as an outside consultant to the Secretariat,
  and a critical friend to its leadership. Such positioning allowed the Bank team to maintain independence
  while developing close-knit relationships of trust. The leadership o f the SEC was persuaded of the
  importance o f assembling a professional, competitively selected team for the implementation o f the
  project. This step immediately reported gains, as project activities moved efficiently and successfully and
  ultimatelyinfluenced other areas o f the Secretaria. O f course, at the center of this impressivetum-around

Bahia EducationProject (Phase II)                                                                        Page 18



was the commitment o f the political leadership o f the State and o f the Secretariat o f Education, and the
continuous support provided by the Bank on consulting, training, and monitoringthe process.

School Autonomy
The choice o f school autonomy as a main strategy for improvingthe quality o f education is supported by
international experience in numerous countries, including Chile, Uruguay. These countries, as well as
others in Latin America, have promoted school projects for the procurement o f context-appropriate
materials and increasing stakeholder and community input. Also, the Colombian PACES program
promoted school autonomy by paving the way for direct transfer o f funds to secondary schools. These
lessons are reflected inthe design o f the PDE/PME process.

Minimum Operational Standards
The inclusion o f the concept of minimum operational standards for schools within the federal
FUNDESCOLA project has proven a useful and concrete tool to address long-standing educational
inequities. These standards have set an important precedent and are currently being adopted by many
states inBrazil. The inclusion of a minimumoperational standards component within the Bahia Education
Program reflects the lessons learned to date from the implementation o f FUNDESCOLA and are in line
with the state's currentparticipation inthat project.

Accelerated Classesfor grades 5-8
One o f the main findings from the recent Brazil Secondary Education Study, "Time to Move Forward,"
was the critical agelgrade distortion inNortheast states and inBahia inparticular. This large distortion is a
result o f highrepetition rates and the existence o f large numbers o f children who are caught in a cycle o f
serial repetition. The inclusion o f accelerated classes as an intervention to address this problem is based
on successful experiences implemented elsewhere inBrazil (e.g., Ssio Paulo, Paranh, and others).

Night Schools
The importance o f addressing specific needs o f night school students was also highlighted in the
secondary study cited above. Night school students are frequently older, employed, and may have rich
experiences inthe workplace that complement formal education. Although the Bahia Education Program
has no specific night school focus, it will address this issue by tailoring the PDEPME process inpublic
secondary schools to respondto the special needs o f night school students.

Student assessment
Experiences inChile, England, the UnitedStates and a host o f other countries have illustratedthe benefits
o f school-level assessment. Based on the successful federal SAEB experience, the Bahia Education
Program will support the implementation o f a continuous assessment systemthrough which the state will
increase accountability to regional offices, municipalities and schools. This assessment system will
provide schools with the necessary information to adjust and enhance their teaching practices based on
the areas ofmajor weakness. International and Federal lessons inthis regards have beenkey inthe design
o f this Program activity. It will also supply state and regional managers with the informationthey need to
more precisely target additional resources andsupport to low performingschools.

4. Indicationsof borrower commitment and ownershk
As discussed at greater length in Section B.2 o f this document, the Government of Bahia is committed to
improving educational quality and outcomes, as indicated byrecent efforts inbothprimary and secondary
education and an excellent implementation record under Phase 1. Over the last few years, the state
government o f Bahia has consistently spent above the constitutionally required minimum in government
education receipts. State efforts have included: (a) expansion o f access at the fundamental and secondary
levels; (b) increased municipal-state collaboration; (c) the initiation o f "accelerated classes" to address
age-grade distortions; (d) initiation o f state-level evaluation testing; and (e) promotion o f greater parental
and community involvement inschooling through the formation o f school councils. The best assuranceo f

Bahia Education Project (Phase ti)                                                                   Page 19



borrower commitment to the Bahia Education Program is that it has been designed to support and build
uponmany o f the state's own strategies and actions.

Further indications of Borrower ownership include broad-based participation inproject preparation, and
the implementation o f an internal SEC administrative reform to better align line' departments with the
strategies and activities proposed. Project preparation has benefited from the involvement o f working
groups within the SEC, as well as from the involvement and support o f the Secretaries o f Planning and
Finance, and outside actors such as universities and NGOs.

5. Value added of Bank support in this proiect


Informed Cooperation
As the chief external financing institution inthe area of basic education over the past ten years, the Bank
has had the opportunity o f developing a well-informed and close familiarity with the key educationissues.
More importantly, over the last few years it has built up a fluent dialogue with the leading education
authorities and institutions o f Brazil. This dialogue has grown despite the presence o f ideological
differences between a number o f the key actors. The Bank has been able to play the role o f "honest
broker" and "critical friend" in policy dialogue, and provide the continuity and informed cooperation
necessary to support the implementation o f both development projects and policy reform. The Bank has
further played an important role in gathering a wide variety of participants during project planning: the
log-frame exercise for the Bahia Education Program, for example, included the contribution o f more than
15 institutions, includinguniversities, NGOs, and various sectors o f government.

Local Knowledge
The Bank's information base is particularly strong with regard to educational issues in the Northeast.
Bank-initiated studies and reports such as "A Call to Action", the Secondary Education Study: "Time to
Move Forward", "Social Spending in Selected States", and "FinancingEducation in Brazil" have focused
on the Northeast, and especially Bahia as an area o f great educational need. Bank education and poverty
sector work have facilitated the identification o f poverty and regional imbalance issues, which have in
turn contributed to the Bahia Education Program's strategic choices. Experience working with Bahia
through federal projects such as Northeast Basic Education I11and FUNDESCOLA 1has giventhe Bank
a solid basis for project design. Through the preparation o f this program, the Bank has already been an
important support for the structuralreformof the SEC.

Innovation
Although World Bank-financed projects in Brazil differ from one another tremendously, all have
generated innovation. Examples include textbook development and student performance evaluation from
the Northeast Basic Education Projects, school strengthening in the Minas Gerais project, teacher
development and accelerated learning inSZo Paulo, and municipalization inParanh. Lessons learnedfrom
these innovations have contributed to the policy dialogue with Bahia, and the preparation o f the proposed
program. The Bank's ability to bringexperience it gathers from basic educationprojects in other countries
in the region (as well as elsewhere in the world), particularly with regard to the school development
process, would also provide a tremendous benefit to the Borrower. The analysis and inclusion o f
international reform experiences and best practice from such countries as Great Britain, Australia, New
Zealand, and El Salvador would further enrich the development o f the Bahia Education Program. The
Bank has the ability to serve as a conduit to current innovation and research results emerging from other
national and state systems aroundthe world.

E. SummaryProjectAnalysis (Detailed assessmentsare inthe project file, see Annex 8)

1. Economic(supported byAnnex 4)
Cost benefit (worst-case scenario) NPV=US$507 million; IRR= 21.25 %
Under-girdingthe Bahia Education Program's economic analysis is the fact that Bahia displays some of
the highest repetition and drop-out rates in Brazil. Low levels of educational attainment represent a
significant barrier to both increasing individual income and macroeconomic growth. High repetition and
dropout rates also translate into an elevated cost o f both primary and secondary education due to the high
number o f years o f schooling necessary to produce a graduate at either level o f education. Through
investingineducational inputs, school autonomy, the expansion of secondary schools, andthe adoption of
better management processes, the Bahia Education Program is attempting to get more children through
higher levelsofschooling at a lower per-graduate cost.

The economic analysis provides a cost-benefit analysis o f the project and a corresponding sensitivity
analysis for alternative scenarios. Before estimatingthe Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate o f
Retum (IRR) for the project as a whole, each separable component is appraised independently, inorder to
determine the marginal contribution o f eachto the overall project.

The cost-benefit analysis was undertaken in the following manner: (a) the costs were estimated; (b) the
secondary level flow model was estimated for the state system; (c) a flow model for the fundamental level
was estimated for both state and municipal systems; (d) a historical trend was applied for both flow
models, using the method introduced by Ruben Klein (1999), in order to determine how the flows o f
students would look without the project; (e) the impact o f the project on the flows was estimated to the
year 2007; (f) the number o f students that conclude each grade was predicted and the difference between
the flows with the project and without the project were determined; (g) given these differences, the out-
of-school benefits were calculated by using both the private rate o f return to each grade o f education and
the increment in productivity related to improvements in Math and Portuguese test scores; (h) in
performing the sensitivity analysis, the NPV and the IRR were calculated and tested' for different
scenarios.

Inthe calculation of the IRR and the NPV, the sensitivityanalysis considered nine possible scenarios
influencedby potential outcomes o f income flows and productivity growth. The IRR and NPV results are
as follows.




IRR-3% prod. Inc                  I 33,87%                                   I21,87%

                                                                                R$ 1,724,062,240
NPV - 3% prod. Inc                IIR$4,753,204,023                     16         1,823,412,787

                                                                                R$ 1,922,763,334


The IRR for all scenarios is satisfactory. Eveninthe worst scenario, the internal rate o f retum is greater
than the Bank's standard discount rate o f 10-12 percent, which indicates the capacity o f the project to
generate substantial benefits. Therefore, although the project does not yield enormous intemal rates o f
return (except from the best scenario, where the benefits might be overestimated), there is a high
probability that gains will be positive and significantly above the minimum requirement for investment
yield.

2. Financial(see Annex 5)
To assess the state's ability to provide counterpart funding and service the proposed debt, projections o f
each major itemof cash flow and of the stock o f debt were made. Both phases are included inthe analysis
included as part o f the Bahia Phase 1 PAD (2000-2006). The analysis included as part of Annex 5
addressesonly Phase2 (2002-2007).

The results o f these projections are summarized inthe table below. The current situation with the project
seems favorable as the margin for indebtedness is R$1.3 billion in2001, with estimates for 2002 at R$1.7
billion, showing that the project represents only a small fraction o f the total current state debt.
Nonetheless these projections (with a time horizonuntil2007) indicate negative margins inlater years o f
the projection (2002 onwards) indicate a deficit o f some R$500 million per year. These estimates are
somewhat conservative (and therefore pessimistic) as the calculations for Res. 43/01 include a ceiling on
thetotal net current revenue that the stateis projectedto carry. Giventhe current state economic situation
it is likely that this amount will grow, especially in light of new industries (and their accompanying
multiplier effects) that have beenestablished inBahia.

 Expenses with amortization and charges o f
 the unpaid debt or to be paid in the current

 Net debt amount cannot exceed 2 times the
 net current revenue (Chapter 7", 111)

 (1) Including social charges and excluding guaranties.


The projected Debt/GDP ratio for the period2002-2005 suggests a decreasing debt burdenthroughout the
years, as a result o f an increasingGDP growthrate and a diminishingstock o f debt.

As positive margins exist under Res. 43/01, in theory the state should have little difficulty providing
counterpart funding. Nonetheless, given the current uncertainty o f national and international political and
economic situations, these projections vary widely.        Despite the wide variety o f information and
conclusions made, there is a general consensus that Brazil's (and Bahia's) GDP will continue to grow and
external vulnerabilities will be reduced(due to a more favorable balance o f trade conditions) regardless o f
which govemment assumespower inJanuary.

3. Technical
The Government o f Bahia's education reform strategy i s supported by the World Bank through the
FUNDESCOLA program, the Bahia Education Program and by the IDB through the Escola Jovem
Project. This reform is aligned with those that have proven most successful internationally, that is,
supporting school autonomy, encouraging local participation, and providingeducational inputsto enhance
quality.

The decision to use a combined top down (centralized definitionof guidelines and provisiono f materials,
pedagogical tools) with a bottom-up approach (school development plans and grants) to improving school
quality is discussed at greater length in section D.l (Project Rationale).      The choice o f the School
Development Plan (PDE) as the primary means for improving school quality and management is based on
positive experiences in other countries, pilot projects in several Northeast states, and preliminary
experience with FUNDESCOLA 1.

Curriculum parameters for both secondary and primary education were recently revised and thoroughly
updated,bythe federal Ministry o f Education (MEC) for use by all schools in the country. Teacher and
staff development programs and education materials will be evaluated during project preparation and
implementation to ensure that they are consistent with these curricular parameters. Much of this
evaluation will be done duringthe course o fworking with schools on their PDE process.

Inclusion o f the "Accelerated Classes" program is supported by the positive experience of similar
approaches inthe State o f SBo Paul0 and inpilot programs nationwide. Evaluations have established that
children with a history o f repetition can succeed at school and even catch up to their peers when provided
with experienced and specially trained teachers, age-appropriate materials, and extra support and
attention. Because most o f these programs are recent, questions still remain regarding these children's
success once they are "mainstreamed" back into regular classes; this issue will be given particular
attention inproject evaluation.

Finally, the Secondary Education Study: Time to Move Forward (2000) provided key information to
guide project preparation and will be an important input for project implementation. This study contains
technical summaries o f efficient school investments; qualification and quantification o f the demand for
education and successful school practices inBrazil and specifically, inBahia.

4. Institutional
4.1 Executing agencies:
For the civil works component, SUCAB, the state civil works agency, has primary executing
responsibilities and oversees the contractors performing the construction. For the student assessment
component, a unit within the Federal University o f Bahia (UFBA) has been providing technical
assistance. The SEC also contracts out the implementation o f certain activities such as the school staff
certification program. Eacho f these agencies met their responsibilities under Phase 1.

4.2 Project management:
The SEC Bahia is the principal executing agency for the program. SEC's main responsibilities include:
(a) financial oversight o f the program; (b) coordination with line departments, regional offices and
external agencies responsible for program activities; (c) coordination with municipal governments
participating in the program; and (d) overall monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure program
quality and effectiveness.

4.3 Procurement issues:
The Project implementationwill require procurement of works, goods, hiringo f consultants and training
activities. These activities will be carried out primarily by the Comisscodas LicitacGesda COPE at SEC.

procurement. All these entities are familiar with the procurement under Bank-financed projects and work
closely with COPE.

The COPE will be responsible for the overall project procurement activity, including compliance with
procedures and timetables agreed with the Bank. COPE will retain at least three procurement specialists
inorder to carry out their supervisory responsibilitiesandto assistthe other implementingunits.

4.4 Financial management issues:
CoordenagEo de Projeto Educacionais - COPE, which is the Central Coordination o f Project
Implementation, is well organized in terms o f having staff capable to respond to project implementation
demands. COPE has a Financial Coordination Unit, which i s staffed with 4 accounting technicians, and a
financial manager i s already on board to carry out the financial management responsibilities. The Staff is
familiar with the Bank financial and disbursementprocedures.

The project is the second phase o f the Bahia Education Adjustable Program Loan (APL), which seeks to
assist the Government o f Bahia in its effort to improve the educational system and respond to the
demands and needs o f the Bahian population. The program complements numerous Government actions
and focuses on improving fundamental and secondary school quality, increasing access to secondary
schools, and improving system management. The first phase o f the 4.5-year (APL) was U S $ l l 6 million
extended over 2.5 years, while the second phase is expected to disburse US$100 million over 3 years.

Most activities to be financed by the second phase are a natural continuation o f those to be financed in
Project I. development objectives o f the Bahia EducationProject are to: (a) improve fundamental and
               The
secondary school outcomes, as measured by improvements in dropout and promotion rates and student
performance on standardized tests; and (b) increase access to secondary school, as measured by an
increase insecondary enrollments. This phase will include the construction o f 104 classrooms.

The main features ofthe environmental management plan are:
Sitting
Proper sitting is critical to avoidbothunnecessary environmental impacts andunnecessary escalation in
project costs due to mid-stream design changes. A screening checklist has beenprepared which
enumerates critical questions about possible sites, such as:
         ------ is it inor near a natural park
                are there critical natural habitats
                is the areaprone to flooding
                will the project affect any streams, rivers, springs
                are there people living nearby who mightbe affected
                is the areaprone to natural disasters
         -
         ---    is there site access
                is there electricity at the site
                will the project cause impacts on surface water quality
                etc.

The school sites have already been identified through the microplanning exercise undertaken during
Phase Io f the project. DuringPhase 11, the screening criteria will be applied to each site prior to approval.

Identificationof MitipationMeasures
The screening checklist is used to identify possible environmental impacts in each phase o f the project
(design, construction and operation). Based on this, a matrix i s produced where each impact is described,
mitigation measures are identified,         and responsibilities, costs and monitoring indicators are assigned.
Mitigation measures could include recommendations for: i)sitting within the chosen plot (i.e. away from

Bahia EducationProject (Phase II)                                                                   Page 24



any streams, wetlands, roads); ii)design such as increasing sanitary facilities; iii)specijk construction
practices not already included inthe construction manual; and, iv) operational issues such as proper solid
waste management from the school. These mitigation measures are then includedinthe relevant bidding
documents, where applicable, or in operational manuals for the schools; for instance, measures in the
design to avoid contamination o f nearby water bodies through proper sanitation, inclusion in the
contractor's bidding documents o f measures to prevent stream contamination during construction, and
operational guidelines for the school for proper solidwaste management.

Design SDecifications
The schools which will be constructed have design specifications that include restrictions of material use
(no lead paint, no asbestos, etc.) and promotion o f environmentally-friendly technologies (such as
wastewater recycling, use o f natural ventilation and light to lower energy needs).               Specific
recommendations for designs, both to mitigate any negative impacts and to take advantage o f any
opportunities to enhance positive impacts, will be identifiedduringthe environmental screening.

Construction Manual
A construction manual has been produced describing good construction practices, including provisions
for: erosion control, pollution control, solid waste management, protection o f cultural property,
restoration o f roads, restriction o f borrow pits and dumps, maintaining access and services, public
information, etc. The manual includes occupational health guidelines and first aid instructions. Adherence
to the manual will be referenced in all bidding documents for works, whether for new construction,
expansionor rehabilitation.

MonitorinP propram
The implementing agency will follow up the environmental supervision and address activities requiredto
achieve the goals o f the construction implementation plan.

5.1 For Category A and B projects, timeline and status o f EA:
 Date o f receipt o f final draft:                 October 7,2002

The final draft o fthe construction manual was submittedto the Bank for review on October 7,2002.

Stakeholders have been consulted on the environmental management plan. Such plan i s part o f the
construction manuals. The construction manual has been posted on the website o f the implementing
agency. Residents near the schools will be consulted during the screening and construction phases of the
schools.

Implementation o f the environmental mitigation measures will be part o f construction supervision. The
supervisor will be responsible for conducting any requiredmonitoring o f environmental indicators.

6. Social

The project's main social development outcome is to improve the schooling conditions and opportunities
for children inpublic schools inBahia. The Bahia Education Program's ability to achieve this goal may
be affected, both positively and negatively, by various social factors. Three o f the most positive factors
are the solid and increasing political support provided by the government to education, the social
consensus for and commitment to education, and parents' continuing demand for educational services for
their children inspite ofserious economic constraints.

Participatory Approach Studies exploring stakeholder perspectives reveal that there is a widespread
belief inthe value o f education, and a general belief among most stakeholders that the quality o f primary
education needs to be, and can be, improved. Available evidence also suggests that although economic
pressures on poor families and limited access to higher levels o f primary education continue to be
problems, poor quality and lack o f relevance is the primaryreason behindschool failure and dropout.

There is also a fair degree o f overlap in opinions regarding what needs to be changed. Better physical
conditions for schools, more and better material and equipment, and a more relevant curriculum are
mentioned again and again ininterviews across a range o f stakeholders. The designo f the program takes
these perspectives into account, while also attempting to address some o f the root causes o f the problems
identified. The program has sought to incorporate key stakeholders in the project both through project
design workshops and by way o f the school development planprocess.

It is expected that groups traditionally "outside" of the public education system in Bahia will become
essential participants in program activities. This change has come about as a result o f SEC's recognition
that it must draw upon the commitment and skills o f multiple stakeholders if major implementation
challenges are to be surmounted.

O f primary importance will be the involvement o f parents in school development activities. Through the
PDE process, parents will be directly involved in school management decisions affecting their children.
As co-authors oftheir schools improvement plan, parents will also beresponsible for overseeing effective
implementation and appropriate use o f PMEresources.

The project also intends to involve the wider community (e.g. civic leaders, businesspeople) in school
improvement efforts. Civic leaders will be invited to participate in the PDE process. Mobilization
campaigns will alert communities about state-municipal investments in minimumoperational standards.
Communities will be urged to hold their local political leadership -and themselves - accountable for
sustaining school conditions and improvement efforts.

The program will also draw in state universities and NGOs into the school improvement process. Both
universities and NGOs are seen as major source o f innovation in providing professional development
opportunities for teachers via PME funds. They are also expected to play a role in delivering training for
"accelerated class" activities, developing the teacher certification program, as well as designing the state
assessment system. Overall, this invitation to non-SEC partners represents an early, but important
broadening o f the education services market inBahia- one which has traditionally been single source (Le.
the State Teacher Training Institute- IAT) and supply driven.

Bahia Education Project (Phase II)                                                                    Page 26



Attitudes and perspectives that present a challenge for the project include: (1) a sense o f disconnection
and lack o f shared perspectives between schools and their communities; (2) the lack o f a common view
among teachers and principals that student learning i s their main priority; (3) teacher misperceptions
about repetition and literacy teaching; (4) lack o f clarity about the role o f the school; (5) the
personalization o f school failure; and (6) a fairly widespread "disempowerment syndrome" whereby
everyone complains about the system, but few (be they parents or municipal secretaries o f education)
assume the responsibility for change. The Bahia EducationProgram's main mechanism for working at the
level o f the school and community (where many o f these attitudes prevail) i s the school development
plan. Conceived as a joint school-community exercise, the school development plan is also the most
likely entry point to beginto address many ofthe issues outlined above.

Performance monitoring will be conducted by SEC as well as extemal agencies contracted for this
purpose. A detailed evaluation is currently underway by an extemal research agency. Inaddition, results
from the student performance evaluation will inform the evaluationof social development outcomes.

7. Safeguard Policies:
The following safeguards policies apply to the Project:

                                     Policy                                         Applicability

      PestManagement(OP 4.09)                                                             No
      Cultural Property(OPN 11.03)                                                        No
      IndigenousPeoples (OD 4.20)                                                         Yes
      Involuntary Resettlement(OP/BP 4.12)                                                No
      Safety of Dams(OP 4.37, BP4.37)                                                     No

      Projectsin DisputedAreas (OP 7.60, BP7.60, GP 7.60)*                                No

The Project has provisions to ensure compliances with applicable safeguard policies. This project i s not
expected to cause significant negative environmental impacts. It is important to note that in 1999, the first
phase o f the APL was categorized as C, consistent with the trend at that time to categorize all education
projects as C. No changes inproject activity scope have occurred to cause the project to be upgradedto a
B, however recent advice from the LCR Quality Assurance Team indicates all projects with new
construction (no matter how minor) should be categorized as B.

The methodology for screening o f small infrastructure projects to ensure proper sitting and design,
followed by proper construction practices, operation and supervision will ensure compliance with OP
4.01.

For the issue o f indigenous peoples, this project intents to build one school (withat least 6 classrooms) in
the reservation area pertaining to the Tupinambh de Olivenqa group. Inaddition the project will provide
appropriate and specialized teaching and learning materials for 38 indigenous schools. The project also
plans to provide equipment and fumiture for 38 indigenous classrooms. A consultative process managed
by the Secretary o f Educationtogether with local representatives was heldinwhich the indigenous group
expressed their desire for official classroom and schools intheir community. This process is described in
inAnnex 11and infurther detail inthe Indigenous Education Development Plan developed by SEC and
found inthe project files.

F.Sustainability and Risks

1.Sustainabilitv
The Bahia Education Program is an integral part of a larger education investment plan designed by the
state government. Program objectives support government policies and are the product of the consultation
process. Political commitment to the Programat the state level, therefore, i s high.

With regard to the sustainability of the Program beyond the tenure of the current administration,
investments, policies, and activities can be categorized in three ways: (a) those which are not meant to
continue beyond the life o f the Program; (b) those which are likely to continue because o f existing
mandates or pressures; and (c) those for which sustainability will very much depend on the success o f
Programimplementation.

A good example of an activity with a "planned obsolescence" is the Accelerated Classes. These classes
are meant to be a short-term solution to the large age-grade distortions in grades 5-8 in Bahia. Once the
bulkof over-age children have managedto catch upwith their peers, the needfor the Accelerated Classes
should disappear, although other, ongoing techniques for giving slower leamers extra help before they
repeat a grade (through special tutoring, summer school, etc.) needto be continued andexpanded.

With regard to the Program's support for increased school autonomy, certification o f school principals,
and increased investment at the secondary level, in all cases extemal trends and pressures should help
ensure sustainability. Increased school autonomy and more objective qualifications for principals are
areas being emphasized by the federal government, and are in line with the 1996 Education Law (LDB).
The state's primary responsibility for the provision o f secondary education is also clarified inthe LDB,
and growing demandfor secondary education will clearly continue to drive investment.

The sustainability o f Program activities such as assessment, reorientation and transfer o f resources to
DIRECs, the PDE process, and even physical investments, will depend in large measure on how
successfully they are implemented, and whether it i s possible to build a constituency for them. For
example, ifparents and teachers are part o f the process o f buildingan assessmentsystem and are taught to
use the results, they are more liable to request such information on an ongoing basis. To cite another      .
example, microplanning should ensure more efficient use o f space within the school system, freeing up
resources that could be used for building maintenance or replacement o f school materials. Whether
resources are infact used to this end, however, will dependinpart on communities, parents, teachers and
principals who: (a) know what a school should have (according to the state's own declared minimum
standards); and (b) are empoweredenough to demand it from their political representatives.

3. PossiblecontroversialasDects
There are a few potentially controversial aspects in this program. O f some concern is the reaction that
some government offices (or officials) may have towards strengthened autonomy for schools. Direct
budget transfers to schools frequently diminish central decision-making power and related entrenched
interests. As such, concerns may be raisedregarding accountability and institutional capacity at the school
level vis a vis the handling o f significant resources. This possible controversial aspect can be addressed
by: (a) the strong political support to school autonomy in Brazil as a whole and, inparticular, in Bahia,

Bahia EducationProject (Phase II)                                                                Page 29



and (b) a well-developed accountability system based on: (i)results (evaluated through student
achievement), (ii)continuous opportunities of monitoring and influencing school usage of resources
(through the PDE and PME mechanisms), and (iii)       fiscal accountability (through random auditing of
school expenses).

The Bahia Education Program is designed to assist the Government of Bahia is its effort to improve the
educational system and respondto the demands and needs o f the Bahianpopulation. The program focuses
on improving fundamental and secondary school quality, increasing access to secondary schools and
improving systemmanagement. The medium-termprogram i s dividedintwo projects: Project 1(US$116
million) spanned 2.5 years, while Project 2 (US$lOO million) will be completed in 3 years. Project
triggers (described in Annex 1) indicate the government's readiness to begin the second project. This
annex describes both phases o f the Bahia program. As the second phase i s a continuation o f the first
project, only minor adjustments have been made to this Detailed ProgramDescription.

BahiaEducationStrategy
Given the complexity o f education needs and challenges in Bahia, a well-defined and comprehensive
strategy i s needed. The BahiaEducationProgram's strategic vision can be summarized as follows:

Autonomy of schools as the avenuefor quality
This approach addresses the repeated lack of relevance o f centrally-designed investments while making
schools more purposeful institutions. For both fundamental cycle and secondary education, a well-
planned intervention to prepare schools to develop strategic plans and their accompanying investment
needs is an avenue to increasing quality. Schools are best able to determine their immediate needs, be
they teacher training, educational materials, computers, library equipment, or others. School autonomy
does not imply a school's isolation. Rather, strategy preparation is envisioned to involve a mobilized
school community -i.e.            parents, civic leaders - and be supported by trained facilitators who bring
resources, experience and guidance to the process.

Meeting the demand of secondary education
As discussed above, Brazil implemented the FUNDEF which guarantees a minimum investment per
fundamental cycle student. One substantial outcome o f this policy i s the shift o f significant resources
from the state to the municipal level. Though this change will strengthen chronically under-funded
municipal fundamental cycle schools, there is widespread concern about funding secondary education.
This project responds to this challenge in Bahia by increasing the supply o f secondary education,
especially in those municipalities where the absence o f secondary education promotes desertion or
migration. Three strategies are used (a) reorganization o f the existing spaces (accounting for 34 percent
o f new students); (b) expansion o f existing schools and classrooms (61 percent o f new students); and (c)
new school construction (5 percent o f new students).

 Coordinating educational management
The most recent school effectiveness research suggests that educational environment has a significant
impact on student achievement. An effective educational management system provides: (a) clear
standards for school achievement, management and qualification o f personnel (b) strong support systems
that assist schools in achieving these standards; (c) consistent and objective assessment o f schools; and
 (d) strong accountability from communities and incentives from managers for schools and administrators
to improve student outcomes. The Bahia Education Program intendsto focus efforts on improving system
management of all state schools, municipal schools inthe 100 poorest municipalities, and other municipal
systems on a volunteer basis, and to evaluate the impact o f management reforms on studentoutcomes.

Targetingthepoor
The project design embraces the notion that in an environment with so many critical needs, investments
must first and foremost target the poor. In Bahia, poor students are left out of fundamental cycle, but
those who complete this cycle often find that they have no access to secondary schooling. As such, the
fundamental vs. secondary dilemma is not necessarily the most appropriate poverty targeting criteria.
Targeting fundamental cycle investments in the 100 poorest municipalities, while increasing access to
upper secondary education throughout the state assures that growing numbers o f poor are guaranteed
access to a quality primary education and increasingly gain entrance to upper secondary schooling.

By Component

         Component1
         ImprovingSchool Quality
         This component seeks to improve school quality by providinginputsto bringstate and municipal
         primary schools closer to meetingminimumoperational standards, and increase school autonomy
         for state and municipal primary and secondary schools by means o f the school development
         process.

         1.1Assuring minimum operational standardsfor schools:
         The minimumoperational standardsmodel operationalizes the concept o f a functioning school. It
         consists o f an agreed-upon, pre-determined set o f essential inputs and conditions needed for a
         school to be considered "operational." The checklist is the basis for the school facilities survey,
         which determines ifthe school meets or falls short o f the minimumoperational standard.

         A school operating at the minimum operational standards is one that is considered minimally
         capable o f proving satisfactory conditions for student learning. The model assumes that a school
         musthave all of the minimuminputsand services inorder to meetthe standard. A school unable
         to offer these essential factors simply cannot provide an adequate opportunity for children to
         learn. Indetermining the minimumstandard level, the state adapted the FUNDESCOLA concept
         with special attentionto the following criteria:


         0    The school staff and community are familiar with the minimumoperational standards model
              and checklist, and understand the equity considerations associated with this model;
         0    All students have access to basic textbooks andreadingbooks, and allteachers have accessto
              teaching guides;
         0    All classrooms have aminimumset o ffurniture and equipment;
         0    All classrooms have accessto basic teachingmaterials;
              The school offers the minimumphysical conditions to permit it to receive or maintain inputs
              and services indicated above.

         The state will ensure minimum operational standards for the state and municipal fundamental
         cycle schools located in poor municipalities. This i s assured by means of: (i)                 evaluation o f all
         fundamental cycle schools inthese municipalities in order to determine which schools are under
         the minimum standards; (ii)provision o f the required materials and equipment, and where
         necessary, rehabilitation through school grants,' in order to bring all schools up to the standard.
         The provision is made based on an estimated allotment o f US$1,300 per classroom. An estimated
         210,000 students will benefit from this sub-component.


 Before a school is eligible to receive a rehabilitation grant; it must demonstrate financial autonomy through the
establishment of a caixa escolar.

Bahia Education Project(Phase II)                                                                        Page 35




          Subsidiary agreements between the state and the municipalities were established in an effort to
         ensure that all fundamental cycle schools attain the minimum standards described above. Ineach
         municipality, the state finances the necessary inputs to and rehabilitation o f all state and a share
         o f municipal schools deemed substandard.          For their part, the municipal governments are
         encouraged to raise the remaining substandard municipal schools to the established acceptable
          level. This component was almost entirely implemented during the Project 1 o f the Bahia
         Education Program. An additional 2,100 classrooms inthe state o f Bahia will receive minimum
          operational standards (furniture and equipment) under the second project. The costs associated
         with this component include transportationcosts for delivering school equipment and furniture.

          1.2 Supporting the implementation of School Development Plans (PDE):
          The objective of the school development planprocess is to: (a) develop within schools a process
          o f educational planning and local empowerment to improve school quality and efficiency; and (b)
         prepare both state and municipal education secretariats to guide, evaluate, facilitate and supervise
         the design and implementation o f the school development plans and school improvement
         projects. The school development plan is a multi-year school-based strategic plan aimed at
          improving student outcomes and school quality. Through the school development plan, the school
          defines its own values, mission, goals, strategies, educational targets andresponsibilities, with the
          participation o f the parent community. The PDE is the culmination o f one preliminary process-
          diagnosis and strategy formulation, and the guide for a subsequentprocess-school      improvement.
          Once agreed upon, the PDE serves as a guide to the implementation o f the school improvement
          projects (PME) (see below). Active community participation in PDE development establishes a
          stronger sense o f local accountability for school performance, an essential driver o f change and
          local political commitment to education over the longterm.

          A team composed o f existing SEC personnel and outside consultants, when necessary, were
          trained for implementation o f the PDE in fundamental and secondary schools in Bahia. These
          technical assistants work with the school principals and state secretariat staff throughout the PDE
          process and are responsible for: a) training o f selected school staff inthe elaboration o f the PDE;
          b) mobilization of school personnel and the broader school community; and c) evaluation and
          monitoringo fthe implementation o f the PDE.

          Public fundamental cycle schools that are (a) located in either the 100 poorest municipalities or
          the government's Educarpara Vencer municipalities and (b) enroll over 200 students will benefit
          from this action. Project 1trained some 2,000 schools inthe PDE process; Project 2 will continue
          supporting these schools.

          1.3 Financing SchoolImprovement Projects (PME):
          The school improvement project (PME) is a section o f the school development plan that the
          school can use to apply for financing from the Bahia Education Program in order to implement
          selected actions.       The school uses the PME to indicate project inputs, services, or training
          activities it needs to achieve the school development plan targets. While the minimumoperational
          standards model seeks to equalize the school environment, the school improvement project aims
          to individualize the school by responding to school-specific initiatives in order to improve school
          learning and quality.

          The PMEs are submitted to a forum o f technical education authorities for evaluation, and if
          approved, the school receives a direct transfer o f funds with which to develop its project. The
          amount o f the transfer depends on the PME activities with a ceiling determined according to the
          number o f students inthe school, as indicatedbelow. (Estimates for the secondproject phase).

Bahia EducationProject (Phase II)                                                                        Page 36




         Fundamentalcycle schools:
         0     with 201-500 students...................R$ 6,200
         0     with 501-1000 students   .................R$ 10,000
         0     with 1001-1500 students   ...............R$  12,000
         0     with more than 1500 students      ........R$15,000

          Secondary schools:
          0    with less than 300 students......R$ 30,000
          0    with 301-2000 students   ...................R$ 100 per student
          0    with more than 2001 students..R$200,000

          Those schools trained in the PDE under Project 1 and whose PME meets the technical
         requirements described in the Program Implementation Manual received a first (and sometimes a
          second) full transfer under Project 1, and canreceive additional transfers as part o f Project 2, after
         updating their PDE and accounting for their first PME. The remaining schools will be trained
          and will receive a full transfer during Project 2. However, before a school i s eligible to receive
          the PME transfer, it must demonstrate financial autonomy through the establishment o f a caixa
          escolar. As o f November 2002 404 fundamental cycle and 537 secondary schools have received
          PME funds. Under Project 2, 493 fundamental cycle schools and 638 secondary schools are
          expected to receive transfers. The first o f these transfers under Phase 2 will follow the amounts
          above. For secondary schools only, the transfer will be dividedinthree parcels: 20% o f the above
          total in2003,40% in2004 and40% in2005.

          1.4 Implementing Accelerated Classes:
          More than half o f all fundamental cycle students inBahia are older than they should be for their
          corresponding grade. Many o f these students eventually drop-out, as older students increasingly
          compare the benefits o f employment to participation ina poor quality system with little relevance
          to their needs. Given the high financial and social costs o f repetition, and the failure o f the
          traditional grade system to resolve the growing problem, the LDB o f 1996 allowed for more
          flexible mechanisms for incorporating older students back into the system and accelerating their
          grade attainment process.

          The Accelerated Classes Program is Bahia's response to these high levels of repetition and age-
          grade distortion.       The program groups over-age fundamental cycle students (grades 1-8) in
          modules within which students progress and are evaluated at their own pace, eventually being
          "tracked back" into the main system at higher (and more age-appropriate) grade levels. The
          particular characteristics o f these older fundamental cycle students require a new approach to the
          traditional teaching practices and curriculum design. The result i s an integrated teacher training
          and curriculum design program that uses age-appropriate materials and reinforces the autonomy
          and self-esteem o f teachers and students. Year-end student evaluations are substituted for
          continuous assessment, monitoring student progress throughout the learning process and guiding
          teachers intheir practice.

          While further evaluation o f such programs i s needed, initial evidence has shown that students that
          have been rejected by the traditional system can succeed in one that is more flexible and
          responsive to their particular needs. Project 1 financed the implementation o f accelerated classes
          in 279 municipalities (9,000 classes). Project 2 will expand this effort to all 417 Bahian
          municipalities (18,000 classes).

Bahia Education Project (Phase II)                                                                         Page 37




          1.5 Expanding Gestar Program
          Gestar is a curriculum and in-service teacher training program developed by Fundescola and
         under implementation for several years in a number of states. Gestar provides practical, usable
          materials to improve teacher practice and includes training and didactic materials aligned with the
          new National Curriculum Parameters for teachers in fundamental cycle schools. Project 2 will
          expand the pilot program now underway in two Bahian municipalities to some 6,000 teachers in
          65 municipalities usingthe Gestar methodology and staff trained by Fundescola.

          1.6 Improving Indigenous EducationProgram
          Inorder to improve the quality of teaching and leaming inindigenous communities, the second
          Bahia project will finance the construction o f six classrooms (one school), the establishment o f
          minimum operational standards in 38 classrooms, and distribution of teaching and leaming
          materials to students and teachers in38 schools.

          Component 2
          Expanding Access
          The objective o f this component is to assist Bahia inmeeting the growing demand for secondary
          education. As overall demand for enrollments within Bahia begins to shift from primary to
          secondary, an ever increasing number o f poor students will gain access to secondary education.
          As the wealthy in Brazil have always had access to secondary education, the increase in
          enrollment rates and improvement incompletion rates i s increasing equity o f opportunity.

          This component complements the IDB Escola Jovem project, a federal loan that finances the
          expansion and enhancement o f secondary education in several Brazilian states. Bahia has agreed
          to coordinate both projects by targeting them for distinct geographical areas. That is, some
          regions within Bahia will expand and enhance their secondary education through Escola Jovem
          while the Bahia EducationProgram will cover the remainder.

          2.1 Planning andproviding additionalschoolplaces:
          Microplanning and structural reorganization o f the secondary school system was conducted to
          guarantee the provision o f additional school places through the optimal utilization o f school
          facilities, that is, through the articulation and rationalization o f state, municipal andprivate school
          resources.        New classroom and school construction i s undertaken only when revealed as
          absolutely necessary by the microplanning process.

          As a result o f the initial microplanning process, Project 1 financed 750 new classrooms, 10 new
          schools, and four new "model" schools, providing over 90,000 new places. Project 2 continues
          this process, financing an additional 104new classrooms (12,000 school places). Management of
          the school construction process, with technical specification and architectural plans approved by
          the Bank, is conducted by SUCAB, the BahianDepartment o f CivilWorks.

          Component 3
          Strengthening EducationalManagement
          The objective o f this component is to provide increasingly autonomous schools with the
          institutional environment they need to make timely, relevant and informed decisions to improve
          student outcomes. This framework includes a more transparent qualification system for school
          managers, a strengthening o f regionally-based school support services, and centrally administered
          evaluation system which informs political leaders, managers, teachers and parents throughout the
          public system whether academic standards are being achieved. Institutional strengthening for
          project coordinationand implementationare also included.

Bahia EducationProject(Phase II)                                                                            Page 38




         3.1 StrengtheningEducationalAssessment:
         Responsibility for the development, implementation, analysis, and dissemination o f a state-wide,
         school level assessment system, based on and complementary to SAEB, rests primarily with SEC.
         The assessment will eventually cover the entire state educational system. Plans for a frequent
         application strategy (bi-monthly) are underway in order to develop a "continuous assessment
          system"; however, this is a long-term goal. This program will lay the foundation for this
          "continuous assessment system" by supporting a step by step implementation strategy, beginning
         with a yearly application of the assessment ina targeted area. Project 1financed the development
          o f the assessmentand the initial applications o f the exam inthe targeted area. Inconjunction with
         universities and NGOs, SEC will also support the creation o f a critical mass o fprofessionals who
         will contribute to the further development of educational evaluation in the state o f Bahia. The
          second Project will continue this process andseek to ensurethe sustainability o f the component.

         3.2 Institutional strengthening of Educational Management:
         An important program interventionhasbeenthe establishment o f a certification system for school
         principals and top school administrators. Prior to Bahia Project 1, no transparent, standardized
          approach to selecting qualified school leaders exists in Bahia. Under the project, minimum
          academic qualification standards were defined in accordance with goals set forth inthe LDB. In
          addition, all current and prospective school principals must demonstrate a broader set o f school
          leadership skills. These skills are then evaluated through a preliminary standardized test. Those
          candidates that pass the exam are offered leadership training opportunities, which lead to
          certification upon completion. Over the long term, school principals are required to periodically
          pass additional certification exams in order to maintain their qualification. It i s expected that
          under Project 2 some 20,000 school staff (including school directors and other staff members)
          will betrained.

          Recognizing its role as a source o f technical assistance to the entire education system-both
          municipal and state-SEC      and its regional offices (DIRECs) are reorienting their mission away
          from administrative supervision and toward front-line technical support to state schools and
          municipal secretariats serving under-performing schools.           Under Project 1, all 33 DIRECs
          prepared Regional Education Development Plans (PDD) and identified activities to be
          implemented to meet the goals o f such plans. Similar to the school-level PDE process, the
          development and prioritization o f PDDs relies heavily upon collaboration with the broader
          community such as civic leaders and regional academics. Some o f these activities are funded
          through a direct transfer o f funds to the DIRECs. Project 1 financed the preparation o f the PDD
          and a first transfer of funds to DIRECs for the implementation o f the activities described intheir
          plan. Project 2 will monitorthe implementation o f the plans developed by the DIRECs.

          Project 2 will also pilot a program to improve school autonomy in state secondary schools in
          order to improve the decision making o f school directors and staff. These schools will receive a
          transfer o f resources to cover all o f their non-salary costs (e.g. electricity, gas, small repairs, and
          maintenance). In preparation for receiving these resources school staff will participate in a
          training program. The criteria for selection are that the schools only offer secondary grades, that
          they not be a model secondary school, and that they not have more than 5,000 students. Under
          Project 2 these schools will not benefit from the PME project (estimate 113 schools).

          The total amount o f school autonomy resources to be transferred to these schools is as follows:

               0    R$28.20 per student (3 times under Project 2: 2004,2005 and 2006)

BahiaEducationProject(Phase II)                                                                                    Page 39




                   PME resources under this subcomponent, following the total amounts described above
                   (component 1.3) for secondary schools but distributed in three equal parcels in 2003,
                   2004 and2005.

        Also under this sub-component Project 1financed the final steps o f the full implementation o f the
         SIIG in Bahia, a process that began with Projeto Nordeste and has had continued support from
         Fundescola. Project 2 will consolidate the school-level experiences o f SAEMEC and SIDE by
         offering these school basedmanagement software developed by MEC) to 1,000 state schools.

         3.3 Financingproject management:
         SEC is responsible for the administration o f the project. SEC's primary responsibilities include
         administration o f financial resources o f the program, and operating as the World Bank
         counterpart inthe preparation, discussion, and negotiation process.

         In planning for project management, SEC has deliberately sought to integrate and coordinate
         project interventions within the broader scope o f SEC activities. As outlined in the diagram
         below, overall responsibility for the project falls under the authority o f COPE. This unit is
         positioned to oversee the overall quality o f the Bahia Education Project, as well as assure
         complimentarily and coordination with other education projects (e.g. Escola Jovem,
         FUNDESCOLA) under its purview. COPE also provides direct oversight o f procurement and
         financial management activities for the project.

         With regard to specific project activities, each activity area falls under the responsibility of
         technical coordinators, who are accountable to the Director of Education Projects for the quality
         o f activity implementation. These technical coordinators work on a day to day basis with the
         appropriate SEC units (and in some cases government agencies or NGOs beyond SEC) that are
         responsible for actually implementingproject activities.

          3.4 Projectmonitoringand impact evaluation:

          SEC is responsible for monitoringthe project. Of special importance will be the monitoringo f the
          project's role as part o f the State-wide development strategy and the contribution o f the project
          impact to such integrated state strategy. In this regard, the project will finance workshops and
          analytic work that evaluates and advancesthe state-wide integrateddevelopment strategy.

          For the impact evaluation SEC will contract an outside agency that will design and implement
          (with SEC's collaboration) studies that evaluate progress and final impact. These studies must
          consider Project 1 outputs (which will be key elements as triggers to move into Project 2 o f this
          APL), and the Program's impact. Among other impact studies that should be considered are the
          following:

          1. Achievement trends based on the results o f the national SAEB sample, and application o f a
          SAEB-type exam.
          2. Enrollment, efficiency, and achievement trends inthe 100 poorer municipalities, compared to
          all other municipalities.
          3. Analytical study o f PDEPME choices at the school level and at the DIREC level.
          4. Monitoring o f the compliance with the project's key performance indicators

ProiectGoalsand Components
The main goals to be achieved by the endof the project (June 2006) are the following:

0    Reduce secondary and fundamental cycle drop-out rates by 6 and 3 percentage points, respectively.
0    Increase promotionrates o f fundamental cycle students by 15 percentage points.
0    Increase promotionrates o f secondary cycle students by 11percentage points.
0    Increase net secondary enrollment rates by 14percentage points.
0    Increase average performance o f secondary and fundamental cycle students inPortuguese and Math
     by 5 percent.
     Increase promotionrates o f fundamental cycle students residing inthe 100poorest municipalities by
     10percentage points.

The major objective o f the Bahia Education Project is to expand the secondary cycle and improve the
quality o f both secondary and fundamental schools, as well as to invest inschool management at all levels
inorder to prepare educational managers to meet the challenges created by the municipalization of state
schools.

The main components o fthe project are the following:

Component 1: Improving School Quality
             1.1      Assuring minimumoperationalstandardsfor schools

Cost-BenefitAnalvsis
The economic analysis provides a cost-benefit analysis o f the project and a corresponding sensitivity
analysis for alternative scenarios. Before estimatingthe Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate o f
Return(IRR) for the project as a whole, each separable component is appraised independently,inorder to
determine the marginal contribution o f each to the overall project.

The Cost-Benefit analysis o fthe Projeto de EducaqfiodoEstado da Bahia was undertaken inthe
following manner:

 Bahia EducationProject(Phase II)                                                                               Page 43




          The costs were estimated.
           The secondary level flow modelwas estimated for the state system.
           A flow modelfor the fundamental level was estimated for both state andmunicipalsystems.
           A historical trend was appliedfor both flow models, takinginto account the methodintroduced
          by RubensKlein(1999), inorder to determine how the flows o f students would look without the
          project.
           The impact of the project onthe flows was estimated to the year 2007.
           The number o f students that conclude each grade was predicted andthe difference betweenthe
           flows with the project and without the project were determined.
           Given these differences, the out-of-school benefits were calculated byusingboththe privaterate
           o f retumto each grade o f education and the increment inproductivityrelatedto improvement in
           Math and Portuguese test scores.
           Inperformingthe sensitivity analysis, theNPVandthe IRRwere calculatedandtested for
           differentscenarios.

. The main assumptions underlying the estimationandpredictionofcosts andbenefits acrosstime are the
  following:
      0    The average exchange rates o f R$/US$ = 2.35 and R$/US$3.20 are applied to all cash flows
           throughout the periods 2000-2002 and 2003-2007, respectively.
      b    The estimated marginal cost, unemployment rate, and the proportion o f students that study and
           work are constant over time.
      b    For each grade, there is a large number o f children out o f school that would likely occupy the spot
           generated by the promotiono f a student inthe system. Therefore, a reduction inthe years o f
           schooling due to greater promotionrates will not reduce the overall number o f students enrolled.2
      0    The increase insalary due to productivity gains is directly proportional to the improvement in
           both Portuguese and Math scores.

  costs
  Direct Costs of the Project
  The projected cost and financing of the project were converted from US$ to R$. The conversion o f the
  flows for the period 2000-2002 followed the actual average exchange rate (R$ 2,35 = US$ 3.00) adopted
  in the lst of the project ,while the expected exchange rate for 2002 (R$ 3.20 = US$ 1.00) was
              phase
  assumed for the period 2002-2006. Although not perfect, this is a reasonable estimate, given Brazil's
  managed floating currency regime andthe commitment o f its policymakers to keep inflationarypressures
  low andto minimize volatility inthe currency market. Furthermore, ifit is assumedthat the real exchange
  rate will be constant over time (PPP holds), it can be said that the estimated direct costs are already
  discounted for possible inflationary movements.

  Table 1displays the projected direct costs o f the Project for the years 2000-2006 inBrazilianReais.




  * This assumption i s based on the fact the net enrollment rates for fundamental and secondary education in Bahia
  (93.9% and 14.1%, in 1999, respectively) are relatively low. In addition, there i s a large contingent outside official
  age-grade limits who i s seeking to reenter school, as indicated by the huge discrepancies betweenthe state's net and
  gross enrollment rates (93.9% vs. 157.7% for the fundamental level; 14.1% vs. 53% for the secondary level). These
  rates indicate a significant excess in demand, clearly suggesting that, for the time frame under analysis, there will
  always be someone wishing to enroll inthe system.

The maintenance costs o f the project associated with Component 2 were considered to be a segment of
the recurrent costs associated with the incorporation of new students. However, the maintenance costs
related to Components 1 and 3 o f the project were disregarded, since there i s no clear commitment on the
part o f the state government o f Bahia to maintain these investment measures after 2006

CostsAssociated with Additional Students
Recurrent Costs. The expansion o f the state's secondary school system is expected to generate the
addition o f 840 classrooms by the end o f 2006 (750 in 1st phase 1and 90 in2nd phase o f the project), as
well as the construction o f 16 schools (10 standard schools and 4 model schools inthe Phase 1; 2 schools
inmarginalizedareas under Phase2). This implies an increase inthe total educationalexpenditures ofthe
state.

The increment o f new studentsimplies that insubsequentyears there will be greater investments inschool
facilities, an expansion o f teacher hiring, and an increase in maintenance costs for buildings and school
equipment. The most appropriate way to calculate the cost impact o f incorporating new students into the
systemis byestimatingthe marginal cost andmultiplyingthe result bythe numbero f additional students.

Unfortunately, there are few data available on student marginal cost. Therefore, the marginal cost
estimate was obtained by running a regression on secondary school expenditures as compared with                          ,
enrollment levels, and then the marginal expenditure was equated to the marginal cost. Using this
approach, the marginal cost for each additional student in the secondary level was estimated to be
R$519.69.3

Opportunity Costs. The addition o f new students in the secondary cycle also indicates an increase inthe
opportunity cost related to the foregone income o f young workers while they go to school. For older
children, time in school represents a real cost because the family forgoes the services o f the child in
household activities, in the family business, or on the farm. Where opportunities for wage employment
exist, the student and the family forgo income while the child is inschool.

Opportunity cost was calculated in the analysis by considering the following: (1) the average salaries
associated with completion of the Sth, 9th, and 10th grades, respectively, (2) the unemployment rate for
the state o f Bahia, and (3) the proportion o f secondary students who work and study simultaneously5.

The opportunity cost of the additional students for each grade o fthe secondary level was estimated for the
period 2001-2007. Again, the three considerations outlined inthe paragraph above are assumed to be
constant across the periodanalyzed6.

  The analysis assumedthat the actual marginal cost would remainthe same duringthe succeeding years. Giventhat
the reduction inrepetition rates should lower marginal costs over time, it is admitted that Cost-Benefit Analysis
overestimatedthe costs and, consequently, underestimated the Internal Rate o f Retum o fthe project. Therefore, the
economic evaluation o fthe project musttake into consideration that the estimated IRR is likely to be lower than the
froject's actual IRR.
  See "Handbook on Economic Analysis o f Investment Operations", 1997.
  The proportion o f students that take night classes was used as aproxy o f this variable.
  There i s another important issue that should be discussed: an increase inschool quality will allow the student o f the
secondary level to graduate sooner, thereby reducing the opportunity cost for that individual. The benefit associated
with the savings in time resulting from a decrease o f the years o f schooling should be subtracted from the
opportunity cost o f the new students in the system. However, this benefit does not seem to be quantitatively

Benefits Associated with the Improvement and Expansion of Student Flows

Flow Model and Estimation of Parameters.The estimation of the flow model was based on the approach
developed by Klein (1999),         which considers promotion, repetition and drop-out rates, as well as the
percentage o f students transferredfrom other school systems (federal or private, for example).

The estimation method adopted was based on the fact that enrollments, promotion and repetitionrates are
expected to oscillate inaccordance with a historical trend independently o f any external intervention. In
other words, we assume that it is very unlikely that the observed promotion and repetition rates will be
exactly the same inthe future.

The flow of students was broken into two different segments: the secondary level o f the state systemand
the fundamental level of both state and municipal systems. This segmented analysis of the student flow
gives better flow estimates than would an overall flow analysis that considers only the aggregate results
for each educationlevel.

First, the student flows for the without-project scenario were estimated for the period2001-2007, then the
scenario with the intervention was determined for the same period. Next, the number o f students that
would conclude each grade was predicted for every year until 2007. Finally, once the number o f
concluding students per grade was estimated for both scenarios, the difference was taken, in order to
determine the increment inthe number o f concluding students attributable to the intervention.

Tables 3 and 4 display the additional concluding students for each grade for the different segments o f the
student flow analysis. Observe that the results shown in Table 3 take into account the expansion of
coverage as well as the improvement in school quality for the secondary system, while the output
displayed inTable 4 i s relatedto the overall improvement o f the fundamental system. Inaccordance to the
main goals o f the project, it i s assumed that the goal for the aggregated fundamental system embraces the
one regardingthe 100 poorest municipalities of the State.




important in determining the final economic rate-of-return values. (See the Economic Analysis of the Project
AppraisalDocumenton a proposedcredit to Bolivia, May25, 1998)
  The calculation ofthe project cost present value was simplifiedby adding the project cost for the year 2000 to the
2001 figure, as well as assuming that the cost for 2005 will comprise the one for 2006 as well.

Marginal Rates of Return with Schooling. The private rates o f return were calculated using high quality,
up-to-date data from Brazil's yearly household survey, PNAD (Pesquisa Nacional por Amostragem de
Domicilios). The data were then applied to an adapted Mincerian wage equation, which is:

LogY = Ci di+y1Age
                pi                +y2 Age' +y3Black +"1'4Female +5

Where Y is the hourly wage received in all occupations the week before the survey and di is a dummy
variable having the value 1ifthe individual has completed the i-thgrade level o f education and the value
0 otherwise, so that a personhavingcompletedthe fourth grade will have:

dl =d2 =d3= d4 = 1 and d5 =d6...d15 =0.

Inother words, the coefficient p2 shows the marginal lograteofreturnto the i-thgrade levelofeducation.
The equationwas estimated for those between 15 and 65 years receiving positive income duringthe week
before the survey and living inurban areas.

Since we are observing only those individuals that are inthe work force (otherwise, we would have In(0)
for people without any source of income), and since the choice betweenhome work or leisure and wage
work is not independent of the wage offered, there is an implied selection bias. The two-stage Heckman
correction term (based on the inverse Mills ratio) was then applied to the equation. The unbiased
estimation results are presented in Table 5. Observe that the Heckman correction slightly changes the
coefficients for educationbut that all of themremain statistically significant.

BeneJts Associated with Gains in Productivity
The improvement inbothMath and Portuguesescores indicates an augmentationof the overall education
quality of the school system. A reasonableway to quantify this benefit is by assumingthat gains inlabor
productivity are proportional to the increase in the quality of education. The benefits due to quality
improvements lead to higher academic achievement, which will eventually take the form of higher labor
productivity and arelative increaseinearnings.

The main assumptionsbehindthis analysis are that wage levels reflect the marginal productivity of labor
and that growth inmarginal productivity will be related to the improvement inMath and Portuguesetest
scores. However, it is very unlikelythat there is a linear relation betweenthem. Some studies suggest, at
best, a weak connection between test scores and wages. Thus, in the sensitivity analysis section, the
estimation of the NPV and IRR will take into consideration three possible outcomes regarding
productivity growth: 1%, 3%, and 5% growth in salarywith the project implementation.

The last step in determining the total amount of benefits was to multiply the number of additional
graduates per grade by the expected earnings, taking into account the average unemployment rate for the

Bahia EducationProject(Phase il)                                                                       Page40




state o f Bahia. Unfortunately, only a portion o f the additional graduates will have the opportunity to enter
thejob market, which lowers the estimatedbenefits ofthe project.

The calculation o f the total benefits took into account the expected additional graduates caused by the
project through the year 2007 (one year after concluding project implementation). Assuming that these
individuals will only retire when they reach age 60, their income streams with and without the project
were estimated to the year 2046. The income surplus generated by the project was then determined and
the total benefits estimated.

Calculatinp the Net Present Value of the Separable Components

The Net Present Value (NPV) analysis of the overall project should follow the corresponding analysis of
the separable components. Each component shouldjustify itself as a marginal part o f the overall project
and must have a positive NPV. Ifa separable component presents a negative NPV, it should be dropped
from the main project, even if the overall NPV o f the project is positive. Thus, the components were
separated into two groups: (1) the combination o f components 1 and 3 regarding the fundamental level,
and (2) the combination of components 2 and 3 regardingthe secondary level.

According to Table 6, none o f the separable components should be discarded, since they yielded positive
NPV's and thereby represent a positive marginal contribution to the overall project.


 SeparableComponents                                  NPV(inR$)
 Fundamental Level - 1and 3 combined                    885,637,563
 Secondary Level - 2 and 3 combined                   1,480,181,501

Sensitivitv Analvsis and SwitchinP Values

Switching Values

The first step o f the sensitivityanalysis is to identifywhich variables most affect the project outcomes by
switching the values o f the aggregate variables. Although a disaggregated approach would give more
detailedresults, the analysis was applied only to the aggregated variables. The primary goal i s to find the
switching value o f a variable at which the project's NPV becomes zero or the IRR i s equivalent to the
discount rate.

 Table 7 presents the switching values o f the relatively more important variables in order o f declining
 sensitivity.The most critical variable is the student income flow: the income flow must decreaseby more
than 80 percent to make the NPV negative if other things remain as expected. The project does not seem
to be very risky, since it i s reasonable to assume that the examined aggregated variables are unlikely to
 present such highvariations intheir values.




  The NPV values are underestimated, since the analysis ofthe separable components comparedtheir
 corresponding benefits to the overall costs.

 Recurrent Cost                                        2,510%
 Direct Cost                                           694%

This analysis presents some shortcomings: the aggregated variables give very rough estimates of the
sensitivity o f the project and do not assist injudgments concerning the range o f likely variation or the
specific measures that could reduce the risks associated with the project. Inaddition, like other sensitivity
analysis approaches, the switching values estimation does not take into account the probabilities o f
occurrence o f the events.

The IRR for Different Scenarios (Best. Middle, Worst)

The second step o f the sensitivity analysis is to establish different scenarios for the project by assuming
three possible outcomes o f the income flows determined by the corresponding effects o f the rates o f
promotion and repetition. The income flow impacts will determine changes in the benefits and in the
opportunity costs, while the other variables are heldconstant.

The worst scenario is that the project will only lead to an improvement o f one percentage point over the
historical trend o f the promotion rate. The scenario that is most likely to take place is the one entitled
"Middle Scenario", where the increase in promotionrate estimated for the project (see Project Goals and
Components) is added to the current figures and not to the historical trend. The best scenario is one in
which the project's estimated increase inpromotionrate is incrementedto the historical trend".

The sensitivity analysis also considers three possible outcomes regarding productivity growth related to
the improvement intests scores. Inthis way, each scenario will present three estimates for IRRandNPV:
one in which there is a 1% increase in salary, another inwhich there is a 3% wage increase, and finally
one inwhich the salary i s expected to grow 5% withthe implementation o f the project.

According to Table 8 both the NPV and the IRR for all scenarios are satisfactory. Even in the worst
scenario, the internal rate o f return is greater than the Bank's standard discount rate o f 10-12 percent.
Another important feature is the low variability o f the IRR across the scenarios. This means that there is a
low risk o f default associated with the project implementation.

Besides the assumptions presented above, there are additional possible sources o f under or overestimation
o f the rates presented above:


loThe follow up o fproject outcome inthe period2000-2001 suggests that the best scenario is too
optimistic and very unlikelyto occur inthe timeframe established by the project.

0   Inthe student flow estimation, no allowancewas made for continuedschooling. For instance, inthe
    fundamental cycle the fact that students finishingthe eighth grade may stay and achieve greater rates
    o f returnafter secondary andhigher educationis disregarded.

0    Other benefits, such as health insurance, vacation, 13th salary, and retirement plans were not taken
     into account inthe calculation of the income flows.

Despite the limitations associated with underlying assumptions o f this analysis, it i s certain that the
Projeto de Educaqiio do Estado da Bahia should be continued, given its low risk and the substantial
benefits that it will generate. The economic analysis reveals that investments to expand the secondary
school system and improve educational achievements through quality and educational management
increments inthe fundamental and secondary levels will yield rates o f retum that are significantly greater
than the Bank's standard discount rate.

                                          FinancialSummary



Since January, 1999, when Brazil was forced to change its foreign exchange rate regime with a radical
monetary devaluation, Brazil's economy has beeninfluencedby extemal and intemal conditions that have
had significant impact on the country as a whole, including: (i)the Argentinean collapse; (ii) electric
                                                                                              the
energy crises; and (iii) deterioration of global economic activity. Within Brazil, the major sources of
                               the
instability are not new and include a chronic deficit o f current transactions and an excessive tributary
burden(about 34 percent of the GDP), especially inthe productive industrial sector.

Thus far, the only solution found for effectively dealing with the growing financial challenges has been
to compensate for the outgoing monetary flow by increasing exports. Given these circumstances, in
September 2002 the IMF approved a US$ 30 billion line of credit.

The financial situation o f the State o f Bahia has, o f course, been influenced by the national and
international conditions mentioned above. Inthis context, the State has sought to improve its economic
prospects by making significant investments designed to attract companies (e.g. Ford Motor Company,
Monsanto) and develop new industries (e.g. footwear and textiles). Such investments are key for Bahia's
economic development, even though, as a consequence, they may diminish the State's capacity for other
investments.

Table 1 compares Bahia's recent GDP growth with that o f the country as a whole. As can be seen,
despite a recent downtum, the State's economyperformedcomparatively well over the 1996-2001period.

Brazil as whole and Bahia specifically attribute the positive results to the performance o f agnbusiness,
which has represented the most important source o f growth inmost o f the Brazilian states. According to
SEI (Bahian Official Statistics Bureau), in 2000 the agricultural sector increased by 20.1 percent, while
the service sector improved by only 2.4 percent and the industrial sector diminished 1.3 percent. Table 2
presents projections for Brazilianand Bahian real GDP growth over the next five years.

In 2001, the current revenues and tax collection revenue accounted, respectively, for 93.2 percent and
53.4 percent o f total state revenues. In Bahia as elsewhere in Brazil, the ICMS (value-added tax) i s the
main source state revenues.. In2001, it represented 44.4 percent o f the State o f Bahia's total revenue and
accounted for 97.4 percent o f the taxes collected. The industrial sector is the main source for the ICMS
deposits, accounting for 49 percent o f total deposits. It is important to emphasize that the state applies
the minimum ICMS tax rate of 17 percent to a majority o f the services and products commercialized in
Bahia, meaning that there is a significant margin for revenue expansion which can be still utilized in the
case o f new budgetary constraints.

In2001, Bahia's current expenditures (mostly comprisedofpersonnel, interests and charges of internal
and external debts) amounted to approximately 80 percent o f the State's total expenses, nearly the same
proportion found in the previous year. Expenses with personnel were only 48.1 percent o f the total in
2000 and 47.7 percent o f the total in 2001. In both years the State met by a substantial margin the
restrictive limits established by the Federal Complementary Law 96 (Lei Camata), which sets a ceiling for
personnel expenditures at 60 percent of net current revenues.

Table 4 presents the DebtIGDP ratio for some Brazilian States. Public Debt in Bahia represents 20.2
percent o f the GDP, which puts Bahia below the national average (21.9 percent). It i s valuable to note
some o f Brazil's wealthiest states, like Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais, have a higher Debt/GDP
ratio than does Bahia.

As shown inTable 5, Bahia's Debt/GDP ratio has stabilized inrecent years, after increasing inthe latter
1990s. The projected Debt/GDP ratio for the period 2002-05 suggests a decreasing debt burden over the
next several years.. This projection is based on: (i) increasing GDP growth rate (as seen inTable 02)
                                                      an
that mightbe relatedto the maturation o f new investments inthe State (like Monsanto, Ford, etc), and (ii)
a diminishingdebt stock.

The Fiscal Responsibility Law (Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal - LRF) which took effect in 2000,
became a landmark in terms o f public management in Brazil. This law requires public executives to be
reasonable and responsible in their decision making processes. The LW's most important components
are:

0    Limitsfor personnel disbursement;
0    Limitsfor public debt;
0    Definition o f the annual fiscal goal;
0    Compensationmechanisms for continued expenses;
0    Controlmechanisms for the public finances inelection years;
0    Budgetadjustment mechanisms to the financial flows reality;
0    Revenue renunciation conditions.



Senate ResolutionNo43/01 attends to the intemal and extemal credit operations o f the States, the Federal
District and the Municipalities, including guarantee concessions, their limits and conditions. Table 06
shows aspects o f the Resolution that pertain to the evaluation o f State Debt Capacity. With regard to
some aspects (related to chapters 6 and 7, Iand 111) Bahia demonstrates good results for current debt
capacity with satisfactory margins to expand its credit operations. However, for other items o f chapter 7,
the results are not so satisfactory, showing little margin for increasingthe state's debt, at least until 2007.
It is worth emphasizing that the negative results are overestimated,       influenced by the conservative
strategy o f fixing the net current revenue for the period from 2002 to 2007, with no projected increase in
the state's tax revenues.

     The negative results indicate that Bahia has lost debt capacity inthe last few years. While it is reasonable
     to assumethat this loss is related to concessions made by the Bahian Government to some companies that
     have installed industrial plants inthe state's territory inrecent years, the mainreason for this deterioration
     i s Brazil's economic instability, which i s a determinant that supercedes any local particularity.

      According to the Federal Constitution, it is compulsory for each state to apply at least 25 percent o f its
      total tax revenue (including the federal transfers and excluding the constitutional transfers to the
      municipalities) inmaintaining and developing education. In2001, Bahia's state government exceeded the
      requiredpercentage, investing26.41 percent o f its total tax receipts ineducation.

      The total costs for the implementation period (see Table 08) represent an annual average increase o f 8.4
      percent over the total expenditures in education in 2001 (see Table 09). The overall investment for the
      four years o f implementationrepresents 8.9 percent o f the total education spending for 2001.

      It is important to note that although Bahia's future debt capacity is limited, the current financial situation
      i s under control, with improving Current and Primary Results, carefully restricted expenditures on
      personnel, and a Dept/GDP ratio that is predicted to fall over the next three years. As shown above, the
      state's financial situation compares very favorably to that encountered in many other Brazilian states.
      Moreover, it appears that the state is well position to overcome its tight fiscal condition. The investments
      made in dynamic sectors such as automotive and chemical should mature and bring direct and indirect

benefits, especially intax collection, due to economic strengthening. Also, the state enjoys a margin for
revenue expansion because at present it generally applies the minimum rate in administrating the ICMS
tax.

                                  Procurement and DisbursementArrangements

Procurement Arrangements
Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's
"Guidelines: Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits", published in January 1995 (revised
JanuaryIAugust 1996, September 1997 and January 1999); and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" published inJanuary 1997 (revised in September 1997, January
1999 and May 2002); and the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement. This project is the second
phase o f an APL Program in which the procurement performance o f the implementingagency during the
first phase was above average.

Procurement Responsibility. The Project implementation will require procurement o f works, goods,
hiringof consultants and training activities. These activities will be carried out primarily by the Comissiio
das Licitac6es da COPE at SEC, including all services and hiring under monitoring and evaluation
components. COPE is the Coordination for implementation o f educational projects. The procurement
team and their supervision at COPE are highly qualified and competent. SUCAB will have a secondary
role on procurement. All these entities are familiar with the procurement under Bank-financed projects
and work closely with COPE.

The COPE will be responsible for the overall project procurement activity, including compliance with
procedures and timetables agreed with the Bank. COPE will retain at least three procurement specialists
inorder to carry out their supervisoryresponsibilitiesandto assist the other implementing units.

Procurement Plan. COPE prepared a procurement plan for the procurement activities to be carried out
during the project implementation. COPE maintains an integrated information system able to produce
updatedprocurement plans on demand. The procurement was approved by the RPA's office and is inthe
project files. COPE will be presenting the updated o f the procurement plan, covering goods, works and
consultant services, plan o f operational expenditures and forecast o f school grants, for Bank's approval
each year.

Procurement Arrangements. The project's procurement arrangements for each component are
summarized inTable A.

Bank- Financed Goods, Works and Associated Procedures. The proposed project would finance goods
school fumiture,textbooks, didactic and scientific materials and technology equipment. The procurement
o f such items in individual packages estimated to cost less than US$350,000 will be procured through
NCB procedures, acceptable to the Bank, up to an aggregate amount o f US$3.5 million. Seemingly, the
procurement o f goods in individual packages estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO will be procured
through shopping or pregHo up to an aggregate amount o f US$3 million. The pregZo and the electronic
pregijo may be usedas an alternative to shopping for selected items for which customized designs are not
required or off-the-shelf items. The works under the project consist of construction o f scattered schools
throughout the state, through NCB procedures. Provisions for three quotations will be added inthe Loan
Agreement, although small works estimated to cost less than US$100K were not identified in the
procurement plan. The methodmay be used inthe case o frebiddingo f lots cancelled.

Bank-Financed Consultant Services, Training and AssociatedProcedures. The proposedproject would

The project's selection and employment o f consultants will be carried out under arrangements acceptable
to the Bank using the Bank's Standard Forms and Contracts.            The project's studies, implementation
supervision, financial and independent procurement reviews will be carried out following Quality and
Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) methods and individual consultants; except for the sole source contracts
identifiedduring appraisal, no other exceptional methods were identifiedinthe initial procurement plan.
Sole source will be used for two consulting contracts at an estimated cost o f US$970,000 for impact
evaluation and school surveys. The aggregate amount for hiring individual consultants is established at
USS10.5 million.

Procurement Review and Methods. The Bank's procurement review for goods and works will be
outlined inthe Loan Agreement as per table A 1 and in accordance with Appendix 1 o f the Guidelinesfor
Procurement. The procurement documents for all ICB will be subject to Bank's prior review. The
procurement for goods estimated to cost US$ 250,000 or more, as well as the first two NCB for works, to
confirm that COPE and SUCAE3 are usingthe agreed biddingdocuments, will be subject to prior review.

The Bank's review of selection of consultants will be in accordance with Appendix 1 of the Guidelines
for Selection and Employment of Consultants and the provisions stipulated inthe Loan Agreement as per
Table A.2.        Consultant contract documents to be reviewed will include TORS, shortlists, evaluation
reports, and contract forms. A review process similar to individual consultants, will apply to training and
workshops.

Non-Bank Jinanced services: These services and expenses consist o f the hiring o f consultants directly
related to the principal certification program and the school grants linked to the pilot for full autonomy o f
large secondary schools. Both o f these programs, while not financed by the Bank, will be closely
monitored by the Bank as they are critical inthe larger context o f the educational reform in the State o f
 Bahia.

Incremental Operational Costs. Incremental operational costs refers to the management and supervision
 o f the Project, including COPE staff and travel, maintenance and supplies of sucndr items,
 communication services, and spare parts for office equipment. Identificationo f suppliers o f sundry items
 and minor services will be made through market inquiries in the local market. Once the suppliers are
 identified, who will be generally the suppliers offering the lowest cost o f lists o f items, a purchase order
 willbe issuedusingregular administrativeprocedures. The market inquirieswill be updatedperiodically.

Advertising. A General Procurement Noticefor hiring of consultant services, and the ICB goods should
 be publishedinthe United Nations Development Business, no later than August 2003. The Notice will be
 updated annually for outstanding consultant services and ICB goods. In addition, detailed consultant
 services and assignments will be advertised, as they become available, inat least one national newspaper o f
 a large circulation. Furthermore, the implementing agencies may also advertise some o f the project's
 studies in an intemational newspaper or a technical magazine. The agencies may also seek "expressions
 o f interest" by contacting embassies, professional organizations, or firms that it knows or that are
 registered in DACON (paragraph 1.15 of the Guidelinesfor Selection and Employment of Consultants).
 In this case, the information required would be minimum, limited to make a judgment on the firm's
 suitability. Sufficient time (not less than 14 days) will be provided for responses, before preparing the
 short lists.

 Procurement Records. Detailed procurement records, reflecting the project's supply o f goods and
 consultant services, includingrecords o f time taken to complete key steps inthe process and procurement
 activities related to supervision, review and audits, will be maintained by COPE. These records will be
 maintained for at least two years after the project's closing date. The records for goods will include public
 notices, biddingdocuments and addenda, bid opening information, bid evaluation reports, formal appeals

by bidders and outcomes, signed contracts withrelated addenda and amendments, records on claims and
dispute resolution, and any other useful information. The records for consultant services will include
public notices for expression o f interest, request for proposals and addenda, technical and financial
reports, formal appeals by consultants and outcomes, signed contracts, addenda and amendments, records
on claims and dispute resolution and any other useful information.

Procurement Risk Assessment. There is Country Procurement Assessment (CPAR) for Brazil dated
1993. A federal review was completed inMarch 2003. The results o f this review indicate that the judicial
protests or recurso continue to be a major difficulty in the government procurement. Another finding
indicate that the use o f pregao and other modem procurement methods will add efficiency and
transparency to the government procurement. The State Government and the Bank are carrying out a
state procurement review in early 2003. The findings o f such a review may strengthen the proposed
procurement arrangements, supervision and monitoring o f the various components under the Project as
they are implemented. The risk assessment, selection o f thresholds for prior review, use o f independent
reviews and the supervisionplan arejustified inthe agency's capacity assessmentpresented andapproved
to the RPA concurrently.

In early 2002, a ex-post procurement supervision was carried out and the findings'demonstrated that
COPE and the other participant entities carry out procurement in an acceptable manner. The main
problems identified in the assessment include lack o f space for the procurement function, modest
supervision o f the implementing actions under the school grants component and cancellation and
repetition o f large procurement.

An agency capacity assessment was repeated for COPE and other participant agencies, confirming that
the overall quality o f the procurement planning, management and implementation is good. The report and
the action plan were presented to the RPA and are in files.  The overall risk o f the proposed Phase I1is
average. COPE has the staff andresources to perform at low risk, however, the proposedproject includes
a large component o f school grants which are managed at the school level; this component was not
assessedinterms o f risk due to its scattered and highlyde-centralized nature.

Independent Procurement Reviews. For investments under the School Grants component, COPE will
provide the Bank, no later than six months after the end o f each year, the reports o f the independent
procurement reviews audited by procurement experts, acceptable to the Bank.

Frequency of procurement supervision missions: The Bank will carry ex-post and supervision mission
onprocurement once a year.

FinancialManagementArrangements

CountryIssues

The CFAA concluded that Brazil has a well developed and centralized system o f public financial
management. Overall it i s able to reliably track budget expenditures. However the institutional
arrangements and processes are complex. While good results are achieved in terms o f aggregate fiscal
control, the government is less successful in achieving good expenditure prioritization and operational
efficiency. The Braziliansystem of public financial management yields reliable information and adequate
management and tracking of the receipt and use o f funds at national level, and is able to support Bank's
lendingprograms.

The Country issues that could affect the Project's financial management system andor the fiduciary
responsibilities o f the implementing Agency are manageable.

Strengths and Weaknesses

SEC Bahia established COPE, which successfully has been implementing a number o f Education Projects
either as a State Executing Agency o f FederalEducation Projects and as a Central Executing Agency o f a
Bank's financed project. The implementation project experience o f COPE demonstrated that management
capacity was established and problems that could affect the implementation o f the projects were not
identified. COPE is now perfecting the current management system to have a smooth implementation for
phase 11.

ImplementingEntity

The SEC Bahia is the principal executing agency for the program. SEC's main responsibilities include:
(a) financial oversight o f the program; (b) coordination with line departments, regional offices and
extemal agencies responsible for program activities; (c) coordination with municipal governments
participating in the program; and (d) overall monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure program
quality and effectiveness. For the civil works component, SUCAB, the state civil works agency, has
primary executing responsibilities and oversees the contractors performing the construction. For the
studentassessmentcomponent, a unitwithin the FederalUniversityof Bahia (UFBA)has beenproviding
technical assistance. The SEC also contracts out the implementation o f certain activities such as the
school staff certification program.

The Implementation arrangements that are in place for Phase 1 will continue into Phase 2. The Bahia
Education Program is expected to be implemented over a 5 year period, from January 2001 through
December 2005. Project 1 was implemented over 2 years, from January 2001 through June 2003, while
Project 2 will be implemented over 3 years from July 2003 through June 2006. The program will continue
to be subject to regular evaluations every six months; an intense evaluation was completed at the end o f
the first project inorder to evaluate progress on implementation and assess performance triggers.

SEC has developed a Project ImplementationPlan (PIP) for each o f the programphases that describes the
operational guidelines to address the above implementation responsibilities. The PIP i s accompanied by
an operationalmanual for school construction which provides guidelines for the civil works component o f
the Project. At the core o f SECs strategy is COPE, a program implementation unit which has the
incentives to: (a) integrate program activities within the wider array o f SEC activities and projects, and
(b) enhance andutilize the capacity ofline units and extemal agencies to implement program activities.

Responsibility for program activities is delegated to technical coordinators who work directly with the
SEC line units or extemal agencies (e.g. private firms, NGOs, universities) assigned to actually
implement activities. Technical coordinators play a key role in monitoring quality, trouble shooting
implementation issues, and ensuring that project resources are applied effectively.

SEC uses performance agreements as a key instrument to ensure accountability. Under the PDE and
certification sub-components, SEC is signing performance agreements with school directors. Finally, in
those cases when municipal schools are too small to adequately implement the MinimumStandards for
rehabilitation, the corresponding municipality is responsible for doing so and has signed an agreement
with the SEC.

Staf8ng

Coordenaqiio de Projeto Educacionais - COPE, which is the Central Coordination o f Project
Implementation i s well organized in terms o f having staff capable to respond to project implementation

Bahia EducationProject(Phase II)                                                                   Page 61



demands. COPE has a Financial and Administrative Coordination Unit, which is staffed with 7
accountingtechnicians, and a financial manager is already onboardto carry out the financial management
responsibilities. The Staff is familiar withthe Bank financial anddisbursement procedures.

Funds Flow and Disbursement Arrangements

The disbursement arrangements take into account the disbursement procedures adopted in the phase I,
where COPE requests the funds in R$ to the Finance Secretariat of Bahia. The Finance Secretariat will
pre finance the Bank's share o f project expenditures by decentralizing the funds from the State Treasury
single account to a specific project operational bank account at Banco do Brazil in R$ established and
maintainedby COPE. COPE receives the funds inR$ to pay the invoices and make funds transfers as per
project implementation design, and based on the payable account controlkept by COPE, the invoices can
be promptly paid and the funds can be usedwithin 30 days. COPE access through SICOF the counterpart
funds.

Basedonthese payments, COPE informs the Finance Secretariat to reimburseitself from the special
account andwill prepare the SOEs and SSs, when applicable, to be submittedto the Bank together with
S/A application for replenishment.

For Component 1 Improving SchoolQuality - Schools Sub projects
                         -
This component design stipulates that fundamental teaching schools will receive the ceiling amount of
R$15.000,00 in 2003 and 2004, and for secondary teaching schools will receive R$ 200.000.00 being
20%(R$ 40.000,OO) inthe first year, 40% (R$ 80.000,OO) in the second year and 40% (R$ 80.000,OO) in
the thirdyear. COPE will transfer the funds to the Schools on the basis o f the "Termo de Compromisso",
signed between the Schools and the Education Secretariat. The beneficiary Schools will establish a
specific bankaccount where the funds will be transferred from COPE. The schools have one year after the
signature o f the Termo de Compromisso to document the expenditures. Based on these transfers, COPE
will prepare the SOEs for reimbursement from the special account. COPE has in place monitoring
mechanisms which consists o f making visits to the schools to monitor closely the expenditures made by
the Schools. This monitoring mechanisms worked successfully in phase Iwhere 100% o f the schools
were visited by COPE monitors.

For Component 2 -Expanding Access
The activities related to this component will be carried out by SUCAB, which i s the State Secretariat of
civil works. SUCAB will pay up front in Reais (R$) the invoices for the civil works services under its
responsibility and will submit the proper documentation to COPE for reimbursement. COPE will
reimburse in Reais (R$) SUCAB via SICOF through budget decentralization. COPE will prepare the
SOEs based on the documentationandvalidation o f the expenditures.

For Component 3 Strengthening EducationalManagement
                        -
FAPEXand FLEMwill implement some o f the activities relatedto this component. COPE will transfer
the funds to FAPEX and FLEM based on the "Conv&nio" signed. Transfers will be made quarterly to
FAPEX and FLEM based on their working program. FAPEX and FLEM have to document previous
advances before next advance is made. COPE receives and validates the "prestaqiio de contas" received
byFLEMand FAPEX where the actual expenditures will be recorded and which is the basis for preparing
the SOEs.

COPE will then disburse the funds on transactions basis (SOEs) as per arrangements above, except for
contracts for works above US$500,000, contracts for goods above US$350,000 equivalent, and contracts
with consulting firms above US$lOO,OOO equivalent and with individuals above US$50,000.          In these
cases all contracts information has to be attached to the Summary Sheet (SS). The informationrequired

for the compilation o f SOEs would be maintained by the Financial management Unit at COPE, in the
informationmanagement systemdata base.

SpecialAccount

Inorder to facilitate project implementation, the Borrower(The State Finance Secretariat onbehalfofthe
State o f Bahia) will establish a special account inU S Dollars, in a commercial bank, with an authorized
allocation o f USD 6.0 million, so as to initiate disbursements under the traditional disbursement
methodology.

RetroactiveFinancing

The Bank will provide retroactive financing for eligible expenses related to this project incurred after
January 1, 2003, and amount will not exceed 10% o f the loan. The project will follow the Bank's
guideline and will submit SOEs only for eligible expenditures.

Accounting Policies and Procedures

SEC Bahia has to comply with the Public Sector Accounting Policies and Procedures which are
established in the National Budgetary Law 4.320. The accounting records are kept in the accounting
system usedby the State of Bahia, that is SICOF, Sistema de Informagdes Contibeis e Financeiras. This
systemhas been designedinaccordance with the Public Sector financial and accounting regulations. The
system allows the project to identify accounting and financial transactions related to the project activities
and this informationis migrated to the project management information systemthat i s GEP.

External Audit

The Project Financial Statements (FMRs) will be audited for the period January lstDecember 3lS`,
                                                                                         to
carried out by Tribunal de Contas do Estado da Bahia, which i s acceptable to the Bank to perform the
Bank's financed projects in that State. The audit will be performed according to terms o f reference
acceptable to the Bank.. The audit report will be submitted to the Bank no later than June 30 in the year
following the year for which the project accounts are audited. The Auditor's TOR will include the
issuance of a management letter on intemalcontrols six months after effectiveness.

Information and Financial Management Reporting Systems

SEC Bahia has in place a financial management information system (GEP) that can generate FMRs and
other reports in a timely and accurate manner. The format o f FMRs has been agreed to the Project
Implementation Unit. For the phase Io f this project, COPE submitted reports to the Bank on a timely
basis allowing task team to monitor the progress o f the project. These reports were also the basis for the
preparationo fthe audit report.

Action Plan Progress

COPE has hired a IT firm to perform some improvements in the project information system. These
adjustments are expected to be completedbefore project negotiations.

Bahia i s home to some 4 millionpeople livingbelow the poverty line, more than any other state inBrazil.
This widespread poverty directly affects the possibilities for educational success of children and
adolescents: nearly 15 percent of 7-14 year olds and 50 percent o f 15-19 year olds must work to help
support their families. Repetitionand dropout rates at both fundamental and secondary levels are some o f
the highest in Brazil, reflecting a mixture of social and economic demographics as well as a history of
under-investmentineducation for the poor.

The development objective o f the Bahia Education Program is to improve fundamental and secondary
school outcomes, as measured by improvements in dropout andpromotionrates and student performance
on standardized tests; and increase access to secondary school, as measured by an increase in secondary
enrollments. Designedto complement existing and plannedfederal projects, the Bahia Education Program
is framed within the new realities created by the implementation o f the FUNDEF, the priority given to
strengtheningeducationalmanagement, and the municipalization of fundamental cycle schools inBahia.

The program design incorporates findings from beneficiary assessmentsconducted as part of the ground-
breaking "A Call to Action."         Undertaken as part o f combined effort by MEC, the World Bank and
UNICEF, the study was designed to increase the understanding o f the causes o f low achievement and
highrepetition rates of children inprimary schools inthe Northeast of Brazil. The following presents an
overview o f these studies, as well as a summary o f their findings and implications for the Bahia Education
Program.        In addition, this annex includes an analysis of the Indigenous Education subcomponent,
presenting findings on the participatory and consultative design o f the component as well as the plans for
implementation.

Overview ofBeneficiarvStudies
Studies reviewed for the purpose o f this Social and Beneficiary Assessment primarily include "EducaCfio,
Escola e Comunidade: Estudo Piloto no Estado da Bahia" (Portela and Bastos, 1997) and "0
(Des)Conhecido Universo da SuIa de Aula: Um Estudo de ObsewaCfio de Sala de Aula no Estudo da
Bahia" (Portela and Bastos, 1998) (additional background studies can be found in the Annex 8). These
studies include more than 300 interviews conducted in nine Bahian municipalities. Adult community
members and leaders, youths, and school principals and teachers associated with twenty-three state and
municipal schools o f highand low performance participated inthe background studies. Adult community
members interviewed are o f primarily black or of mixed origin, have not completed ensinofundamental,
and earn from 3 to 5 minimum salaries per month. This level o f poverty is consistent with the total
number o f residents in the home (more than half reside in homes with 6 to 8 residents) as well as the
occupation o f these individuals, typically highinlabor and low inpay. Youth and students included both
successful and poor students, as well as drop outs, primarily between the ages o f 11 to 15. Teachers and
principals (all female) were by contrast mostly white and had completedupper secondary education.

The methodology used followed the guidelines proposed by the World Bank for Beneficiary
Assessments, that is semi-structured interviews with a variety o f stakeholders to assess their perceptions
o f a project or policy (Salmen, L., "Beneficiary Assessment: An Approach Described." The World Bank,
Social Assessment Series. July 2, 1995). Interviews were conducted by education researchers and
assistants, and includedthe following topics:

Bahia EducationProject(Phase Ii)                                                                       Page 74




     Personal, family, and social information;
     Perceptions o f the school, including school quality and operation;
     Relationship o f school to community and family; and
     Bamers to learninghhe schooling process.

Findings

The Value of Schooling
The value of schooling as perceived by the adults of the community is idealized and extensive. Adults
interviewed credited education with the source o f a future, learning ingeneral and as the exclusive source
o f learning in the areas o f reading, writing and arithmetic. Parallel to this description, the majority o f
those interviewed indicated that the school has a role in social formation, including good manners,
behavior and respect for elders. By contrast, student perceptions focused on employment and interactions
with peers. Those youth that hadleft school stated that they were forced to leave insearch of employment
to help support their families. None o f the youth stated that they wanted to drop out. Teachers, like
parents, believe inthe formative nature o f schooling as well as the understanding that the role o f schools
has expanded inthe last few decades.

School Quality
For community members, a quality school should, above all, have quality teachers. Schools should also
be close to home, well organized, equipped, and function properly. As in other studies, however, the
majority o f those interviewed did not indicate problems with their school, but o f education in general.
Parents also indicated low teacher salaries as a factor o f teacher performance and therefore school quality.
These adults squarely place the responsibility for assuring school quality with the government, and only
sometimes include the community as part o f a cooperative effort with the state. Students emphasized
order and cleanliness as a primary factor o f school quality, and complained o f "bagunqeiros":
(delinquents or unruly students). Ingeneral students refer to their teachers with affection, and appreciate
their patience. Teachers emphasized that poor quality schools often have poor quality teachers, especially
inruralareas. Relevant curriculum, attentionto the needsof its clientele, and student social formation, in
addition to transmission o f formal knowledge are all characteristics o f a quality school, according to these
teachers.

Barriers toLearning
For adults, school failure is the result o f poor living conditions rather than school conditions (70 percent
o f respondents). That is, poverty, according to community members interviewed, forces parents to take
their children out ofschool. There is little mentionofpedagogic or intra-school differences and analmost
complete lack o f knowledge of what goes on in schools, due to the lack o f communication between
schools and parents. Youth and students primarily indicated lack o f interest, intelligence or responsibility
as the primary source of student failure demonstrating yet again, the low self esteem o f drop-outs.
Teachers, by contrast have a much broader vision o f barriersto schooling. They indicatedthat poor living
conditions have a number o f associated problems including malnutrition, frequent migration, emotional
and psychological difficulties, and child-labor. While recognizing that part o f the onus o f responsibility
lies with schools to overcome, look past (as in the case o f the lack o f uniforms), or at times compensate
for these conditions, teachers also blame parents for not assisting with homework. There is contradiction
here: while teachers are aware o f the high levels o f poverty and low educational attainment o f their
clientele, they have not developed new forms o f measuring student work that take into account the
limitations o f parents and families.

Blame for the failure o f schools to achieve the lofty goals expected by both parents and teachers is
attributed to school quality (by the teachers) and parent and student failure (by the parents and students

themselves).      This is in contrast to previous studies, in which teachers blamed parents and the students
themselves for student failure. Recommendations for overcoming barriers to learning, on the part o f both
teachers and parents, focus on school inputs, rather than instructional changes. Furthermore, while
teachers are quick to recognize their need for additional training and professional development, they do
not cite their pedagogicalpractice as a barrier to learning.

School-Community Relationship
Inconversations with adults from the community about the relationship of the school to the community,
two perspectives arose: one indicating how families can help the school, another indicating the type of
assistance schools have solicited from families, both limited and very functional in scope. Most schools
only request parental assistance in terms o f material necessities or services, including cleaning and
school-nutrition programs. Parents suggested that schools organize community participation days, but .
again emphasized physical labor rather than involvement in lessons, or classroom assistance. Students
and youth emphasized the relationship to their peers during recreational periods, and rarely discussed
classroom activities or learning.        Teachers and school officials stated that the community had a
particularly strongrelationship to the school, that they were "always invited" to school meetings, heldbi-
monthly. Further probing revealed that perceptions o f potential parental involvement are limited to
physical labor. Based on these conflicting reports, school professionals have a very different view o f a
strong school-community relationship than researchers.

School Operation as viewed by Education Professionals
School principals submit annual reports to education secretariats, while pedagogical issues typically fall
to a school supervisor or pedagogical coordinator. School management i s the responsibility o f the school
principal, who often complained o f lack o f autonomy, inputs and humanresources. Teachers, incontrast
to student statements regarding frequent lack o f discipline did not complain o f student behavior.
Difficulties discussed by teachers included lack o f didactic andreference materials, libraries, equipment
and teacher training courses; large classroom size, diversified classroom populations, and inappropriate
materials. Teachers recognize their ability to improve their practice, and hope to do so through in-service
programs.

Policy Recommendations
Together these studies present a rich view o f schooling in Bahia. The following conclusions and policy
recommendations stem from the studies described here:
e    Strengthening and deepening o f School-community relationships
0    Implementation o f new forms of student evaluation that account for the difficulties o f completing
     homework (given poor living conditions)
0    Promotion o f student-student .interaction, whether through learning or recreational activities
0    Evaluation and Expansiono f in-service training for schoolprofessionals
0    Controlled school enrollment procedures to assure students school places close to home
0    Quality and regular school nutritionprograms
     On-time and free distribution o f schoolmaterials
e    Rehabilitation o fschools and libraries
e    Increased financial and managerial autonomy for schools
0    Improvedsalary conditions for teachers

Implicationsfor the Program
Among the most positive o f perspectives for the program i s the widespread belief in the value of
education, and a general belief among most stakeholders that the quality o fprimary educationneeds to be,
and can be, improved. Had studies shown a massive disaffection with education generally or complacency
with the status quo, the program would have a much more difficult task. There is also a fair degree of

Bahia EducationProject (Phase II)                                                                    Page 76



overlap inopinions regarding what needs to be changed. Better physical conditions for schools, more and
better material and equipment, a more relevant curriculum, and better qualified teachers are mentioned
again and again ininterviewsacross a range of stakeholders. While the program's analysis can (and does)
extend beyond and elaborate within these categories, clearly progress in these areas i s necessary if
beneficiaries and stakeholders are to "see" an improvement inthe quality o f education.

The design o f the Bahia Education Program takes these perspectives into account. Repair of school
buildingsand equippingof classrooms are includedinthe program. Fromthe perspective o fthe education
analyst, improving the framework for these inputs offers the best hope for addressing the root causes o f
poor physical and material conditions in schools, over the long term. Hence, the program incorporates
financing for school improvements within a comprehensive strategy that acknowledges its role as an
important incentive for stakeholder participation. The Program will (through the financing o f school
improvement projects) support school staff in defining their own training needs. Experience with school
improvement projects under FUNDESCOLA Iindicates that teacher training i s one o f the main areas o f
investment. This corresponds with study findings that teachers themselves do not feel that they have
sufficient training.

Attitudes and perspectives that represent a challenge for the program include: (1) the sense o f
disconnection and lack o f shared perspectives between schools and their communities; (2) the lack o f a
common view among teachers and principals that student leaming i s their main priority (and the lack o f
connection between student leamingand "quality" among most stakeholders); (3) teacher misconceptions
about repetition and literacy teaching; (4) lack o f clarity about the role o f the school; (5) the
personalization o f school failure; and (6) a fairly widespread "disempowerment" syndrome, whereby
everyone complains about the system, but few (be they parents or municipal secretaries o f education)
squarely assume.theresponsibility for change.

The Bahia Education Program's main mechanism for working at the level of the school and community
(where many o f these attitudes prevail) i s the school development plan, a process which explicitly
requires an highlevel o f involvement on the part o f students, parents, and the community. Conceived as a
joint school-community exercise, the school development plan i s also the most likely entry point to begin
to address some o f the issues outlined above. Schools will be assisted in the development o f plans by
school development teams, made up o f municipal and state education staff; these staff, in tum, will
receive training that will include exposure to some o f these attitudes and guidelines for facilitation that
will help schools and communities to begin to question them. As a concrete incentive for schools to
participate inthe school development process, the Bahia EducationProgram includes financing for school
improvement projects developed as part of the overall school plan.

Finally, it will be important for monitoring and evaluation to include the gathering and dissemination o f
additional information on stakeholder perspectives. Ultimately, it i s important not only to assess whether
educational outcomes have improved by quantitative measures, but whether those involved believe that
things have improved, for the answer to that question will drive the politics o f education.

Indigenous Community Analysis

Bahia i s home to 12 distinct indigenous groups located inthe North, Center-West and Southemregions of
the state. According to preliminary estimates based on the 2000 IBGECensus, some 60,000 indigenous
persons reside in Bahia. O f these, approximately 16,000 are now between the ages o f 7 and 19,
correspondingto the target school age population for primary and secondary school.

According to the 2001 Indigenous School Census conducted by the Ministryo f Education, 35 schools (33
Municipal and 2 Federal) and 95 teachers attend to the educational needs o f the Bahian indigenous
population in indigenous schools. Individuals who classify themselves as indigenous inthe IBGE Census
can be enrolled either in the traditional public school system or in indigenous schools. Intotal, 3,230
students were enrolled in indigenous schools in2001 (according to the MEC Indigenous School Census).
About one-third o f schools offered specially designed curriculum and instruction for three levels; pre-
school, literacy classes and primary education (no secondary enrollments were reported in indigenous
schools inBahia). These results implythat only 20 percent o f Bahianindigenous children are enrolled in
indigenous schools, while only 6 percent o f Bahian indigenous children receive an education that is
designed specifically to meet their individual educational needs and reflect their cultural differences, in
accordance with Brazilian law.

Legal parameters for indigenous education were established in 1988 as part o f the Federal Constitution.
The 1996 Education Law (LDB) gave the federal government the responsibility o f assuring indigenous
groups their ethnic identities, socio-cultural traditions and leaming processes as well as access to
information, technical and scientific knowledge known to society as a whole (indigenous and non-
indigenous). State regulations reflect these federal mandates, though in practice the state is only just
beginning to develop and implement its Indigenous Education Development Plan as much o f this
responsibility has beenleft to local municipalities.

Inan effort to remedy this shortfall of indigenous school places, the state secretariat inauguratedits first
indigenous school in August 2002. The Escola Estadual Indigena Caramuru, located in Pau Brasil has 6
classrooms and serves a population o f 555 students in grades 1-8. The school is fully equipped with the
minimumoperational standardspackage of equipment and fumiture andincludes specific curriculumand
other materials for the indigenous population. A second school, Indigena Capitiio Francisco Rodelas was
transferred from municipal to state responsibility in July 2002. Plans for construction o f a third state
indigenous school, inthe Tupinambh de Olivenga community with the support o f the Bahia Project, have
been published in the Diario Ofzcial. Plans for further expansion o f indigenous schools is described in
this annex, as well as the state's IndigenousEducationDevelopment Plan, found inthe Project files.

Locationfor project
The site selected for the creation o f a state-managed indigenous school in Bahia is the Tupinambti de
Olivenga community, which has a population o f roughly 1,700 individuals. This community does not
currently have any official school. This area has been selected as a pilot for Phase 2 as the population is
committed to the establishment o f an official school in the community. In addition, the state has
developed a strong relationship with the community, for this, their third indigenous school managed by
the state government.

More than 600 students were identified by the SEC in the target community. Currently these students
study inimprovised classrooms distributed through the reserve area. Thus there is clear evidence of the
needfor additional classrooms and schools inthe community.

Consultativeprocess
Inorder torecordandeventuallybe ableto respondtotheneedsofthetarget population, the Secretaryof
Education, together with its regional representative, DIREC, held a series of meetings with the
community. The Tupinambh de Olivenga community expressed their desire for a specific and
differentiated pedagogicallpolitical project (Projeto Politico-pedagogico) appropriate for their community.

In 1999, State Primary School Coordinator Sandra L k i a Ferreira Silva, established a relationship with
the Tupinambh de Olivenga community based on their desire to construct an official state school. ARer
several meetingswithin the community, the indigenous group forwarded to the state secretariat a petition
for a school, thus formally establishing the link between the state secretariat and the indigenous
community. Continues informal meetings were heldwith the indigenous community and the secretariat,
as represented by State Primary School Coordinator Sandra Lucia Ferreira Silva. Records o f official
meetings were kept by SEC and can be found inthe state secretariat offices. A summary of the events and
results of these meetings can also be found inthe Indigenous Education Development Plan, inthe project
file. Official meetings included the following:

Summary of Indigenous Education DevelopmentPlan

The State Secretariat o f Bahia has developed a detailed plan for improving the provision of educational
services to the indigenous population o f Bahia. This indigenous Education Development Plan includes
three main sections: 1) BackgroundContext o f Indigenous Population in Bahia, 2) Consultative Process
Description and 3) Plan for Attendingto Indigenous Population (both within and outside the scope o f the
Bahia Project).

One o f the key strategies o f the state secretariat has been to promote formal teacher training for
indigenous teachers lacking the minimum qualifications necessary in accordance with the National
Education Law (LDB). To this end the state, with the conjunction with MEC, FUNAI, UFBA and
UNEB, has funded teacher certification courses for indigenous teachers (magisterio level). To date 90
indigenous teachers have participated inthe program, which began in 1997and will conclude inDecember
of this year. The curriculum is designed to take advantage o f the rich experience o f the local population
and included several themes such as 500 years o f Brazil, land and territory, present/past/future, productive
systems, education and health, biodiversity and culture. These themes have been developed from a
intercultural, inter-institutional and multi-reference perspective in order to provide the teachers-in-training
with a broaddifferentiated, interandpluri-cultural education.

Bahia Project Phase 2 Component Contribution

As part of this broader strategy for attending to the needs ofthe indigenous population inBahia, the Bahia
Educationproject Phase2 includes a subcomponent including the following main activities:
         A. Buildinga school withsix classrooms

         B.Equipping14schools (approximately 38 classrooms) withminimumoperationalstandards.

         C. Deliveringappropriate curriculum and materials

Each o f these subcomponents is described indetail inthe pages that follow.

A. Buildinga school with six classrooms

As stated above, the Bahia Project will support the construction of one school with six classrooms inthe
Tupinambi de Olivenqa community. The schools design will meet state architectural standards as
approvedby the Bank and will be builtby SUCAB as appropriate to local conditions.

B.Equipping14 schools (approximately 38 classrooms) withminimumoperationalstandards.

Minimumoperational standards will be attained, with the support of the Bahia Project in 14 indigenous
schools inBahia. These conditions include improving the infrastructure of schools, through both physical
equipment characteristics and furniture and equipment. Minimumphysical conditions include appropriate
flooring, roofing, lighting, and ventilations as well as water and sewage systems.           Fumiture and
equipment include a blackboard, student andteacher desks, bookshelves and cabinets.

C. Delivering appropriate curriculum and materials

The Bahiaproject will also deliver a student kit to each o f the 5,064 indigenous students in38 schools in
Bahia. This kit includes pencils, pens, colored pencils, erasers, notebooks, etc.

I. VISIONSTATEMENT

BAHIA: A SOCIALLYJUSTAND COHESIVE SOCIETY

It is imperative to builda society that is capable of ascertaining the full rights of citizenship, including
ample access to quality basic services and equipment inthe areas o f education, health, housing, sanitation
and public safety, as well as information, culture, sports and leisure. The strategy aims at improving
income distribution coupled with a reduction in poverty and social exclusion indices. In a scenario o f
increasing alienation o f part o fthe global society from the development process, it is crucial that Bahia set
goals for reducing inequalities at the state level inorder to ascertain social cohesion.



BAHIA: A DIVERSIFIED AND COMPETITIFT ECONOMY

The increasing competition among firms requires incentive policies focused on a better harmonization o f
production chains, including improvements in technology and labor skills, as well as a reduction in the
production costs o f intermediary goods and the strengthening o f inter-sectoral links by deepening and
vertical integration o f the existing production chains. Inaddition, it should be possible to innovate and
develop a knowledge and infrastructure network that would reinforce the dynamic competitiveness o f
Bahia's economy. It i s envisioned that small and medium enterprises will become more competitive,
generating newjob opportunities and fostering the development o f a network o f intersectoralrelations.


BAHIA: A SPATIALYINTEGRATED SOCIETY

The spatial integration o f the society and the state economy i s key for keeping it united. Given that the
Salvador Metropolitan Region has already consolidated its position, it is important to pursue a
desconcentration o f economic activities.        This implies the availability of an adequate level o f
infrastructure and logistics for the different regions within the state and the position o f these regions vis-a-
vis the national and international trade flows. Medium size cities that are strategically important should
be strengthened inasmuch as they serve the integration function for the regional economy by providing a
more sophisticated set o f goods and services, includingpublic services. The integration o f dynamic areas
located near the perimeter of the state's territory is key for addressing the development o f the semi-arid
region that is located inthe central part o f the state. The integration process would simultaneously create
agglomeration economies andpopulation densities that would more efficiently support the production and
trade o f goods andservices.


BAHIA: ANENVIRONMENTALLY CLEANSTATE

It is important that a new environmental consciousness applied to business and public decision making
processes be promoted that makes the appropriate use o f natural resources for economic growth while
minimizing the risks o f environmental degradation. For the sake o f future generations, Bahia has to
embrace sustainable development model that is based on harmonious, socially just and environmentally
sound growth. Modern society increasingly demands a new balance between human activities and the

environment, with natural resources and cultural, artistic and architectural heritage becoming
progressively more important.       Consumers themselves are demanding goods and services that are
produced by environmentally clean processes and socially responsible companies. It is envisioned that
technological progress will accompany a greater conservation of the natural and cultural environment,
making it possible to arrive at an intervention model that will help to preserve, recover, and make a
rational and sustainable use o f natural resources. It i s also envisioned that instruments will be available
for a more adequate management o f environmental issues, especially those concerning water resources.
