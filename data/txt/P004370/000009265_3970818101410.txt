PAPUA NEW GUINEA
NUCLEUS ESTATE AND SMALLHOLDER I (MILNE BAY) PROJECT
Loan and Project Sumzarn
Borrower:            The Independent State of Papua New Guinea.
Beneficiaries:       The Milne Bay Estates Pty. Ltd (Company) and smallholder
farmers in the Milne Bay Province.
Loan Amount:         US$27.6 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayable in 17 years, including 6.5 years grace at
standard variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:      The Government of Papua New Guinea (GOPNG) will onlend
US$18.5M equivalent equivalent to the Company at variable
interest rate with a margin of 1.55% above six-month
LIBOR and US$1.6M as equity contribution. The Company
will bear the foreign exchange risk. GOPNG will also
lend US$0.7M equivalent to the Agricultural Bank of Papua
New Guinea (ABPNG) at 8% p.a. for onlending to small-
holder farmers at 11Z p.a. with GOPNG bearing the foreign
exchange risk. The grace periods and terms of loans to
the Company and ABPNG will be the same as those of the
Bank loan. The remainder of the Bank loan proceeds
(US$6.8 M equivalent) will be retained by COPNG and used
for other project works, including infrastructural
improvements.
Project
Description:       The project aims at increasing foreign exchange earnings
of Papua New Guinea (PNG); partially offsetting declines
in cocoa exports and accelerating economic development in
one of the less developed provinces of PNG. The project
will develop about 3,700 ha of oil palm plantation, 750
ha of cocoa plantation and 1,000 ha of smAllholder oil
palm blocks in the Milne Bay Province. The project will
also provide associated processing facilities and
infrastructural support, including construction of an oil
palm mill, a cocoa fermentary, and improvements in proj-
ect area roads, bridges, health, education and housing
facilities. The project is expected to increase PNG's
annual exports of palm oil and kernel by about US$13M and
cocoa by US$2M. The project fazes no special risks.

1. BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The Government of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea (GOPNG)
has requested Bank assistance for a project to increase the production and
processing of export oriented tree crops (mainly oil palm). The project was
pr-cpared during 1983 by the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) with
thie participation of GOPNG's Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and the
Bank. In May 1984, GOPNG invited the Bank to send a pre-appraisal mission to
review the project. A preappraisal mission consisting of Messrs T.P.N. Sinha,
A Rhan, C. Shearing and Ms C. Clark visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) during
June/July 1984, and in view of agreements reached on a restructured project,
it was later converted into an appraisal mission. This report is based on the
mission's findings.
Agriculture in PNG
1.02      Role in the economy:  Agriculture plays a dominant role in the PNG
economy as employer and provider of food and income to the great majority
(over 80%) of PNG's population. The sector, including forestry, fisheries and
livestock, accounted for more than 40% of PNG's K 687 million exports in 1983
and about a third of its GDP.
1.03      Resources:  PNG enjoys a humid tropical climate which is conducive
to agriculiural production, especially of tree crops. The land ares of
500,000 km is sparsely populated (an average of six persons per km ) and
nearly 15 million ha (30%) is topographically, geologically and climatically
suited to agriculture. With only about half of this suitable land currently
used for agriculture, there is considerable scope for increased utilization.
1.04      Structure:  Agriculture in PNG follows three modes of production:
(a) smallholders following subsistence farming based mainly on root crops and
vegetables for their own consumption; (b) estates which hire labor and produce
mainly tree crops for export; and (c) smallholders growing cash crops, mainly
tree crops for export in addition to some food crops. Estimates of subsis-
tence output are weak, although such output is believed to comprise about 40%
of total agricultural production. Subsistence agriculture is suited to remote
areas where poor infrastructure hinders trading activity; its importance is
expected to decline gradually as infrastructural improvements permit trading
at lower cost, and thereby encourage greater cultivation of tree crops. Tree
crop products already account for about 40% of the agricultural production,
and over 77% of agricultural exports.
Tree Crop Subsector
1.05      Tree crops cover about 476,000 ha (1%) of land in PNG, of which
about 55% is under coconut; 27%, cocoa; and 18%, other tree crops. About 65%
of the area is managed by smallholders, and 35Z by estates. Production from
major tree crops during 1983 is shown below:

1.06      Tree crop production volume has increased by 4Z p.a., mainly due to
increases in oil palm and coffee. Most other tree crops have shown a decli-
ning trend. The slow growth coupled with reduction in comnodity prices since
1978 has resulted in stagnation of export values (Table 1.2).

The performance and prospects of major tree crops in PNG are discussed below.
1.07      Coffee:  Coffee is the most important tree crop in PNG, accounting
for almost half of PNG's tree crop export value. About 86Z of the 47,000 ha
coffee area is cultivated by smallholders. Arabica coffee comprises about 90%
of the crop and is grown in the highland provinces. The main constraint to
future expansion of coffee area is the high level of current coffee production
in relation to market opportunity. PNG is a member of the International



-3-
Coffee Agreement (ICA), and in most of the recent years its export quota has
been below 70Z of its production. Since local consumption is low (5%), a sub-
stantial proportion of productijn (over 25%) has to be exported to non ICA
countries at heavily discounted prices. Until PNG is able to get a substan-
tial quota increase, incentives for expansion of coffee area would be small.
1.08      Cocoa:  The cocoa area at 128,000 ha is more extensive than that of
coffee, but production volume and value are lower so that cocoa accounts for
only about 19% of tree crop exports. While the majority (57%) of the cocoa
area is cultivated by smallholders, plantations also cover a substantial area
(some 55,000 ha). Cocoa production has declined by about 20% since its peak
production of about 35,000 tons in 1974/75 due to senility, pests and dis-
eases, and current average yields of about 0.3 tons/ha are very low. However,
future yield prospects are better. Locally selected disease resistant varie-
ties are now available and, under good management conditions, the prospects
for increasing cocoa yields are excellent. The proposed project will make a
modest beginning in this direction, which will only partly offset previous
production declines.
1.09      Coconut:  Copra production is PNG's longest established industry and
provided 9OZ of its exports in 1900. Even now, coconut covers 57% of tree
crop area, but accounts for only 15Z of tree crop exports due to the emergence
of other tree crop exports. About 64Z of the 263,000 h- coconut area is under
smallholder management. Copra yields are variable but average about 0.7 tons
per ha. Increased yields are now possible through the utilization of hybrid
planting material. DPI has established coconut seed gardens which will
support planting of about 3000 ha p.a.
1.10      Oil Palm.  Oil palm is grown and processed on a commercial scale at
Cape Hoskins (13,200 ha) and Biala (6,100 ha) in West New Britain Province,
and at Popondetta (9,400 ha) in Oro Province.  Of the total 28,700 ha of oil
palm, about 58% is managed by smallholders. Cultivation, processing and
export of this crop are increasing and represent the fastest growing segment
of the tree crop sector in PNG. Production and export of palm products are
growing at an average annual rate of more than 20% from 32,600 tons in 1978 to
87,000 tons in 1983. The high growth rate relative to other crops results
from the higher profitability of oil palm which in turn is due to high yields
and a good market demand.
1.11      Oil Palm Yields:  The favorable climatic and soil conditions in many
parts of the country allow PNG oil palm yields to rank amongst the best in the
world. Even under smallhylder management conditions, yields as high as
34 tons ffb/ha per annum -  had been reached prior to 1980, with average
annual yields at maturity ranging between 19-24 tons ffb/ha per annum. Since
then, technological improvements such as introduction of the pollinating
weevil and further improved planting material are permitting yield increases
to levels around 28 tons ffb/ha per annum on nucleus estates and about 22 tons

Projects of July 7, 1980.



-4-
ffb/ha per annum on smallholder farms. The weevil has also improved oil and
kernel extraction rates which are now around 24Z and 5Z respectively.
1.12      Oil Palm Production and Exports:  In 1983, PNG produced and exported
77,900 tons of palm oil and 9,100 tons of palm kernel worth K 25.1 million.
In the five year period ending in 1983, export volume almost tripled, and in
spite of price declines, the palm product export value has increased by
124%. PNG crude palm oil is of excellent quality and is sold at a slight
premium (2%). PNG palm oil exports to Europe enter duty-free and therefore
attract an additional premium of about 4%. Such favorable prices considered
alongside good fruit yields, provide PNG with a competative advantage over
other oil palm producers.
1.13      Tea and Rubber:  PNG also has small areas of rubber (6,500 ha) and
tea (2,800 ha). Low annual rubber yields (0.6 ton per ha) from aging trees,
high labor costs and recent depressed prices have led to declines in rubber
area and production. Like rubber, the tea industry in PNG is small and
declining. Tea is even more labor-intensive than rubber, requiring very
careful plucking (harvesting) techniques. Declining real prices coupled with
high labor costs in PNG make tea production less attractive than other tree
crops. While production increases from existing tea areas are possible, it is
unlikely that any new project will be started.
Tree Crop Support Services and Institutions
1.14      Direct responsibility for all agricultural extension is with
Provincial Departments of Primary Industries (DPI), under technical guidance
from the National DPI. For new projects the National DPI establishes a
project team to coordinate and facilitate tree crop planting and maintenance,
and provision of inputs and credit. Once the project is completed, extension
responsibility is turned over to the Provincial DPI. This arrangement has
caused deterioration of extension support in the post project phase due to
weaknesses in the provincial extension services. In the future, the problem
should diminish because of strengthening of extension training to be carried
out under the Bank-assisted Agricultural Support Services Project
(Ln. 2276). The design of the proposed project has also been adapted to
strengthen extension support after project completion.
1.15      Research:  National DPI is also responsible for the tree crop
research stations at Keravat, Aiyura, Kuk, Bisianumu and Omuru. In addition,
industry-based, cess-financed research is being carried out for oil palm (at
Dami), cocoa (at Keravat), and coffee (at Kera'at and Aiyura).  Tree crop
research priorities are as follows.
(a) Plant Breeding: PNG has yet to take full advantage of the plant
breeding advances made in other countries. A wider range of plant-
ing material should be introduced, especially in cocoa, coconut and
coffee.
(b) Nutrition of High Yielding Varieties. Generally, soils on which
tree crops are grown in PNG have been of sufficient fertility to
produce satisfactory yields with the varieties used. Newer varie-



-5-
ties already in the country and others which should be introducea
have higher yield potential. The achievement of this potential will
require higher fertilizer dosage than existing varieites.
Fertilizer trials will be required for newer varieties in different
cultural situations.
(c) Pest and Disease Investigations. Past entomological and patho-
logical work has produced effective methods of controlling most
economically-significant plant pests and diseases in PNG, especially
those related to tree crops. However, because of staff shortages,
work in these areas has slowed. It will be important to have
adequate entomological and pathological services available if new
planting materials are to be imported.
GOPNC, recognizing the shortcomings of its recent agricultural research
effort, is now implementing the Bank-assisted Agricultural Support Services
Project.
1.16      Oil Palm Research and Technology:  Thus far, oil palm genetic
research has been the responsibility of the New Britain Palm Oil Development
Company and applied research has been carried out by an association of oil
palm producers (PNGOPRA). A comprehensive program has been developed during
the past fourteen years, covering breeding, seed production techniques,
pollination, nutrition, palm density and thinning and pests and diseases.
However, more work is required in the areas of weevil pollination, pest
problems, and smallholder farming of oil palms.
1.17      Cocoa Research and Technology.  Considerable experimentation has
already been undertaken on planting materials, shade management, density/
spacing, manuring, pruning, and pest and disease management. Until recently,
major technical constraints to cocoa cultivation have been presented by the
pests and diseases.  However, suitable remedies have been or are being dis-
covered.  The major pests are the wood-borers, the cocoa weevil (Pantorhytes
plutus), and longicorn borers (Clenea spp.)  Others are the podsuckers -
mirids (often called capsids) and leaf-eating beetles and caterpillars.  Gen-
erally, these pests have been well researched and satisfactory recommendations
for prevention and/or control have been made.  For Pantorhytes, which can be
controlled chemically but only with high rates, frequent application, and
costly products, more promising results are being achieved through biological
control especially using crazy ants. Vascular streak dieback (Onchobasidium
theobromae) has been the most serious disease and reached epidemic proportions
in PNG in the early 60s, but has now declined partly due to an increase in the
field resistance of the surviving cocoa population. Current DPI research is
also directed towards finding a fungicide which would protect young seedlings
during the particuiarly vulnerable first two-three years. Stem canker
(Phytophthora palmivora), also the causal agent of black pod, is a dangerous
disease. However, control can be achieved if action is taken sufficiently
early. This requires sound management which could be available on estate and
supervised smallholders. A number of sound technical packages have been
developed for both low and high input conditions..



6
1.18      Agricultural Credit:  Credit for smallholder agriculture is provided
by the Agricultural Bank of Papua New Guinea (ABPNG) which was established in
1965. ABPNG is authorized to grant loans to and receive deposits from the
public. However, in practice, it does not receive deposits and acts only as
an investment bank. It operates 10 branches, 3 sub-branches, and 14 field
representative offices. In line with GOPNG development policy, the agricul-
tural sector is the major recipient of ABPNG loans, and agricultural loans
comprise 57Z (K 30 million) of the total portfolio. While about 21Z of all
loans are in arrears, the situation for loans to oil palm smalLholders is much
better, with only 5Z of the loans in arrears. This is because there is no
parallel market for paLm fruit whicb is processed only in factories controlled
by companies partially owned by COPNG. These factories cooperate fully with
ABPNG and deduct credit repayments before paying smaLLholders for the fruit
which they sell to the factory. There is no opportunity for smallholders to
avoid credit repayments.
1.19      Marketing and Input Suppl:  Oil palm prsiucts are processed and
marketed by nucleus estates (NE) which also provide agricultural inputs to
participating smallholders in their area. Because of the need to collect and
process oil palm fruits soon after harvesting, all oil palm smallholder areas
in PNG are in close proximity to the three NEs at Hoskins, Bialla, and
HigaturulPopondetta. Processing mills at Hoskins, Bialla and Higaturn are all
operational. These NEs collect oil palm fruit, process it, and export palm
oil and kernels. Smallholder_ are paid for their fruit at prices calculated
using a formula established by GOPNG and agreed by the Bank. The formula
allows for calculation of the fruit price based on f.o.b. prices of palm oil
and kernel less processing and marketing costs. The residual price paid to
smallholders has fluctuated along with oil palm f.o.b. prices and caused
considerable hardship to smallholders when prices were low. Therefore GOPNG
has recently established a stabilization fund for oil palm smallholders .
This fund will help dampen price fluctuations for smallholders by paying out a
bounty when prices are lower than the seven year moving average price and
charging a levy when higher. The bountyllevy compensates for 50Z of the price
difference from the seven year moving average price.
Agricultural Development Strategy
1.20      The main goals of agricultural development in PSG are: to improve
the livelihood of rural families; to increase and broaden agricultural
exports; and to reduce food imports. To achieve this, GOPNG's agricultural
and rural development srategy has focussed on: (a) an open economy with
emphasis on a strong private sector supported by agricultural credit and
export crop stabilization funds; (b) the support of clans and other tradi-
tional groups as recognised legal entities while acknowledging individual land
rights in clan lands as a basis for long-term farm improvements; (c) the dele-
gation of major development responsibilities to the provincial level;
(d) financial and management assistance to nationals to enable them to assume
responsibility for plantations formerly owned and managed by expatriates; and
(e) expansion of specialized agricultural training and improvements in the
remuneration and working conditions of agricultural support staff. There has
been a renewed awareness within the Goverment that agriculture will remain
the mainstay of PIG's economy for many years. This recognition is manifested



-7-
in the greater flexibility of Government on expatriate ownership and manage-
ment of plantations, in the formulation of a national food and nutrition
policy, and in its efforts to improve agricultural services such as research,
extension and credit.
The Bank's Role
1.21      Since the country's independence in 1975, the Bank has supported
agricultural development in PNG through six projects: (a) Popondetta Small-
holder Oil Palm Development (PSOPD) Project - La. 1333-PNG of US$12 million,
effective January 6, 1977; (b) Southern Highlands Rural Development Project
- Cr. 841-PNG of US$20 million, effective February 26, 1979; (c) Second
Agricultural Credit Project - Cr. 1149-PNG of US$15 million, effective Kay 26,
1982; (d) Enga Provincial Development Project - Ln. 2125/Cr. 1227-PNG of US$ 6
million, and US$2 million, effective September 16, 1982; (e) Agricultural
Support Services Project - Ln. 2276-PNG of US$14.1 million, effective October
21, 1983, and (f) West Sepik Provincial Development Project - Ln. 2475-0-PNG
of US$9.7 million approved October 30, 1984. Of these projects only PSOPD
Project has provided assistance for oil palm smallholder development and will
be completed on December 31, 1984. In addition, IDA credits 137, and 175-PNG
for the New Britain Smallholder Development (NBSD) Project (1969-70) also
provided assistance for smallholder oil palm development prior to PNG's
independence. A PPAR (Report No. 1400) of December 28, 1976 and an impact
evaLuation report (IEL) of July 7, 1980 (Report No. 3070) are available. The
following lessons were learnt:
(a) Due to extremely fertile soils and favorable climatic conditions
palms began producing harvestable fruit bunches some two and a half
years after field planting, which was about six months earlier than
expected at appraisal, and reached peak production levels within
seven years. Actual peak yields for smaallholders at 24 ton/ha for
phase I and 19 tons/ha for phase II were also above appraisal esti-
mates of 18 tons/ha. Consequently, the appraisal ERR of 15Z was
reestimated at 19Z by PPAR in 1976, and at 25Z by IER in 1980.
(b) IER found that 1978179 average family incomes from oil palm and
surplus food sales was US$4,000 - 4,500 almost twice the appraisal
estimates. Consequently loans were repaid faster than expected.
The high incomes raised some equity considerations and IER
recommended taxation of oil palm farm incomes.
(c) Extension standards at NBSD dropped after project completion because
of reduced involvement of the more experienced national DPI staff.
However, the NE recognized that it was in their interest to improve
extension standards and therefore appointed an experienced expa-
triate as a smallholJer liaison officer. Under the proposed
project, similar arrangements will be made.
(d) Some friction between out-of-province settlers and local farmers
developed but was resolved.  Since the proposed project will not
have auy settlers, such problems are not anticipated.



8-
(e)  Some smallholders fell behind with their farm maintenance activities
due to personal and social commitments and later found the accumu-
lated maintenance too daunting. This resulted in abandonment of
some farms. Later the NE offered to rehabilitate such farms with
costs to be recovered from fruit sales. Provision of such services
by the NE has worked satisfatorily and will be adopted in proposed
project.
These lessons are reflected in the design of the proposed project.
The Company
1.22      The Milne Bay Estates Pty Ltd. (Company) was established in PNG in
1983 under PNG's Companies Aret Ch. 146 with the following objectives:
(a)  To carry on trades or businesses of planters, cultivators, harves-
ters, millers, processors, buyers, sellers, marketers, exporters,
brokers of and dealers in agricultural plants, produce or crops and
products thereof at any place;
(b)  To provide further employment opportunities for the people of PNC
and provide training for them in all aspects of the Company's
activities;
{c) To act as consultants and advisers; and
(d) To erect and construct buildings and machinery for the purposes of
the Company.
1.23      The Company was set up with an initial share capital of K 0.5f,
wholly owned by GOPNG. It has the power to increase or reduce its capital,
but the number of shareholders cannot exceed 50, and the Company cannot make
public offerings. The Articles of Association provide for three directors,
and require proper accounts and records to be kept and audited at least once
every year by independent auditors. The Company was set up specifically to
invest in and implement the nucleus estate components of the proposed project,
and it is expected that the Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) of U.K.
would invest about 60Z of the equity required to implement the proposed
project and would also provide top level managers under a management agree-
ment. Even though the Company is new, its managers (CDC) have long experience
in managing tree crop enterprises in many countries including a previous oil
palm nucleus estate at Higaturu in PNG. They are highly respected in this
sector, and under their management the Higaturu nucleus estate in PNC is a
profitable enterprise.
II. THE PROJECT AREA
2.01      The project is located in the .Gumini and Sagarai areas of the Milne
Bay Province near Alotau; the provincial capital (Nap). The province is
located in the ea:tern part of PNG (150° east and 10° south). Economically,



- 9 -
it is one of the least developed and is in the lower third of provinces in
PUG, in terms of per capita income. It is one of GOPUG's primary objectives
to encourage economic development in less developed areas such as Milne Bay
Province.
Climate
2.02      The project area receives ample rainfall, ranging between 1,600 and
3,500 mm per year and the rainfall is well distributed throughout the year.
The driest month is around December with monthly rainfall ranging between 110
to 150 mm. Average temperature is around 270C with very little variation
during the year. This hot and humid climate is ideal for tree crops such as
oil palm, cocoa, coconut and rubber. Wind speed and daily sunshine hours are
reasonable and are not expected to pose any problems for tree crop production.
Soils and Topography
2.03      Based on reconnaissance soil survey done by CDC and DBI, lands
suitable for oil palm and cocoa have been selected. Suitable soils are mainly
derived from quaternary alluvium and are classified in the following
categories:
(a) the Plantation System - having mainly deep, well-drained, well-
structured, silty clay soils found in the flat valley bottoms along
the three main rivers, and covering most of the areas which have
been previously used for plantations;
(b) the Maiwara System (Ipouli in the Sagarai area) - having mainly
highly mottled, gleyed soils with high water tables and requiring
drainage; and
(c) the Hagita System (Watubo in the Sagarai area) - with more dissected
conformation and some intrusion also of dissected sedentary as
opposed to alluvial parent material. In the higher areas, there is
much gravel in the surface horizons.
2.04      The selected lands are flat to gently sloping and are between 0 and
120 meters in elevation above sea level. Therefore, road construction and
transport would pose no problem. This area is drained by the Lauwona Creek
and the Haiwara and Gumini rivers and their tributaries. The rivers are
shallow and con be forded by 4-wheel drive vehicles year round excepting on a
days when there may be exceptional rainfall. Because of the heavy rainfall
and relatively flat topography, some of the project area (about 15Z) will
require drainage.
Infrastructure
2.05      The project area is well qerved with basic transport infrastruc-
ture. It is next to a commecial airport with a regular air service to Port
Moresby, and its north-eastern boundaries are only 10 km by road from the
underutilized deep sea port of Alotau. The port area has sufficient space for
construction of storage and bulking facilities for export of palm oil, kernel



- 10 -
and cocoa. A 28 km provincial road passes through the project area, connect-
ing Alotau to the Gumini area and ends at a ford on the Cumini river. The
road is adequate for the most part and will require only minor upgrading and
realignment. Beyond the Gumini ford and up to the Sagarai area, the Ulabo
Timber Company has constructed, improved and maintained a road to a 50 km/hr
speed standard. The road is adequate for current usage and would require only
minor upgrading for future traffic levels. There is one ford crossing within
the GCnini area and two between the Cumini and Sagarai areas. These fords can
be crossed in 4-wheel drive vehicles year-round excepting days with unusually
heavy rainfall. On such days, there are alternative routes for reaching
Sagarai using water transport. This situation will suffice during the
development phase but will have to be improved before production phase. Two
existing bridges and 12 to 20 existing culverts are adequate for now but would
require upgrading before the production phase.
Current Land Use and Production
2.06      The project area has about 5,500 ha of estate and vacant government
land suitable for cocoa and oil palm nucleus estate development (Table 2.1).
Table 2.1:  PROJECT ARFA CURRENT LAND USE

Most of the area (75%) is under secondary scrub and forest. Copra, cocoa and
rubber production is small and declining. Value of the production was
K 71,000 in 1981 and only K 55,000 in 1982. Even if value of cattle grazed on
coconut lands is added, the gross annual sales value will be around K 110.000
and allowing K 70,OOC for expenditures, the net value will be around K 40,000.
2.07      In addition, the project area has about 2,000 ha of clan lands under
secondary scrub and forest which will be suitable for oil palm cultivation.
These lands are currently not in use.
Population and Social Customs
2.08      The Milne Bay Province has a population of 128,000 of whom about
4,000 are in the Gumini and Sagarai area. There are 5 to 6 clans in the area
and two languages (Tavara and Suau) are spoken. Settlements are dispersed,



- 11 -
consisting of a few houses, each occupied by a nucleus family and with most
households in a settlement related to one another through kinship ties and
affinal links. Land is in practice owned by the sub-clan, though the senior
sibling of the eldest generation is the nominal owner. Land is generally
inherited along matrilineal lines.
2.09      Social customs in the Cumini and Sagarai areas are changing faster
than in most rural areas in PNG. This is because the project area was the
scene of heavy fighting in World War II, with about over 200,000 treops sta-
tioned there. Also the area has been a center of christian missionary acti-
vity for about a century. Consequently, there is considerable modernization
of the local population, a high degree of literacy and school attendance.
Education has also been helped by the presence of a catholic mission and
several schools in the area.
2.10      Project area farmers are familiar with cash cropping and have
visited other oil palm cultivation ar2as. Based on these visits they have
expressed enthusiasm for oil palm cultivation. This was confirmed by an
anthropological study completed in November 1981 and also during project
appraisal.
III. THE PROJECT
Objectives and Strategy
3.01      The propo-ed project has been designed to address several of QOPNGs
development objectives. First, it will address the objective of increasing
and diversifying foreign exchange earnings through investments in sectors
where PNC has competitive advantage. The project, therefore, will concentrate
its investments in the tree crop sector and mainly oil palm production for
export. Oil palm products currently form about 4Z of PNG exports, but show
great potential for growth (para. 1.06). PNG's climate and soils are excel-
lent for oil palm growth and support some of the highest oil palm yields in
the world (para. 1.12). Therefore, about 90% of the project investments will
be directed towards oil palm cultivation.
3.02      Second, the project will also address GOPNG's objective of reversing
the declines in its cocoa exports. Cocoa production and exports have declined
in PNG due to pest and disease attacks. Cocoa research in PNG has been able
to identify varieties and technological packages which would address these
problems. The proposed project will make a modest investment in demonstrating
that cocoa can be grown profitably on a commercial scale in the project area
using an appropriate technological package. However, because of the risks
involved, the investments will be kept small and limited to the nucleus
estate. If successful, a larger investment including smallholder partici-
pation will be possible.
3.03      Third, the project will address GOPNG's objective of accelerating
economic development in the least-developed provinces by virtue of its
location in the Milne Bay Province. In line with this development objective,



- 12 -
first preference for project employment will be given to qualified residents
of Milne Bay Province.
3.04      And fourth, the GOPNG objective of increasing rural employment
opportunities will also be addressed in the project through choice of
technologies. For instance, manual land clearing techniques will be used
throughout most of the project area.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.05      By its support to the proposed project, the Barc  will encourage
greater inflow of risk capital into PNG along with scarce management exper-
tise. The tieing of risk capital to the expatriate management input will
ensure that there is a greater performance incentive and therefore a higher
quality expatriate management input. Through the project, the Bank will also
encourage greater smallholder participation, institution building sectoral
development and training of local staff, and indeed these aspects of the
project were strengthened during project appraisal. Combining oil palm pro-
duction, processing and marketing into one project will also permit the Bank
to monitor ccsts of these separate activ-ities better (para. 4.13); and since
these costs are critical in determining fruit prices (para. 1.19), this will
help ensure that the pricing of smallholder oil palm fruits is done in an
equitable way. Through the project, the Bank will assist in furthering the
development of one of the less developed provinces of PNG.
Brief Description
3.06      The proposed project will include:
(a) Nucleus Estate
(i) development of 3,700 ha of oil palm nucleus estate plantation;
(ii) development of 750 ha of cocoa nucleus estate plantation;
(iii) construction of a 30 ton per hour oil palm mill with associated
maintenance, transport and storage infrastructure;
(iv) construction of a cocoa fermentary;
(v) provision of administrative, technical and training support;
(vi) construction of 560 housing units for labor and
administrative   staff;
(b) Smallholder and Infrastructure
(i) development of 1,000 ha of smallholder oil palm blocks;
(ii) construction of three bridges and upgrading of provincial and
other access roads, bridges and culverts;



- 13 -
(iii) construction of health, education and police protection
facilities; and
(iv) strengthening of extension, research and project preparation.
Detailed Features - Nucleus Estate
3.07      Oil Palm Plantation and Nursery:  About 3700 ha of oil palm wilL be
planted in the project area over four years, starting in the second year of
the project (Table 3.1). Most of the oil palm (88X) will be planted in a
compact block on the Gumini side, which is nearer to Alotau port and requires
relatively less in terms of infrastructure strengthening. This will decrease
transportation costs and increase returns. In addition, this will allow oil
palm plantation development -nd initial production to proceed without being
encumbered by the pace of infrastructure strengthening between 'umini and
Sagarai.
Table 3.1:  OIL PALM PLANTING PROGRA1 (ha)
1       2       3       4       5       6       Total
Annual plantings          -       800    1,200   1,250    450      -       3,700
Oil palm would be planted on the Sagarai side at the beginning of fifth year
of the project and production will start two and a half years later, by the
end of the seventh year, thereby allowing sufficient time for infrastructure
strengthening. Land clearing will start in year 1 and would not pose a
serious problem since about half the area is under secondary scrub and old
coconut. The scrub would be cleared manually using contract labor wherever
possible. However, use of mechanical equipment will be necessary in coconut
areas to eliminate stumps and thereby minimize Ganoderma infection in oil palm
plantings. PNG Forest Department has received enquiries for the supply of
coconut stems and efforts will be made to export coconut stems removed during
land clearing. Currently, there is an export market for ultrathin logs and
the Forest Department has indicated that it will encourage export of such
timber from areas cleared for agricultural use. A timber extraction company
is currently operating in the GCnini/Sagarai area and has excess extraction
and road building capacity. The timber company has offered to extract and
expor: ultra-thins and help with field road and drainage construction. This
arrangement is currently being negotiated. Along with land clearing, road and
drainage construction work will be started. Drainage will need particular
attenLiob in Sago paLm areas and an excavator will be provided for improving
natural water channels and installing main drains. About 30 kn of drains will
be constructed. In addition, 37 km of main roads and 185 km of secondary
roads will be constructed to facilitate year-round transport of fruit bunches
to the mill using 6-8 ton trucks. Main roads will have 5 m wide pavement of
15 cm compacted gravel and shoulders 1.5 m wide. Secondary roads will have



- 14 -
only 4 m wide pavement of 10 cm compacted gravel and 1 m wide shoulders.  G.I.
pipe culverts will be provided where necessary and are estimated at 25-30 m
per km of road. Planting will be done using 137 one-year old seedlings per
ha.  Balanced fertiLizer dressings will be required and ammonium sulphate will
be used in preference to urea during the establishment phase in view of the
possibility of sulphur deficiency. Seedlings will be obtained from an oil
palm nursery to be established in the project area.
3.08      A one-stage nursery will be established on 20 ha near the mill
site. It will use topsoil from that area and water from a nearby river.
Heat-treated and germinated seed of the Tenera variety from Dami Research
Station will be used. The nursery will produce about 14,000 seedlings per ha
per year and would supply both nucleus estate and smallholders. Production
would be sufficient to allow for 25% losses and culling. The oil palm nursery
and plantation will together cost about K 8.9 million CUS$ 10.0 million).
3.09      Cocoa Plantation and Nurser:  About 750 ha of cocoa plantation will
be established on the Sagarai side of the project area. Initially, about 75
ha each of existing rubber and coconut will be used as shade to accelerate
establishment. Simultaneously glyricidia (a fast growing shade tree) will be
established in secondary forest areas after land clearing. Land clearing
procedures will be similar to those for oil palm plantation. Cocoa planting
will be one year after land clearing and shade establishment. Cocoa planting
material will be from seed gardens utilizing VSD-resistant clones and
obtainable from the Lowland Agriculture Experiment Station at Keravat, the
Cocoa Industry Board and commercial sources within PNC. Foliar nutrient spray
will be applied at six to eight week intevals. Cocoa planting will start in
year 2 and will be completed over six years (Table 3.2). Field roads will be

constructed in project years 4 and 5 and about 7.5 km of primary and 22.5 km
of secondary roads will be constrcuted. Road standards will be the same as
for oil palm plantation (para. 3.07). Urea, TSP and muriate of potash will be
applied during the establishment phase. The base cost of cocoa plantation
development, including nursery, will be about K 1.6 million (U$ 1.8 million).
3.10      Oil Palm Processing:  A 30 ton per hour oil palm mill will be
established on the Gumini side, about 24 km from Alotau Port, along an exist-
ing provincial road. The mill will have-a single processing line with three
10 ton per hour screw presses. A fruit reception and storage area will be
provided. In order to minimize civil works construction costs, which are very



- 15 -
high in PNG, the storage area at the mill site will be minimized, and fruit
collection scheduled in line with processing. This will be possible because
most of the plantation will be under the same management as the mill and the
responsibilizy for fruit transport will be under the mill manager
(para. 5.04). A sterilizer station with conventional single-door vessels will
be provided. The mill will be powered by self-generated electricity produced
by two single-stage steam turbo-alternators. The steam will be generated in
water-tube boilers fired by burning palm fruit waste fiber and nut shell.
Turbine exhaust steam will be used for sterlizing fresh fruit and to facili-
tate threshing. A single drum thresher and twin incinerators will be provided
to remove fruit from bunches and to dispose of the empty bunches.  Conven-
tional digestors and 10 ton per hour twin screw hydraulic presses will be
provided to extract palm oil. A kernel station with drying silos, nut
crackers, and combined pneumatic/hydrocylone separation system will be pro-
vided to produce dried and bagged palm kernels for shipment. Palm oil from
the presses will be passed to a clarification station beiore being pumped to
storage. A water supply plant including treatment facilities will also be
included. Effluent from the mill will be treated in open ponds by aerobic and
anaerobic methods. Palm oil storage tanks of 7,500 ton capacity will be
constructed with about half this capacity at the mill and the other half at
the port. Storage for about 300 ton of kernel will be provided at the mill.
At the port there are several underutilized warehouses for rent and no new
warehouse will be constructed. The mill will be provided with a maintenance
workshop and initially 12 trucks for fruit collection. The base cost for oil
palm processing and storage, including incremental working capital, will be
about K 10.1 million (US$ 11.3 million).
3.11      Cocoa Processing:  A cocoa fermentary and drier with a processing
capacity of 13 tons DBE per day will be provided in the Sagarai area. The
factory will be equipped with wooden fermentary boxes, solid fuel fired
driers, diesel power generators and bean processing equipment. Fuel tanks and
water supply equipment will also be included. The base cost of cocoa pro-
cessing, including incremental working capital will be about K 0.8 million
(USe 0.9 million).
3.12      Administrative Support:  CDC, under a management contract, will
manage the nucleus estate develpment and for this purpose will provide the
General Manager and the Company Secretary/Accountant (para. 5.02). Additional
staff for functions related to finance, personnel, medical and central work-
shop and building departments will also be provided to facilitate nucleus
estate development. Staff salaries, fees and expenses will be capitalized for
the first five years of development during which cash from operations are not
available to cover these expenditures (K5.8 million or USS 6.9 million). In
addition, headquarter and divisional offices and stores will be constructed at
a cost of K 0.5 million (US$0.6 million). Power supply, workshop and mainte-
nance equipment, personnel vehicles, some construction equipment and furniture
will together cost about K 2.2 million (US$2.4 million). About 145 man-months
of training will be provided to local staff to enable them to take up higher
responsibilities after project development phase. The total base cost will be
about K 8.9 million (US$ 9.9 million).

3.13      Housing:  During the development phase, three villages for estate
labor will be provided in the Cumini area, and one in the Sagarai area.  Each
village will have 100 housing units with associated recreation facilities.
Labor housing has been estimated on the basis of two labor units per house.
An additional 100 labor housing units will be required during the production
phase, when additional labor for harvesting will be required. These will be
constructed in phase II, after completion of the proposed project. 76 housing
units for labor supervisors (bosbois) and 84 housing units for other staff
will also be provided. The total cost of housing will be about K 4.2 million
(US$ 4.7 million).
Detailed Features - Smallholder Areas and Infrastructure
3.14      Smallholder Oil Palm.  About 1,000 ha of smallholder oil palms will
be planted under the proposed project by about 330 families. Sufficient suit-
able clan lands are available around the nucleus estate areas on both the
Gumini and Sagarai sides. These lands will be surveyed by Provincial Depart-
ments of Primary Industry and Lands and block boundaries demarcated. Individ-
ual holdings will range from 2 to 4 ha. These holdings will be aggregated to
the greatest extent possible to facilitate clearing and development and to
reduce road requirements. In line with an anthropological study and in
response to local views, no outside settlers will be invited and all small-
holder oil palm areas will be developed by existing owners.  Because of this
restriction, the number of potential applicants will be less than in other oil
palm smallholder developments in PNG, where outside settlers were included.
In view of this, GOPNC will have to use a slightly different approach.  For
instance, fewer applicants will have to be rejected so that the maximum
possible participation from project area smallholders is achieved. In view of
relatively high returns to the economy (para. 8.10) from smallholder oil palm,
even under relatively low yield estimates, GOPNG and project management will,
in the circumstances, find it both necessary and beneficial to provide
adequate incentives to farmers. At negotiations, GOPNG gave an assurance that
farmer participation levels and incentives for each calendar year will be
reviewed by March 31 of the next year and discussed with the Bank with a view
to ensuring the maximum possible farmer participation in the project. Since
the proposed village oil palm area is currently under secondary forest, the
project management will negotiate a timber extraction contracts for ultra thin
logs and for construction of access (10 km) and subdivision (35 km) roads.
Revenue from timber will help offset road construction costs. After merchan-
table timber has been removed, farmers will clear underbrush and prepare land
for planting. The nucleus estate will supply oil palm planting material to
the farmers and if requested by DDF also fertilizer and agricultural tools.
At negotiations, the Company gave an assurance that it will meet all planting
material requirements of oil palm smallholders in the project area at a
reasonable price and GOPNG gave an assurance that it will ensure that
fertilizer and agricultural tools are provided to smallholders at a reasonable
price. The planting material and fertilizer will comprise in-kind credit of
about K 800/ha and such credit will be provided by ABPNG. In addition,
materials worth K 1,000 will be provided on credit for 20X of the farmers for
improvements in water supply and housing.  This will be used as an incentive
for good field maintenance during the establishment phase and will be offered
only to better performers. The cost of the smallholder component will be



- 17 -
K 1.4 million (US$1.6 million), inclusive of farmer's sweat equity of about
K 0.4 million.
3.15      Physical Infrastructure.  Though the project area is currently well
served by roads, some upgrading and realignment will be desirable for heavier
traffic expected during the production phase. For transportation within the
Gumini area, the requirements are minor and are expected to cost K 0.5 million
(US$0.6 million). This includes 16 km of road upgrading, and 3 km of new
alignment to bypass the Hagita mission school, costing K 0.2 million. In
addition, a single lane Bailey bridge will be constructed across the Kaiwara
river and some existing culverts and bridges replaced, costing K 0.3 million.
Upgrading roads and river crossings between Gumini and Sagarai will be more
expensive (K 1.2 million), and will involve construction of two new bridges
and connecting roads over the Gumini and Sagarai rivers costing K 1.0 million,
and minor toad and culvert improvements costing K 0.2 million. The base cost
of this component will be about K 1.7 million (US$1.9 million).
3.16      Social Infrastructure.  Health and education facilities in the
project area will be upgraded by GOPNG. A rural health center will be con-
structed in the Gumini area and a health aid post on the Sagarai side. Pri-
mary school facilities will be expanded by adding four double classrooms in
the Gumini area and two on the Sagarai side. Associated staff housing and
furnishing will also be provided. In view of the influx of estate laborers,
and security concerns of the local population, a new police post will be
established in the Gumini plantation area, with seven L-40 type staff
houses. The total base cosL will be K 0.7 million (US$0.8 million).
3.17      Extension, Research and Studies.  The National DPI will strengthen
local DPI extension services by establishing a project office and posting an
experienced Project Coordinator (PC) and five other extension staff. An
office and housing for these staff will be constructed and suitably equipped.
Two 6-ton trucks and a tractor trailer will be provided to help with the
transport of planting material and fertilizer. Transport for extension staff
will also be provided. The extension work will involve training of farmers by
extension officers who in-turn will be trained by both PC and research
staff. Extension support over six years will cost K 0.8 million (US$0.9
million). Currently, little research is being done on oil palm cultivated by
smallholders, on physiology of pollination and on ways of increasing effi-
ciency and yield of oil palm grown under smallholder conditions. To rectify
this deficiency, the project will provide staff salaries and provide direct
experiment and transport requirements for smallholder research, at a cost of
K 0.15 million. There is also a need to strengthen regional oil palm research
at Milne Bay in particular, in view of the planned expansion of oil palm in
that area. The project will provide staff salaries, allowances, travel and
experiment costs of K 14,000/annum for an oil palm research substation at
Milne Bay and for a study of the physiology of pollination. The project will
also provide about 30 man-months of technical assistance for identifying and
preparing a tree crop project at a cost of K 0.3 million. The total base cost
of this component will be about K 1.5 million (US$1.7 million).

Environmental Aspects
3.18      The project will establish tree crops in areas which are currently
occupied by secondary forest, brush and run-down plantations. Clearing
methods will involve minimal soil disturbance thereby preventing soil erosion
(para. 3.07). Appropriate drainage and establishment of leguminous cover
crops will further reduce soil erosion and enhance soil fertility. The small
quantities of agrochemicals used to control weeds, pests and diseases will not
have any significantly adverse environmental effects. Potentially dangerous
effluent from the oil palm processing mill will be rendered biologically inert
through treatment to standards appropriate to Papua New Guinea (para. 3.10).
IV. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
Project Cost
4.01      The project will cost K 52.8 million (US$59.2 million) of which
K 1.8 million (US$2.0 million) will be in duties and taxes and K 27.6 million
(US$30.9 million) in foreign exchange (Annex 1). The total financing require-
ment, inclusive of interest during construction on loans to the Company will
be about K 60.3 million (US$68.3 million) of which K 2.2 million (US$2.9 mil-
lion) will be in duties, taxes and on-lending fee, and K 34.7 million
(US$39.1 million) in foreign exchange (Table 4.1). Interest during construc-
tion is included in the financial requirements, because the Company is new
(para. 1.22) and therefore cash flow from operations will not be available to
offset interest payments. Base costs are calculated on June 1984 estimates
updated to December 1984. PhysicaL contingency estimates for civil works
average about 8.6%, and for other categories about 3.7%. Price contingencies
are based on an estimated local inflation of 8% in 1985, 7.5% in 1986; and 8Z
between 1987-90. Inflation in foreign costs is estimated at 5% in 1985; 7.5%
in 1986 and 8% between 1987-90. Total physical contingencies amount to 5.5%
of base cost and expected price increases amount to 26%.
Financing
4.02      The proposed IBRD loan of US$27.6 million equivalent (42% of net
financing requirement) will finance 52X of foreign exchange requirements and
28% of local cost, (net of duties, taxes and on-lending fee). The loan will
be at standard variable interest rate for 17 years with 6.5 years grace period
(Table 4.2).

4.03      Onlending Terms for Bank Lean. From the proceeds of the Bank loan,
GPOG will invest US$1.6 N as equity in the Company, and will onlend
US$18.5 million to the Company and US$0.7 million to ABPNG. the loan to the
Company will be at variable interest rate of 1.55% above six-month LIBOR for
17 years and with 0.75% comnitment charge. The Coupany will bear the foreign
exchange risk.  The loan to ABPNG will be at 8% fo- 17 years with 6.5 years of
grace with GOPNG bearing the foreign exchange risk. ABPIG will advance in-
kind credit to smallholders for planting material, fertilizer and some housing
construction (US$0.8 million) at llS interest rate for 15 years with 5-year
grace period. The interest rate to final beneficiaries are five percentage
points above the long-term inflation rate projection of about 6Z. A margin of
3% points for ABPNG is considered adequate because loan disbursement and
collection will be done by the Company and default on oil palm credit is
insignificant. For onlending of the Bank loan, signing of a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement (SLA) between GOPNC and the Company, acceptable to the Bank, will be
a condition of loan effectiveness and signing an SL& between COPNG and ABPNG
will be a condition of disbursement for the smaLLholder credit component.  The
Bank will also enter into a Project Agreement with the Company.
4.04      Cofinancing terms:  CDC will contribute 60% of the equity require-
ment of the Company, which will amount to US$14.3 N equivalent. In addition,
CDC will make a pound sterling loan directly to the Company, which during the
project period will amount to US$17.5 M equivalent. The loan will be at 9%
interest rate for 16 years with an eight year grace period. Signing of a Loan
Agreement between the Company and CDC, acceptable to the Bank, is a condition
of loan effectiveness.

4.06      Civil Works (US$22.7 million).  The construction of the oil palm
factory, bulking station, staff quarters and labor housing costing about
US$11.6 miLlion, (excluding administration and supervision costs) will be
carried out under five contracts after ICS in accordance with Bank guidelines.
About 20 separate contracts will be awarded for estate offices and fermentary
(US$1.0 million), some housing (US$1.5 million) and roads (US$3.8 million);
social infrastructure (US$0.8 million), new bridges and roads (US$2.2 million)
following LCB procedures in which foreign contractors are eligible to partici-
pate. LCB procedures are justified because these works are small and
scattered over 50 locations and are to be implemented over five years.  DIS
will use force account for upgrading of provinciae roads (US$1.4 million) and
smallholder roads (US$0.7 million). Force account is justified because the
upgrading will require work on short stretches of road in remote locations
which is unlikely to be of interest to most contractors.



- 22 -
4.07      Equipment and Vehicles (US 11.7 million).  Most machinery, equipment
and transport (83Z) worth US$9.7 million will be procured following ICB
procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. Some furnishings, small office
and workshop equipment (US$1.8 million) will be procured by the Company in
small quantities over six years through LCB procedures in which foreign
suppliers are eligible to participate, or for items less than $75,000 in value
by shopping with at least three suppliers. Similarly, vehicles and equipment
(US$0.23 million) for extension and research services will be procured by DPI
using LCB procedures, or for items less than $75,000 in value by shopping with
at least three suppliers.
4.08      Agrochemicals (US$3.7 million):  Fertilizers and agrochemicals worth
US$3.1 million (85%) will be procured following ICB procedures. Other
chemicals worth US$0.6 million will be procured in small quantities over six
years, and will not be suitable for ICB. These will be purchased by LCB or
for items less than $75,000 in value, by shopping with at least three
suppliers.
4.09      Other (US$21.1 million):  Technical assistance and training (US$0.7
million), to be financed by the Bank, will be procured following Bank guide-
lines. Other technical assistance (US$0.3 million) will be cofinanced and
will follow CDC procedures. Land (US$0.4 million) is being purchased through
negotiations after independent valuation. The remainder is for staff salaries
(US$9.5 million), agricultural labor wages (US$4.1 million), incremetal
operating expenditures (US$4.7 million) and incremental working capital
(US$1.4 million).
4.10      Contract Review. After an initial review of standard bidding docu-
mints by the Bank for LCB contracts, only bidding documn ts for contracts
estimted to eaeead US$300,000 will be revioned prior to issuance. This will
result in a Bank review of only siz bidding documnts covering 83S of the
value of contracts. Similarly, all bidding packages for equipment and
vehicles estimated to cost over US$150,000 will be revionwd prior to issuance,
and this will result in Bank review of six bidding docments covering 88M of
the value of equipment and vehicles to be proeured by the project. The
remaiing contracts will be reviowed on a random basis.
Digburseomnt
4.11      Disbursements under the Bank loan will be completed by September 30,
1992 - approximately seven years after Board Presentation (Annex 2, table
5).  This compares with the typical disbursemeem period of about eight years
for agriculture projects in the ECast Asia & Pacific Region. The seven year
disbursement period is considered reasonable because the project implemeta-
tion in expected to begin in erly 1985; much ahead of Board Presentation,
giving the project a head sta-rt over the typical agricultural project for
which implementation usually begins after Board approval. In addition, mueh
of the project will be managed by experienced CDC staff who can draw upon the
oeperience, systms and designs from an earlier successful oil palm
development at Higaturu in PUG. Therefore, the seven year disbursement period
for the proposed project is considered realistic.



- 23 -
4.12      Disbursements from the Bank loan vill be made tor:
(1) Nucleus Estate
(a) 100Z of foreign expenditures on directly imported machinery
equipment and vehicles and on training, or 85Z of local
expenditures on locally procured machinery, equipment and
vehicles; and
(b) 77Z of expenditures on civil works for processing, storage and
housing.
(2) Other
(a) 95Z of expenditures on physical and social infrastructure,
smallholder credit, incremental operating expenditures for
extension and research; and
(b) 85% of expenditures on equipment vehicles, and technical
assistance.
Disbursements for road and bridge upgrading (US$1.7 million), smallholder
credit (US$0.7 million) and for extension and research incremental operating
cost (US$1.2 million) will be made quarterly on a Statement of Expenditure
(SOE) basis. The SOE's will be prepared by the Project Coordinator (PC) from
the consolidated quarterly project accounts. Detailed documentation support-
ing SOEs will be retained at PC's office, and will be audited and made availa-
ble to the Bank for inspection during supervision. Disbursements for other
components (US$24.0 million) will be based on fully documented withdrawal
applications, which will be collected by the Department of Finance and sent to
the Dank for reimbursement (para. 5.09). Special accounts are not needed. In
view of the need to start project implementation before Board Presentation
(para. 4.11, 5.14), retroactive financing of up to US$0.3 million is
recommended for eligible expenditures after July 15, 1984.
Accounting and Audit
4.13      The Company is obliged by its articles of association to maintain
proper accounts and records according to accepted accounting procedures consi-
stently applied, and to have these accounts audited at least once every year
by independent auditors. The Company will maintain separate accounts and
profit centers for its field and processing (including transport and market-
ing) divisions. At negotiations, the Company gave an assurance that indepen-
dently audited income statement, balance sheet, and sources and application of
fund statement along with auditors findings will be made available to the Bank
within six months of the end of each fiscal year. ABPNG, DPI and DWS will
maintain separate project accounts and at negotiations, appropriate assurances
were given by GOPNG. DPI and DWS will maintain accounts in accordance with
GOPIG accounting procedures which are sound and consistently applied. ABPNG
will maintain accounts in accordance with procedures and format established
under Dank assisted Agricultural Credit II Project (Cr. 1149). At
negotiations COPNG gave assurances that the project accounts including SOE



- 24 -
will be maintained by DPI, OWS and ABPNG, and will be audired by independent
auditors and made available to the Bank within six months of the end of the
fiscal year.
V. Organization and Management
5.01      The following institutions will have the primary responsibility for
implementing the proposed project.
(a) the Milne Bay Estates Co. Pty. Limited (The Company); and
(b) the Department of Primary Industries (DPI).
Project implementation will also be assisted by the Department of Works and
Supply (DWS) and by the Agricultural Bank of Papua New Guinea (ABPNG).
The Company
5.02      The Company (Annex 3) will be responsible for implementing the
nucleus estate components covering 86Z of the project cost. It will be headed
by a policy making Board of Directors; consisting of representatives of the
main shareholders - GOPNG and CDC. The Chief executive responsibility will be
with the General Manager. It is expected that GOPNG will enter into a manage-
ment agreement with CDC under which CDC will provide the General Manager and
the Company Secretary, who will also act as the Chief Financial Officer.
Signing of the management agreement and signing and effectiveness of the joint
venture agreement acceptable to the Bank, is a condition of effectiveness.
The General Manager will supervise seven officers of the Company, who in turn
will be heading the following divisions and offices.
5.03      Field Divisions.  There will be three Field Divisions reporting to
the General Manager, each having responsibility for plantation development
over a specified area of the nucleus estate. For this purpose oil palm plan-
tation in the Gumini area will be divided into two Field Divisions of about
1,650 ha each and fields in the Sagarai area will form the third Field Divi-
sion with 750 ha of cocoa and 450 ha of oil palm. Each Division will be
headed by a Division Manager. The Division will be split into four to five
field operations of 200 to 400 ha, each having a supervisor reporting to the
Divisional Manager. Each Division Manager will have a decentralized field
office with two Assistants helping him in office management and field supervi-
sion. Each Field Division will act as a separate profit center with indi-
vidual accounts, and will have decentralized field stores.
5.04      Processing and Workshop. There will be a Processing and Workshop
Division responsible for fruit collection from nucleus estate and smallhold-
ers; central stores and workshop; processing; and transport of finished pro-
ducts to the port. The Division will be headed by a Manager, reporting to the
General Manager. The Divisional Manager will have the following officers
reporting to him:
(a) A Stores Controller heading the Central Stores;



- 25 -
(b) A Workshop Superintendent heading the Central Workshop;
(c) A Factory Engineer heading Oil Palm Processing;
(d) A Superintendent heading the Cocoa Fermentary; and
(e) A Superintendent heading the Transport Department
The oil palm mill and the cocoa fermentary will act as separate profit
centers. The remaining departments described below will only act as cost
centers with individual accounts. but no profit responsibility.
5.05      Building Department.  To supervise civil works construction, there
will be a Building Department headed by a Superintendent. Most of the civil
works construction will be contracted out, and this Department wiLl avoid
doing direct construction work other than for some roads, and drains and for
building maintenance. This will ensure that the Department can focus-its full
attention on supervision of construction.
5.06      Administration.  The administration office will be responsible for
all personnel and public relations matters and will be headed by a Personnel
Officer. This office will be responsible, after project compLetion, for
providing a smallholder liaison officer. The liaison office will ensure that
smallholders continue to get inputs and services needed to ensure good yields.
5.07      Finance. The finance office will be headed by the Company Secre-
tary. He will be assisted by an accountant responsible for financial planning
and control, a cashier responsible for the treasury and a head clerk responsi-
ble for general accounting and bookkeeping. The head clerk will be assisted
by five clerks responsible for recording of payroll, assets, Liability/loan
disbursements, ezpenditure, and revenue. The Company Secretary will ensure
that quarterly reports are prepared and copies are sent to the Bank.
The Department of Primary Industries (DPI)
5.08      DPI will be responsible for coordinating the non-nucleus estate
components of the project, which together form 14Z of the project cost. For
the purposes of the project, DPI has designated a Field Project Manager (FPM)
who is to be stationed at Alotau in the Milne Bay Province. At negotiations,
COPNG gave an assurance that a FPM, acceptable to the Bank will be appointed
by March 31, 1986, and maintained thereafter for the duration of the project
and will be made responsible for coordinating the non-nucleus estate compo-
nents of the Project.
5.09      FPM will report to the Deputy Secretary, National DPI and will be
assisted by a smalL staff consisting of a field supervisor, three extension
officers, and office support staff. These officers will help in encouraging
smallholders to plant oil palms and in selecting and registering them. They
will provide training and inputs (obtained from nucleus estate) to the small-
holders. The officers will receive training from AC and agricultural research
staff. A finAncial officer in the National DPI office will be designated for
the purposes of collecting disbursement requests and sending them to the Bank.



- 26 -
Other implementing Agencies
5.10      DWS will be responsible for construction of roads, bridges, DPI
offices and houses, and social infrastructure. DWS departments in Port
Moresby wilL assist in the planning, design, and preparation of tender docu-
ments. The existing provincial branch of DWS at Alotau will supervise the
construction for which one engineer and three construction supervisors will be
assigned by the DWS.
5.11      ABPNG will be responsible for the smallholder credit component and
this responsibility will be assigned to ABPNG office at Alotau. Since the
credit will be disbursed in-kind only, the Company and DPI will assist in
credit disbursement and the load on ABPNG will be small. ABPNG will also
advise in settler selection which will be the responsibility of PC. The
credit collection will be done by the Company. This again will lessen
administration load of ABPNG.
Project Implementation Plan and Actions
5.12      The project will be implemented over a six year time period, though
some immature plantings (24Z) will continue to be maintained on average for
less than a year beyond this time period. The maintenance of these ismature
plantings will be financed out of funds generated by other plantings.
5.13      The Company has already started initial implementation activities.
Agreements for transfer of Sagarai lands, and of Waigani plantations and
Government lands on Gumini side have been signed. Owners of Gili-Gili and
Hagita plantations have also agreed to transfer their plantations to the
Company. Signing of all agreements for transfer of these lands is a condition
of Loan Effectiveness.
5.14      The Company has already started actions for the establishment of an
oil palm nursery. Bidding documents for initial purchase of equipment and
vehicles are being prepared. Construction of processing facilities will begin
in October 1986, and the detailed design work will be undertaken during
1985/86 (Annex 3). At that time, introduction of some innovative features of
the Hoskins Oil Palm Mill in the West New Britain, will be considered. Estate
offices and housing will be of standard designs available from the earlier oil
palm plantation at Higaturu, and construction has already started. Social and
physical infrastructure will follow standard DWS designs and these are already
available. Construction plans and detailed design for road improvements and
structures will be prepared by DWS during 1985.

VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES
Yield
6.01      Oil palm yields on the nucleus estate are expected to average about
26 tons ffb per ha at full maturity (Table 6.1).
Table 6. 1.  NUCLEUS ESTATE OIL PALM YIELD PROJECTION
(tons ffb per ha)
1     2     3     4     5     6-12    13-25
Annual yield            -     -     9      18   23      26     25-20
The projected average yields are below the 34-35 tons ffbJha yields achieved
on some farms, because soil conditions and management supervision will not be
uniformly ideal and because early yield flushes produced by efficient weevil
pollination are likely to be followed by a period of temporary yield depression.
6.02      Oil palm yields on the smallholder farms are expected to be lower
than on the nucleus estate, reaching a peak yield of about 19.5 tons ffb per ha
(Table 6.2).
Table 6.2.  SMALLHOLDER OIL PALM YIELD PROJECTION
(tons ffb per ha)
1     2     3     4     5        6       7-13    14-25
Annual yield            -     -     -      10    13       17     19.5    18-15
The projected yield is at the lower end of the range of smallholder yields
(19-24 tons ffb/ha) reported by the impact evaluation report on a previous oil
palm project in PNG (para. 1.11). In previous projects there was a mix of
traditional village society and more modern settlement. Yields from oil palms
grown under traditional village society conditions are lower because farmeri
have to meet many social demands for ceremonies, feasts and funerals which
lead to suboptimal maintenAnce and harvesting of oil palms. Though projected
smallholder yields at Milne Bay would have been higher if more modern settle-
ments were introduced, this alternative has not been followed because of the
recommendations of an anthropological study as well as wishes of the local
population (para. 3.14). Efforts will still be made to adapt the production
system to the social demands of the traditional village society as has been
successfully achieved at Hoskins. This involves the nucleus estate providing



- 28 -
some of its estate labor to smallholders at cost, for maintenance or
harvesting during periods when social obligations prevent smallholders from
harvesting fruit or maintaining fields.
6.03      Oil palm fruits will be collected from the field and taken to the
oil palm mill, where oil and kernel will be extracted. The extraction rate is
projected to be 22 to 23X by weight for palm oil and 4 to 5% for kernel.
6.04      Cocoa will be grown only on the nucleus estate and is expected to
yield about 1.8 tons/ha at full maturity (Table 6.3).
Table 6.3. NUCLEUS ESTATE COCOA YIELD PROJECTION

At Keravat Research Station peak yields of about 3.0 ton/ha have been reached.
The projected yields are lower because soil conditions and management will not
be ideal in all fields.
Production
6.05      Production will be built up slowly (Annex 4) and reach a peak
production of 118,000 tons ffb for oil palm and 1,280 tons for cocoa in year
11 (Table 6.4).
Table 6.4. ANNUAL PRODUCTION ('000 tons)

Oil palm production includes about 2,800 tons ffb produced by major outgrowers
outside the project, but processed in the project mill.

Markets and Prices2/
6.06      Palm Oil.  World exports of palm oil are about 3 million-tons of
which PNG's share in 1983 was 3%. Palm oil accounts for 14Z of world trade in
edible oils and fats, second only to soyabean oil. Market share of palm oil
has been growing such that palm oil now accounts for 30% of the annual
increase of some 75,000 tons in world trade of oils and fats. In view of this
the incremental production of 27,000 tons over 11 years will be absorbed
easily. Palm oil price is currently US$710/ton cif Europe, but is expected to
drop from current high levels by 22Z in the next 11 years. The fob price in
1995, is expected to be K 445.1 ton (Annex 4).
6.07      Palm Kernel.  World trade in palm kernel and palm kernel oil is
about 520,000 ton of which PNG's share is about 3%. Palm kernel oil is a
close substitute of coconut oil, but has a less than 25Z share of lauric oil
market. The incremental production increase of some 6,000 tons over 11 years
will not pose a marketing problem. Palm kernel price is currently US$525 per
ton c.i.f. UK but is expected to drop 14% in the next 11 years from current
high levels, and the fob price in 1995 is expected to be about K 188/ton.
6.08      Cocoa.  World trade in cocoa is currently about 1.5 million tons of
which PNG contributes 2%. Project incremental production of 1,260 tons will
be only 0.1% of world trade and 4% of PNG exports. This production will only
partially offset the 8,700 ton decline in PNG production since 1975 when PNG
exports formed 2.4% of world trade. As such marketing of cocoa should not
pose a problem. 1984 cocoa price was US$2,380/ton c.i.f. UK and is expected
to drop from these high levels by some 15Z over 11 years, and the fob price in
1985 is expected to be about K 1,558/ton.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      The main financial beneficiaries of the project will be project
smallholders in the Cumini and Sagarai areas of the Milne Bay Province, the
Company, and GOPNG, through their shares in the Company, and from income tax
paid by the Company. An analysis of financial cost benefits and risks,
discussed below, indicates that the project will be financially attractive to
the beneficiaries and will, therefore, provide sufficient incentives for their
participation. In addition, the overall impact on GOPNG Budget will also be
beneficial.
Smallholder Financial Returns
7.02      Financial Benefits.  The typical smallholder participant will have a
3 ha oil palm farm, which will reach a peak production of about 57 tons of oil
palm fruit p.a. within seven years from planting giving the farmer about K
3,200 p.a. in gross revenue. The annual outlay on fertilizer and chemicals
2/   A full discussion of markets and prices is given in Price Prospects for
Major Primary Commodities (Report No. 814).



- 30 -
will be K 228 which is only 7% of che revenue. Even if the imputed cost of
farmer's labor is included, the operating costs will be 25% of oil palm
revenue, and yielding K 2,400 in net income. Based on this income the
financial rate of return (IRR) will be a very attractive 30Z, and will provide
sufficient incentive for the farmer to grow oil palms as proposed (Annex 5).
The in-kind credit proposed under the project will involve an initial outlay
of only K 1,290 per family (constant terms). Interest at 11% for smallholders
will be capitalized for four years, at the end of which debt outstanding will
be about K 1,930 (nominal terms).  The debt will be repayed over ten years in
equal payments of principal and interest, amounting to K 309 per year. This
debt service level is reasonable and will amount to only 10% of net cashflow
before debt service.
7.03      Cost Recovery. Smallholder oil palm direct development cost of
K 1,417 per ha tK 4,251 per family) consists of roughly 30% farmer's equity,
30% credit package and 40% infrastructure development costs. The credit pack-
age is relatively small, and experience shows that full repayment of principal
and interest can be expected. In addition, the proposed interest rate of 11%
represents a real interest rate of about 5% above inflation. At a 10% dis-
count rate the cost recovery index for the credit package will be 80% and in
present value terms, there will be a subsidy of about K 0.1 million. If
infrastructure and extension costs are added, the cost to GOPNG (in present
value terms), will be about K 1.1 million. This will be completely offset by
export tax revenues on palm oil to be produced by the project. Therefore, the
project will not place any burden on GOPNG finances.
Nucleus Estate - Financial Benefits
7.04      The project will generate K 13.5 million in revenues per annum by
year 10 (Table 7.1).

After allowing for production costs, R 5.2 million will be left as annual net
income. Of this COPNG will be the main beneficiary receiving K 1.8 million
(35Z of net income) as taxes and dividends. About 25Z will go as finance
charges, 152 to CDC as dividends and the remaining 25Z will be available to
the Company for future investments or for distribution as additional
dividends. If GOPNG and CDC shares of retained earnings are included, GOPNG
will receive K 2.3 M and CDC, K 1.5 M.
Nucleus Estate Operating Costs
7.05      The production and marketing cost of the nucleus estate will be
about 62Z of revenues (Table 7.2).

Nearly half the expenditure will be on fruit production and procurement cost,
one quarter on administrative overheads and the remaining costs will be for
processing, marketing and depreciation.
Financial Rates of Return for the Nucleus Estate
7.06      The financial rate of return on the nucleus estate investment is
about 11% in real terms (Annex 5), equivalent to a nominal return of about
17Z.  The returns are sufficient to cover interest charges on the borrowed
capital, which will average 10X. This will give a rate of return on equity of
about 25% before taxes. Since a third of investment expenditures and one
quarter of operating costs are in joint overhead cost, the marginal IRR for
both oil palm and cocoa components are quite high, at about 23Z and 22%
respectively. The difference in IRR between the two crops is not significant.
Financial Structure of the Company
7.07      The Company will have a sound financial structure by year 10, the
first full year of production (Table 7.3).

By Year 10, the Company will have sufficient surplus ca-h, resulting in high
current ratio of 3.2 and a-low debt:equity ratio of 44:;6. This will give the
Company sufficient borrowing capacity to be able to make further invest-
ments. However, to ensure that the Company does not prematurely undertake
such expansion, at negotiations it gave an assurance that during the construc-
tion and initial operation phase, up to December 31, 1901, the Company will
maintain debt to equity ratio of not more than 70:30. After 1991 the Company
will maintain:
(a) a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1501; and
(b) a current ratio of at least 1.5
VIII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
General
8.01      The project forms a part of COPNG's development strategy of giving
the highest priority to the development of the agricultural sector. It also
supports GOPNG objectives of expansion and diversification of exports, and
development of least developed provinces such as the Milne Bay Province.



-34 -
Benefits
8.02      By year-l1 the project will increase palm oil production and exports
by some 27,000 tons p.a., palm kernel, by 6,000 tons p.a., and cocoa, by 1,260
tons and will produce K 13.9 million (US$15.5 million) in export revenues.
The nai.n project beneficiary will be GOPNG with about K 3.0 million (US$3.5
million) in annual revenues from duties, taxes and its share of the nucleus
estate profits (including both dividends and retained earnings).
Non-Quantified Benefits
8.03      Health and Education. The project will provide new health and
education facilities, benefiting about 1,000 estate workers and dependents.
8.04      Demonstration Effect.  The nucleus estate development will encourage
more smallholders in the project area to start and expand oil palm and cocoa
plantings using techniques learned from the nucleus estate and using high
quality planting materials obtained from the estate.
8.05      Future Expansion Possibilities.  The project will establish the
groundwork and infrastructure which will allow lower cost expansion of small-
holder tree crops in the future. The project provides funds for preparation
of future projects as well as for improving tree crop production technology
through better research.
Economic Analysis
8.06      The project economic rate of return (ERR) will be about 14Z
(Table 8.1) with the nucleus estate having ERR of 13Z (para. 8.08) and
smallholder and oilpalm, 34% (para. 8.09).

8.07      The benefit/cost analysis is made in border Kina. International
prices have been converted to Kina at the current exchange rate. Local prices



- 35 -
have been converted to border Kina using appropriate conversion factors
(CF). For the most part a standard conversion factor of 0.965 has been used
in converting local costs to border Kina. this is due to the fact that PSG
has a relatively open economy and except for labor wages, it has few price
distortions. Labor wages, on the other hand, show substantial distortion.
Current rural minimum wage rate is K 2.95 per day, which is very high compared
to both the market wage rate and labor productivity. In the project area, for
instance market wage rate for agricultural labor varies between K I to 2 per
day, based on age and productivity of the worker. GOPWG had consciously
chosen a high minimum wage rate to assist with its objectives of income
transfer to poorer sections of the population. However, GOPNC now recognizes
that this may distort decision making by discouraging labor intensive techni-
ques and investments. Therefore, GOPNG has now decided to limit increases in
rural minimum wage rate to about 52 p.a.; which is less than the projected
inflation rate. In the meantime GOPUC uses a CF ranging between 0.2 to
0.67. ERR for the proposed project have been calculated using a CF of 0.67.
8.08      ERR for the nucleus estate components is 13Z.  Since a third of
investment expenditures and one quarter of operating costs are in joint
overhead costs, marginal ERR for oilpalu and cocoa subcomponents appear to be
higher, and are presented only for comparative purposes. ERR for these
subcomponents show that there is no significant difference between oil palm
and cocoa returns.
8.09      Component ERRs show that the highest return is from smallholder oil
palm. This is because the nucleus estate requires expensive but essential
expatriate -anagewent staff, because of a shortage of trained and experienced
local staff. Recognizing that smallholder returns are higher, the project
design was changed at appraisal to increase the proposed smalLholder area by
67Z. A larger increase is not considered feasible at this stage because of
the size of the project area population, and reluctance of local population to
accept outside settlers.
Project Risks and Sensitivity Analysis
8.10      An analysis of switching values (Table 8.2) shows that the ERR of
individual project components will remain above PNC's opportunity cost of
capital (OCC estimated at 10x) even if there are large reductions in revenues
or increases in costs. This is understandable because the component ERR are
quite high, and do not include overhead costs.

Development cost                    27.47           -       844.5
8.11      The project ERR is also not very sensitive to changes in operating
and development costs, and these can individually increase by up to 36%
without reducing project ERR below the OCC. The project ERR is more sensitive
to reduction in oil palm revenues which form 88% of project revenues, in
present value terms. However, oil palm yields in ONG are well established and
yield reductions of more thAn 10% are not expected. The projected oil palm
product prices are also estimated conservatively at about 20% below current
prices. Further reduction in long term average prices is unlikely.
8.12      Sensitivity to changes in cocoa and i;mallholder oil palm revenues on
project ERR are small, and even if these revenues are reduced individually by
up to 100Z the project returns will remain above 10Z. Similarly the project
can withstand a delay of two years in realization of project benefits along
with one year delay in project investment costs, and project ERR will still be
above 10%.
8.13      Institutional Risk.  While there is some project risk owing to the
fact that the Company, which is the main implementing agency, has just been
formed, the risk has been reduced by having CDC manage the Company. CDC has
long experience in managing such enterprises both in PNG and elsewhere.

and maintained for the duration of the project for coordinatng the
non-nucleus estate components of the project (para. 5.08);
9.02      At negotiations, the following assurances were given by the Company
and incorporated into a Project Agreement.
(a) The Company will meet all planting material requirements of oil palm
smallholders in the project area at a reasonable price (para. 3.14);
(b) The Company will maintain separate accounts for its field and pro-
cessing (including transport and marketing) divisions, and within
six months of the end of each fiscal year, the Company will make
available to the Bank, independently audited income statement for
profit centers and the Company, and the balance sheet, and sources
and applications of funds statement for the Company along with the
auditor's findings (pars. 4.13);

9.03      The following are conditions of Loan effectiveness:
(a)- The signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOPNG and the
Company (para. 4.03);
(b) The signing of a loan and management agreements between CDC and the
Company (para. 4.04, 5.02);



- 38 -
(c) The signing and effectiveness of a joint venture agreement between
GOPNG, CDC and the Company (para 5.02); and
(d) The signing of nucleus estate lease transfer agreements between
current leaseholders and the Company (para 5.13).
9.04      Before disbursements begin on ABPNG credit component, a subsidiary
