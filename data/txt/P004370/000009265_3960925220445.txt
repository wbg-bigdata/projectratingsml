SUBJECT: Project Completion Note an Papua New Guiea
Nucleus Estate and Smaliholder (Milne Ba) Project dlan 2608MP& G)
Attached is a Project Completion Report on Papua New Guinh - Nucleus Estato and Smaliholder
(Mine Bay) Project (Loan 2608-PNG) prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, with Part It
contrbuted by the Borrower. The report is comprehensive and of good quality. It highlights the extent to which
the economic and financial benefits expected at apprasl from a weU conceived and competety maaged prject
cn be compromised by a dramatic and unexpected fal in commodity prices oaring Implementati
Ihe project aimed to establish 3200 ha of ol palm and 750 ha of cocoa on a nucleus estat, jointly
owned by the Govemment and the Commonwealth Development Corporation (a cofinacier with the Eank), and
1,000 ha of smalholder oil palm, and to construct associated infrstructre including crop proceing, housing,
access and social services. The nucleus estate oil palm planting was carried out ahead of schedule, and the area
reaed 5,500 ha by the end of 1992, almost 50% higher dta the appraisal target. Ile nucleus estate cocoa,
however, had to be abandoned because of diseae associated with higher rainfall than aumed at appraisa. The
smailholter oi palm uptake was lower than forecast at appai  and had reached 880 ha by ihe end of 1992
compared to an appraisal target of 1,000 ha which was to have been achieved two years earlier. Quality of
established oil palm plantings is high, although yields, based on early production figur, are likely to be around
eight percent below appraisl esimates in the case of estate plantigs, and as much as 17% below in the case of
smaliholdings.
Unfortmately, a dramatic decline in palm oil and kernel prices which commenced shordy after the
project was declared effective has resulted in prics at completion being only about half of the earlier frecasts,
and current projections are for a fAurther price decline. For this reason, the estate enteprise Is in financi
difficulty; the economic rate of return is negative; and the project outcome must be viewed as unsisf.
Nevertheless, the principal shareholders are continuing their support for the project and are
considerng reducing the high debt: equity gearing, possibly through conversion of a substantia portion of the debt
to equity. Given the probability of this continued support, sustnability can be considered likely. Institutionad
development was substantial, due in large part to a heavy investment in staff training given by the expatriate
management.
A performance audit is not planned at this time. But an impact evaluation wl be considered in a year
or two.

NUCLEUS ESTATE AND SMALLHOLDER (MMNE BAY) PROJECT
(LOAN 2608.PNG)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion ReporL (PCR) for the Nucleus Estate and Smallholder (Milne
Bay) Project in Papua New Guinea for which Loan 2608-PNG in the amount of US$27.6 million was
approved on July 23, 1985. The Loan was closed on September 30, 1992, in accordance with the
original schedule. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was on January 29, 1993.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the East Asia and Pacific
Regional office (Parts I and II). Part II was prepared by the Borrower.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final supervision mission of the
project in October 1992 and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and Project
Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank
memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAPUA NEW GUINEA
NUCLEUS ESTATE AND SMALLHOLDER MILNE BAY) PROJECT
(LOAN 2608-PNG)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
1.         Objectives. The Nucleus Estate and Smallholder (Milne Bay) Project was the third Bank-
financed project in Papua New Guinea to use oil palm, a crop extremely well-suited to the soils and
climate, in support of the Government's policies to: (a) increase and diversify foreign exchange earnings;
(b) accelerate economic development in the least-developed provinces; and (c) improve the quality of life
of poorer people through provision of social infrastructure. The Project was to include: (a) development
of 3,700 ha of oil palm and 750 ha of cocoa nucleus estate plantations, 1,000 ha of smallholder oil palm
blocks, and associated processing facilities; (b) construction of 560 houses for laborers and staff;
construction of three bridges and upgrading of provincial and access roads, bridges, and culverts; (c)
construction of necessary health, education and police protection facilities within the project area; and
(d) provision of administrative, technical and training support; and strengthening of governmental
extension, research and project preparation services.
2.         Implementation Experience. The Project was generally well executed, achieving or
exceeding nearly all its physical targets. The planned 750 ha nucleus estate cocoa development was
abandoned in view of disease associated with higher rainfall than anticipated at appraisal. The high quality
nucleus estate oil palm plantings totaled 5,500 ha, almost 50 percent higher than the appraisal target.
Smallholder oil palm reached 880 ha or 88 percent of target; further smallholder uptake is expected.
Farmers' holdings are more scattered than planned at appraisal. Mill procurement and construction was
difficult, the contract was terminated, and the factory completed in-house by the nucleus estate Company.
The mill is now functioning at good efficiency. The village infrastructure items and roads were all
completed, and the additional health facilities and schools are experiencing heavy demand.
3.         Results. The projected prices for palm oil and palm kernels have fallen dramatically from
the appraisal forecasts, overwhelming the generally sound implementation experience. At appraisal, the
Bank's commodity price projections, in constant 1990 terms, indicated that the price of palm oil would
be $7691ton in 1995, and of palm kernels $430/ton. The projections now indicate prices of $343 and
$234 respectively, only half the earlier forecast. The position continues to worsen in later years, with
the projected price of palm oil falling to $303 by 2000, and $266 by 2005, or 39 and then 35 percent of
the appraisal forecast. The peak nucleus estate yields are now estimated at 24 tons/FFB/ha, which is high,
but a little less than the appraisal estimate of 26 tons/FFB/ha. SmalHholder yields are now estimated to
peak at 17 tons/ha, compared to the appraisal estimate of 19.5 tons/ha. Overall, the price outlook is the
most important factor causing the economic outcome of the Project to be negative, rather than 14 percent
as forecast at appraisal.
4.         The nucleus estate Company invested heavily in human resources, particularly in training,
setting the basis for the scale-back of expatriate staff, from 15 in 1991 to 7 in 1992. National management
staff now number 16. Subsistence lev,. farmers have been trained in tree crop techniques, and the



- Iv -
expanded health posts and schools are functioning well. To preserve the environment, tree and plant cover
around water courses have been left untouched, and treated mill effluent and empty fruit bunches are used
as an organic fertilizer supplement for the palms. In general, women hold land in the project area and
they have been willing to give rights to men for oil palm, a non-traditional crop. There are no restrictions
on women participating in the Project in their own names, and some have. It appears that decisions on
new expenditures made possible by increased incomes are being taken at the family level, that is with
participation of both spouses.
5.         Project Sustainability. The nucleus estate Company's fuure cash flows show a higfly
positive financial internal rate of return In constant terms, and the fturm economic IRR would also be
highly positive. These future returns permit project sustainability, but given the depressed convmodity
price projections, there appears little prospect for fully redressing the negative overall returns to the total
project investments, including sunk costs. The Commonwealth Development Corporation in December
'992 injected a further GBP £4.9 million (UJS$7.4 million) into the Company, which will be available
as additional equity after discussions with the Government are concluded. The strong tangible support by
the majority shareholder is more than sufficient to assure the financial sustainability of the Company, on
the assumptions of the long-term estimates. The financial sustainability of the smallholder components
Is also reasonably assured, due to the decision of the Government to maintain farm-gate prices over the
next five years at a minimum of PGK 26/ton.
6.         Conclusions and Lessons Learned. The project design provided for a balanced, suitably
sized mixture of productive and social objectives, the physical targets have been substantially achieved
or exceeded, and the Project's sustainability appears reasonably assured. The Project has nevertheless
failed to provide a return to the overall investment. Lessons learned include:
o    Commodity prices are volatile, and today's forecasts indicate that the forecasts at the
time of appraisal were a grossly inadequate guide for assessing the viability of this
plantation crop project. Risks were recognized, but the capital structure of the
Company did not reflect the risks and had too high a ratio of loan finance to equity.
O    Changes to the incentive structure for agriculture recommended by the Bank's 1992
agriculture sector review, if adopted, will contribute to the Project.
O    Even for commodities where loan repayments can be linked to marketing, long-tenn
credit to subsistence-level farmers, for the fidl investment costs to maturity of tree
crops, is incompatible with sound commercial or development banking practice.
O    In the present environment, further oil palm  projects should concentrate on
incremental investments increasing returns to sunk costs in factories and other
infrastructure Items. New "green field" investments will need radically reduced costs
and further improvements to the agricultural incentives environment.
O    Cocoa development should not be considered on soils requiring drainage.
o    Smallholder development is unlikely to take place in compact blocks unless
agreements are reached with communities during preparation and appraisal.

NUCLEUS ESTATE AND SMALLHOIDER (MLNE BAY) PROJECT
(LOAN 2608-PNG)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.      Project Identity
Name:              Nucleus Estate and Smallholder (Milne Bay) Project
Loan Number:       2608-PNG
RVP Unit:          East Asia and Pacific
Country.           Papua New Guinea
Setor:             Agriculture
Sub-sector:        Tree Crops
2.       Background
2.1      The main goals of agricultural development have been to improve the livelihood of rural
families; to increase and broaden agricultural exports; and to reduce food imports. To achieve this,
Government strategy has focused, amongst other things, on an open economy with emphasis on a strong
private sector backed by agricultural credit and export crop stabilization funds; and on support of clans
and other traditional groups. The Nucleus Estate and Smallholder (M£ilne Bay) Project was the third Bank-
financed project undertaken to support the Government's policy to use oil palm, a crop extremely well-
suited to the country's soils and climate, as an engine of development in suitable rural areas. The Project
was appraised in June/July 1984. The Bank Loan in support of the project was approved by the Board
on July 23, 1985. The Project's principal financier was the Commonwealth Development Corporation.
3.       Project Objectives and Description
3.1      The Project was designed to address several of the Government's development objectives: (a)
increasing and diversifying foreign exchange earnings through investments in sectors where PNG was
seen to have a comparative advantage, such as oil palm production; (b) reversing the decline in cocoa
exports; (c) accelerating economic development in the least-developed provinces, such as Milne Bay; (d)
increasing rural employment opportunities through favoring manual land-clearing; and (e) improving the
quality of life of poorer people through provision of social infrastructure.
3.2     The Project was to be implemented over six years, and was to include:
(a) development of 3,700 ha of oil palm and 750 ha of cocoa nucleus estate plantations; and
1,000 ha of smallholder oil palm blocks;
(b) construction of a 30 ton per hour palm oil mill with associated infrastructure Including
a wharf bulking station; and a 13 ton per day cocoa fermentary and drier;



-2-
(c) construction of 560 houses for workers and staff; construction of three bridges and
upgrading of provincial and access roads, bridges, and culverts;
(d)  construction of necessary health, education and police protection facilities within the
project area; and
(e) provision of administrative, technical and training support; and strengthening of
governmental extension, research and project preparation services.
4.      Project Design and Organization
4.1     The Project was prepared during 1983 by the Commonwealth Development Corporation
(CDC), with the participation of the Government's Department of Agriculture and Livestock (at that time
the Department of Primary Industry), and of the Bank. The Project was appraised by the Bank in
June/July 1984. Its design was already well established within Papua New Guinea and elsewhere, and
readily accepted by the Government and the Bank as appropriate. This design involved using a soundly
anaged commercial company with good technical qualifications, to establish a "nucleus" estate and
associated processing and marketing infastructure. The estate company would produce planting material
for smallholders, assist with the provision of other inputs, and purchase, process, and market smallholder
output. With oil palm fresh fruit bunches being highly perishable, availability of a local palm oil mill
is essential to the concept. The Commonwealth Development Corporation and the Bank were already
Involved in a well-established and successful similar scheme at Popondetta, Oro province, and two other
schemes in New Britain, involving other parties, were also operational.
4.2     In Milne Bay province, 5,500 ha of run-down coconut estates and vacant Government land,
suitable for oil palm and cocoa were identified in two areas - Gumini, some 5-30 kIm from the port of
Alotau, and Sagarai over the Pini range, some 50-60 km from Alotau. In addition, some 2,000 ha of
clan lands would be suitable for oil palm cultivation. Unlike the Oro and New Britain projects, no
settlement would be involved. Local fmers only were to participate as smallholders, due mainly to
limited Government land availability for possible settlement, and constraints associated with making clan
land available for settlers. As in the other projects, each family would be eligible to plant 2 to 4 ha of
oil palm.
4.3     Organization. Organizational responsibilities were well defined, with a clear distinction
between the commercial role of the nucleus estate company, and the Government's development
responsibilities for snallholders, roads, and village infrastructure development. Milne Bay Estates
Proprietary Limited (the Company), established in 1983 by the Government (40 percent) and CDC (60
percent), was to be responsih!e for implementing the project's nucleus estate components, covering 86
percent of estimated project costs. The Company was to enter into a management agreement with CDC,
under which CDC would provide the General Manager and Company Secretary/Chief Financial Officer.
This arrangements was seen as assuring the Company of CDC's expertise and long experience in estate
operations. The Departnent of Agriculture and Livestock was to be responsible for extension, and for
coordinating the infrastructure components of the Project, which fell under the Department of Public
Works. Credit was to be distributed in kind, and repayments collected by the Company, as a deduction
from payments for fruit bunches delivered to the mill. The Agriculture Bank of Papua New Guinea was
to act as financial intermediary fbr smallholder credit.



- 3 -
4.4     In general, the Project was well prepared and appraised. The chief issues discussed during the
lengthy Interval between preparation and appraisal were: (a) the need to improve the low rates of return
indicated by the preparation report; (b) the possibility of increasing the size of th stnallholder
component, which was seen to yield higher returns than the estate component; and (c) the possibility of
dropping the cocoa component, which had a lower return than oil palm. The Bank accepted the arguments
of the Government and CDC that retaining cocoa would usefully dlversify the project risks. The final
design increased the overall rate of return to 14 percent, and th- smallholder area from the 600 ha at
preparation, to 1,000 ha.
5.      Project Implementation
5.1     ht Bank Loan for the Project became effective on May 9, 1986. ITe Project was implemented
over the 6½h-year period, 1986-1992, and the Loan was closed on September 30, 1992, In accordance
with the original schedule. Final disbursements took place on January 22, 1993. The Project was
generally well executed, achieving or exceeding nearly all its physical targets.
5.2     Nucleus Estate. Oil palm establishment was carried out ahead of schedule, and the area
reached 5,500 ha by end-^992, almost 50 percent higher than the appraisal target of 3,700 ha. The quality
of planting is high, although about one third of the oil palm area has somewhat poor shallow soils, with
coronas on hilly terrain, that have an adverse effect on yields. The nucleus estate cocoa development
however had to be abandoned in view of a disease - phytophthora - associated with higher rainfll than
anticipated at appraisal. A technical note is at Annex 3. Mill procurement and construction was
difficult, the contract was terminated and the factory completed in-house by the nucleus estate Company.
Mill procurement and construction were difficult, the contract broke down, and the factory completed
in-house by the nucleus estate Company. The mill is now functioning at good efficiency. A detailed note
is at Annex 4.
5.3     Smallholder Development. Smallholder uptake was considerably slower than forecast at
appraisal, but gradually increased, especially after the early plantings came into maturity. Forecasting the
pace of uptake for what was a completely new crop to the farmers in the area, was recognized as
difficult. As the target had been incteased from 600 ha to 1,000 ha despite some misgivings on the part
of the Department of Agriculture and Livestock, a loan covenant was included to provide for regular
reviews of smallholder incentives. Reviews during supervision did not idendfy inadequate incentives as
a prob!em, and the uptake rate indicates a normal pattern of a few early adopters, with later followers,
together with delays in obtaining clah approval for land use. At December 31, 1992, 880 ha had been
established, compared to the appraisal target of 1,000 ha, which was to have been achieved by end-1989.
Moreover, the extension service was forced to accept applicants over a more scattered area than was
planned at appraisal. This has necessitated extra access track construction, and extra costs of collection.
It is hoped that these access tracks will encourage other smallholders to join the Project over coming
years.
5.4      Credit. Although the Government-owned Agriculture Bank (ABPNG) had been consulted
during appraisal, it did not participate in negotiations, during which the Government agreed to an
intermediation margin of 3 percentage points for ABPNG's involvement in smallholder credit. This
margin was considered adequate by the Govermnent and by IBRD because all smallholders would be
closely monitored by the extension service, and because credtt repayments would be assured by
deductions from payments by the Company for fruit purchases. The Agriculture Bank however considered



-4.
that although recent experience with oil palm credit had been good, the leading was not without risk.
More importatly, they were anxious to have a higher margin available on oil palm, as some redress
against losses in other areas of their operadons. IBRD subsequently agreed with the Government tbat
the small amount of IBRD loan finids involved (USS700,000) could be passed to ABPNO at 3 percent,
and that the smaiholder interest rate would remain at 11 percent, thereby providing ABPNQ with an
Intermediation margi of 8 percentage points. As price projections fell, the housing element of the credit
package was cut back to a roof for rain water collection, and other items were also reduced.
5.5      Rural infrastructure. All rural infrastructure was completed, including the costuction and
upgrading of seven bridges, 34 km of main road, two health centers, one new and two expanded schools,
an oil palm extension office, and a police station. The Project's small research componenm established
some field trials which were still In progress at project completion.
6.       Project Results
6.1      PhysIal Results. 'Me Project achieved all its physical targets, some behind schedule, except
for the abandoned nucleus estate cocoa development, and a 12 percent shorfall at end-1992 in smaliholder
uptake. Details are in Part m, Table 4.
6.2      Pices. The projected prices for palm oil and palm kernels have fallen dramatically from the
appraisal foreas, overwhelming the general sound Implementation experience. At appraisal, the Bank's
commodity price projections, in constant 1990 terms, indicated that the price of palm oil would be
$769/ton in 1995, and of palm kenels $430/ton. The projections have progressively falen (Chart and
Annex 2), and now indicate prices of $343 and $234 respectively, only some half ithe earier fotecast
hposition continues to worsen in later years, with the projected price of palm oil falling to $303 by
2000, and $266 by 2005, or 39 and then 35 percen of the appraisal forecasL Although the project's
cocoa development failed for technical reasons, it too would have been affeted by low pdces. At
appraisal, the price of cocoa In 1995 was forecast to be 280c0/kg, whereas the latest forecast Is for 1130
or 40 percent of the earlier prediction. For all three ptoducts, there has been a steady fail at each revision
of the projections. Not surprisingly, the price outlook is the most important factor causing the ecmomic
outcome of the Project to be negive, rather than 14 percent as fbrecast at appraisal.

6.3      At appraisal, switching value sensitivity analysis indicated that the Project could withstand a
40% drop in nucleus estate oil palm revenue, a 39% drop in cocoa revenues, or a 14% drop in the
revenue of both crops, below the projections which in the case of oil palm products were already some
20% below then current price levels. During Board discussions, an executive director commented on the
risks of oil palm projects. The presentation of projections for palm oil and kernels was enhanced
recently, In that forecasts are now given for the 70% probability medium-term variations for these volatile
prices. In the case of palm oil, 1995 prices (in constant 1990 terms) could range from $274 to $647,
around the trend figure of $343 - the upward skew reflecting the market reaction to possible supply
shortages. Similarly, palm kemel prices might range from $183 to $408, around the trend figure of
$234. TMese enhancements to the projections will enable more sophisticated risk analysis in future
projects, but unless the trend prices currently being forecast tum out to be extremely pessimistic, such
risk analysis cannot be expected to cope with drops in trend prices of the magnitude encountered in this
Project. One practical precautionary measure would be to have a high ratio of equity capital, rather than
loan finance, in projects involving commodities with highly volatile prices.
6.4      Yields. Nucleus estate yield levels in the first two years of maturity are based on the actWal
results in areas where palms had matured normally without ablation (that is, where fruiting had not been
artificially suppressed because of the delay in mill completion). Crops currently in their third or fourth
year of production have been ablated, and have been ignored for the purposes of yield assessments. Thus
the revised yield forecasts are based on two years actual production data. However, the plantings
concerned were on corona areas, that is poorer soils, and subsequent plantings have been on good alluvial
soils. Taking account of this, the PCR mission agreed with the peak yield of 24 tons/FFB/ha, that the
Company had used in its long-term estimates prepared in mid-1992. This level compares with the
appraisal estimate of 26 tons/FFBlha.
6.5      Smallholder yields, based on field visits and an examination of project records, have been
estimated by the PCR mission to peak at 17 tons/ha, compared to the appraisal estimate of 19.5 tons/ha,
and to decline in a normal pattern thereafter. The weighted average yields have been calculated after
considering the likely mix of good and poor performance under smallholder conditions. The PCR forecast
is consistent with the lower PCR estimate for estate yields, but is based on limited smallholder production
at this time. The Company in its long-term estimates considers that smallholder yields will peak at 16.2
tons/ha, but after the eleventh year of harvesting, forecasts a steep decline in smallholder production due
to an assumed lack of interest by smallholders, if prices are low, in harvesting tall palms.
6.6      Human Resource Development. The Company invested heavily in staff training, setting the
basis for the scale-back of expatriate staff, from 15 in 1991 to 7 in 1992. National management staff
increased from I in 1987 to 16 in 1992. Subsistence level farmers have been trained in tree crop
techniques, and the expanded health posts and schools are functioning well.
6.7      Environmental Effects. Tree crop development in general is environmentally friendly if well
implemented, and the Project has taken care in several important environmental areas. Tree and plant
cover around water courses has been left untouched. A plan to build a furnace to incinerate empty fruit
bunches was abandoned, in favor of using the bunches as an organic fertilizer supplement for the palms.
Effluent from the mill is biologically treated before being irrigated on to land as fertilizer. These
practices, together with appropriate planting techniques - platform planting on hilly terrain, and planting
legumes - serve to improve soil tilth, sustain fertility, conserve moisture, and control soil erosion. The
Company initially used mechanical clearing, despite the appraisat intention to maximize labor creation,
but later changed this practice, in view of the destruction to soil cover. The project land - clan land that



-6-
had been used for agricultural purposes, and alienated land that had been used for plantation purposes -
was by definition not primary forest, but re-growth in the area is rapid, and surveying dense growth for
patches of primary forest, and distinguishing re-growth forest and primary forest difficult. Species and
age can be used to Identify primary forest, and the Bank could usefully prepare a set of I lelines to
assist Governments and projects. Another important environmental concern is the safety of farmers and
estate workers, using agrochemicals, or operating factory, harvesting or collection equipment. A prudent
management safeguard would be for a broad scope environmental audit to be conducted from time to
time, as a precaution to see that the prescribed environmental standards are being followed, and to permit
revisions to the standards to be considered if appropriate. Such an audit could be commissioned by the
Company, and by the Oil Palm Industry Corporation.
6.8      The role of women, and poverty alleviation. In general, land rights in the project area are
held and inherited by women, giving them an importance in clan and village affairs. Women have been
willing to give rights over land to men for oil palm lots. There are no restrictions on women
participating in the Project in their own names, and some have. It appears that decisions on new
expenditures made possible by increased incomes are being taken at the family level, that is with
participation of both spouses. A sociological survey would be needed to determine more precisely the
patterns that may be emerging, but general observations indicate that education, travel, and house
improvements are important expenditure priorities. The project's support to education and health facilities
has been widely welcomed by the communities in general, and women in particular. On the whole, the
education and health facilities have given increased employment opportunities to women, and extension
activities to men. Oil palm maintenance and harvesting activities appear to be regarded as a family
responsibility and shared between men, women and older children. No particular measures were taken
during the project implementation period to monitor poverty alleviation aspects of the Project. As in the
other oil palm schemes, project activities, higher incomes, and better roads, have had observable results
in a higher level of economic activity lr, the area.
7.       Project Sustainability
7.1      Nucleus estate. The project results, including the lower actual and project prices, have been
analyzed in the Company's mid-1992 long-term estimates, which were reviewed during the PCR mission,
and form the basis of the revised financial rate of return analysis presented in Annex 5. The Company's
future cash flows show a highly positive financial internal rate of return in constant terms, and thefir
economic IRR for the estate component would also be highly positive, after adjustment for the effect of
shadow pricing labor and eliminating taxes on imported items. These future returns permit project
sustainability, but given the depressed commodity price projections, there appears little prospect for
redressing the negative overall returns to the total project investments, including sunk costs. Sensitivity
testing (Annex 5) indicates that an increase in future turnover value of 50%, and reduction in expenses
of 50% would enable positive returns. The Company has already reduced expenditures substantially, and
the scope for further reductions may not be great. Similarly, if the higher limit of the forecast 70% range
of probable prices were achieved in the next five years, and expenses reduced, returns could be positive.
Given the uncertainties of forecasting commodity prices, and the possibility of Government macro-
economic action increasing agricultural incentives, a brighter outcome for the Project is possible. CDC
in December 1992 provided a 4 percent demand loan of GBP £4.9 million (US$7.4 million) to the
Company, with the understanding that part or all of this amount would be able to be converted to equity
following discussions between the Government and CDC on revising the Company's capital structure.
The high debt:equity gearing of the Company, even though the debts are held by the shareholders roughly



- 7 -
in proportion to their equity, is no longer appropriate. Indeed given the inherent vulnerability of estate
enterprises to commodity price changes, the PCR questions the advisability of the high gearing at
appraisal. 'he strong tangible support by the majority shareholder is more than sufficient to assure the
financial sustainability of the Company, on the assumptions of the long-term estimates, and it is expected
that the formal modifications to the capital structure will be agreed between the partners shortly.
7.2     Smallholder Component. The financial sustainability of the smallholder components is also
reasonably assured, due to the decision of the Government to maintain farm-gate prices over the next five
years at PGK 26/ton. This decision remains to be implemented, and should be monitored by the Bank.
8.      Bank Perfornance
8.1     As discussed above, the Bank's commodity price projections did not provide a sound basis
for assessing the project's viability at appraisal. The Bank recognized the difficulties for agriculture
associated with PNG's mineral export boom, and initiated sector work focussed on the agriculture
incentives framework. Bank recommendations are with Goverment. Supervision was effective in
advocating environmental protection measures, but did not foresee the difficulties with cocoa development
and factory implementation. However, the Bank assisted in resolution of the problems, by assessing the
solutions proposed, and agreeing to changes as necessary under the Loan and Project agreements.
9.      Borrower Perfornmance
9.1     The Government, as principal borrower met all its obligations under the Project. These loans
have yet to be disbursed, although the Company has advanced its own funds, to keep prices at PGK
21/ton. The Company, as subsidiary borrower, also met all its obligations. From its long-term estimates
mid-way during the establishment period, it recognized the risks presented by the fall in commodity price
projections, and having obtained a convertible demand loan from CDC in December 1992, is in the
process of addressing the covenants relating to the Company's financial structure. Formal changes to the
equity structure are expected shortly.
10.     Project Relationships
10.1    The significant relationships to consider are those between the Company and the host
community, and the extension service and farm families. In some areas of Papua New Guinea, including
mining areas and also the oil palm development area in Oro Province, local communities have seen the
role of outside companies with significant expatriate presence as exploitative. The enclave nature of these
companies, including the Milne Bay Company, contributes to these tensions. The representation of
farmers on the Oil Palm Industry Corporation board, the good extension service relationships, and the
village and road development components provided a counterweight to dissident voices, as did the efforts
of the Company to maintain good relationships. The Company for example constructed estate perimeter
roads in a manner to improve smallholders' access to their land, and assisted villages maintain water
supply in dry periods. Disputes concerning the Company's rights to land occurred in the early stages, but
were resolved or the use of some parcels of land forgone. The situation continues to require attention,
and at project completion, the Company and its corporate manager (CDC) were highly focussed on
building sound relationships with the local community.



11.      Management Services
11.1    A joint venture arrangement with an associated management contract is a standard vehicle for
transferring technical skills and building up local expertise, and provides the framework for controlling
the varying interests of the partners. The Government, as the passive partner in the nucleus estate
Company, relied on CDC as Corporate Manager to ensure the Company's affairs were well managed.
CDC's continued support of the Company, In the face of commodity price declines outside the control
of management, is providing the Company's sustainability at the present time, demonstrating the value
of a committed partner in a joint venture of this type. Project implementation problems falling more
within the control of management, were the supervision of the mill contract and some aspects of the failed
cocoa development. In these cases, the Corporate Manager's expertise was valuable in resolving the
situations after they had arisen, rather than before.
12.      Conclusions and Lessons Learned
12.1    The project design provided for a balanced, appropriately sized, mixture of productive and
social objectives, the physical targets have been substantially achieved, a well functioning estate company
and extension service have been established and the project's sustainability appears reasonably assured.
The Project has nevertheless failed to provide a projected return to the overall investment. Lessons
learned are:
Price related issues
o   Commodity prices are volatile, and despite the record of the Bank's commodity price
projections being better than simple alternatives, today's forecasts indicate that the
forecasts at the time of appraisal were a grossly inadequate guide for assessing the
viability of this plantation crop project. Risks were recognized, but the capital structure
of the Company did not reflect the risks and had too high a ratio of loan finance to
equity. (See Annex 7 for further comments on commodity price risk management.)
o   Even for commodities where loan repayments can be linked to marketing, long-term
credit to small farmers at or slightly above subsistence level, for the fill investment costs
to maturity of tree crops, is incompatible with sound commercial or development banking
practice. If targeted participants require this level of assistance, it needs to be provided
by the Govermment for poverty alleviation and development reasons, and the
administration of any associated cost recovery should be kept as simple as possible.
Alternatively, the possibility of backing from the nucleus estate Company, or depending
on the commodity concerned, from traders, could be investigated.
O   In the present environment, candidates for further oil palm projects will need to be sought
where incremental investments increasing returns to sunk costs in factories or other
infrastructure itens can be found. New 'green field' investments will need radically
reduced cost structures, including reduced investments in overhead items until crops are
mature.



-9-
Broader macro Issues
o The PCR notes that the Bank 192 agriculture sector review recommended changes to
the macro-environment, and in particular the incentive structure for agriculture. These
changes if adopted wll iiso contribute to the Project.
Project related matters
o   Care should be taken at appraisal to ascertain if the Bank's procurement procedures are
fully acceptable to coflnancing partners. If doubts exist, the appraisal mission should
consider the flexibility within Bank operational guidelines for partners who finance items
themselves, to use their own economically efficient procurement procedures.
O Engineers appointed under FIDIC-based construction contracts should, where possible,
preferably be independent consultants, rather than staff of, or otherwise affiliated with
the employer.
o   Cocoa development should not be considered on soils requiring drainage.
O   Smallholder development is unlikely to take place in compact blocks unless agreements
are reached with communities during preparation and appraisal.
o   The Bank should ensure that all involved parties are represented at negotiatons,
especially autonomous state enterprises, through adequately empowered delegates.
O   An environmental audit should be undertaken from time to time in the project area in the
future, to help ensure the sound environmental practices in use are maintained and even
improved where possible.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTV
1. Comments on Part I
1.1       The Government of Papua New Guinea (GOPNG) generally agrees with the review of the
Project as outined In Part 1. in particular, it notes that it "was genera1ly well executed, achieving or
exceeding nearly all its physical targets". Some 400 poor village families have been given improved
employment opportunities to Improve their quality of lift.. Te provision of social and transport
infastructure has brought further benefits to the community.
1.2        Smal1ho1dgr 11aelglent.  The shortfIll In smallholder plantings resulted from  a
misunderstanding of the Milne Bay people and an underestimation of fte effort required to get them to
adopt oil palm as a crop. In this respect, the experience in Milne Bay has differed from elsewhere in
Papua New Guinea. High levels of interest can usually be generatd for planting the crops, with the main
challenge being the maintenance of this interest as palm get older and harder to harvest. Efforts are
continuing to reach and excee the target of 1,000 ha.
1.3       The roll of women. Participation by women in the Project is not limited to widows. There
are instances of married women planting blocks in their own right.
2. Bank erfnnnc
2.1        Bank staff assisted with the implementation of the Project. Supervision missions were
supportive in idendfying and resolving problems and issues as they arose.
2.2          .   During implemention, projected prices for palm oil fell wel below the Bank's
forecasts used at appraisal. Farm model budgets were modified in response by reducing the housing
allowance to roofing iron and a water tank. The housing component was considered to be an important
incentive to smallholders in the credit package and there was concern that this downgrading may deter
new entrants. In the event, this was not the case, in face few growers have qualified for housing as they
have only planted the initial two ha (refer Agricultural Bank below).
3. Broe'  rft&rnance
3.1        D=Aw M. Reimbursement applications have generally been submitted in a timely
manner. There were some initial problems, especially in documenting Department of Works expenditure,
but these were overcome.
3.2        Agcultural Ban. ITe Agricultural Bank is generally pleased with the way the Project has
progressed. Relationships with the World Bank have been good, especially the level of consultation over
issues affecting the Project. The major area of concen relates to the proposed size of oil palm blocks.
The delivery of smallholder credit by the Agricultural Bank was based on a 4-ha model. Initally, 2 ha
would be planted, and, if this was satisfactorily maintained, a further 2 ha would be approved. The
release of funds for housing was tied to the second planting. It was found that most farmers were only
able to manage 2 ha and were not given funds to proceed with the second 2 ha. This meant that a



significant portion of their loan comnitment was not disbursed. OPIC is reviewing all loans to identify
those growers who will not plant up the full area. Agricultural Bank will be advised to vary these loans
so that committed funds can be released for other farmers wishing to enter the industry. Future loans
will be limited to 2 ha in the first instance. A second loan for expanding to 4 ha will be arranged where
appropriate.
3.3        Rural Inu=cu   . Rural inf&astructure was completed, principaily by Department of
Works force account. However, some road construction was done under contract by private fims and
this proved to be a more cost-effective way of geting the work completed.
3.4        Fi1naial Allot         Anma  budgetary allocations were adequate for projedt
implemention and the Loan was fully drawn down.
3.5                  states ME  Ltd. The relationship between the Company and DALlOPIC were
harmonious and marked by mutual assistance in resolving problems. The slower than expected rate of
planting by smallholders meant that no all ordered seedlings could be used. The estate company applied
the surplus to its own development. for its part, DAUIOPIC sed its expertie in dealing with the local
people to help settle disputes between the estate and neighboring villages over land.
4. Lssons Learned
4.1        The content of Conclusion und LanLrn  in Part I are endorsed. Of particular note
in respect of smallholder development are:
(a)  price forecasting;
(b)  long-term credit and equity contribution by smallholders; and
(c) structural change and incentives to smallholder.
Other Lessons Leamed are:
(a)  experience with infastructure development suggests that more reliance could be placed on
using private contractors rather than DOW force account for fairly small pieces of work
(b)  village oil palm blocks should initially be limited to 2 ha with provision for expansion to
4 hia if the grower demonstrates he has the time and ability.

Annexl(a)
COMMENTS FROM COMMONWEALTH
DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
CDC's perspective of the project is as follows:
1.    Milne Bay Estates Pty. Ltd. is considered to be a technically sound oil palm project and of good
developmental value. By December 31, 1992, some 5,500 ha of oil palms had been planted and this is
expected to increase to an estate planted area of approximately 6,100 ha by the end of 1993. This is
considerably in excess of the originally planned planting of 3,700 ha and together with outgrower
plantings will provide the high throughput loading on the mill which is essential for the economic
utilization of the facility.
2.    Most of the additional oil palm planting has taken place at Sagarai following the failure of the
cocoa planted there. Cocoa failure is thought to be due to an association of two fungal diseases,
Phytophthora and Fusarium, in an environment where rainfall is proving to be considerably higher than
that originally anticipated, based on records from surrounding areas. This high rainfall, together with
the soil types at Sagarai, makes the area particularly well suited to palms and the plantings there are
expected to be amongst the highest yielding on MBEPL. The improvements to roads and bridges
completed in recent years ensures reliable and economical transport of fruit to the mill.
3.    Financially, MBEPL is in difficulty due primarily to the high debt:equity gearing put into place
on commodity price assumptions that have proved to be optimistic. Price projections indicate that the
position is likely to worsen rather than improve. CDC is addressing this matter and is currently
preparing a financing proposal for discussion with its partner in the project. This is likely to include
conversion of a substantial proportion of the debt to equity or equity type finance. Thereafter, MBEPL
is expected to show a positive return on the funds invested.

COMMENTS FROM MILNE BAY ESTATES PROPRIETY LIMITED
(a)   In your covering letter as well as In Part I paragraph 7.2 and 9.1, you mention that the
government is to support a smallholder farmgate price of K26/tonne FEB. Despite many
requests from MBEPL no support has been received by the company who are currently
paying K21/tonne as calculated by the smallholder price formula.

Annex 3
COCOA DEVELOPMENT
A combination of environmental, agronomic, and genetic factors resulted in failure of the
Project's cocoa development, intended as a relatively small component (750 ha) at Sagaral. At
preparation, the need for drainage of the proposed site was recognized, and drainage was installed.
Although the drains are effective in removing surface water, the soil often remains waterlogged due to
frequent heavy rains. Records for surrounding areas examined at appraisal indicated rainfall generally
under 2,000 mm/year, but during the period when cocoa was being established (1987-90), rainfall in
some years exceeded 3,100 mm, and the long-term mean is now estimated at 2,800 mm/year. For the
1987-89 planting periods, the SGI high-yielding hybrid was used, and in 1989/90, another high yielder,
SG2. SG1 is susceptible to the diseasephytophthora, but SG2 is normally not. However, with the high
rainfall, and inability of the drainage system to cope with water-logging, SG2 also has proven to be
intolerant of phyothora. The disease causes flower cushion, stem, pod, and root damage, resulting
in very low yields. Although injections with phosphorous acid are an effective treatment, the frequency
of applications required at Sagaral would render this uneconomic. The Bank agreed with the Company's
decision to replant the 611 ha which had been established with oil palm, which is expected to grow
satisfactorily at the site. Some 62 percent of the development costs of PGK 6.1 million (US$6.3 million)
were written off, the balance represented land preparation costs whose value could be charged against
the oil palm to be developed in place of cocoa.

Annex 4
PALM OIL MILL PROCUREMENT AND CONSTRUCTION
1.    At the outset of the procurment process for the 30 ton/hour palm oil mill, CDC as the Estate
Company's corporate manager, expressed concern that the prequalification procedures under the Bank's
procurement guidelines could lead to qualification of a firm which CDC would not otherwise choose, and
some discussions were necessary before the list of six pre-qualified firms was agreed by the Bank. Then
for bid analysis, CDC proposed a points system under which prices would receive a 75 percent
weighting, and commented that "as long-term investors in the Project, we are anxious to avoid being
forced into a decision which we believe may not be in the best interest of the Project." The Bank insisted
upon an 80 percent weighting. Of the valid bids subsequently received, three in the range of PGK 4.5-5.5
million were substantially below the appraisal esdmate of PGK 10 million (without contingencies), and
CDC's estimate of PGK 6.3 million. Ihe fourth bid was for PGK 11.6 million. CDC informally
indicated their unease at the low priced civil works and buildings component of the lowest evaluated bid,
but the Company's Board accepted their bid evaluation consultants' recommendation that "due to the on-
site presence of a full time engineer (to be seconded by CDC to oversee the contract), and the extensive
track record of the bidder (which the consultants had specifically checked), that the bid be approved with
the performance bond increased to 15 percent". The Bank accepted the Company's recommendation on
October 14, 1987.
2.    After a slow mobilization, relations at the site became strained from an early stage of
construction, fiuther delays occurred, and finally, the contract broke down on September 8, 1989. The
Company completed the works with an in-house team, and the final costs were in line with the original
appraisal estimate. Fruit from plantings due to become mature in 1989 and 1990 had to be suppressed
by ablation because of the delayed commissioning of the mill, with a subsequent loss of income.

Commodity Price Risk Management and Operational Lending
1.          The first steps of financial risk management are to identify the objective or objectives of
the project, identify the sources of the risks born by the various parties affected by the project, and
measure the risk exposure of each party. For operational lending, multiple objectives are likely. At the
most basic level, there is the financial feasibility of the loan. Commodity prices are volatile and price
movements will, at different times, benefit or hurt cash flows. How critical are these fluctuations to the
survival of the project and can they be managed? These are questions best addressed during the appraisal
of a project, and ones which may lead to hedging strategies being implemented. There may be
characteristics to the project (diversified products, vertical Integration, long-term agreements, etc.) that
enable it to internally offset the price risks to which it is exposed.
2.           Further, since much of the Bank's commodity-related lending also addresses poverty
issues, questions regarding the effects of commodity price fluctuadons at the household level should be
addressed as well. For example, if the project is a nucleus estate with small-holders ringing a central
processing station, what share of household income is derived from the commodity? How susceptible
is this share to volatile commodity prices? Are alternative markets for family labor available? Can
alternative crops be grown? Again, hedging strategies should be considered as part of the project.
3.           The International Trade Divisionprovides a set of commodity price projections which have
proven good relative to alternatives. Unfortunately, given the large vaiability in commodity prices, no
set of projections will be 'accurate' at any workable level. The International Trade Division also
provides a 70% probability range (i.e., prices are expected to remain within the range with a 70%
probability) and these should be used to conduct rigorous sensitivity analysis. Commodity prices tend
to be characterized by periods of random movements near mid-to-lower levels of the range of historic
prices and occasional spikes. As such, commodity price distributions are not normally distributed and
it is difficult to over-emphasize the wide range of their variability (by way of example, in 1990 dollars,
palm oil averaged $1,071 per ton in 1984 compared to $290 in 1990). Different commodities will have
differences in the frequency of the spikes and the variability of the prices. The consequences for the
firm, of course, are many years of low to negative cash flow mixed with a few extremely profitable
seasons. An understanding of the behavior of commodity prices should be an intrinsic part of the
sensitivity analysis performed.
4.           Where suFstanial commodity price exposure does exist, the question arises as to whether
it can be hedged in the financial markets. Options and futures markets exists for short-run (mostly less
than one year) hedging of commodity prices. In cases where a single comnmodity (for example,
petroleum) is of particular importance, these financial markets can be used to smooth revenue flows, but
only for periods of up to one year ahead. Unfortunately, the f'undamental risk associated with most
commodity lending is the mis-match between the long-term nature of the investment (and associated debt)
and the short-run price variability. Longer-term financial instruments do exist, for example commodity
swaps, commodity loans, and commodity bonds, and while these instruments are ideally suited for
addressing long-term commodity price risk, there are limited markets in these instruments outside of
petroleum, gold, and a few metals. As a result, much of commodity-based lending goes either unhedged,
or is hedged in the context of a larger portfolio of assets.

S.          More concrete steps can sometimes be taken to manage price risk at the household level.
First, during the project evaluation phase, alternative sources of household income shoud be examined.
If crop diversification opportunities or other opportunites for diversifying income sources are not
available, then small-holders may become desperately dependent upon the success or failure of the project
which, In turn may be partially dependent upon wUdly variable commodity markets. If income
diversification oppornities are available, then designing the project to prvide clear signals on prices
and expected prices can assist families in hedging their incomes by allocating their labor efficiently. For
exanple, if the pricing formula links prices on fresh fruit bunches at the plantation level to the spot price
for palm oil In Kuala Lumpur, then announcements (say radio broadcasts) on the palm oil futures
contracts deliverable six months ahead gives small-holder families a good signal for planning and
household-level hedging. Alternatively, some types of small-holder lending can be hedged directly. For
example, a small-holder credit scheme to soybean farmers can bundle a loan for seeds and fertilizer with
a put option. Should the price on soybeans drop, the loan amounts could be reduced, while the lender
is compensated by an increase in the value of the put.
6.          Particular recommendations are likely to grow from the initial project analysis. The
systematic analysis of the price-related risks, starting with a fundamental analysis of the market, tracing
