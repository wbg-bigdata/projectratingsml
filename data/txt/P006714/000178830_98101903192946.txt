AGRICULTUFAL CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        In August 1968 the Government of Colombia asked for a Bank loan to
help finance an agricultural credit project to develop about 3,300 medium-
sized crop and livestock farms covering about 250,000 ha in seven different
areas in wlhich the Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA) is respon-
sible for development. At appraisal it was agreed that because of limitations
of management, the project would be confined to 2,500 medium-sized (10-50 ha)
crop farms covering about 80,000 ha in the two most fertile INCORA areas
(Tolima and Valle).
ii.       The project would be a four-year supervised credit nrogram to in-
crease productivity of major crops for export and import substitution (cotton,
rice, maize, beans and soya) by providing institutional credit to farmers who
at present only have access to limited credit from private sources, and are
farming relatively inefficiently. It would provide incremental seasonal
credit for fertilizer, pesticides and mechanized farming services, and longer
term credit for agricultural machinery and on-farm improvements.   It would
include technical assistance to ensure effective administration of the program
and to prepare an irrigation project of about 60,000 ha in the Cesar river
valley. It would be executed by INCORA, which would also take the financial
risk. The Agrarian, Industrial and Mining Credit Bank (CAJA) would assist by
administering the project account and supplying farm inputs to farmers and
contractors through its supply organization.
iii.      Estimated cost would be about US$42.5 million of which one-third
would be for machinery and on-farm improvements, and one-half for the in-
creased working capital required to finance seasonal farm invuts. The bal-
ance would be for technical assistance and contingencies. Farmers, contrac-
tors and commercial sources would contribute US$17.3 million, 41% of the total
cost. Government would provide US$8.2 million, 19%. The proposed Bank loan
of US$17 million represents 40% of the total cost of the project, and would
be lent to the Government which would on-lend to INCORA on the same terms as
received from the Bank.
iv.       The project is sound and economically justified, with a rate of
return to the economy of about 25%. It is suitable for a loan of US$17 mil-
lion, repayable over 15 years, including a five-year grace period.
v.        In the last three years the Bank has made two loans for agriculture
in Colombia. In 1966 a loan of US$16.7 million was given for a Livestock
Development Project, and in 1968 a loan of US$9 million for the Atlantico
No. 3 Irrigation Project.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Bank missions led by Mr. W. Schaefer-Kehnert visited Colombia in
1967 to evaluate t,he programs and operations of INCORA. It recommended, inter
alia, an early emphasis on credit programs for medium-sized farms to comple-
ment USAID-supported programs for smallholders. Later a credit project was
prepared by INCORA with assistanice from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, and
in August 1968 the Government of Colombia asked for a Bank loan of about US$25
million to help finance it. The project proposed a credit program for the
devE-lopment of about 3,300 medium-sized crop and livestock farms, covering
about 250,000 ha. Total cost would be about US$50 million over a four-year
period. The farms would be in seven selected areas in which the Colombian
Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA) is responsible for agrarian reform and
development. The project as presented was too ambitious for INCORA's re-
souirces, in particular because project supervision in seven widely scattered
areas would have strained management unnecessarily. Because of its very lim-
ited scope compared with the overall demand for credit among medium-sized
farmers, and the heavy demand for credit in the two most fertile INCORA areas,
Government and INCORA agreed that the project should be confined to 2,50()
medium-sized crop farms (10-50 ha) covering about 80,000 ha in these two areas,
giving priority to about 900 irrigated farms.
1.02      This appraisal report is based on INCORA's request and on the find-
ings of a mission consisting of Messrs. A. H. Stoneham (Bank), J. F. Dekker
(FAO Consultant) and K. Berg (Consultant) which visited Colombia in October/
November 1968.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
Agriculture-
2.01      Agriculture accounts for about 30% of Colombia's gross domestic
product, 75% cf total exports, 95% of its food supply, and over 50% of its
supply of industrial raw materials, and directly absorbs about 50% of its
economically active population. Transport and handling of crops, production
of agriculturel inputs and processing of agricultural products provide sub-
stantial additional employment.
2.02      Less than one-third of the available land in Colombia is used for
productive purposes. It is mainly in the Andean region (Map 1), where most
of the population is located. The 1960 census shows some 1.2 million farms
(crop and livestock) covering about 27 million ha. Of these about three-
fourths are smallholdings averaging about 3 ha each, occupying less than 10%
of this area. At the other extreme, under 4% of farms (50,000) occupy three-
fourths of the area, and average about 400 ha each. Apart from coffee, which

Prospects of Colombia": Report No. WH-188a, December 30, 1968.

is dominant, other crops of importance are bananas, plantains, maize, rice,
barley, wheat, cassava, sugar, tobacco, cotton, soya, edible beans, fruit and
vegetables. Livestock is very important and represents by value about one-
quarter of total agricultural production.
2.03      Gross value of non-coffee agricultural production has expanded at
an annual rate of about 4%, slightly more than the rate of population growth.
This has been mainly due to increases in land and labor, with little advance
in other farm inputs or in technology. Production of rice, cotton, sugar and
bananas is increasing, but for most other crops has levelled off. By value
coffee represents about one-third of agricultural and livestock production,
and almost two-thirds of total commodity exports. Bananas, cotton, sugar,
cattle and meat together account for about 13% of agricultural exports, and
are the only other significant non coffee exports. Agricultural imports com-
prise about one-tenth of total imports, and wheat, wool, cocoa and vegetable
oils are the most important. Government's current policy is to encourage in-
creased production of export and import substitution crops, mainly cotton for
export and rice, maize, edible beans and soya for local consumption.
Bank Loans for Agriculture
2.04      In the last three years the Bank has made two loans for the devel-
opment of agriculture in Colombia, totalling US$25.7 million. A loan of
US$16.7 million (448-co) was made in October 1966 for a Livestock Development
Project, estimated to cost about US$28 million. The project covers on-farm
improvements (land clearance, fencing, water supplies, stock handling facili-
ties, and the improvement of pastures and breeding stock) on about 900 beef
cattle ranches, 250 dairy farms and 35 sheep farms, to raise output and pro-
duction efficiency. It is administered by CAJA (para 2.05). A second Live-
stock Development Project is currently under appraisal by the Bank. A loan
of US$9.0 million (502-CO) was made in June 1967 for the first phase of the
Atlantico No. 3 Irrigation Project, estimated to cost about US$16.7 million.
The project covers the settlement and development of about 9,900 ha of irri-
gated land for crops. It is administered by INCORA (para 2.05).
Agricultural Institutions
2.05      The four main nublic institutions serving the agricultural sector
are:
(a)  The Agriculture and Livestock Development Institute (ICA);
established in 1962 as the national institution for research
on crops and livestock, and thaving some responsibilities for
agricultural education. It 'till ultimately take over respon-
sibility for coordination and supervision of all extension
services (para 2.08);
(b) The Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA); set up in 1961
with responsibility for agrarian reform and development in
certain specified areas, aid described more fully in Annex 1.
It has concentrated on land reclamation, irrigation, anc4 land
acquisition for improving conditiona for smallholders.   It



-3-
has introduced a supervised credit program for smallholders
and has over 40 projects throughout the country;
(c) The Agrarian, Industrial and Mining Credit Bank (CAJA);
established in 1931. Its main functions are to provide
credit for agricultural purposes and to supply farm inputs.
It is more fully described in Annex 2;
(d) The Agrarian Marketing Institute (IbEMA); which recently
(1968) succeeded an older institution, and now has respon-
sibility for domestic pricing and distribution of farm
products, and promotion of non-coffee agricultural exports.
Additionally there are quasi-public crop development agencies for coffee,
rice, and cotton.
Institutional Reorganization
2.06      As part of its economic reform objectives, late in 1968 the Govern-
ment reorganized all public institutions serving agriculture. This included
consolidation of the almost; 30 former institutions into 10 new ones, each
with clear-cut lines of responsibility. There is now a three-tier hierarchy,
with the Ministry of Agriculture at the top, responsible for planning and co-
ordination. In the middle are the four main operational institutions; ICA,
INCORA, CAJA and IDEMA. The third tier comprises the rest of the new insti-
tutions.
2.07      An Executive Agricultural Committee has been created, responsible
for agricultural and livestock policy. The Chairman is the Minister of Agri-
culture, and the members are the managers of ICA, IDEMA, INCORA, CAJA, a new
institute for developing natural resources, the Livestock Bank and the Coffee
Growers' Federation. Its technical secretariat is the Planning Office of the
Ministry of Agriculture. Policies being discussed include prices, credit,
storage facilities, identification of exportable surplus and import substi-
tution opportunities, and a reView of the channels for external finance.
Extension and Technical Services
2.038     Agricultural extension and technical assistance services, other
than those of ICA and INCORA, are widely dispersed among about 70 private
agencies, each functioning independently. INCORA provides an extension ser-
vice for its supervised credit program for smallholders. The crop development
agencies and an increasing number of private firms provide extension services
of varying effectiveness at farm level. Those of the crop development agen-
cies tend to specialize in the prevention of pests and disease. For most
seasonal crop loans from institutional and banking sources, farmers have to
contract with one of the agencies or firms for extension assistance. In gen-
eral farmers are willing to use and pay for such services. Government intends
that ultimately all extension services at farm level should be provided through
these agencies and firms, under strict supervision of the newly integrated
service of ICA.  This is expected to take at least four years.    There is a
shortage of suitable personnel available for training for extension work,
which limits its expansion.



Seasonal Inputs
2.09      Consumption of fertilizer in Colombia increased rapidly from about
220,000 tons in 1962 to 300,000 tons in 1964, and has remained practically
unchanged since. Considerably more fertilizer could be effectively used if
sufficient credit was available to farmers to cover its cost. Capacity of
the six local factories, which now produce the bulk of the fertilizer used,
is about 700,000 tons annually, and so is considerably underutilized. Pro-
duction includes urea, ammonium nitrate and phosphate, and mixed fertilizer.
Practically all of the nitrogen and some of the phosphate is locally produced,
while potash is imported. CAJA distributes about half of all fertilizer used
in the country.
2.10      Extensive use is made of pesticides (insecticides, fungicides and
weed control chemicals) by large and small farmers alike. Much is applied
through private aerial crop-spraying services which are available in the major
agricultural areas. Demand for pesticides has been roughly proportional to
the demand for fertilizer. While the basic ingredients are imported, most of
the solvents and emulsifiers used to dilute pesticides for spraying are domes-
tically produced. CAJA distributes about one-third of the total amount used
in Colombia.
2.11      The use of improved seed has been increasing in recent years.    Re-
sponsibility for its production now rests with ICA, while CAJA is the princi-
pal distributor. Although selected seed varieties are fairly readily avail-
able, there is a lack of information for farmers on such matters as optimum
seed rate, suitable varieties, and cuantity and time of rertilizer appli-
cation. This should improve in future under ICA's leadership.
Farm Equipment
2.12      Mechanization has not advanced significantly over the past 10 years.
Average number of tractors imported in -he five years ending 1958 was about
1,900 annually, declining to about 1,650 annually in the five yearn ending
1968. The total effective number of tractors in use today is of the order
of 20,000, probably no larger than 10 years ago. In the past, impcrts of
farm machinery have been given a low priority, and insufficient spare parts
have been brought in to keep all serviceable machinery in operation. This
has inhibited increased m3!chanization, and has resulted in inefficient use of
the machinery E,.lready in the country. Mechanization is mainly confined to
larger farms and commercial crops, particularly paddy, cotton (except for
harvesting), some cereals, and large scale sugar cane production. Many of
the tractors and equipment are owned by small contractors, who do much of the
plowing, cultivating, etc. under contract with individual farmers. INCORA
uses mechanized farming services on contract to an increasing extent in its
smallholder credit program. Apart from tractors and ancillary farm machinery,
there is a small but increasing demand for combine harvesters, and a rising
demand for aircraft for crop spraying. Tractors, harvesters and aircraft are
imported, but most of the ancillary equipment (farm implements) is now manu-
factured locally, as are some tractor parts, including tires and batteries.



There are five main manufacturers of ancillary equipment. Importation of
such equipment is severely restricted by licencing rArocedures. Present
duty on imported farm machinery and equipment is generally 2% ad valorem.
2J13      In the period 1961 through 1967 some 13,000 tractors of 60 different
makes were imported.  Three quarters were of 10 different makes.   Numerically,
about 60% came from the United Kingdom, 25% from the USA, and a further 5%
each from West Germany and Sweden. Tractors from the USA were generally of
higher power, and were valued at over half the total cost. At present some
seven or eight well-known makes are actively represented by ag-ents, and the
market is competitive. Import licensing restrictions have been considerably
eased, but spare parts are still in short supply due to Government's reluctance
to issue licences freely. CAJA plays a major part in the supply of farm ma-
ch.inery and equipment on credit to farmers and contractors, who are free to
purchase from any source. The Government maintains a school for training
tractor operators, and CAJA tries to ensure that tractors bought on credit
are handled by qualified operators.
Marketing and Storage
2.:L4     IDEMA's responsibilities (para 2.05) include the stabilization of
domestic prices. A support price, at which IDEMA is prepared to buy direct
from farmers, is published for most crops before planting starts. If the
market price is above the support price farmers sell their crop in the open
market. In the past, whenever the open market price has been below the sup-
port price, IDEMA's cash resources, storage facilities and staffing have
proved insufficient to absorb more than a fraction of the marketable crop.
So the support price mechanism has not prevented extreme seasonal price move-
ments, and farmers have tended to ignore it when deciding what crops to plant.
The position is improving rapidly. IDEMA's purchases in the first half of
1968 were nine times those of the same period of 1967, due to improved access
to Government funds to finance stocks. It has applied to the Inter-American
Development Bank for a loan of US$15 million to increase storage capacity.
IDEMA can in the future be expected to influence more effectively both price
behavior and cropping decisions.
2.L5      There has been a steady improvement in recent years in the storage
and processing facilities available for the major crops, but they are still
below needs. A number of private concerns associated with commercial banks
have developed storage, silos and drying facilities for use by farmers. Other
installations are owned and used by processors and manufacturers.
B.  r_icultural Credit
Background
2.16      Institutional sources of agricultural credit are described in detail
in Annex 3. Available funds are scarce compared with demand, which is esti-
mated to reach over Ps 10 billion per planting season, mainly for seasonal
credit for fertilizer, pesticides, mechanized services and labor. Demand is



at least three times the current supply from all sources. Supply of institu-
tional credit reaches less than 30% of farmers but is rarely adequate for
their needs. Of this CAJA provides about one-half, the commercial banks one-
third between them, and the balance comes from INCORA and other institutions.
Loans through private moneylenders are extensive, but cannot be measured.
Credit through CAJA reaches some smallholders and medium sized farmers, but
only in areas where it has farm planners to make appraisals. Credit for small-
holders through the INCORA supervised credit Drogram reaches no more than 10/J
of smallholders in INCORA areas, or 2% of the total in the country.
2.17      A study of agricultural credit     was released by the Government
early in 1968. It reports that only 25% of institutional credits are advanced
as a result of detailed technical appraisal of requests, as distinct from rule
of thumb evaluation by farm planners. Most institutional credits are approved
for 'safe' crops only, and are usually fixed as a percentage of estimated pro-
duction costs, which bears no relation to farmers' individual requirements.
Delays in processing applications cause some credit approvals to arrive too
late to be effective. Existing security requirements exclude many potential
borrowers who could use credit effectively but are unable to furnish adequate
security. The study also records that some f'unds advanced for credit are
diverted to other purposes (particularly among larger farmers), a high pro-
portion of loans go to relatively few large borrowers, and there is a lack of
information on credit through private moneylenders.
Credit Terms and Conditions
2.18      Terms and conditions for agricultural credit are detailed in Annex
3, para 3. In general any security is acceptable for short term credits (up
to one year) for farm inputs, but for medium (one to five years) and long term
(five years and over) credits for machinery and farm improvements, a property
mortgage is required. Advances for seasonal inputs are generally limited to
40% of estimated crop value, and for medium and long term to 75% of the caDital
cost of the machinery and improvements.   Most credit from institutional sources
is granted only if the borrower agrees to accept and pay for technical assist-
ance.
Interest Rates
2.19      Interest rates charged by agricultural credit institutions are gen-
erally around 'O to 11% per annum short term, and 12 to 114% medium and long
term, with penal rates of 50% or more in case of default. Commercial bank
interest rates for agricultural loans are around 9 to 10% per annum, rising
to 18% in case of default. Smallholders in the INCORA supervised credit pro-
gram are charged 8% per annum. Farmers in the Livestock Development Project
(supported by Bank loan 448-CO) are charged 124 for medium and long-term loans.
Invariably 1% is added to all the above rates to cover life insurance on the
borrower. Interest rates charged by private moneylenders are of the order of
25% per annum.

III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
Definition
3.01      Theb project would be a four year supervised credit program to improve
production on about 2,500 medium-sized crop farmt (10-50 ha) in INCORA areas.
It would include technical assistance to ensure effectiveness of the ;aroposed
program. Finance would also be provided to INCORA for the preparation by
consultants of an irrigation project of about 60M000 ha in the Cesar river
vEalley.
3.02      The credit program would be in the Departments of Tolima and Valle
irn areas where INCORA is responsible for development; known as Tolima 2-4
(rainfed), Tolima 5 (irrigated) and Valle 1 (rainfed and irrigated) (Map 2).
The principal aim would be to increase productivity of major crops for export
and import substitution (cotton, rice, maize, beans and soya), by providing
institutional credit to farmers who, in its absence, are dependent on insuf-
ficient and expensive credit from private moneylenders, and are farming rela-
tively-inefficiently. The responsibility for executing the project, and the
financial risk of the credit program would rest with INCORA. CAJA would be
responsible for supplying farm inputs and for maintaining, for a fee, the pro-
ject account.
Project Areas
3.03      The areas chosen for the project deserve priority for the following
reasons: (a) they have the best farm land in the country; (b) supporting serv-
ices for farm input supply, processing, storage, marketing and transportation
of farm produtce are comparatively well developed; (c) farmers are generally
mcre active and progressive; and (d) the return to farmers from both irrigated
and rainfed farms is potentially much greater than the national average.
3.o4      Altitudes in the project areas vary between 1,000 and 2,000 meters.
Climates are temperate, with average temperatures around 18 C. There are two
raLiny seasons, February to April and September to December, and one dry season,
April to AuguLst. Annual rainfall varies from 1,000 to 1,400 mm. The estimated
size of the project areas and number of farms is as follows:

-8-
About 45,000 ha in Tolima 5 will be affected by current canal rehabilitation
works. In Valle 1 major flood control and irrigation works are being con-
structed with help from the Inter-American Development Bank.
tKroJe_ct C~ro!tp-
3.05     'Two crops can be grown each calendar year in all areas.    Major
cropping patterns would be:
First        Second

Valle 1      Irrigated     Cotton       Soya and beans
Valle 1      Rainfed       Cotton       Soya and beans
To control disease in project areas, cotton is not allowed by law to be grown
in the second season. If rice is planted in both seasons in Tolima 5, a weed
(coquito or nut grass) appears which causes milling problems, and means re-
duced prices to the farmers. There is insufficient water in Valle 1 (irrigated)
to plant rice in the second season, and soya and beans are the best alternatives.
The cropping patterns in areas other than Tolima 5, particularly in the second
season (July to December), would be liable to change through possible influence
by IDEMA on cropping decisions (para 2.14), and the development of alternative
crops. The patterns above show the most likely crops to be grown, based on
their current profitability. But if other crops become more profitable, whether
due to higher support or market prices, better yields, or any other factor, they
will be substituted. When ICA has developed a disease-resistant variety of
sesame, it should prove an attractive alternative in project areas, where past
results with it have been disappointing.
Project Farmers
3.06      Farmers who would benefit from the project are potentially very good
but their productivity is hax4pered by lack of credit. They are unable to get
credit from commercial banks because of the type of loans required (development
credit) and lack of orthodox banking security (para 2.17). Being in INCORA
areas they cannot presently get credit from CAJA. The amounts obtained from
moneylenders are very limited and relatively expensive and generally money-
lenders do not give credit for on-farm improvements, which are essential to
improve productivity on some irr:Lgated farms. As a result of lack of credit
farmers cannot obtain the limited mechanized farming services currently avail-
able when they require them, but only when convenient to the contractor. Work
tends to be dore inefficiently at cut prices and this coupled with its untime-
liness, has an adverse effect on yields. Insufficient credit also precludes
the use of adequate fertilizer and pesticides for optimum yields. Almost half
the farmers in rainfed areas do not plant a second crop !ach year, preferring
to leave their lands fallow.   Productivity would be significantly increased
through access to adequate credit and improved availability of mechanized serv-
ices. Land at present under fallow for one season would be farmed for both
seasons, effectively increas1n- the area under cultivation by about 20,000 ha.

B.  Detailed Features
Project Farms
3.07      About 2,500 farms are expected to participate in the project, with
estimated phasing as below:
Number of farms             1969/70  1970/71  1971/72  1972/73  Total    (%)
Tolima 5                       320      380        -        -      700   (28)
Tolima 2-4 rainfed               -       90       570     760    1,420   (57)
Valle  1   irrigated             -       60        80      40     180    ( 7)
Valle  1   rainfed               -       30        70     100      200   ( 8)
Total                     320      560       720     900   2,500   (100)
Cumulative           320      880     1,600_ 2,500           _
Cumulative (%)       12        35        64     100
Priority would first be given to Tolima 5, afterwards to Valle 1 (irrigated)
as that became ready in 1970/71. The project would reach about 14% of the
18,000 medium-sized farms in the project area. Phasing would be limited by
the rate at which farm planners could be trained (para 4.03). The maximum
effect from the project could be expected from 1976/77 onwards, when the farms
entering it in 1972/73 would be at full production.
3.08      The average size of a project farm in Tolima 5 would be 25 ha; all
others would be 35 ha. The estimated build-up of area under development is
shown in Annex 4. Total area affected would reach 72,500 ha (30% irrigated
and 70% rainfed) at the end of 1972/73, of which almost 85% would be in Tolima.
This total excludes 10% of each farm area as being under miscellaneous crops
and buildings. Gross area would be 80,000 ha.
On-farm Improvements
3.09      On-farm improvements, mainly to land, buildings and roads, are esti-
mated to cost about Ps 78 million, with a foreign exchange component of about
Ps 16 million (20%). Average cost of improvements on irrigated farms, at
Ps 75,000 per farm, would be ten times that on rainfed farms, and would in-
clude levelling, irrigation and drainage ditches. Some of the land improve-
ments, particularly on irrigated farms, would be done by INCORA with earth-
mc,ving equipment purchased on its own account (para 3.11), and farmers would
be charged with the cost of the work.
Machinery for Farmers and Contractors
3.10      Total cost of machinery and spares is estimated at Ps 161 million,
as follows:



- 10 -
Unit      Total
Quan-   cost       cost
__ tity  Ps '000  Ps million
Tractors and equipment 65 HP     720     115       82.8
Tractors and equipment 35 HP     350      90       31.5
Combine harvesters                37     250        9.3
Crawler tractors                   5     700        3.5

Spares for above items             -       -       26.0
Aircraft                          13     320        4.2
Aircraft spares                    -       -        0.8
Total cost                         160.8
3.11      Only farmers with more than 30 ha would be given credit to buy a
tractor and equipment to work their own farms exclusively, and about 400 could
be expected to do so. Under conditions in the project area, annual costs per
ha on smaller farms would be less by using contractors' services. However,
farmers with less than 30 ha would be encouraged to buy machinery on credit,
provided they contracted with INCORA to supply machinery services to other
farmers in the area. Contractors would buy the balance of the tractors and
the combine harvesters, with credit advanced by INCORA through CAJA (para
3.16). The crawler tractors, scrapers and levellers would be purchased by
INCORA and used for land improvements (para 3.09).
3.12      Aircraft crop spraying services are required mainly for cotton, and
to a lesser extent for rice. Cotton has to be fumigated about 13 times per
season, mainly in a period of two months. Due to the relatively small size
of each field, one plane is able to fumigate between 300.and 400 ha only per
day, and so is able to take care of about 1,500 ha of cotton effectively in
the growing season. There are at present eight companies owning 32 aircraft
in the rroject area, but this fleet is considerably augmented by aircraft from
other areas during the cotton growing season, and itself goes elsewhere when
local demand is small. To meet the extra demand for crop spraying services
for the additiQnal 20,000 ha expected to be farmed under the project (para
3.06), 13 more aircraft would be required. They would be purchased through
one or other of the three agents at present importing them. The available
makes are from USA firms specializing in crop-spraying aircraft. Manufactur-
ers from other countries are not debarred from the Colombian market, but few
specialize in these aircraft. Contractors would pay half the cost, and obtain
the balance on credit through INCORA (para 3.17).
3.13      Past shortage of spare parts for imp3rted agricultural machinery and
equipment has been due to the restrictive import licensing system, and has
inhibited increased mechanization (para 2.12).: Similarly shortage of spare
parts for crop spraying aircraft (particularly engine spares for routine over-
hauls) has restricted their serviceability. Adequate spares are essential to
the project.  Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the prompt
importation of spare parts, to such an extent as would be required for the



continuous and proper functioning of all imported agricultural machinery and
equipment and crop-spraying aircraft, would be p6rmitted.   Cost of spares has
been calculated at 20% of the total cost of machinery, equipment and aircraft.
Net Increase in Working Capital
3.:L4     Seasonal credit would be givezn for fertilizer, pesticides, and mach-
inery services (except when farmers owaed their own tractors, para 3.11), and
farmers would provide their own funds for labor, seeds and other seasonal in-
puts. The amounts required at the beginning of each season would be reimbursed
at the end, so the additional working capital required to finance seasonal in-
puts as the project builds up would be their incremental cost from one season
to the next. The provision of the additional working capital requirements is
an essential part of the project. Without it the other inputs could not be
advantageously used, and the project would be ineffective. The estimated in-
crease in working capital would be Ps 355 million over the first four project
years (Annex 5, Table 2), of which Ps 171 million (48%) would be from credit
through INCORA, and the balance would be found by farmers from their own re-
sources. As already explained in para 3.06 farmers in the project areas can-
no-t obtain their credit requirements from either the commercial banks, CAJA
or moneylenders. Even if this were possible the total funds currently avail-
able are quite insufficient to meet the demand for credit, which is at least
three times the supply from all sources (para: 2.16). If the project is to be
effective, provision must be made for additional working capital. This is an
experimental program in a development area and the loan would not replace
existing working capital.
Credit to Farmers
3.15      Credit would be extended to farmers holding title to a farm, and to
creditworthy tenant farmers with satisfactory tenancy agreements, farming
between 10 and 50 ha in the project areas. They would be required to accept
supervision by INCORA's farm planners.
(a)  Medium and long-term credit: INCORA would advance credit for 75%
of the cost of farm machinery and on-farm improvements, the balance
being found by the farmer. Borrowers would pay 13% interest per
annum plus 1% life insurance. Credits for farm machinery would be
for five years, and on-farm improvements 10 years, with no grace
period.
(b)  Short-term seasonal credit: INCORA would provide through CAJA
seasonal credit for fertilizer, pesticides and mechanical services.
Borrowers would pay 13% interest per annum, plus 1% life insurance.
Credit would be supplied in kind from CAJA's depots whenever pos-
sible. INCORA would pay contractors direct for services to farmers.
Credit would be repaid at the end of the season in which it was
advanced.



- 12 -
Credit to Contractors
3.16      INCORA would advance credit to contractors supplying contract serv-
ices in the project areas for tractors, ancillary equipment and combine har-
vesters. Credit would be repaid over five years with no grace period, and with
interest at 13% per annum. Purchasers would pay 25% of the cost in cash.
Contractors receiving credit would contract with INCORA to provide a speci-
fied minimum service to project farmers.   About 700 tractors would be required
to meet the estimated increase in demand for contractor services. Existing
contractors may find it difficult to expand operations at an appropriate rate,
because of limitations to their creditworthiness and to the size of an economic
contracting unit. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that INCORA
would encourage existing contractors to participate and new ones to enter
project areas, by making firm contracts with them for agreed services to
project farmers.
3.17      INCORA would give credit for 13 crop-spraying aircraft up to 501c of
their cost, subject to purchasers offering adequate security, obtaining a
license from Government to operate a service in a project area, and contract-
ing with INCORA to provide a specified minimum service to project farmers.
Credit would be repaid over tnree years with interest at 13%o per annum.
Credit Terms and Conditions
3.18      During negotiations assurances were obtained that the above terms
and conditions for credit to farmers and contractors would not be altered with-
out prior consultation with the Bank.
Technical Assistance and Services
3.19      Cost of tech4ical assistance to INCORA for management services and
the Cesar River Study would amount to about Ps 57 million (US1$3.5 million)
with a foreign exchange component of 41%, Ps 24 million (US$1.4 million).
3.20      INCORA Management Services: Technical assistance would consist of
one credit expert to assist with administration of the program at headquarters
for a 4-year period (para 4.02), four experienced agronomists to assist in
training farm planners in the field for a 3-year period (para 4.03), together
with the cost of 75 vehicles for the farm planners, which would be necessary
for efficient use of their time. Details are at Annex 5, page 2.
3.21      INCORA Cesar River Study: The proposed study is not directly related
to the main credit project, but has been included to maintain the pipeline for
possi1le future projects. Consultants would prepare by mid-1971 a feasibility
study, suitable as a basis for appraisal, for irrigated development of about
60,000 ha in the Cesar river valley. They would establish a 100 ha demonstra-
tion and experimental farm on a representative area, and initiate a pilot pro-
ject on about 3,000 ha. They would also outline a draft master plan for the
ultimate development of the entire 250,000 ha believed to be suitable for ir-
rigation in the valley. INCORA invited two consultants familiar with condi-
tions in the Caribbean Plain (Map 2) to make proposals for the study, and 'as



- 13 -
tentatively accepted those of Tahal Consulting Engineers Ltd. of Israel. Du-
ri.ng negotiations assurances were obtained that the terms and conditions of
the proposals, staff members assigned, and consultarnts contract would be
acceptable to the Bank. Total estimated cost of the work would be Ps 43 mil-
lion (US$2.57 million) of which 36%, or Ps 15 million (US$0.92 million), would
be foreign exchange. Further details are in Annex 6.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
P2rjxect Cost
3.22?     The estimated total cost of the project would be Ps 712 million
(US$42.5 million), of which 29a, Ps 208 mtllion (US$12.4 million), would be
foreign exchange. Details of these estimates are in Annex 5. They are sum-

3.24      The proposed Bank loan of US$17 million (Ps 284 million) would be
lent to Government which would bear the exchange risk, and on-lent to INCORA
on the same terms as received from the Bank. Loans to farmers for capital
investment would be made over the first four years, and repayments by them for
on-farm improvements would end in the fourteenth year.   The Government would,
from 1973 onwards, maintain the Fund for seasonal credit at not less than
Ps 171 million. The cash flow estimates (Annex 5, page 5) of the project ac-
count (para 4.08) show that, provided the Government contribution to project
funds was given to INCORA as equity, free of interest (para 3.25), the project
would be able to repay the Bank loan over 15 years, with a grace period of 5
years. Funds surplus to project requirements would be used for further credits
to medium-sized farms until required for loan repayment, and the interest earned
would accrue to the project account.   Agreement to the above terms, including
the use of surplus funds as proposed, was obtained during negotiations.
3.25      The balance required from public funds would be Ps 138 million
(US$8.2 million); of which Ps 79 million (US$4.7 million) is for incremental
working capital. CAJA has access to Central Bank funds for rediscounting up
to 100% of credits of five years and less, up to a present limit of Ps 1,700
million (Annex 2), and also to the Agrarian Finance Fund (Annex 3) for limited
discounting on some other agricultural credits. Since it uses these facili-
ties to the limit for its other commitments, it would not be able to finance
project working capital from these sources without displacing some other com-
mitment. INCORA is dependent on Government for its funds for all purposes.
The balance from public funds would therefore have to come from Government
sources. The project account cash f'low estimates (Mnex 5, page 5) show that
the project would not be able to support any interest payments on Government
funds without increasing interest rates to farmers. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that Government would make the balance of public funds
necessary to implement the project available to INCORA as an interest-free
grant.

IV. ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION
P_oJect Administration
4.o)l     Details of INCORA are in Annex 1.   A Bank mission which reviewed
its operations in 1967 reported that while it was carrying out its responsibi-
lities creditably under progressive leadership, on-going reclamation projects
should be completed before new ones were started.   The mission recommended
that: (a) new projects should not be undertaken before their feasibility had
been established;,(b) more emphasis should be given to colonization to balance
INCORA's investment program; (c) a credit program for medium-sized farms should
be started, to complement the smallholder credit project; (d) program planning
should be improved by establishment of a planning and economic analysis unit;
and (e) staff capabilities should be improved by continued in-s;ervice training.
Government and INCORA accepted the main findings of the mission's report, which
remain valid, and have been implementing them. The planning unit has been set
up hnd is functioning effectively. In-service training is continuing, but
staff capabilities are still a limiting factor.
4.02      The credit division within INCORA's Agricultural Development Depart-
merit is responsible for coordination and promotion of agricultural credit and
extension, and supervision of credit programs. For the project to function
efficiently, the division would require strengthening by the addition of a
senior credit specialist to head a new section responsible for the project.
The appointment would last four years, and the specialist would be required
to train a counterpart to succeed him. Agreement was obtained during nego-
tiations that prior to effectiveness of the loan INCORA would appoint on
suitable terms and conditions a senior credit specialist acceptable to the
Bank.
4.03      A major factor limiting project implementation is the rate at which
farm planners can be trained. A training program is currently operating with
French technical assistance, producing around 18 farm planners a year. Twenty
trainees are alreadv in the field, and by the end of 1972/73 about 75 farm
planners would be working. Because of competing demands for qualified person-
nel for training, it would be difficult to increase this number significantly.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that funds would be made available
to continue the training program through 1972/73. Trainees are mainly agri-
cultural engineers of university level. Their training is generally very
goc)d, although somewhat lacking in agronomy. To remedy this it is proposed
to appoint four practical agronomists with field experience of similar agri-
culture for a period of three years, to assist and train the farm planners at
farm level. Agreement was obtained during negotiations that prior to effective-
ness of the loan INCORA would appoint four agronomists acceptable to the Bank
on suitable terms and conditions.
4.()4     INCORA would be responsible for the implementation of the project,
and would assume the financial risk.   Its farm planners would prepare with
the! applicant a farm plan and credit application. INCORA's credit section



responsible for the project would establish applicant's creditworthiness, and
the terms, guarantees and conditions of the credit. Through the farm planners
it would supervise implementation of the farm plan. It would be responsible
for collection of overdue loans.
4.05      CAJA would act as INCORA's agent for the credit program, by oper-
ating the project account and by supplying farm inputs in kind. It has suf-
ficient depots close to project areas to give an adequate service to ptoject
farmers, both for supplying farm inputs and receiving loan repayments. It
would also prepare credit documents, fulfill legal formalities, and send bor-
rowers repayment reminders. Its fees for its services are discussed in para
4.09. Prior to effectiveness of the loan, an agreement satisfactory to the
Bank would be signed between Government, INCORA and CAJA, covering their
responsibilities and duties for project implementation.
Procurement
4.o6      Procurement of project supplies would be as follows:
(a) Fertilizer and pesticides: Farmers would obtain their supplies in
kind from CAJA depots. In keeping with Bank loan procurement re-
quirements, assurances were obtained during negotiations that
CAJA would obtain its supplies through international competitive
bidding procedures;
(b)  Machinery: This comprises mainly tractors and combines which are
imported (para 2.12). It is available through local importers, of
which there are a sufficient number to provide adequate competition.
Farmers and contractors would be free to purchase from any local
supplier, subject to CAJA approval of the purchase price. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that INCORA would purchase
vehicles for farm planners through international competitive bidding
procedures. Goods to be procured under international competitive
bidding would be subject to E. preference margin of 15% or the exist-
ing level of duties whichever is the lower. These would include, in
addition to vehicles, the fertilizer and pesticides referred to in
subparagraph (a) above;
(c)  Equimpent:  Farm implements would be purchased by farmers from exist-
ing commercial channels. Suitable implements are manufactured locally
and supplies are adequate. Imports are virtually excluded by licens-
ing procedures (import duties are only 2% ad valorem). Prices for
locally manufacturd equipment appear to be about 10% higher than
those for comparable inputs at existing tariff levels.
(d) Aircraft: Contractors would be free to purchase crop-spraying air-
craft from any importer (pare. 3.12), subject to CAJA approval of
the purchase price.



- 17 -
Disbursement
4.07      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be as follows:
(a)  On-farm improvements: 86% of all credits given by INCORA through
the project account up to a limit of US$3.1 million (Ps 52 million).
(b)  Machinery and equipment (including aircraft): 86% of all credits
given by INCORA through the project account up to a limit of
US$5.3 million (Ps 88 million).
(c)  Incremental Working Ca _tal: 54% of the increments of all credits
given by INCORA through the project account up to an overall limit
of US$5.5 million provided however that the aggregate of all with-
drawals from the Bank loan under this category shall not exceed
the following amounts:
(i) US$0.6 mi1lion before July 1, 1970
(ii) US$1.6 million before July 1, 1971
(iii)  US$3.4 million before July 1, 1972 and
(iv)  US$5.5 mi:Lliof before July 1, 1973
(d) Technical assistance: As incurred as follows:
(i) Credit specialist, agronomists and vehicles for farm
planners: 86% of agreed costs up to a limit of US$0.7
million (Ps 12 million)
(ii) Cesar River Study: 36% of agreed costs up to a limit of
US$0.9 million (Ps 15 million).
Disbursement would be against statements of expenditure probably on a monthly
basis. Claims would be made by INCORA as representative of the Government.
Claims for machinery and equipment (including aircraft) would be supported
by normal documentation.
ProJect Account
4.o8      CAJA would maintain on behalf of INCORA a separate project account,
wh:ich would cover all items, including technical assistance, and show all pro-
ject transactions. It would distinguish between: short term credit; medium
an(i long term credit to farmers; credit to contractors; technical assistance;
disbursements from Bank loan; disbursements from Government funds; interest
earned from credits; bad debts provisions; and CAJA's fees for operating the
account. Interest earned would be paid out to INCORA''; general funds to cover
the cost of technical assistance, but only after adequate amounts had been
provided for bad debts. Estimates of cash flow through project account are at
Annex 5, page 5. CAJA's fee for operating the account would be one-thirteenth



- 18 -
of interest earned. This should cover its expenses in operating the account.
The project account would be audited annually by independent auditors accept-
able to the Bank. The agreement between Government, C.AJA and INCORA covering
their responsibilities and ciuties for project implementation, which would
include operation by CAJA of the project account, has been discussed in para
4.05.
V. PRODUCTION MARKETS A1'D FARMERS' BENEFITS
Production
5.01      The estimates of project production below are based on the cropping
patterns in Dara 3.05. Crops would be liable to substitution as explained in
that paragraph.
(a)  Cotton: Colombian production --/ increased at an average rate of
almost ll,o annually between 1950 and 1967.  1968 production is
around 340,000 tons, a record, due partly to higher prices
(recently negotiated between farmers and the textile industry)
and partly to the relatively easier availability of credit for
this crop. Over two-thirds is grown in the project areas. It
is estimated that project farmers at present (1968/69) produce
about 69,000 tons, which would be expected to increase to about
183,000 tons at full production, largely due to increased yields
and production from land at present fallow for one season. The
increase of about 114,000 tons would produce about 13,000 tons
of cottonseed oil for local consumption.
(b)  Rice: Total production in 1968 was about 780,000 tons of paddy,
with an average annual growth rate since 1960 of about 6%. To
date it has been entirely consumed within the country, but about
40,000 tons are expected to be exported in 1969. It is estimated
that project farmers at present produce about 63,000 tons annually,
which would be expected to increase to about 94,000 tons at full
production.
(c)  Soya: Total production of soya has been increasing at an annual
growth rate of over 10%,/ since 1960, and is now about 90,000 tons
annually. It is processed and consumed locally. It is estimated
that project farmers at present produce about 8,500 tons annually,
which would be expected to increase to about 13,000 tons at full
production.
(d) Edible beans: Total production of beans has declined from 47,000
tons in 1950 to about 38,000 in 1967. It is estimated that project
farmers at present produce about 4,000 tons annually which would
be expected to increase to 7,000 tons at full production.
1/   Mainly of medium-long s-taple, between 1 and 1 3/32 inch (2.54 cm to
2.78 cm).



- 19 -
(e)  Maize: Colombian production has an average annual growth rate of
under 1% since 1950, and is now about 900,000 tons.  It is estimated
that project farmers at present produce about 80,000 tons annually,
which would be expected to increase to about; 121,000 tons at full
proauction.
5.02      The estimated impact of the project on production would be as fol-
lows:

/2 % increase over 1968/69 production.
At the end of 1972/73 estimated total annual tonnage of crops produced would
have increased by about 45%, and at the end of 1976/77, when at full production
from all farms, by about 85%. Estimated value of production in local markets
would increase from about Ps 525 million (US$31 million) in 1968/69 to Ps 750
million (US$145 million) in 1972/73, and to Ps 890 million (US$53 million) at
full production.
Markets and Prices
5.03      At present about 75,000 tons of seed cotton are required for the
modern local textile industry, which is producing at almost maximum capacity
for the local market, but has poor export prospects. Future export is limited
due to quota restrictions. Demand from local industry is expected to rise
but the main portion of increased cotton production would be exported. Local
market prices in real terms have kept fairly steady over the past five years,
but are now about 20% above equivalent USA market prices. The outlook for
cotton exports in the longer term is difficult to evaluate 1/, but a downward
trend in local market prices can be expected as the larger quantities exported
adjust to world prices. In the project estimates a price decline to the farmer
aireraging almost 4% annually over the next seven years has been used, based
on estimates of the world market position made within the Bank, which show
that the world price for medium-long staple cotton is likely to decline by
about 12% between 1968/69 and 1976/77.
5.04      In real terms, local market prices for rice have risen about 20%
over the past five years, but are now slightly above equivalent world market
prices.  Past increases in production, averaging 6% ainually, have more than
1,/  WH-188a, para 129.



- 20 -
kept pace with population growth (3.5%), and the trend is likely to continue.
As more rice is exported the average price to farmers can be expected to de-
cline, and in project estimates a decline of 2% annually over the next 5 years
has been used, based on estimates of the world market position made within the
Bank. The estimated average annual increase from project production (about
4,000 tons) would be under 1% of current production.
5.05      Colombia is a net importer of vegetable oils, and consumes about
100,000 tons a year. The market for soya is related to that of cotton and
sesame which are the main domestic sources of edible oils, accounting for
over one-half of total. Soya now accounts for one-fifth. In real terms soya
prices have remained fairly steady over the past four years, and in project
estimates the current price has been used throughout. The estimated average
annual increase from project production of about 600 tons would be under 1%
of current production. The oil obtained from soya, and from cotton seed (para
5.01), would reduce imports of vegetable oils into Colombia.
5.06      Prices of edible beans in real terms have increased by about one-
half over the past five years. Government is encouraging their consumption
through a publicity campaign as part of its import substitution program. The
increase in demand arising from the publicity is likely to lead to increased
plantings, and the future trend of prices is uncertain. In the project esti-
mates the current price to the farmer has been used throughout. The average
annual increase of about 350 tons from the project would be about 1% of cur-
rent production.
5.07      Maize prices, in real terms, have remained relatively steady for
some years past. The current price to farmers has been used throughout the
project estimates. The estimated average annual increase from the project of
about 5,000 tons would be less than one-half percent of current production.
Benefit; to Farmers
5.08      The principal benefit to farmers would be the provision of institu-
tional supervif;ed credit which would enable them to farm more efficiently, and
in some cases to follow better mixed farming practices. The provision of more
mechanized farming services would enable them to obtain these services when
required rather than when available. With more adequate credit they would
spend more on fertilizer, pesticides and more thorough plowing, cultivating,
etc., and thus get closer to optimum yields. With institutional credit, on-
farm improvements could be made, and these are particularly desirable on ir-
rigated farms. The technical assistance received from farm planners would
also help to improve productivity.
5.09      The financial benefits to farmers have been estimated on the basis
of representative farm models for each of the project areas. These are at
Annex 8 (Tables 1 to 4). Average net income per farmer in the four areas is
ihown in Annex 8, Table 5. Wiithout the project, farm incomes in all areas
vould decline, due to the reducing price of cotton (para 5.03), and for rice
also in Tolima 5. Average decline for all farms would be about 35% over a
5-year period, ranging from about 25% in Tolima 5 to 40% in Tolima 2-4.    In-
come of farmers entering the project would increase, by about 20% on irrigated



- 21 -
farms and over 60% on rainfed farms over the same period, at the end of which
farms woul6 be in full production. Actual net intcomes in the fifth year would
vary from Ps 145,000 (US$5,600) in Tolima 5 to Ps 71,000 (US$4,250) in Tolima
2-4. i'he net; gain to farmers by coming into the project instead of staying
out would vary in the fifth year from Ps 53,000 (US$3,150) in Tolima 5 to
PE: 39,000 (US'$2,300) in Valle 1 irrigated. The relatively high increase
be!tween years 0 and 1 in rainfed areas would be due to land formerly fallow
in one season being double cropped.  However there may be crop substitution
as explained in para 3.05.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSIIFICATION
6.01      The main contributiof of the project to the development of the
Colombian economy would be the increased production of import substitution
and export crops. At full production (1976/77) the increase in local market
vElue of annual production would be of the order of US$22 million, of which
over US$10 million would be exportable. This is about one-seventh of present
export earnings from agricultural crops (other than coffee). It would be a
ve.ry significant contribution from 2,500 farmers farm:ing about 2% of the total
area under crops (excluding coffee). A second important contribution would be
the project's influence on reversing the present downward trend in prosperity
in the project area among agricultural labor. Cotton, the main project crop,
is regarded by labor as a "village crop' since harvesting and preparation for
market are done by hand. It brings much greater prosperity into the villages
than rice, which is harvested by machine.   Arn additional benefit, which is not
readily quantifiable, would come from the progressive availability for other
proJects after 1973 of a number of the 75 farm planners trained under the pro-
ject.
6.02      The rate of return to the economy of the main project (excluding the
Cesar River Study) would be about 25%, based on a life of 10-years, including
technical services and assistance, and calculating labor costs at the official
wage rates (which may be overestimated in the conditions of underemployment in
the project areas). Detailed calculations are in Annex 9.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The project is technically sound and economically justified.   It
would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$17 million, equivalent to about 40%
of total project costs. The borrower would be the Government which would
on-lend to INCORA on the same terms as received from the Bank. Government
would contribute 19% of project costs, and the remainder (41%) would come
from private sources.
7.02      A number of assurances have been received from the Government in-
c:Luding the following:



- 22 -
(i) import licenses for spare parts to such an extent as would
be required for the continuous and proper functioning of
all imported agricultural machinery, aircraft and equipment
would be granted Dromptly to agents on application (para
3.13);
(ii) INCORA would be provided with the balance of funds required
for the project as equity (para 3.25);
(iii) prior to effectiveness of the loan, INCORA would appoint the
credit specialist and agronomists acceptable to the Bank
on suitable terms and conditions (paras 4.02 and 4.03);
(iv) the agreement between Government, INCORA and CAJA would be
subject to approval by the Bank and signed prior to effective-
ness of the loan (para 4.05);
(v) Fertilizer, pesticides and vehicles for farm planners would
be obtained through international competitive bidding pro-
cedures (para 4.06).



ANNEX 1

AGRICULTURE CREDIT PROJECT
INCORA
Objectives
1.     The Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform (INCORA) is an
autonomous Government institution, set up under the Agrarian Reform
Law 135 of 1961, to reform the agrarian social structure of Colombia.
Much land is inequitably concentrated in the hands of relatively few
people, wlhile at the other extreme, some smallholders are trying to farm
land which is too small in area to be profitable. INCORA is respon-
sible for bringing these two extremes closer together. Where large
and potentially valuable areas are being left uncultivated, or are
being wastefully or inadequately used, INCORh is authorised to buy
them up and develop them. INCORA is also responsible for raising
the standard of living of the rural population in areas in which it
operates, by increasing production and productivity, particularly by
making credit readily available to smallholders and encouraging them
to use it.
Operations
2.     To achieve these objectives, INCORA has concentrated on land
reclamation, irrigatibn and land acquisition for: colonization in
unpopulated areas; consolidation of uneconomic smallholdings; and
division of large areas into smallholdings. It has encouraged the
issue of land titles to give farmers security of tenure and to ensure
their eligibility for credit. It has introduced supervised credit
and technical assistance to subsistence smallholders to develop them
into commercial producers. Its activities comprise over 40 projects
located throughout the country (Map 2).  Of these, about one-third
are mainly concerned wi-bh land reclamation and irrigation, one-quarter
with colonization, and the balance with farm improvement and super-
vised credit.
Administration and management
3.     Under INCORA's constitution, Directors are chosen so that the
Board reflects broad political parity. The Ministry of Agriculture
is Chairman, and the 16-man Board includes representatives of ICA,
CAJA, IDEA., the Geographical Institute, farmers associations,
agricultural cooperatives, livestock breeders, farm workers, the
Catholic Church, and the Army.  Two Senators and two Representatives
of Parliament are also members. Board members serve for a two-year
term. The General Manager is nominated by the President of the
Republic, and his political affiliations must be different from those
of the General Manager of CAJA.
4.     There are five separate departments at headquarters, as shown
in the attached organization chart. Field operations are decentralised






ANNEX 1
Page 2
as far as possible through regional offices, but overall responsibility
for direction, planning, general policy formulation, and supervision
remains at headquarters. There are about 1,500 professional and sub-
professional staff, of which about 400 are at headquarters. About
one-third are administrators, one-third agricultural technicians,
one-fifth engineers, and the balance legal and other professionals.
Total staff is at present about 4,500. The Agricultural Development
Department is composed of four divisions: rural development; agri-
cultural promotion; credit; marketing and cooperatives. Total
professional staff of the Department is about 80, of which one-
third each are in the agricultural promotion and credit divisions.
Finance
5.     INCORA is dependent on Government for the majority of its
funds.  Its resources include appropriations, agrarian bonds, proceeds
of foreign and domestic loans, donations, and income from current
operations. Summarized balance sheets and budgets for the past four
years are at Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Administrative costs
(excluding interest charges on borrowings) were 1.2, 1.7 and 1.4% of
average capital employed for the three years 1966 through 1968.
Accounts are audited by the Government audit department.
Supervised credit program
6.     The program, started in 1964, has received two loans totalling
US$18 million (Ps 300 million) from USAID. To be eligible for credit,
farmers have to own or rent less than 10 ha of land in INCORA area.
Seasonal credits for operational costs, and longer term credits for
machinery, livestock and farm improvements are advanced. Average
size of loans made in 1967 was about Ps 22,500, and at the end of that
year 19,000 loans were outstanding. An average of about one third
of each loan was for seasonal credit. Interest charged on loans is
9% per annum, wJhich includes 1% for life insurance.  At the end of
1967 about 10% of loans due were in arrears. Cost of administering
the program has been reduced from 3.0% of sums loaned in 1964 to 1.1%
in 1967. There are some 320 credit supervisors working with some 80
agronomists on the program. Four supervisors and one agronomist
work as a team, each team handling some 240 smallholdings. The
program has been generally successful. CAJA operates the program account
for a fee.
1967 Bank mission
7.     A Bank mission visited Colombia in 1967 to evaluat,e the programs
and operations of INCORA. The missionts main findings were that
INCORA was in general carrying out its responsibilities in a creditable
manner writh an appropriate organization and under progressive

leadership; on-going reclamation projects should be completed before
new ones were started; and new projects should not be undertaken
before their technical viability and economic justification had
been carefully studied. To improve the balance of INCORA's investment
program, more emphasis should be given to colonization, which would
permit bringing new areas into efficient production at relatively low
cost. The mission recommended that program planning should be
improved through the establishment of a planning and economic analysis
unit, and that staff capabilities should be improved through a
continuing in-service training program.
8.     The mission noted that in INCORIV areas there was a total of
about 33,000 medium-sized farms which did not have access to any
institutional credit, since they were too small to obtain it direct
from commercial banks, too large to obtain it under the supervised
credit program, and unable to obtain it from CAJA, which does not
operate in INCORA areas. The mission recommended that a new program
for medium-sized farmers be initiated, and this project is the result.

AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
CAJA
Objectives
1.     The Colombian Agrarian, Industrial and Mining Credit Bank (CAJA)
was created in 1931 as a joint stock corporation to provide credit to
farmers tnable to obtain it from other sources. Later its responsib-
ilities were extended to include credit for small industry and mining.
Operations
2.     Apart from providing credit as above, it administers a savings
department, an insurance department, and some Government agricultural
development projects /. It operates a supplies department to provide
farmers with seasonal inputs and farm machinery. It also administers
for INCOfA, for a fee, the account of the Smallholders Supervised
Credit Program (Annex 1 para 6).
Administration and management
3.     CAJA has a Board of ten Directors, which includes the Minister
of Agriculture, a representative of the President of the Republic, one
representative each from the Coffee Growers Federation, the Farmers
Association and the Central Bank, and representatives of other
agricultural interests.  There is no set term of office for members.
4.     The General Manager is nominated by the Board.   He is assisted
by five deputies, heading sections on coordination, finance and commerce,
credit, development and administration, which are staffed with special-
ists. IThere are over 600 branches and agencies throughout Colombia,
400 of which provide farm supplies as well as credit services. Stalff
is about 8,400 of which 2,000 are at headquarters. Only about 150
are classified as professionals. 800 are farm credit officials.
Finance
5.     CAJAMs paid-in share capital is Ps 510 million of which over
80p is held by the Government, and 13% by the Coffee Growers Federation.
It has special rediscount facilities with the Central Bank enabling
it to obtain up to Ps 1.7 billion at specially favorable rates.
Summarized balance sheets and income and expenditure accounts are at
Tables 1 and 2. Its accounts are audited by the Superintendence of
Banks.
1/ Including the Livestock Development Project, for which a Bank
Loan('448-Co) of US$16.7 million was granted on I'Iay 16,1966.
A second livestock project is currently being appraised by the Bank.

COLOH-BIA
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
AGRICULTURAL CREDIT
Banking sources
1.     The main banking sources of agricultural credit are:
(a) CAJA: Over 90% of its loans are for agriculture, around
one-half being for livestock. Its main activity is short
and medium-term credit to small and medium-sized farmers,
involving each year about 300,000 farmers, almost one-
eighth of the total in Colombia. It also makes some loans
for machinery to contractors. Value of loans disbursed
was about Ps 1,500 million in 1968. Short-term (seasonal)
lending accounts for over 60$ of its annual farm credit
programs. Pledium-term lending is mainly for tractors
and farm machinery. It does not operate in INCORA areas.
It has over 600 depots throughout the country and supplies
farmers direct from its own stocks with a wide variety of
seasonal farm inputs and some farm machinery.  Of its share
capital of Ps 519 million, over 80% is held by the Government
and about 13% by the Coffee Growers Federation. Its technical
staff numbers about 900, of which 800 are farm credit
officials. It also adminsters the Bank Livestock Development
Project (448-co) through a separate Livestock Development
Department. It is more fully described in Annex 2.
(b) Livestock Bank: A quasi-public institution, which is
playing an increasing part in the financing of livestock
development,  Its share capital is Ps 160 million.   220
is held by the Government and CAJA, and the balance by
private investors. It is responsible for a Ps 200
million livestock development project started this year
with Inter-American Development Bank and Dutch Government
funds. Number of loans, mainly medium and long-term for
livestock development, increased from about 2,000 in 1963
to 4,000 in 1967. Loans outstanding at the end of 1967
were about 15,000, worth approximately Ps 550 million.
Its technical staff numbers about 50.
(c) Agrocredito: Nain shareholders are some 23 commercial
banks. It was formed some three years ago, and acts as
a creditworthiness bureau for its member banks, using
the technical services of private agencies to appraise
farm plans. It arranges on behalf of its individual
member banks for short-term loans (through the banks
themselves) on farms above 10 ha. It investigated about
1,800 loans last year, valued at about Ps 200 million.






ANNEX 3
Page 2
(d) Commercial banks: The banks which are Agrocredito
shareholders appraise an increasing number of their
loans through that organization, but still make the
majority direct to farmers. The seven commercial banks
which are not Agrocredito shareholders make their loans
direct. Commercial banks are also indirectly inv&lved
in financing credit to farmers, since they are obliged
by law to invest 15% of their free deposits in the
agricultural sector.
(e) Agrarian Finance Fund (FFA): Established in 1966 to
supply short-term credit for agricultural purposes.
It is administered by the Central Bank, and offers
rediscount facilities to CAJA and ccmmercial banks
for up to 65% of credit programs approved by the Bank.
A ceiling of credit per hectare for major crops
is fixed for financing current expenditure, incliuding
rents, technical assistance, fertilizers, pesticides,
seeds and other operating costs. The FFA rediscounts
about 5,000 loans per season at an interest rate of
7%. The average amount rediscounted is around Ps 60,000
per loan, involved resources of about Ps 300 million.
Non-banking sources
2.     The main non-banking sources of agricultural credit include:
(a) the coffee, rice and cotton federations, which provide
some annual inputs on credit to their members;
(b) cattle funds in various regions, which include local
governments and private produceis as shareholders;
(c) INCORA, whose credit division handles a supervised
credit program for smallholders (Annex 1, para 6);
and
(d) private moneylenders, who provide an un1a.own amount
of credit (para 2.15).
Credit terms and conditions
3.     In general, for short-term (up to one year) seasonal loans
covering operating costs, any kind of security is acceptable, but for
medium (one to five years) and long-term (five years and over) loans
for machinery, land or farm improvements a property mortgage is
required. Limits on size of loans vary, but are rarely more than Ps
350,000 for the purchase of machinery and equipment, and Ps 100,000
for other purposes. For most short-term loans a chattel mortgage






ANNI,X 3
Page 3
on the crops to be produced is accepted, but the advance rarely
exceeds 40% of their value   For medium-term loans for machinery and
equipment, an advance of up to 75% of the cost is usually given.
Medium and long term loans usually have a grace period of from one to
three years, depending on their purposes. The general terms and
conditions of loans from commercial banks are more flexible than from
other institutions, but repayment rarely exceeds five years. In
the past commercial bank loans have been virtually confined to the
larger farmers, but the operations of Agrocredito are beginning to
make it available to smaller farmers. Credit through all institutions
is usually coupled witn technical assistance. CAJA and the Livestock
Bank use their own staff to make appraisals while the other institutions
rely on 'the private agencies. For credits financed from specific
resources under separate projects (e.g. the INCORA Supervised Credit
Program) these general terms may be varied. Disbursement of loans
other than from CAJA is usually in cash to the farmer. Loans from
CAJA are in kind for seasonal farm inputs, machinery and equipment,
CAJA paying the suppliers direct.

COLOMBIA                     ANNEX 6
AGRICULTJUIAL CREDIT PROJECT
CESAR RIVER STUDY
1.     There are at present 200,000 ha under cultivation (mostly
un-irrigated) in the basin of the Cesar and Ariguani river valleys
in the Caribbean Pla:in (Map 2).  Over 705 of the farmers own 100 ha
or more, producing mainly cotton, rice and livestock, It is estimated
that about 500,000 ha, divided approximately equally between the two
valleys, are suitable for development through irrigation. The Ariguani
valley is being studied for INCORA by consultants who are financed
by the Canadian Government.
2.     This study for INCORA would be concerned with development of
irrigated agriculture in the Cesar river valley. It would take two
years to complete, and cover:
(a) delineation of areas for successive project phases
covering about 250,000 ha, and preparation of a
tentative master plan to coordinate development of
the entire area;
(b) preparation of a first phase project of about 60,000 ha,
on sufficient detail to serve as a basis for appraisal;
(c) establishment of a pilot project of about 3,000 ha;
(d) establishment of a demonstration and experimental farm of
about 100 ha.
3.     The feasibility study for the first phase of 60,000 ha would
include:
(a) supply, demand and marketing surveys;
(b) soil surveys, and the preparation of soil maps;
(c) drainage and irrigation surveys; and
(d) plans for water supply, extension services, social
development, farms, farm credit and other infrastructure
requirements.
4.     The terms and conditions of the proposal, staff members assigned
and the consultants contract would be subject to Bank acceptance.
Estimated cost of the study is Ps 43 million (US$2.6 million
equivalent) of which the foreign currency c4mponent would be about Ps
15 million (almost US$1 million equivalent).   A breakdown of these
costs is given in Annex 5, Table 4.
