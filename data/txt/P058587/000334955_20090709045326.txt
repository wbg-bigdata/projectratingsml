                  I.   RATIONALEFOR BANKINVOLVEMENT




   A.    Major Impedimentsto the Reformsof Inter-GovernmentFiscal Relations

1.      Weak Fiscal and StructuralAdjustmentReforms at the Sub-NationalLevel
TheRussian Federationhas undergonesignificantreformsin its system of inter-
governmentalfiscal relations sincethe beginningof the transition.The Budget Code,
approvedby the Duma in 1998,andPart I of the Tax Code', whichwent into effectin
January1999 are examplesof major Governmenteffortsto reformfiscal management
andbudgeting at the sub-nationallevel,as well as the existing systemof revenue andtax
assignments.Whilethe pace and depthof reformshad acceleratedin the first half of
1998,the Augustcrisis broughtthese governmenteffortsto anabrupt halt. However,in
1999,the Government's attempts to reforminter-governmentalfiscal relationshave
receiveda new, strong impetus. An Inter-MinisterialWorkingGroup (IMWG)for Inter-
GovernmentalFiscal Reformhas been formedand meets regularly,a GovernmentFiscal
Concept Paperhas been approved andhas been adheredto, and a working dialoguewith
the regionson keyissues of inter-governmentalreformhas been resumed. Yet,Russia's
fiscal and structuraladjustmentreformsat the sub-nationallevel have been alarmingly
slow. In many instancesthe progressof federalfiscal reformshas been reversed by the
increasedallocationof subsidiesto the housing sector andenterprisesfrom the regional
and municipalbudgets.From small surplusesin the early 1990s,mostregionalbudgets
have slipped into deficits.Sub-nationalgovernmentinterest paymentsdue in 1998
amountedto about 0.74 percent of GDP, and muchof thiswas never paid. The August
17, 1998ruble devaluationand the subsequenteconomiccrisistriggereda chain of
defaults by the regionson locallytraded debt. As aresult, a clearimbalancehas
developedbetween fiscal adjustmenteffortsat the federaland sub-nationallevels, posing
a seriousthreat to Russia's macroeconomicstabilityand impairingnational economic
growth.At present,the Government's effortsto accelerate fiscal and structuralreforms at
the sub-nationallevelare being hamperedby three issues:

* Deficient Legal Framework*The current inter-governmentallegal frameworkdoes
    not provide incentivesthroughoutthe multi-tieredfiscal systemfor effectivetax
    collection,efficient allocationof public resources,and financiallyresponsible
    borrowing. Lack of clarity in expenditureassignmentsandthe extensiveuse of
    unfinded expendituremandatesfromupper-level governmentspromoteinefficient
    expenditurepatterns and fiscallyirresponsiblebehavior. In addition,the overall legal
    frameworkgoverningthe systemof inter-governmentalfiscal relationsis riddledwith
    inconsistenciesand contradictions.

                                             1

* Poor Compliance.Althoughoverthe past six yearsmany laws have been passed on
    budgetingand financial management,revenue sharing,transfers,and assignment of
    functionalresponsibilities,there has been considerablevariationin the degree of
    compliancewiththese laws by the regions.Enforcementof these laws remains weak.
    In somecases,the laws have been little more than proclamations,with essentiallyno
    implementation.

* Weak InstitutionalCapacity The Governmentfaces severe capacity constraintsin
   the designand implementationof inter-governmentalfiscal reforms,as well as in
   monitoringthe complianceof the regionswith federalregulations.The institutional
    capacityof the regionsto implementfiscal andbudgetary reformsis of evenmore
    concern, as the federalreform agenda growsevermore complex.


               B. GORAgenda for Inter-GovernmentalFiscal Reform

2.    The GORrecognizesthat these issues mustbe addressedas part of its medium-term
economicagenda. The GOR's medium-termeconomicstrategy includes actionsto
eliminateunfundedmandatesfromthe federalto sub-nationalgovernments,revise the
formulafor allocatingfederalequalizationtransfersto the regions, and develop a
programto rationalizeexpenditureandtax assignmentswith the objectives of
establishinga more stable and transparentsystemof inter-governmentalfinance and
providingapotential revenue base at each level of governmentcommensuratewith its
respectiveresponsibilities.

3.    In orderto implementits reform agendain the area of inter-governmentalfiscal
relations,the GOR requestedBank financingto supportthe following Government
efforts:

  Promotelegal reform of inter-governmentalfiscal relations,includingfiscal
   managementand budgeting,debt management,revenue andtax assignments,
   assignmentof expenditures,and inter-governmentalfiscal transfers;

* Builda powerfulfiscal incentivemechanismto improveregional compliancewith
   federalrules andregulations.Aspart of this effort,the Project will support further
   Bankeffortsto promote fiscal and structuralreforms inthe regions;

* Improveregionalinstitutionalcapacityto design,implementand monitor fiscal
   reforms. The Governmentbelievesthe Bankcan provide valuabletechnical supportto
   the Fiscal MonitoringDivisionof the Ministryof Finance (FMD), whichwould focus
   on monitoringregional compliancewith Federal legislationand provide analytical
   supportand policy adviceon inter-governmentalfiscal issuesto the Inter-Ministerial
   WorkingGroupfor FiscalReform. In addition,the Governmentrequested the Bank's
   assistance in designingand implementingcomplexbudgetary and structuralreforms
   at the regional levelrequired by the Governmentreform program.

4.    The proposedRegionalFiscal TechnicalAssistanceProject is fully consistentwith
the objectivesof the Russia CountryAssistanceStrategy(CAS)due to be presentedto the
Board in conjunctionwith this operation,and withoperational standardsforproject
quality inthat it:

* respondsto the Government's request for assistance infacilitating fiscal adjustmentat
    the sub-nationallevel;

* contributesto the structuralreformprogram by identifyingthe prioritiesof public
    sector spendingand expenditureprogramsfor alternativeprovisionby the private
    sector;

* promotesmore equitableand efficientpublic spendingthrough improvementsin the
    legalframeworkof inter-governmentalfiscal relations;

* buildsinstitutionalcapacity for fiscal and economicmanagementat the federal and
    sub-nationallevels, whichis a key structuralreform priority.

6.     The Bankbrings experiencewith sub-nationalfiscal management,reformof inter-
governmentalfiscal relations,andreform of housing and communalservices in other
transitionaland middle-incomecountries. Theproposed approach underthe project
would draw on Bankexperienceaccumulatedfrompreviousoperations (both adjustment
andinvestmentprojects),includingthose developedfor other economiesin transition.
Oneimportantlesson from other Bankprojects inRussia (e.g.,EHDP,Urban Transport,
Housing,and St. PetersburgCenter City RehabilitationProject)is that reform
developmentsat the sub-nationallevel needto be closelymonitored.Strengtheningthe
governmentmonitoringcapacity in thisrespect, is criticalto successfulproject
implementation.

7.     Technicalassistanceloans (TALs)are traditionallyamongthe weakestperformers
in the Bank's portfolio. Whilethe causesof poorly performingBank TALs are a source
of continuingdebate, OED's findingssuggestthat governanceproblems andweak
managementhave been two main reasonsfor their poor past performance.The Bank's
experiencewith TALs in Russia underscoresthe importanceof these lessons. In this
regard,workable governancestructuresand strongmanagementhave been the key
considerationsin selecting aproject implementationagency. The Foundationfor
EnterpriseRestructuringhas been selected as the PIU for the RFTAP. The FER has
developeda strong projectadministrationcapacity,proven by an exemplarydisbursement
record andhigh qualityof outputs.Its experience,however,highlights the need to settle
the project governancearrangementsandinitiateprocurementas early as possible in
orderto avoid delays in mobilizationof technicalassistance,which, inthe case of the
RFTAP,couldjeopardize the governmentprogramof inter-governmentalreform.

8.     Fiscal adjustmentand sectoralperformanceindicators,in particularthose relatedto
the regional structuralreform of the keysectors such as housing andtransport, will be
developedbasedon the experienceof variousinvestmentprojects such as the EHDP.
Reformprogramsrecently developedby the IBRD underPublic ResourceManagement
Loans inKazakhstan, Kyrgystan,and otherFSU states will be also taken into account.
Project preparationwill benefitfrom smallerpieces of TA to regional governmentsin
Russia,being fundedunder ongoingBankprojects (Communityand Social Infrastructure,
SPILand LegalReform).

                                    A. Project Objectives

9.    The Regional Fiscal Technical Assistance Project (RFTAP)pursues the following
objectives:

    improve the legal framework for sub-national public finance and inter-governmental
    fiscal relations:
    establish a mechanism for improving compliance with federal laws and regulations in
    the area of fiscal management and promote fiscally responsible behavior at the sub-
    national level through appropriate economic incentives;
    strengthen the Government's capacity to monitor sub-national fiscal performance and
    reform efforts;
    strengthen the institutional capacity of sub-national governments to carry out fiscal
    and structural reforms.

10.   Key policy and institutional reforms arc the focus of the Project. The Project
would: (i) promote the establishment of a stable, fair and predictable system of inter-
governmental fiscal relations which would provide sub-national governments with
appropriate incentives to undertake fiscal reforms; (ii) promote the use of modern
accounting and budgeting practices which will give a fair and representative view of the
financial position of sub-national governments; (iii) support the development of
individual regional reform programs to reduce deficit spending and improve the
efficiency of budget expenditures at the sub-national level; and (iv) improve the overall
financial stability and creditworthiness of participating sub-national governments.

                                    B. Project Description

I I.  The Project will finance four components: (i) Strengthening Federal and Regional
Fiscal Legislation; (ii) Strengthening Federal Monitoring Capacity: Fiscal Monitoring
Division and the PIU for the RFTAP; (iii) Assistance to Sub-National Governments in
Accounting and Budgeting; and (iv) Sectoral Public Expenditure Reviews.

12.   Strengthening FederaI and Regional Fiscal Legislation (US$2.4 million).
Development and implementation of the Government's fiscal reform will require
substantial efforts in improving the current legal framework for inter-governmental
relations. Financing would be provided for local consultants and, as necessary,
international experts to assist in the completion of relevant tasks. The legal and policy
research efforts will be focused on high-priority themes such as inventory of the current
assignment of revenue and expenditures responsibilitiesbetween the federal, regional and

local governments;designof formula-basedequalizationtransfersfor the regions;federal
regulationsfor monitoringsub-nationalfiscal performance;andanalysis of the
consistencyand compatibilityof existing legislationon sub-nationalpublic financeand
inter-governmentalfiscal relations.It is envisagedthat the work underthe component
will be closely coordinatedwith the LegalReform Project.In addition,the component
will providefor additionalflexibilityto respondto requestsfrom seniorofficialson
developmentsinthe legalenvironmentinthe formof quick-responselegal/policynotes.

13. StrengtheningFederalMonitoringCapacity:Fiscal MonitoringDivision and
the PIU for the RFTAP (US$14.8million).The componentwould financethe provision
of technicalassistancerelatingto the strengtheningof institutionalcapacityfor the
design,implementationand monitoringof the fiscal and structuralreforms and
performanceat the sub-nationallevel,throughthe financingof goodsand services.These
expenditureswould include: (i) computerand informationtechnologyneeded for the
statisticalanalysisof regionaldata; (ii)the creation of a library and on-line databaseson
regionalfiscal practicesand the current legislation;(iii) developmentand dissemination
of Principles(Code)of Good Practicefor regionalfinancialmanagementas an extra legal
standard; (iv)designof financial disclosurerequirementsfor sub-nationaland municipal
borrowers; (v) ongoingmonitoringof fiscal and structuralreforms andperformanceat the
sub-nationallevel,as well as compliancewith federallaws and regulations;(vi)
analyticalsupport andpolicy adviceon key issuesof inter-governmentalfiscal reform
and sub-nationalpublic finance;(vii) training,study tours for FMD staff andfor
governmentstaff(includingregionalpolicy-makers)participating inthe project activities
to developmodem analytical skillsrequiredfor the implementationof fiscal reforms;
(viii) office furnishing,administrativeand computersupportto the staffof the FMD and
consultantsworking on other projectcomponents.

14. The componentincludes a budget for conferencesand seminarson inter-
governmentalissuesto promote exchangesof experts anddisseminategood fiscal
managementpractices inthe Russian regions.

15. The Project's incrementaloperatingcosts wouldbe financed100% fromthe
proceedsof the Bankloan. The MOF and regionalgovernmentswouldprovide in-kind
contributionstowardthe FMD's costs (e.g., rent,utilities, seniorproject management,
andregional supportteams). Upon expirationof the Bankloan, the core activitiesof the
FMD will be fully fundedfromthe Government's budget.

16. Assistanceto Sub-NationalGovernmentsin Accounting andBudgeting
(US$10.1million).Budgeting andfiscal managementat the sub-nationallevelin the
Russian Federation,with somepossibleregionalexceptions,has failedto keeppace with
reformsat the federallevel.The budget formulationprocess has notevolved fromthe
previousregime's practices. There is no modem treasuryfunction for budget execution,
ex-postaudit is spotty,and there is no evaluationof budgetpolicies. Anotherissue of
significantimportance is the lack of transparencyin the regionalaccountingrecords
whichimpairs the capacity of lendersandthe federalgovernmentto make timely and
adequateassessmentsof regionalcreditworthiness.The Governmenthas initiated several
major effortsto improve the qualityof financialreporting andbudget managementin the



                                             6

regions.However,these effortshave not yet spelled outin sufficientdetail the changes
needed in financialmanagement,accountingandreporting at the regionallevel.

17. Tothis end, the componentwill financethe provisionof technical assistanceto the
ParticipatingRegions,in support of regionalinstitutionaldevelopmentprograms,
consistingof: (i) diagnosticreviews anddevelopmentof reformplans in the area of
budgetingand fiscal management;(ii) financial planning,treasury andcash management;
(iii) budgetary accounting,reporting andaudit; (iv)expenditureandpublic sector
restructuring;(v) debt managementsystems;(vi)regionalbudget procurementsystem;
(vii) regionalfiscal managementguidelines,bestpractice standards,andregionaland
localpublic financemanual; (viii) computerequipmentanddesign of softwareprograms;
and (ix)trainingof local staffneeded for a successfulinstallationandsubsequent
applicationof integratedfinancial managementsystems inthe selectedregions.

18. SectoralPublic ExpenditureReviews (US$2.4million). Fiscal adjustmentat the
sub-nationallevelis linkedto the successof regionalstructuralreforms. Currentpatterns
of regionalbudget expenditures-including unsustainablesubsidization-indicate that
structuralreformsin the regionshave been slower than anticipated.The componentwill
assistparticipatingregionswith the designof expenditurereform plansby financinga
number of public expenditurereviews.Thesewill primarilyfocus on the sectorswhich
have been the largest recipientsof subsidiesfromconsolidatedregionalbudgets such as
housing and utilities, agriculture,public transportation,educationand health.The reviews
are expectedto result inprioritizationof budgetexpendituresinto key functional sectors,
identificationof expenditureprogramsandprojects withlowerpriority, introductionof
appropriatepricing policiesto provide for costrecovery, as well as identificationof
sectoralexpenditureprogramsfor alternativeprovisionby the privatesector. The
componentis expectedto generate substantialsavings for regionalbudgetsin the form of
reducedsubsidies to the sectoralprogramswithlow rates of return or/and of low public
priority.

                            C. Summaryof ProjectAnalysis

19. Economic. Althoughthe Project does not lend itself to standardcost-benefit
analysis,it should improvethe efficiency of public expendituremanagementthrough
increasedtransparencyin financial reporting,increasedefficiencyin resource allocation
and improvedtargetingof subsidies andbenefits at the sub-nationallevel.

20.    Financial.It has been discussed andagreed with the Governmentthat technical
assistanceto the regions beprovided out of the loan on a grantbasis. No on-lendingto
the regionsis envisaged.

21. Fiscal impact The Project is expectedto have a significantfiscal impactby
promotingefficiency in public expenditurethrough increasedtransparencyin budget
planning andreporting. The Project would also enableregionsto reduce budget deficits,
reduce subsidies for housing and municipalservices, andimprove targetingof social
assistancebenefits.




                                              7

22.   Technical.It is expectedthat thetechnical assistanceprogramwill require the
servicesof bothinternational andlocal consultantsin orderto ensureaccess to
internationalbestpractice, while at the same timeensuringtimely access andproper
interpretationof existing financial data. It is assumedthat relativelylimited investment
will be requiredto develop or adapt softwareneededto implementnew accountingand
budgetingprocesses.

23.   Institutional.Executing agencies:The Project will be implementedby the
Foundationfor EnterpriseRestructuring,whichwill be in charge of procurementand
disbursementactivities.The FER staffare alreadyexperiencedwith Bank procedures.
The conceptual guidanceunderthe Project is to be providedby the FMD, which shall
assist the GOR in designing,implementingand monitoringthe inter-governmentalfiscal
reforms.The Inter-MinisterialWorkingGroup for FiscalReform will guidethe reforms
and overseethe FMD's activities.The qualitymonitoringfunction will be carried outby
the Expert Council.

24.   Social. Someexpenditurereformsand,in particular,movementto costrecovery in
the area of housing and communalservicesmay adverselyimpact low-incomegroups.
Considerationwillbe givento improvementof targetingof assistanceto the poorest
groups.Theproject will incorporatethe lessonsof economicand sectorwork already
undertakenin this area, includingthe experienceof the SPIL.

25.   Environmentalassessment-For the purposes of environmentalassessment,the
Project falls into Category C.

                                    D. ProjectBenefits

26.    The principalproject benefitwill bethe improvedlegal frameworkof sub-national
public financeand inter-governmentalfiscal relationsand structuraladjustment at the
sub-nationallevel.These would resultfrom intensiveproject effortsto enhancethe
existinglegalframework of inter-governmentalrelationsandimprove institutional
capacity of the federalgovernmentand the regionsin fiscal and economicmanagement.
As a result of the Project, the Governmentis expectedto retainenhancedcapacity in
governmentinstitutionsfor analytic economicwork and monitoringinthe area of inter-
governmentalfiscal relations.A principalbenefitof the Project in the longterm will be
sounder fiscal and economicpolicies of the regions.

                                     E. ProjectRisks

27. There is a risk that the current consensusin favor of inter-governmentalfiscal
reformmight be lost andthat the program mightthen stall. Thisrisk is partiallymitigated
by includingrepresentativesof the Dumaandthe FederationCouncil inthe IMWG.The
reasonthat progresstoward a more stable andtransparentinter-governmentalfiscal
systemis importantfor the success of this projectis that without consistent andpositive
incentivesin supportof regionalfiscal reform,technicalassistance mightnot lead to a
changein behavior. The federaldimensionsof the project,in particular, are designedto
mitigatethis risk.



                                                8

28.   Thepossibleweakening of politicalwill to implementfiscal managementreforms
at the regionallevelposes another risk for the Project. This couldhappen as aresult of
the improvedtransparencyof regionalbudgetsandaccountingproceduresimposinghard
budgetaryconstraintson the regionaladministrations,thus making it difficultto resort to
off-budgetaryfunds or to accrueoff-budgetaryliabilities. Sucha situationcouldtrigger
politicaloppositiontothe Project at the sub-nationallevel.Maintainingpositive regional
perceptionsof the benefits of inter-governmentalfiscal reform canmitigatethis risk by
rewardingthose who undertakeagreedreforms.

                                    A. ProjectCosts

29.   The totalproject costis estimatedat US$36.2million, includingcontingencies
amountingto US$2.0million,taxes of US$4.7million, and anup-front fee of US$0.3
million.The Bank would financeUS$30.0millionor approximately83% of totalproject
costs. The estimatedproject cost summariesare shownin Tables 3.1 and 3.2. All project
costs are based on August 1999prices.FMD and FER incrementalstaff costs were
estimatedbasedupon currentrates for local staffoperatinginthe Foundationfor
EnterpriseRestructuring(FER) inMoscow,adjusted for current labor market conditions
in Russia.

30. Project costs includetechnical assistance(consultingservices),training, operating
expensesof the Fiscal MonitoringDivisionandthe PIU (Foundationfor Enterprise
Restructuring),costof goods,contingencies,andthe commitmentfee (1% of the loan
amount):

   TechnicalAssistance(TA) (US$21.5million). TA costs were derived fromterms of
    referenceandrecent fees quotedfor comparablespecializedservicesin Bank-
    financedprojects in Russia. Both foreignandlocal consultantswill be responsible for
    anytax liabilityincurred inthe courseof the Project. Most of the research and
    analysisconductedby the FMDwill becarriedout withthe assistanceof local
    consultantscontractedon both short-and long-termbases. The estimatedcost for
    localconsultants is US$3,000per person-month.ForeignTA will beneeded to guide
   FMD staffand local consultantsin internationally-recognizedanalyticaltechniquesin
   selectedpolicy areas. The estimatedcost for foreignconsultants is US$20,000per
   person-month.

* OperatingCosts (US$6.8million). The Bankwould financea part of the US$5.4
   million FiscalMonitoringDivision operatingcosts. Bank financingof the FMD
   would amount to US$3.9million. TheBank would also financeoperatingcosts of the
   Foundationfor EnterpriseRestructuringinthe amount of US$1.4 million.

* Goods (US$1.9million).Unit costs werebased on similar goodsrecently purchased
   in Russia from localsuppliers.

                                   C. Procurement

32.    All Bank-financedgoods and consultantserviceswould be procured in accordance
withthe Bank's Guidelines:ProcurementUnder IBRD Loans andIDA Credits (January
1995,revised Januaryand August 1996,September1997, andJanuary 1999) and
Guidelines:Selectionand Employmentof Consultantsby World BankBorrowers
(January1997,revised September 1997andJanuary 1999),respectively.National
Shopping(NSH) procurementwould require that originalprice quotations andreceipts
fromsuppliersbekept on file for review/auditpurposesduring supervisionmissions. The
FER's AdministrativeDepartnent would beresponsiblefor trackingprocurementactions
andapprovals as well,as periodicallyreportingto the Bank on procurementprogress.

                                          13

Two additionalprocurement staffwill be hiredto work in the PIU, includingone Senior
ProcurementSpecialist,andone AssociateProcurementSpecialist.Also, staff will be
trainedthroughperiodictraining workshopsconductedby the Bank.

* GeneralProcurement-The majorityof procurementactions underthe proposed
    projectwould be for consultantservices.To ensurethat the standard of consultants
    procuredunderthe Projectwere of sufficientlyhighquality,the FER would submit
    for the Bank's priorreview terms of referencefor all consultantcontracts.
    Advertisementswould beplace in DevelopmentBusiness,and expressionsof interest
    fromfirms sought for all ICB and consultantcontracts.UJNDBpublicationswill be
    updated annually.Tablesin Annex 2 list the applicablemethod of procurementfor
    each goods or consultantservicespackage.

   Goods.An estimated US$1.9millionworth of goods would be procured,including
    office supplies,furnitureand equipmentfor the FER andFMD, and computers forthe
    participatingregions.All office supplies,furnitureand equipmentwould be
    purchasedusing the NationalShopping(NSH) procurementmethod, groupedin
    packages not to exceedUS$50,000(US$550,000total). As such, none of the
    packages would require prior Bankapproval.To minimizethe numberof contracts
    andreduce the unit costs, computersfor the regionswould be purchasedin packages
    of aboutUS$700,000each (US$1.5milliontotal). These packageswould be procured
    using the ICB method andrequire prior Bankapproval.

* TechnicalAssistance/ConsultingServices-ApproximatelyUS$21.5million in
    consultantservices contractswould be procuredto providetechnical assistancein the
    formof specialists/advisers,studies,trainingprograms,seminars andworkshops.
    Tlheseitems would be covered underfour primary components(i.e., Strengthening
    Federal Legislation;StrengtheningFederalMonitoringCapacity; Assistanceto Sub-
    National Governmentsin RegionalFiscalReform; and SectoralPublicExpenditure
    Reviews).

* OperatingCosts. These costs, inthe amount of US$6.8million, includeincremental
    operatingcosts of the FER andFMD relatedto Project implementationandwill be
    based on annual budgets approvedby the Bank.The staffwill be employedin
    accordancewithBank ConsultantGuidelinesand should be experienced,capable,and

Accountin US dollarsin a commercialbank inRussia. It is envisagedthat the FER
wouldperform the duties assignedto a PIU,includingthe procurementof consultant
servicesand disbursementof loan funds andcoordinationof projectactivities.The
SpecialAccountwould financeoperationof the Foundationfor EnterpriseRestructuring
andthe FMD. In the initial phase of the Project, the balance for the SpecialAccount
wouldbe limited toUS$500,000.However,when the aggregate amountdisbursed under
the loan reachedUS$3.0million, the initial allocationwould be increasedup tothe
authorizedallocationof US$1.0million by submittingthe relevantApplication for
Withdrawal.Replenishmentapplicationswould be submittedat least everythree months,
andwould includereconciledbank statements,as well as otherappropriate supporting

35. Disbursementsbased on Statementsof Expenditure(SOEs)would be used for: (i)
consultingfirmsbelow US$100,000equivalent (includingstudiesand training);and (ii)
conferences,workshopsand seminars.Documentationsupportingthe SOEs would be
retainedby the FER and FMD andmade availablefor reviewby the Bank supervision
missions andauditors.

36. Accounts andAudits- The FER will maintain a singleset of project accounts,
includingthe accountof the FMD andthe SpecialAccount.An audit of the accountswill
be performedannuallyin accordancewith standardsacceptableto the Bank.Allprojects
implementedby the FER shallbe auditedas a singleentity:the RFTAPwill be included
amongthese projects. Oncethe annualaudit has been performed, it will be submittedto
the Bankby the FER within six monthsof the end of the Government's fiscal year. For
furtherdetails, seethe FinancialCapacityAssessmentReport (Annex 6).

                  E. ProjectImplementation:ManagementStructure

37.   OverallProjectManagement Structure The Governmentof the Russian
Federationhas createdthe Inter-MinisterialWorkingGroup (IMWG)to representits
interestsfor the purposes of this project.It is the intentionof the IMWGto buildcapacity
inthe Ministryof Finance (MOF)both to monitorregional fiscalperformanceand to
designandguide the implementationof policiesand regulationsinthis sphere.The
IMWGhas decidedto implementthe Projectthrough a specialunit basedin the MOF,
knownas the Fiscal MonitoringDivision (FMD),which shallprovide substantive
leadershipfor this projectand for the Government's relationswith the WorldBank on
regionalfiscalpolicy andto act as its secretariat.In orderto assist withproject
implementation,the MOF has createda specialdivisionon monitoringof regional
financein itsDepartmentof Inter-BudgetaryRelations.TheHead of this division,who is
alsothe DeputyDepartmentHead in the MOF, will act as the Project Directorand Head
of the FMD. The IMWG has also designatedthe Foundationfor EnterpriseRestructuring
and FinancialInstitutionsDevelopment(FER)to assistproject implementationwith
administrative,procurement,accounting andother proceduralsupport.A discussion of
the key elementsof the project managementstructure follows(see alsoProject
OrganizationalChart).

38.    TheInter-MinisterialWorkingGroup.The IMWG is composedof representatives
of key governmentagenciesinvolved indesigningand implementinginter-governmental
fiscal reformssuch as the Ministryof Finance (MOF),Ministryof RegionalPolicy,
Ministryof Economy,Apparatusof the President,the Working Center for Economic
Reforms,andthe Bureau of EconomicAnalysis, andhas the decision-makingpowers
commensuratewith thetask of carrying outinter-governmentalandregionalfiscal reform
inthe Russian Federation.The IMWGestablishmentis part of the overall Government
conceptof inter-budgetaryrelations reform.The First DeputyChairmanof the
Governmentchairsthe Group. The key functionsof the IMWG are: (i) strategic
managementof the Project; (ii) coordinationof Project activitieswithother Government
effortsinthis area;(iii) approval of draftdecrees and resolutionspreparedunderthe
Project andtheir submission to the Government;(iv) coordinationof effortsbetween
federalandregional authorities;and (v) overallsupervisionof the FMD andFER
performanceunder the Project. In order to implementthese functions,the IMWG
approvesthe annual workplans and budgetsfor the Project, approvesthe key Project
documents,approvesthe regions for participationinthe Project, overseesthe core
activitiesof the FMD, approvesthe main TOR and consultantreports, approvesthe
evaluationcommitteesfor the Project, and approvesthe Project Director.

39.    FiscalMonitoringDivision. Themain objectiveof the FMD is implementationand
monitoringof the reform of the inter-governmentalfiscal relationsat the national and
regionallevel. Under the Project,the FMDwould be responsible for the design of the
monitoringsystemto be further supportedby the MOF after the Project's completion.It
will alsobe responsiblefor the supervisionandcoordinationof Project activitieson all
components.The FMD will act as a designatedagent of the IMWG incarrying out
Projectactivities.



                                              17

40.   TheFMD's tasks andProject-relatedactivitieswould be directly linkedto the
MOF's fiscalreform agenda, whichwould be ensuredby the MOF's representationin the
IMWGand contributionof MOF staffto the FMD. MOF would instruct regionalfinance
departmentsandthe regionaladministrationsto providethe FMD with fiscal data
necessaryfor itsanalyticalwork. The FMD would prepareannual budget estimates for
project-relatedactivities(tasks)and submitthem to the IMWGfor approval.

41.   The Headof the FMD (Project Director)is the head of the monitoringdivision of
the MOF and has been appointedby the IMWG. The FMD staffconsists of the staffof
the monitoringdivisionof the MOF,to be supplementedby consultants hiredthroughthe
Project. TheMOF will initiallycontribute5 staff membersto the FMD,with this number
to increaseoverthe life of the projectto 10in the year 2004. Afterproject completionthe
MOF is expectedto be able to performthe monitoringfunctions of the FMD using only
the staff of its monitoringdivisionandthe staffhiredby the regions.

42.   The staffof the FMD will reportto the FMD Head on all substantive issues of
projectimplementation.Hiringof all consultantsfor the FMD will be subjectto World
Bankprocurementrulesfor the selectionof individuals.At leastthree (3) candidateswill
be reviewedfor each position.Oncethe appropriatecandidate is identified,the FER will
issue a contractto the selectedindividual.All contractswould be signedfor no longer
than one(1) year andcould be renewedupon the request of the FMD Head,subject to
satisfactoryperformanceof the consultant.

43.   TheFMD staffingplan is as follows (see alsoFMD OrganizationalChart):

TheFMD Headis a public servantreportingto the IMWG.He has been appointedand
released fromhis regular duties by the Ministerof Finance, as approvedby the IMWG.
He is alsothe Head of the MonitoringDivisionof the MOF andtherefore will have direct
authorityoverthe MOF staff inthe FMD. The FMD Headwill be in charge of all
conceptual andanalyticalwork within the Project, as well as building andmaintaining
governmentfiscal monitoringcapacityin the MOF and in the regions.In particular,the
FMD Headwill performthe followingtasks:

   provideconceptual guidanceandsuperviseall projectrelated tasks;
* designand managethe capacitywithin the FMD to performthe statisticalanalysisof
    regionaldata;
* create computerlinkageswiththe Ministryof Finance andthe regions, establisha

EnterpriseRestructuringand FinancialInstitutionsDevelopment(FER) would be
responsiblefor compliancewith all World Bankprocedures, includingthe procurement,
financialmanagement,accounting,reportingand audits.The FER would provide similar
support to the MOF in implementationof contractsunder all project components.The
FER would report to the IMWG, whichwould assumethe functions of the FER Project
Managementcommittee(such committeesare envisagedby the FER Charter for all its
projects).

49.   The Director General, supportedby two DeputyDirector Generals,leads the FER's
managementteam. The FER's functionalorganizationis dividedinto two types of
budgetary groups: generalservicesandproject groups.General servicesconsistof the
followingdepartments: management,secretariat,contract, financeand accounting.
General servicesareresponsible for procurement,disbursement,and financial
managementand contractmanagement.Costs of the generalservicesdepartmentsare
allocatedto operatingcosts categoriesof all projects in proportion,reviewed andagreed
by the PMC andapprovedby the Board. It is envisagedthat approximately15%of the
generalservicesdepartmentcosts would be allocatedto the RFTAPproject annually(this

                                  TERMS OF REFERENCE


     About the Project:

     The Project seeksto contributeto the reform of Russian sub-nationalgovernmentfinance
across abroad front,both geographically(six regions)and functionally(all aspectsof sub-
national fiscal management).It is bothamnbitiousand complex,and involves a significant
number of separatebut interdependentcomponentsof technicalassistance,whichmust work
effectivelytogetherif the Project is to achieveits goals efficientlyand on time.

      The Project consists of four major componentsof external TA, each of whichwill be
procuredas a whole, but consistsof a numberof sub-components.The major componentsare;

      1. StrengtheningFederal Legislationon IntergovernmentalFiscal Relationsand Sub-
          nationalPublic Finance
     2. StrengtheningFederal MonitoringCapacityandDevelopmentof Standardsfor
          RegionalFinanceManagement
     3. Assistanceto Sub-NationalGovernmentsin Accountingand Budgeting
     4. SectoralPublicExpenditureReviews.

      It is essentialthat work on each of these componentstakes full accountof (andwhere
relevant alsocontributesto) workthat is beingdone on the other components.The Project covers
groundthat also is being or has been examinedby other Russian- or donor-financedwork
("AssociatedProjects").It is importantthat due accountis taken of this work, andthat it is
incorporatedwhereappropriateas inputs intothis Project.

      ProjectManagement:Fiscal MonitoringDivision ("FMD")andFoundationfor
      EnterpriseRestructuring:

      Project implementationwill formallybehandled by the Foundationfor Enterprise
Restructuring(FER), but day-to-daymanagementwill be providedby the Fiscal Monitoring
Division(FMD) of the Ministryof Finance,which is intendedto becomethe focal point for
managementstandardsin Russian regionalfinance,andthe centralrepository for all information
aboutregional finances.

      FMD will also have an advisoryrole inrecommendinglegaland extra-legalstandardsfor
all aspectsof regional governmentfinance inRussia, includingadviceto the Inter-Ministerial
WorkingGroup (IMWG)on improvingall aspectsof budgeting, accounting, andthe preparation
of financialreportsfor electors/tax-payers,centralgovernment,management,suppliersand
creditors;and the setting of standardsfor financialmanagementgenerallyin regional
govermment.FMD will advisethe IMWGon the desiredcontentand structure of legislation and
regulation,(iricluding"extra-legal" instrumentssuchas a code of Good Practicewith compliance
encouragedby incentives,as opposed to legalrequirementswherenon-complianceis penalized
by legal sanctions).


                                                 34

      Morespecifically, FM:Dwill perform the followingfunctions:

      * developingand specifying the regulatorystandardsfor monitoringregionalfinance;
      * establishingthe tools for monitoringregionalfinance;
      * specificationof monitoringneedsfor each of the identified future functions
      * monitor compliancewithfederalrequirements,for purposes of authorizingfederal
          Budget Transfers;
      * developingresearch-and databank.

      The FMD is thereforeresponsible (underIMWG andMinFin authority)for the direction
and integrationof the variousparts of the Projectwithin the Terms of Reference,andfor using
its discretionto ensurethat TA resourcesare used as efficientlyas possibleto coverthe areas of
greatestincrementalneed, includingorganisationof routine exchangeof informationbetween the
contributorsto the TA, and by running a "steeringcommittee"for the Project.Providers of TA
will be expectedto contributeto this forum,andto receivedirection from it, within theirterms of
reference.

      Concept Paper:


      A paper entitled "Conceptsof IntergovernmentalFiscal Reform in the Russian Federation,
1999- 2001",prepared by the Governmentof the Russian Federationin 1998,definesthe
objectives,particularlyin respect of intergovernmentalissues. The FMD will beavailableto help
provide updatesand interpretprioritiesin the implementationof this paper.

      Inventory, Associated Projects:

      An Inventory of AssociatedProjects,covering other TA work on topics similartothose
underthe Project, willbe provided to prospectivebiddersfor TA work hereunder. (A draft is
attachedas Schedulexxxx) No assuranceis giventhat this Inventoryis yet complete, andno
guaranteeis given as to the qualityof the outputfromthe activitieslisted in this Inventory.

      The AssociatedProjects are thosewherethe subjectmatter overlapsparticularly closely
withthe goals of this Project, wherethe quality of the work is regardedas good, and whichin
manycases formedknown antecedentsof the Project. Ofparticular importancewill be a seriesof
diagnosticstudiesandreform plansto be undertakenwithIBRD loan fundingin parallel with
thisProject, in the six subjectsparticipatingin thisProject - but AssociatedProjects are in no
senselimited to these studies.Attentionshouldthereforebe given to the output of all Associated
Projects,and activeworking dialoguebe establishedwhereverpossible.
      Whereverpossible,output materialfromthe AssociatedProjectswill be made availablevia
the FMD to thoseworking on TA componentsof this Project - this materialwill eventuallyform
onecore componentof alibrary to be developedby FMD inthe courseof this Project.

      Conversely, it is expectedthat all other suitablesource materialcreated or locatedby those
working on the componentsof this Project, that is not yet in the Inventory,will be passed on for
inclusionin the Inventory andin the library, andto that extentbe in the public domain.

      Timetabledemands:

      Many of the tasks describedin the TOR will be more efficientlyandmore effectively
executedif propercommunicationis establishedwithrelevant other componentsin this Project,
or fromAssociatedProjects.A strengthenedandmore consistentlegal environmentrequires
establishmentof what the lawis intendedto achieve,and whatcontradictionsexist in current
legislation.Regionalreformplans will be more satisfactoryifthey correctlyunderstandthe
directionof forthcominglegal andregulatorychange - while legal andregulatorychangewill be
more successfulifit respondsto actual circumstancesin the regions.If time andcost wereno
object,then each task could be discrete,with its precedentneedsdependentonly on its own
research. In reality, outputsfromthe Projectare required urgently, andmuch of the precedent
need is alreadylargelyor partially satisfied by AssociatedProjects.Otherprecedent needsof
somecomponentsare a directtopic for other components.

      Thoseinvitedto contributeTA underthis Project will be requiredto informthemselvesas
closelyas possibleaboutthe output of the AssociatedProjectsand otherrelevant componentsof
this Project, to evaluateit andwhereverpossibleto incorporateit in earlyprovisional
recommendations,that will allow dependentactivitiesto move ahead. In due course,providersof
TA will be expectedto verify or correctthe implied assumptionsabout the validity of this
precedentwork, and wherenecessaryto issue amendedrecommendations.

      Many of the componentsof this Projectthereforecall for Provisional Outputs,basedon
workassimilatedfrom elsewhere (AssociatedProjects,or other componentsof thisProject), to
allowdependentworkto get started on atimely basis;and laterDefinitive Outputs, involvingthe
verification(or amendment)of the provisional conclusions,andthe generationof the definitive
outputs.

      The FMD, in its projectmanagementcapacity, will assist in the flow of this inter-taskand
AssociatedProject information.

      1. Background

      The RussianFederationhas undergonesignificantreformsin its systemof
intergovernmentalfiscal relationsoverthe past six years. TheBudget Code, approvedby the
Duma,andPart I of the Tax Codethat became effectivein January 1999,address many aspects
of two of the four pillars of any systemof intergovernmentalfiscalrelations: fiscal management
andbudgeting, andrevenue andtax assignments,respectively.The two otherpillars of a system
of intergovernmentalfiscal relations,expenditureassignmentsandthe systemof transferswill
need to beaddressedin separatelegislation.

      Lack of clarityin expenditureassignmentsbetween the federal,regional,and local
governmentscontinuesto be a vexing problemin the systemof intergovernmentalfiscal
relationsin the Russian Federation.The issue of expenditureassignmentsis addressedinthe
Budget Codebut without sufficientdetail andclarity. Lack of clarity in expenditureassignments
andthe extensiveuse of unfundedexpendituremandatesfromupper-levelgovernmentsthreaten
to result in inefficientexpenditurepatterns and fiscallyirresponsiblebehavior.

      The Governmentintroduceda formula-drivensystemof equalizationtransfers in 1994,the
FederalFund for Assistanceto the Regions (FFSR).This systemwas changedevery year since
itsintroductionand it was practicallyabandonedin the formulationof the 1998budget. All
parties involved,the Government,the regionsand the Dumawere dissatisfiedwith the
performanceof the FFSR. The Governmentwill be using a new buttemporary formula for the
1999budget.The Governmenthas announcedits intentionof overhaulingthe systemof transfers
for future yearsstarting withthe budget for 2000.

      Much of the reform process overthe pastsix yearshas focusedon the fiscal relations
betweenthe federaland regionalgovermments.Less attentionhas been givento intra-oblast
intergovernmentalfiscal relation issues.The generalbudgetaryprinciple has been that the
regionalgovernmentshad the freedomto organizetheir system of intra-regionalfiscal relations
in anyway they saw fit. Althoughsomeregionshave movedto reformtheir budgetary
relationshipswith local governmentsin amore stable and transparentfashion,the majorityof the
regionalgovernmentsare still using a budgetaryapproachbased on negotiationand bargaining,
the benchmarkthat characterizedthe budget systempriorto 1992. In 1997,the Law on the
FinancialFoundationsof LocalSelf-Governmentsmandatedto the regionsthe introductionof
reforms suchas minimum sharingrates fortax revenueswith localgovernments andthe use of
formula-basedtransfers.But these provisionscontainonly generalprinciplesand concrete
applicationsstill await development.Most regionalgovernmentsappearto have delayedthe
introductionof formula-basedtransfersbecause of a lack of understandingon howto proceed.

      Over the past several yearsthe budgetaryprocess and fiscal managementat the federal
levelhavebeen subject to significantchangesand improvementsin the Russian Federation.A
modem budget classificationsystembased on the IMF's GovernmentFinance Statisticshas been


                                                37

introduced,a Treasuryfunction for budget executionis near completion, andex-post audit is
performed by the Chamberof Accounts.

      However,budgeting andfiscal managementat the sub-nationallevelin the Russian
Federation,with somepossibleregionalexceptions,has failedto keep pace withthe reformsat
the federallevel.The budget formulationprocess basicallyhas not evolvedfromthe previous
regime'spractices,there is no modem treasuryfunction for budget execution,ex-postaudit is
spottyandthere is no evaluationof budgetpolicies.Whilethe newly approvedBudget Code
attempts to address someof these deficienciesat the sub-nationallevel, it does not address in
sufficientdetail the necessaryreforms infinancialmanagement,accountingandreporting at the
regional andlocal level.There appears tobe aconsensusthat a sub-nationalgovernmentbudget
codewill be necessaryto deal appropriatelywith all outstandingissues.

      In most subjects,intra-regionalbudgetaryrelationsare still characterizedby expenditure
assignmentsbetween the regionalandlocal governmentsthat lack clarityand stability.In
addition,the problem of unfundedexpendituremandatesfromthe regional authoritiesto local
governmentscontinuesto be a sourceof frictionandinefficiencyin the use of scarce budgetary
funds.Finally, in most subjectsrevenue assignmentsstill lacktransparencyandpredictability,
thus detractingfromthe abilityof local governmentsto plan ahead and destroyingany incentives
localgovernmentsmayhave to mobilizetheir own revenues.Fundamentalreformof intra-
subject intergovernmentalfiscalrelations facesthe handicapof lack of incentivefor regional
governmentsto reform. Regionalgovernmentstend to feel quite comfortable withthe current
negotiatedsystembecause it providesthem withdiscretionand flexibility.

      An issue of significantimportance is the exerciseof fiscal responsibilityby sub-national
governmentsin the area of borrowing.Whilethe new Budget Codewill restrictand impose
limits on the ability to issue bonds anduse other formsof borrowingby sub-national
governments,andthese shouldbe furtherdevelopedin a sub-nationalbudget code,there is at
present no adequatereporting systemand mechanismfor enforcementof sub-nationalborrowing
limits by the federal authorities.Sometime inthe futurethis controlmay be exercisedby the
capital marketsthemselvesbut at the presenttime direct control by the federal authoritiesis
necessary.Lack of enforcementof borrowing limitsis likelyto be destabilizingat the national
level,compromisingmacroeconomicstability.

      It shouldbe clearly understoodthat ex-antecontrolsby the Ministry of Finance or any
otherfederalauthorityof borrowingby sub-nationalgovernmentswill be unnecessarily
restrictive andbureaucratic.The limitson sub-nationalborrowingin the Budget Code areof a
regulatoryex-postnature, and they do not grantany powersto the Ministryof Finance to
approveex-anteborrowing by sub-nationalgovernments.What still needsto be addressedis how
the federalauthoritieswill ensureex-postthat sub-nationalgovernmentsdo respect the
borrowinglimits introducedinthe Budget Code andwhatmeans or powers need to be grantedto
the federalauthorities.The developmentof adequatedisclosurerules for the fiscal health of sub-
nationalgovermmentsshould contributeto the foundationsfor the creation, in the future, of a
self-policingsystemfor sub-nationalborrowingwithinthe capital marketsthemselves.This will
be the most effectiveand efficientway to imposefiscal disciplineamong sub-national
governments.The sub-nationalbudget code will needto address loan default andbankruptcy
proceedingsfor sub-nationalgovernments.

      There is onelast aspect of the overalllegalframeworkgoverningthe systemof
intergovernmentalfiscal relationswhichrequires attention.Over the past six yearsmany laws
have been passed on budgeting and financialmanagement,revenue sharing,transfers,and
assignmentof functionalresponsibilities.In addition,there has been considerablevariationin the
degreeof enforcementof these laws. In somecases,the laws have not beenmuch more than
proclamationswithpractically no implementation.Asa consequence,inconsistenciesand
contradictionsamong severalof these laws are quite common.The most recentexample is
providedby the contradictionsbetweenthe BudgetCode andthe Law on the Financial
Foundationsof Local Self-Governmentconcerningthe budgetaryrelationshipsbetweenregional
andlocal governments.A systematicstudy of all current legislationon intergovernmental
relationspointing out inconsistenciesand contradictionsis neededto get rid of this significant
sourceof confusioninthe system.

   STRENGTHENINGOFFEDERALMONITORINGCAPACITYANDDEVELOPMENTOF
                  STANDARDS      FORREGIONALFINANCIALMANAGEMENT

      1. Background

      Among the weakest aspectsof the systemof intergovernmentalfiscal relationsin the
Russian Federationis the lack of mechanisms for monitoringby the federalauthoritiesof fiscal
performanceby regional andlocal governments.At thepresent time, regionalgovernmentsare
underthe obligationto reportthe executionof the consolidatedregional budgets(regional
governmentbudget plus the combinedbudgetsof all localgovernmentsin the region).However,
this reporting is insufficientto providethe necessary informationon compliancewith federal
policies (suchas costrecovery on public utilities), actualbudgetarypractices (suchas the
existenceand importanceof extra-budgetaryfunds), or the level or extent of fiscal equalization
across local governments.

      Thelimited and aggregatednature of financialreporting by regionaland localgovernments
doesnot allow, at the presenttime, establishmentof a clearpicture of their fiscal health.Even
thoughregionalgovernmentsreport consolidatedbudgetdata to the Ministryof Finance,these
data reveallittle informationon the actual deficitpositionof sub-nationalgovernmentson a
commitmentor accrual basis.For most cases,the budgetdata providesinsufficientinformation
to evaluatethe size,change and age of existingbudgetaryarrears. The budget data available
provideno informationeitheron the revenuecosts to regionaland localbudgets of tax
preferencesgranted to enterprises,nor actual lending or loan guaranteesby regionalandlocal
governmentsto enterprises.Nor has there been little consistent infornation on the level of
borrowing,debt servicerequirements,and compositionof debtfor regionaland local
governments.Thetransparency,and ultimatelythe validity, of sub-nationalbudgetsis also
compromisedby the lack of disclosure andinformationon extra-budgetaryaccounts andthe use
of non-cashpaymentmethods.

      The lack of quantitativeinformationinregionaland local reportedbudget accounts is
complicatedby the lack of informationanduniformityon budgetaryprocedures andaccounting
systems.There is little informationon the constraintsthat are placed onthe use of extra-
budgetaryaccountsby agencies(andeven by departmentsor divisionswithin administrations),
andwhatthe existingreporting requirementsandsafety checksare. There appearsalso to be a
wide arrayof practices acrossregionaland local governmentsinbudget planning arrangements,
includingrevenue forecasting,current expendituresand capital investments.Very few regional
andlocal governmentsappearto have in placean appropriatetreasury functionwith cash and
debt managementand reporting of budget guarantees.A widevariety of approachesare used by
regionalgovernmentsto fund localgovermnents.Non-transparentarrangemnentsincludingnon-
repayableloans andmutual settlementsappear tobe quite common.In general,there is little
informationaboutthe degreeof complianceby sub-nationalgovernmentswithfederal norms
pertainingtothe budgetprocess and fiscal managementandless informationon actual
budgetarypracticesby sub-nationalgovernmentsinthose areas wherethe law givesthem
discretion.

2. Objectives

     Thisprojectcomponenthasthefollowingmainobjectives:

     > To executeor commissionresearch into fact andpractice in localgovernmentfinances
         in Russia. Much of the factual productof this research will be inthe public domain,
         servingas a "library"of informationon Russianregionalfinance.However, some
         analyticalconclusionsmaybe closelyheld within government.

     > To advisethe Government,IMWG andthe Ministryof Finance on improving all
         aspects of the legal andregulatoryframeworkfor regionalgovermmentfinancesin
         Russia. This will includeall aspectsof budgeting,accountingand the preparationof
         financial reportsfor electors/taxpayers,centralgovernment,management,suppliersand
         creditors;intergovernmentalfiscal relationsbothFederation/Subject,and Subject/City-
         Rayon includinginter aliatax and expenditureassignmentsand inter- and intra-
         governmentalfiscal transfers; andthe setting of standardsfor financialmanagement
         generallyin regional governments.FMD will both advisethe IMWG on the desired
         contentandstructure of legislation/regulation,andassist in coordinatingthe drafting
         andpromulgationin atimely andconsistentmanner.

     > Toprovide ongoingmonitoringandsupervisionof all aspectsof Russian regional
         financewithinthe revised regulatoryframeworkon the basis of the data collected
         throughits research.FMD willmake regularrecommendationsto the Government,
         IMWG andthe Ministryof Finance on a widevariety of questionsrelated tothe fiscal
         reformin the regions.

   3. Outputs andindicators

A. StandardMonitoringSystem


The StandardMonitoring Systemwill respond tothe Federal Government'sneedto maintain an
up-to-dateunderstanding of the fiscal and financialcondition,andthe state of compliancewith
federallegislationand regulations,of each of the 89 Subjectsof the Russian Federation.

      Standard monitoringis envisaged as a computer based system, operating primarily on the
basis of objective,numerate,non-judgmentalinputsfed througha structure that so far as possible
builds upon or adapts existing data sources,rather than creating entirelynew structures.

     The main tasks within this sub-componentwillbe to:

         Specifythe indicatorsthat shouldbe trackedto achieve the purposesof Standard
         Monitoring;these are likelyto includecompliancewith all the main provisionsof
         Russian sub-nationalpublic financelaw andregulation, includingparticularlythe
         setting and executionof budgets withinlegal constraints,the level of debt, the level and
         dynamicof deficits,andthe manner (cashor offsets)of budget execution.



                                               43

        Identify sourcesand flows of data that can be used for this purpose;and specifythe
         deficienciesin form, content,accuracyor verificationstatusof this data, andwhat
         needsto be doneto make it availablein acceptableform.

        To specifyand designthe mechanismsfor collectingand presenting thisdata routinely,
         in as near as practicable to real-time,includingthe computerand communication
         systemsrequired.

      * To specifythe personnel and systemsresourcesrequired to install this mechanism,and
          to assist the FMD in itsimplementation,includingsystems design,recruitmentand
          training.

     Associatedprojects and preliminarywork suggestthat substantialdata resourcesandflows
already exist,but that they are badly co-ordinated,and not used systematicallyto addressissues
relevant tothe needs of Standardmonitoring;moreover,current legaland regulatorystructures
have meantthat the informationis oftennot in formand contentas useful as would be desirable.

      The developmentof monitoringneeds will thereforerequire substantialdialoguewith the
developmentof accountingand reportingneedsand withthe development of legal and regulatory
structures.This dialogueforms part of the provisionaloutput of each of the activities
participatingin it.

     Provisional Outputs:specificationof the form andcontentof input data required (to enable
the reformplans of participatingregionsto incorporatethese regionsas "pilots"for the
monitoringprocess), and discussionwith the relevantfunctionalexperts of any changesto the
accountinganddisclosure requirementsdesirableto improvethe disclosureand accuracyof key
variables.

     Definitive Outputs:specification,implementationanddeliveryto FMD, of a working
systemto achievethe goals of StandardMonitoring.

     PrincipalIndicators ofsuccess at the provisionalstage will be the recognitionof
monitoringneeds into the main functionalreviews(particularlyaccounting,debt, andtreasury);
the inclusion of monitoringinfo-sourcerequirementsin the specifications for regulatorychange;
and the inclusionof StandardMonitoringdata provisionin the reforrnplans for the participating
regionsas "pilots".

     B. Extendedand SpecialMonitoring System&Ratings

     ExtendedMonitoringis intendedto provide the mechanismby which the Federal
Governmentcan develop a closerunderstandingof financialand economic circumstances,and
the degree of reform attainment,in regionswhich areparticipatingin the currentProject, or
whichare seeking conditionalcredits or otherdiscretionarybenefits fromthe federal
government.Such regions will alsobe requiredto participate in StandardMonitoring- the
Extendedrequirementsare incremental,not substitutes.




                                                 44

     Tothe extentthat suchdiscretionarybenefitsare availableas aninducement for desired
reforms,when penalty sanctionsmay notbe availablefor constitutionalreasons, Extended
Monitoringwill providethe main tool for determiningwhere such discretionshouldbe granted,
and hence bea substantiveinstrumentof policy. Extendedmonitoringmay also servea
secondarypurpose,in helping withthe analysisof the effects of other grantsandpolicy actions
undertakene.g. in responseto the intergovernmentalfiscal analysis.

     This sub-componentaddressesboth the specificationof the ExtendedMonitoring
standards,andthe design andconstructionof mechanismsfor tracking attainrmentsagainstthose
standards.As with StandardMonitoring,thiswill include:

      * Specifyingthe indicatorsto be monitored.

      * Specifyingthe data and informationsourcesrequiredto monitor them, andidentifying
         any enhancementsrequiredto render current sourcesof such data effectivefor this
         purpose.

      * Specifyingand designingthe mechanismsfor collectingand analysingthis data,
          includingthe computerand communicationsystems required,and the extentof local
          representation.

      * Specifyingthe personneland systems resourcesrequired to implementthe
          recommendations,and assistingFMD inthe introductionof an effective Extended
          monitoringcapacitywithin the Project'stimetable.

      The ExtendedMonitoringstandardsthemselvesare likely to be closelyrelated to the
standardsspecifiedin the Code of Good Practice,but may alsocontain a numberof other
quantitative(creditworthiness)or qualitative(governance)indicatorsdesignedto provide a close
understandingof compliance,and of commitmentand attainmentinthe implementationof
reforms.The standardsinvolved will be graduatedand progressivetoprovide a measure
attainment,andprovide abasis for incentives,across a wide rangeof levels of attainment.

      Tlheevaluationbased on these criteria is then likelyto be used as a basis for an internal
"rating"of sub-nationalgovernments,as well for specificdiscretionarycreditdecisions.

      Substantialcomponents of the ExtendedMonitoringrequirementsare likelyto be available
fromthe provisional outputof sub-component3, fromAssociatedprojectmaterial, andfrom the
IBRD'sloan conditionalities.Equally,theprovisional conclusionsfromthis sub-componentas to
whatwill be suitablecomponentsof Good Practicewill be requiredas provisional inputto the
regionalreformplans andthe development of the extra-legalframeworkin Component 1. Given
its extra-legalcharacter,it is desirablethat the Good PracticeCode is the subjectof extensive
consultationandexplanationwith the regionsto which itwill apply, andthat so far as possibleits
contents are acceptedby and agreedwith them. This workwill interlockclosely withthe FMD's
overallco-ordinatingrole inthe Project.




                                                 45

     Provisional outputswill thereforeconsistof contributionto the specificationof the
standardsof GoodPractice, and the data flows, analyticalresources, andall other faculties
necessary for the continuingappraisalof reform implementationin the six initial participating
regions,andthe definition of the resourcesrequiredto deliverthis appraisalon a continuing
basis, for an increasingnumber of regions.

     Definitive OutputsImplementationof the appraisalstructure, andits successfuloperationto
producea means tomonitor progress of the participatingregions.Installationof the graduated
ratingprocess, and its applicationto awideningcadre of regions.Publicationof the Codeof
GoodPractice, andits developmentafter debate intoan accepted standardfor reformoriented
regionsto aspireto.

     Theprincipal indicatorsofsuccess in this sub-componentwill be the extentto whichthe
provisionaland definitiveoutputson the designatedtopics are availablein timeto allowother
projectcomponentsto move forwardon schedule.The extentto whichthe Codeof Good
Practiceis really accepted by the participatingregions- and by other investors,thereby
deepeningthe incentivefor its adoptionby otherregions- will be important,as willbe the
extentto whichit providesa continuumof incentiveacross a range of attainments,rather than a
single-standardhurdle.

C. Fiscal StatisticalDatabase


     The FMD, in its co-ordinatingrole for regional financegenerally,will operatea central
informationresource non behalf of regions andall otherinterested parties. Much of this
informationwill be in the public domain;but some aspectsof it may be designatedas restricted
to certaincategoriesof user, or for internaluse only.
Thetopics to be covered by this informationresourceshould be availablein paper or electronic
form,and shouldbe accessiblethrough a websiteto be createdfor thepurpose.
Thetopics will include:

     * RegionalBudget statistics,developedfromthe StandardMonitoringdata flow.

      Additionalbudget and economicstatistics,developedfrom otherdata sources,to provide
        greatertransparencyfor comparisonbetween regions,and as abasis for external
        investmentdecisions andgovernmentpolicy research.

     * Definitive statementsof Good Practicestandardsandthe proposed public finance
        detailed applicationmanualand backgroundmaterialon their introductionin practice
        (where,how, what tools).

     * AnInventory of donor fundedand otherwork in Russia (includingtraining materials),
        that can serveboth as atheoreticalbasis andas apractical "toolkit" for the
        implementationof public financereformsin the directionsrequired.

     The contents of this librarywill almostall be theproduct of other sub-componentsof this
Project,and hence dependenton that otherwork; the task of this sub-componentwill be the
assemblyandpresentationof this material. Conversely,the product of this resourcewill be an

                                                46

importantingredientfor the widertake-up of the reformspromoted by this Project.It is
particularlyimportantthat it is presentedandpublicisedin such a way as to be seenby regionsas
a resourceusefulto them, rather than an impositionon them.

      The tasks of this sub-componentwill be the detailed identificationof content;the
identificationof sources;the specificationof the necessarycommunicationand computer
facilitiesto collect,store andpresent the data;the specificationof premises,personnel andother
logisticalresourcesrequired;andthe implementationof these objectiveswithinthe life of the
Project.

      The Provisionaloutputsof this sub-componentwill includeparticipationinthe
specificationof the data content andformat requiredfor monitoring,and in the identificationand
disseminationof suitableAssociatedProject materialto allow othercomponentsto make rapid
progresstowards their respectivetasks.

      The Definitiveoutputswill be the installationand operationof a mechanismfor the
collectionstorageand deliveryof the specifieddata categories.

      The Indicatorsof success will includeboththe mechanicalaccomplishmentof the required
outputs,to a timescalethat facilitatesthe completionof other projectcomponents on time, and
also the acceptanceof the resourceby regions, investors,other parts of government,and third
parties, as a definitiveresource anda helpful contributiontowardstheir own goals.

 ASSISTANCETO SUBNATIONALGOVERNMENTSIN ACCOUNTINGAND BUDGETING


     1. Background

     CurrentRussian budgetrules and accountingconventions are clearlyat odds withthe
western"BestPractice" standards:rigid use of a cash(rather than accrual) convention;lack of
balancesheetsor reliable asset/liabilityledgers; inconsistentconsolidationof sub-districtsand of
extra-budgetaryfunds; lack of properdistinctionbetween operatingandcapital/financingitems
are amonga few examplesof major shortcomings.Thishas clouded managementand public
understandingof manyreal issues resultingin anon-transparentsetting of budgetsandfinancial
reportsby regional governments.

      Amongmany problems are alreadyidentified:

      > Theuse of a "cash" conventionwhichrecognizestransactionsonlywhen settledin
         cash.This has led to a systematicbuild-upof unsettledaccounts payable(not
         recognizedas an expenseuntil paid - hence a budget outcomemay be "balanced"
         simplyby not settlingthe bills; and an apparentlybalancedbudget seton the basis of
         not expectingto settlethe bills);

      > Unclear andinconsistentconsolidationrules whichhave confusedthe estimationboth
         of flowsof revenuesand expenses,andof aggregateliabilitiesof budget entities;

      > Lack of reliable asset and liabilityrecordsand of a balance sheet,which have prevented
         the normal verificationof flow entriesthroughdouble-entrycross checks;

      > Absenceof accrualconventionswhichhas left someconfusionoverthe true costfor
         exampleof zero couponor foreigncurrency debt, or the consumption of Capitalassets;
         and hence an inabilityto know the true cost of servicesdelivered.

      Budget formationand implementationhas thereforebeen taking place against abackground
of fallingrevenue,rising social need, anduncertainty.Majorresponses have includedcutbacksto
near zero ininfrastructureinvestment; a generaldeclinein the level and standardsof many
services(apparentlyoften with limitedcapacity to measurethe effectivenessor efficiency of
servicesthat areprovided), in deliberatedelaysin settlementof many purchase invoicesfor
goods and services;and in an increasingtendencyto borrow.

      In parallel with this component,a seriesof regionaldiagnosticreviewsand reformplans is
being undertakenin the six participatingregions(also fundedby IBRD loan finance).Ongoing
closedialogueis essentialbetween the consultantsundertakingthese studies, andthe consultants
working on this component:recommendationson budget andaccountingreform must both
respond to the findingsof the diagnosticreviews (anda number of otherAssociatedProjects
withthe same goalsin other places), andprovide direct guidanceback to the reform plans.

2. Objectives

      Thiscomponenthasthefollowingobjectives:

      A. To establishwhat is the current legalandregulatoryenvironmentcovering regionaland
      localbudget formationand execution,fiscal management,accountingconventions,
      financialreporting requirementsand standardsfor financial information.

      B. Todevelop recommendationsbothon the properobjectivesandthe availablemeans
      (both legaland extra-legal)of obtainingenhancedfinancial managementand accounting
      structures.

      C. Toassist with the installationin participatingregionsof mechanismsto deliver the
      requiredlevel of budget management,public sectorrestructuring,accountingand financial
      reporting.

      The end product is intendedto be a mechanismfor the formation,agreement,
implementation,control, andreporting on budgets,that is bothmore effective inextracting
service fromlimited resources,andmore responsiveto the needs of the relevant stakeholders.

      The relevant stakeholdersfor this purpose mean firstand foremostthe electorsand
taxpayers of the region,acting whereappropriatethroughtheir elected representatives;central
governmentin its role as a counterpartto fiscal transfersand taxation flows,and as an alternative
supplierof servicesin someinstances;and employees,suppliersand creditorswho mayhave a
legitimateright to understandto understandthe working of abudget on whichthey are
dependingfor paymentof their wages, for their goodsand services,or for creditgranted.

Manual

      Thistask is essentiallythe drawingtogetherof the specificfunctional analysisand
recommendationsof the components3 and4 into a coherentset of recommendationsboth for
targets for broadstandards (theCode of GoodPractice),and detailedimplementation(the
draftingof a Manual of Public Finance).Bothtasks will have aniterative element, inensuring
that the proposalsare internallyconsistent betweendifferentprojectsub-components,that they
are consistentwith federalgovernmentobjectives(by closedliaison with FMD), and that they
are realisticallyattainablewithinthe timeframespecified.

      The provisional recommendationsnecessaryto allow this activityto get started are
themselveslikelyto bebased substantiallyon provisionaloutputs fromcomponent3, and on the
AssociatedProjects.As the Project progresses,these provisional outputswill matureinto more
definitiveoutputsbased on the refined inputs.

      Thistask will thereforebe continuouslyinvolved in the assembly anddistributionof
progressivelymaturingprovisionaloutput, andin two way feedbackwiththe FMD, those
involvedin the tasks inthis component3, andother componentsof the Project. The creationof

                                               51

consistencybetween the constituentsof GoodPractice andthe ExtendedMonitoring
requirements;the correspondencebetweenthe separatefunctionalrecommendationsandthe
recommendationsfor legal reform;and the integrationof sectoralreform recommendationsinto
the regionalreform programs,will be specifictasks. The collectionof the constituent
recommendationsfor GoodPractice,and the correspondingdetail inthe PublicFinance manual,
willbe a task of this sub-component.

     For each of these sub-components,provisional outputswill includea substantial
contributionto the iterativeprocess of developingthe enhancedlegaland regulatory
environment,andthe reformplans for the regions.The definitiveoutputswill bethe eventual
specificationof the relevant componentsof GoodPractice(in partnershipwith other
contributors),the preparationof the relevantsectionsof the detailed PublicFinance Manual,and
the provisionof tools andpracticalimplementationtechniquesto assist in the attainmentof the
standardsspecified.

      TheIndicators ofsuccess on each of these sub-componentswill be the extentto whichthe
analysisidentifiesreal issues, andthe consequentrecommendationsrespond withproposals that
successfullyaddress these issues in away that is attainablewithinpracticalresource constraints.
An understandingby the regionsof the reasons for and benefitsof the recommendationswill be
essential.Progresson the regionalreformprogrammes,the creationof the creationof anagreed
Codeof GoodPractice, andthe completionof the legal/regulatoryreformprocess, will all be
indicatorsof whetherthese goals have beenachieved.

                     SECTORALPUBLICEXPENDITURESREVIEWS


      These reviewswill take the form of a seriesof studies,one for each sectorto be examined,
to assist regionaland localgovernments inthe designof rationalisationstrategiesfor the sector
concerned,by costing alternativescenarios,and explainingstrategyoptions for adjustmentsto
the levelsof service capacity-andunit cost.

      Thereviewswill incorporate analysisof the mechanismsfor allocatingboth operatingand
investmentbudget resourcesbetween services,andbetween facilitiesfor each service;for
determiningunit costs bothex ante (planand resourcedecision) andexpost(outcome and
analysisof effectiveness);measuresfor enhancingprocurementeffectiveness,andincreasing
budgetaccountability;benchmarksand comparativeperformanceindices for comparable
facilities,both within oneregion, andbetween regions.

      The reviewsmustbe based on reality, as discoveredin the participatingregionsto be
studied,andnot someremoteideal drawnfrom a differentenvironment.Thereviewsmust be
conductedin tandemwith the diagnosticreviewson regionalfinance, andeach of the 9 sectoral
reviewsshould study at least two of the 6 participatingregionsin detail; each of the 6
participatingregions shouldbe the subjectof at least 3 such reviews.

      Thereviews should incorporatewhereverpossibleas provisional inputsthe output from
AssociatedProjects,andthe work of the regionaldiagnosticstudies as it relatesto financial
management.As the Project progresses,there will be increasingoutput of managementtools
from otherparts of the Project, that can be incorporatedinto the sectoralreforms.

      Each of the reviews should then provide as an output the sectoral reform part of the
regionalreformplan for the respectiveregions.

      These sectoralreformplans will includerecommendationsas to:

      * Alternativesto the "normative"methodof defining required service levels
      * Methods of definingunit cost in the service provision,andof constructingmodelsto
        estimate the sensitivityof unit costto a varietyof scenarioson service volume andcost
        recovery
      * Suggestionson alternativescenariosfor reformof both service specificationand service
        delivery,and the costs andother implicationsof each
      * Estimation of the social andpoverty-reliefconsequencesof each of the scenarios
        proposed, includingthe indirect consequencesthroughrelease or engagement of
        resourcesotherwiserequired for otherservices.
      * Implementationrequirementsfor each, includingspecificationof the required tools, and
        guidanceon where/howto gain accessto the requisiteexpertiseandtechniques.

     These sectoralreviewswill thereforegenerateprovisional output in the formnof their
contributionto the draft regionalreformplans, andto the expendituremanagementcomponentof
the functionalreviews.

     Progressiveimplementationof the regionalreformnplans, andthe developmentof the
functionalreviews,will allow these provisionalrecommendationsto firmup into definitive
outputrecommendationsduringthe life of the Project.

      The indicatorsofsuccess in these sectoralreviewswill bethe extentto whichthey can

whichthe actionplans proveto be feasiblein practice.

     The sectorsto be covered by such reviewsare;

     Housing, utilities:
     Education
     Health
     Social Protection
     Culture& recreation
     Public Transportation

                 FINANCIALMANAGEMENTCAPACITYASSESSMENT

PART I - FOUNDATIONFOR ENTERPRISERESTRUCTURING

1.     SummaryandKey Findings

       FER is a well organizedPIU with a clearlydefinedorganizationalstructureand qualified
staff Over the next twelve to eighteenmonths it isproposed that it will becomeproject
implementationunitfor three-newIBRD loans with minimalincreasesin staffing with its core
financefunctions. This is an ambitiousaim which will only be achievedifprocesses and
informationtechnologyare integratedand automated.In the case of theMigration and Forestry
Projects itfaces significant capacitybuilding issues withinregionalproject implementation
groups. Theseare issues whichare currentlybeing addressedbyFER management,butthe Bank
must also be alert to these accountabilityissues inprojectpreparation.

    The Bank needsto adapt to the challengesposed by multi-projectPIU's byproviding greater
focusparticularly inthe monitoringof operationalbudgetsandfinancial managementsystems
and reporting.

2.      General

    TheFoundationfor EnterpriseRestructuringandFinancialInstitutions Development(FER)
is a non-commercial,non-profit foundationfoundedin July 1996.At the momentthe founders
are Ministryof Finance (MinFin), Ministryof Economy, Ministryof RegionalPolicy,Central
Bankof Russia, Ministryof Transport,LeontiefCenter andFoundation of Housing Reform,
Gosstroy.FER is implementingagency for MinFin on three on-goingBank projects;Financial
InstitutionDevelopment,Enterprise Support,EnterpriseHousing Divestitureandpreparation of
Migration Project out of PDL preparationfund.

     It is proposed that FER will also act as implementationagent for SustainableForestryPilot
project,RegionalFiscal TechnicalAssistanceproject andNorthern Out-MigrationPilot project.

2.1. GovernanceStructure.

     Governanceoverthe FER's activitiesis throughthe Board of Directors; a supervisorybody
consistingof twelve members headedby two Co-Chairpersons(First DeputyMinisterof
Economyand DeputyChairmanof the CentralBankof Russia) with support of Executive
Secretaryof the Board.Board meetingsare conductedannuallyor more frequently as required.
Minutesare kept for all meetings.The main functions of the Board are to approve:

* changesto the Charter
 * major restructuringof activities
 * the annualbudget
 * changesto the organizationalstructureand staffing(salaries)
 * the annualreport of FER including auditedfinancialstatements
 * the structureand compositionof Project ManagementCommittees (PMC's)


                                                  63

    The implementationof individualprojects is governedby-the PMCs which are appointedby
the Board of Directors. Thishas aroundten membersrepresentativeof all key stakeholders.
Committeesmeetregularlywith frequencydependenton projectactivity. The functionsof the
Committeesare to:

* define projectobjectivesand activities
* approveproject activitiesbudgetsandwork plans
* resolveproject implementationissues
* define sources of project finance
* approveprojectparticipating entities,sub-borrowersetc.
* form contractevaluationcommittees
* approveProject Directors

    The Project Director reportsregularlytothe PMCs on project implementation.

2.2. Regulationsand Procedures.

    The activitiesof FER are regulatedby national laws andBank rules andprocedures.The
Operationalmanual of the FER providescleardefinitionsand instructionson the FER
organizationalstructure, functionsof itsmanagementbodies, responsibilitiesof FER
departments,job descriptions of staff, employmentpolicy, budgeting and accountingprocedures.
Project implementationis separatelyaddressingprojectdescription,projectmanagementsystem,
financialprocedures,implementationarrangements,reporting requirementsand procurement
procedures.

2.3.OrganizationalStructureand Staffing.

    FER's managementteam is led by the DirectorGeneral, supportedby two DeputyDirector
Generals.FER's functionalorganizationis dividedinto four budgetarygroups:- general services
andthree project groups. Generalservices consistof the following departments:management,
secretariat,contract, financeandaccounting. FER performsimplementing functionsfor three on-
goingprojects (FIDP, ESP and EHDP).The generalservicesare responsible for procurement,
disbursement,financialmanagementand contractmanagement.Costs of the generalservices
departmentsare allocatedto operatingcosts categoriesof all projects inproportion reviewed and
agreed by the PMC and approvedby the Board.

    Thisrequiresno overall approvalby the Bankalthoughproject operatingbudgets are agreed
in advanceby task team leaders.Project groups activitiesare staffwhich can be budgetedto
projectspecificissues.

    The Contractmanagementdepartmenthandles all issuesof procurement,contractmonitoring
and legalsupport. Staffof the Departmentconsistof the following:Manager of the Procurement
Department/SeniorLegal Counsel,SeniorProcurementOfficer,ProcurementSpecialist/legal
counseland assistant.The managerof the Departmentreportsto DeputyDirector.




                                             64

    TheFinance departmentis headed by Director of Finance supportedby three staff; a
disbursementspecialistandjunior disbursementspecialistanda specialist on sub-loan
management.The Directorof Finance departmentreportsto the DeputyDirector General.
Includedwithinthe responsibilitiesof the FinanceDepartmentare the preparationof project
financialmanagementreports in conformitywithBank requirementsandmonthly reportingto
the Ministry of Finance.

    The Accountingdepartment is headed by ChiefAccountantwho supportedby two permanent
staffaccountantsandone full time consultant.The ChiefAccountantreportsdirectlyto the
DirectorGeneral. The AccountingDepartmenthas responsibilityfor theproduction of entity
financialstatementscompliant withRussian legislationand InternationalAccounting Standards
as well as compliancewith tax legislation.

    Staffingpolicies are addressedin the Operatingmanual.The recruitmentprocess is
transparentand staffturnover is low dueto pleasantworking environmentand good
compensationscheme. Staffcompensationpackagesinclude salaryand medical insurance. Staff
performancereviewsare performed annually.FER's Operating manualincludes the provisions
on compliancewith "Norms of conduct andbusinessethics of the FER" for each employee.

    Trainingopportunitiesexist for all levels of staffand are encouragedby management.
Specialtrainingon accountingand financialmanagementis financedby the FER. (The Chief
accountantstudiesunder ACCAprogram andFinance Director studiesunder MBAprogram).

3. ProjectAccountingSystemsandProcedures

3.1. AccountingSystems andReportingRequirements.

    Currentfinancial reportingis divided ontoFER entityreporting whichis handled by the
accountingdepartment andprojectfinancial reportingwhichis conductedby the Finance
Departrnent.The financialreporting systemneeds tobe capableof producing several different
types of reports,including:

* Annualprojectmanagementreportsin accordancewithBank requirements
* QuarterlyProject ManagementReportsin conformitywith Bankrequirements
* AnnualFER financial statementsprepared inaccordancewith IAS (maybe transformedfrom
    Russianfinancial statementsat the year end)
* AnnualFER financialstatementsprepared in accordancewith Russian Legislation
* Reportsprepared at request of InternationalFinance OrganizationDepartmentof the
    Ministryof Finance andProject Finance Center

       Entityaccountingis performed on Inotech accountingsoftwarepackage usedby
approximatelyfifteenother World Bankprojects in the Russia portfolio. Project financial
reportingis prepared fromwithdrawal applicationsand summarizedon anExcel Spreadsheet.In
1998the Bank requiredFoundation accountspreparedunder InternationalAccountingStandards
(IAS)for the first time.At the time of preparingthis assessmentthese financial statementswere
still outstanding.



                                                65

      Thereis a lack of interfacebetween projectand entity financial statements;a significant
issue that exists acrossthe Bank's entire Russiaportfolio. Asproject financial statementsare not
part of the double entry book-keepingsystemkeyinternal controlssuch a overall cash
reconciliationare not built into the system.Thesecan be addressedby othersub-optimalinternal
controls,externalaudit reviewsand Bank supervisionbutthe mediumterm solutionis to more
fully integratethe two systems.The programfor the integrationof the two systemsis plannedto
be completedby December31, 2000 at the latest.The precise details and extentof the
integrationwill bereviewed as part of the consultancycontractmentionedbelow.

      In accordancewith Bank's requirementsFER has to prepare entity's financialstatements
annuallyinaccordance withIAS and ProjectManagementReports(PMR) quarterly.
Managementof FER recognizethe importanceof linking PMR's totechnical analysis of Project
Managersand this is being given particular attentionin the preparationof the new projects.

      In orderto meet Bank's requirementsthe computerizedaccountingsystemof FER need to
be strengthenedto provide higher levelof automatizationand internalcontrol. FER is currently
addressingthis issue througha consultancycontractwiththe followingterms of reference:

* carryout a diagnosticon the statusof bookkeepinginthe Foundationin accordancewith
    Russian accountingstandardsand IAS
   developa procedure to maintain businessaccountingin FER using available software
    accordingto two standardssimultaneously
 preparationof operational chartsof accountscorrespondingto localand international
    standards

    As well as the abovethe consultantwillprepare recommendationsand delivertraining. The
success of this initiativeis extremelyimportantin the overallsuccess of the overalloperational
strategy of FER whoseaim is to achieve significantefficiencygains in the face of a growth in
activityprojected in the next twelve to eighteenmonths.

    In additionto support of the consultant,the Bank agreedto review the overallformat of
FER's entityfinancial reportsand the projectfinancialmanagementreports.It is particularly
importantto Bank supervisionthat there is a transparentlink between entitybudgeted and actual
operationalcosts and individualproject componentcosts.

3.2. Budget preparationandexecution

      Budgets areprepared for all FER's activitiesincludingannual operatingbudgets.The
Boardof Directors is responsiblefor approvingannual budgetsand ratifies anychanges. The
Projectplanning process in performedunder guidanceof Project ImplementationCommittees. In
accordancewithBank's requirementsactual data on project implementationis comparedwith
the budgetson regular basis. An issue for the Bank is how operational expensebudgets within
the Foundationare calculatedand apportionedto individualprojects. The overall annual
operatingbudget of FER will be submittedto the Bank's CountryUnit for no-objectionone
month prior to submissionto the Board of Directors.The Bank's CountryUnit will alsoreview
compliancethroughex-postmonitoringof the financialreports of the Foundation andprojects.



                                               66

3.3. InternalControl Procedures

      InternalControlProceduresof the FER are documentedin Operationalmanual,and control
proceduresare alsoextensivelydefinedunder Russian legislation.FER managementcompleted
an InternalControlQuestionnaireof the Bank.Procedurescoverthe followingmain areas of the
project implementation:budget preparationand execution,contract preparationand signing
(procurementprocedures),disbursement,assets management,etc. As notedabove additional
proceduresareneeded in orderto ensurethe appropriatecontrol overthe allocationof general
servicesdepartmentcosts to project operatingcost categories.Thesewill be incorporatedinto
the OperatingManualand are subjectto the Bank's priorapproval.

      Themanagementof all projects will bethrough oneruble projectaccount in which
counterpartfundsand ruble denominatedtransactionfromindividualprojects SpecialAccounts
are held. If this approach is to be adopted it must be withinan environmentof sound integrated
chart of accountandinternal control surroundingthe reconciliationof the project account.This
should be explicitlyaddressedin the terms of referenceof the consultantengaged in the
integrationof accountingand financial systems.TheBank assessmentteamhas addressedthese
concernsto the Foundationand if it were not for strengthof the managementandfmanceteam
we wouldreject the approach in favorof separateringfenced project account.Neverthelesswe
support the effortsbeing made in terms of the efficientprojectmanagementandtrust that, if
there optimum systemsolutionscannot be achievedthen they will explore alternative and
possibly more expensiveoptionsrequiring additionalfinance staff.

3.4 AuditArrangements.

      In accordancewith Bank's requirements,audit of the projectwill be performed annuallyin
accordancewith Standardsacceptableto the Bank. Russian auditingcompanyFBK audits each
year all projects implementedby FER andFoundationas an entity. In order to ensurea
consistentapproachto the financialmanagementwithinthe PIU we-recommendthat the
principleof a single auditorfor all projects within FER be continued.

4. Conclusion

      FER proposesto implementthe new projects with minimal growth in centralsupport
functionsof financeand disbursement.Thisis to be achievedin part by the impendingclosureof
existing projects.The plan is ambitiousand is dependenton significantefficiencyand
rationalizationof system softwareand internal controlprocedures.It also carries a significant
risk in projectimplementationas FER tendersfor projects with MinFin with limited roomfor re-
negotiationduringimplementation.

      Two of the new projectshave significantRegionalComponents(Forestry andNorthern-
Out Migration)and part of FER's responsibilitieswill includecapacitybuilding, training and
compliancewith Bankreporting requirements.This is likelyto be a significantand time
consumingtaskto be managedwith existing financeand accountingstaff.

      We have foundthe managementof FER addressingthese key issues and believetheir
strategydeservessupport pendingthe outcomeof the work by the consultants intheir
recommendationsregarding the accounting systemsof the Foundation.

                                                 67

      The other key finding is that the Bankneedsto address the supervisionof key elementsof
the supervisionof multi-project PIU's on a more integratedbasis in relation to the fiduciary
elements of financial management,review and approvalof operational expensesandreviews of
project andentity financialreporting.


PART I. REGIONALFISCAL TECHNICALASSISTANCEPROJECT

1.    GovernanceStructure

      The Federal Governmenthas createdan Inter-ministerialWorkingGroup (IMWG)to
represent their interests in the project.This group is composedof representativesof Ministryof
Finance, Ministryof RegionalPolicy, Ministryof Economy,Apparatusof the President,the
WorkingCenter of Economic Reformsandthe Foundationfor EnterpriseRestructuring.To
supervisethe project activitiesduringprojectimplementationthe Board of Directors of FER will
approvethe IMWG as a Project ManagementCommittee(PMC). Thiscommitteewill represent
both the regionaland federalauthorities (seeparagraph2.1 for overviewof FER's governance
structureand the role of PMC's).

Theproject is divided into fivecomponents:

ComponentA - Strengtheningof Federal andRegionalFiscalLegislation - this componentwill
providetechnicalassistanceto improve the existing frameworkof intergovernmentalfiscal
relations.Counterpartsfor this componentare the Ministryof Finance, State Duma,Federation
Counciland the PresidentialAdministration.
ComponentB - Strengtheningof Federal MonitoringCapacityandthe Developmentof
Standardsfor RegionalFinancialManagement-improvingcomplianceof the regions with
existing federallaws and regulations.

ComponentC - Assistanceto Sub-nationalGovernmentsin Accountingand Budgeting-
strengtheningthe Government's capacity to monitor sub-nationalfiscal performanceand reform
efforts.

ComponentD - SectoralPublic ExpenditureReviews

2.    Regulations andProcedures

      TheProject Operating manualwill coverthe projectdescription,projectmanagement
system,financialprocedures,implementationarrangements,disbursementproceduresand
internalcontrol procedures.This manualwill bepresented for Bank's reviewand approvalin
accordancewiththe ActionPlan.




                                                 68

3.    OrganizationalStructureand Staffing

      An Order of the Ministryof Finance was signedon June 29, 1999establishinga Regional
Fiscal MonitoringUnit (RFMU) withinthe Departmentof Inter-budgetaryRelations,whose role
will be to monitorregional financeandto managethisproject. Initiallythis is budgetedto have
five MOF staffbut this is budgetedto increaseto xx overthe duration of the Project.This will be
headed by AlekseyLavrov.

      To supportthe MOF staff inthe implementationof the projectthe RFMU will use a
number of short term consultantswho will reportdirectly to Mr. Lavrov.The projectdesign
assumes that as consultancystaff will reduceduring the life of the project as Ministryof Finance
staffare trainedand drawn into the division.
      FER would perform the functionsof the ProjectImplementationUnit for the Project.
Duringprojectpreparationand implementation,FER will provideprocurement,disbursement,
accountingandfinancialreporting services.Individualconsultantcontractsare being signedby
FER but withaccountabilityclearlyto managementwithinRFMU. The followingchangeswill
bemade inthe existingorganizationalstructureof FER (also seePart I for the assessmentof the
existing structure).Unlike other projects withinFER no separateproject groupwill be formed
withinFER as all technicalissueswill be dealtwith in FiscalMonitoring Center.

      Withinthe General Servicesdepartment,two additional procurementspecialistswill be
requiredwithin FER. Operatingcosts of FER will befinancedunder this loan. The general
Servicesdepartmentof FER works on a cost-sharingbasis with otherprojects under
implementationby the Foundation.

4.    Budget preparationandexecution

      In accordancewith the generalbudgetingprocedure describedin the Operatingmanual,
FER's annual operatingbudget is approvedby the Boardof Directors.This budgetincludes
FER's operatingbudgetand the budget for individualcontractssigned by FER. A Project
ManagementCommitteeis responsiblefor approvingthe projectbudgets.

      In accordancewith the procedures describedinPart I, the overall annual operatingbudget
of FER will be submittedfor priorapproval of the Bank's Country Unit,priorto Approvalby the
Boardof Directors.

      Quarterlybudgetshave to be prepared for main projects and each disbursement category.
The procedure for establishingquarterlybudgetswill be agreed between FER andthe RFMC and
documentedwithinthe Operatingmanual.Annualbudgetswill be reviewed in the light of
projectimplementation.

5     ProjectAccounting SystemsandProcedures

      Under all componentsconsultants contractswill be signedby FER on behalf of RFMC.
The agreementsreached in orderto strengthenproject accountingsystems are addressedin detail
in PartI. Ministryof Financewill issue instructionsto the RFMCto ensure recordson
counterpartfundsare providedto FER for the preparationof financial statements.


                                                69

      In additionto the abovereporting requirements,FER will submit quarterlyProject
ManagementReports(PMRs)to the Bank.For each quarterlyreport FMC will preparea textual
analysis of the progress of projectimplementation,whichwill be attached to the financial report
submittedto the Bank. Thecompositionand formatof the Project PMRs will be drafted by FER
and the Bankwill provide its commentsas providedfor in the actionplan.

      FER will beresponsible for the preparationof projectfinancial statementsfor annual audit.
Project financial statementsshould includedata on total projectexpendituresand financingfor
the reporting period includingcounterpartfunds. Dataon counterpartfundingwill be collated by
FER and willbe incorporatedinto the projectfinancial managementstatements.The principal
sourcesof counterpartfundingare Ministryof Finance staffwithin the RFMC and RegionalStaff
for ComponentB plus rental of office space in Ministryof Finance and Regionaloffices.
6     DisbursementArrangements

      FER will beresponsiblefor compliancewith the Bank's disbursementprocedures.FER
will initiatepayments fromthe SpecialAccountand,as appropriatedirectly fromthe Loan
Account.

7     Audit Arrangements

      As noted in PartI of the assessment,it is recommendedthat one auditor is procuredfor all
projects implementedby FER. The appointmentof projectauditor will be a condition of
effectiveness.

8     Conclusion

      The overall conclusionis that FER has sufficientcapacity to implementthe proposed
RegionalFiscal TechnicalAssistanceProjecteffectively,although FER needto payparticular
attentionto the accountabilityand internalcontrol procedureswithinthe FMC whichhas no
experiencein project management.The followingactions were agreed withFER in orderto meet
the Bank's financial managementrequirementsprior to project effectiveness.
