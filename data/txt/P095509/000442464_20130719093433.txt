            IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in
                                         independent evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
       To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.

About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is t he extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stat ed objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for eight closed Tanzania
Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), implemented as two programmatic series.
Program-1 included the PRSC 1-3 series implemented from 2003-2006. Program-2
included the PRSCs 4-8 implemented from 2006-2011. World Bank disbursements for
Program-1 amounted to a total of USD 432 million, while those of Program-2 amounted
to a total of USD 1,025 million (including a supplemental credit of USD 170 million to
offset the negative implications of the 2008 global financial crisis on Tanzania). The two
programs were co-financed by Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW, Germany) and
complemented by the General Budget Support partners (African Development Bank,
European Union, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,
Switzerland, Ireland and the U.K. Department for International Development).

The report was prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). It is based on
interviews and documents and data collected in the course of a visit to Tanzania in
March, 2012, during which a number of stakeholders, including government officials,
external development partners, business groups, academics, non-governmental
organizations, as well as other civil society groups were consulted. The evaluation also
draws upon in-depth interviews of staffs of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund, including current and former members of the Tanzania country teams in
Washington and Dar es Salaam; published and internal documents from the two
institutions; and recently published and unpublished studies on Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper-related processes in Tanzania. The cooperation and assistance of all
stakeholders and government officials are gratefully acknowledged as is the support of
the World Bank Country Office in Tanzania.

The two Tanzania PRSC series were among the earliest sustained Bank-financed
operations to support a country-owned reform process conducted in the context of the
Paris Declaration for Aid Effectiveness. Because their implementation spanned a long
period of time, the assessment provides an opportunity to derive lessons on the long-term
implications of sustained support through the PRSC instrument of development policy
lending.

Following standard IEG procedure, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the government
for review. Comments were received and are attached as Annex F.

Summary
Context
This report assesses the outcome of World Bank support for eight Poverty Reduction
Support Credits (PRSCs) in Tanzania- totaling nearly USD 1.5 billion in finance-
implemented from 2003 to 2011 as two program series.

After deterioration in relations between Tanzania and external partners in the early 1990s, a
renewed relationship evolved around the principle of 'mutual accountability.' A
government-initiated economic recovery plan in 1996 demonstrated the government's
commitment to improved fiscal performance and structural reform, and introduced a new
dynamic of donor engagement. The World Bank (hereinafter referred to as the Bank)
financed a 1997-2000 structural adjustment credit and a 2000-2003 programmatic
structural adjustment credit, which conditioned disbursement on the implementation of pre-
identified policy changes. To support greater country ownership and flexibility, the two
PRSC series (2003-2005, 2006-2011) continued the programmatic approach around a
sequence of annual single-tranche operations, but used a framework of indicative triggers
and ex-post prior actions derived from the government's own poverty reduction strategies
rather than formal conditions. The new PRSC series also contributed to a joint multi-donor
dialogue comprising a harmonized approach to general budget support.

Series 1: PRSCs 1-3 (2003-2005, USD 432 million)
The first series lacked a functional results framework. Objectives for the series were not
settled until the second operation, and program documents did not clearly articulate how
progress in adopting the proposed policy measures would help to achieve the program ' s
objectives. This evaluation reconstructs a plausible route by which PRSC-supported
activities could have been expected to contri.bute to achieving the stated objectives.

Progress was modest on the first objective of sustaining and accelerating economic growth
and broadening its impact. Growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was robust during the
period, ranging between 7 and 8 percent per annum (a significant portion of this was driven
by government spending financed through increased aid flows). Income poverty reduction,
however, was significantly less than envisioned. It fell just two percentage points at the
national poverty line between 2001 and 2007, yielding a very low growth elasticity of
poverty by international standards. The PRSC's contribution to these outcomes was limited
to a supporting role in the International Monetary Fund-led program to maintain
macroeconomic stability. The growth rate of industry was strong at 10 percent annually,
but this was likely driven by external factors as the business environment did not improve
by available measures despite PRSC support for several reforms. Growth performance in
agriculture met its five percent target, but implementation of the PRSC-supported reform
program in the sector was slow and weak.

On the second objective of supporting results orientation ofpublic service delivery, the
Bank brought greater policy content and a hi gher level of rigor to the performance
assessment framework and helped to set up a system for monitoring progress in the sectors.
Data were widely available on outcomes in health and education and these sectors showed
the greatest improvements during the period--expanded access to education, reduced
infant mortality, and declining AIDS incidence. But the quality, frequency, and availability
of data on the outcomes of other govenunent services such as water and electricity were
weak, and evidence on outcomes from new service delivery surveys were not linked to the
strategic planning process. The focus of the government and of development partners was
initially on demonstrating that adequate resources were devoted education, health,
I-INI AIDS, agriculture, roads, water and the judiciary. In practice, the share of budget
allocated to these priority sectors was flat as a percentage of GDP during the period,
growing in real terms.

The program directly contributed to improving public sector performance, the third
objective. The procurement process was enhanced, and corruption appears to have
subsided. Public Financial Management exceeded the minimally acceptable level for
general budget support, and important aspects-including cash management and policy-
based budgeting- were strengthened. With regard to the fourth objective--the
strengthening ofenvironmental management through policy dialogue-the series included
neither triggers nor prior actions. The Performance Assessment Framework to which the
PRSC was aligned included environmental issues and the govenunent, with limited
emphasis, took some action on this front. But the PRSC put little if any emphasis on the
topic, without defining the nature of the expected outcome of its support or tracking the
"monitorable actions" identified in the program documents.

Overall, the PRSC program yielded steady progress during its implementation, achieving
important outcomes in macroeconomic management and public sector governance, and
laying the groundwork for improvements in agricultural productivity and the business
environment. The dialogue centered on annual public expenditure reviews authored jointly
by the government and the Bank in which key govenunent officials and Bank staff met
every two weeks. While the intensity of the process had high transaction costs, it was
considered valuable by government officials and Bank staff because it increased ownership
at higher levels of govcnunent as well as in the Bank, and it ensured that all partners were
up to date on the program's progress.

The outcome of the first series (PRSCs 1-3}-an aggregate rating of the relevance of
objectives, relevance of design, and achievement of the objectives- was moderately
satisfactory. Although broadly formulated, relevance of objectives was substantial and
well-aligned with the govenunent Bank strategies, with an appropriate focus on growth,
governance, and income poverty reduction to complement the programs of other
development partners. Relevance of program design was modest because while it
appropriately focused on improving public sector performance, a neglected cross-cutting
issue, it lacked a functional results framework thalt articulated how its activities would lead
to desired outcomes. The objectives of supporting results orientation to public sector
delivery and of enhancing public sector performance were substantially achieved, while
the objectives of sustaining and accelerating economic growth and broadening its impact
and of strengthening environmental management were modestly achieved. Risk to
development outcomes was significant because many of the program achievements were
one-time actions that would need to be repeated, or the development of frameworks- such
a.;; better budget execution and a new system for procurement-that had not yet been fully
implemented. Bank performance was moderately satisfactory because of strong analytical
underpinnings and close supervision and dialogue conducted as part of the process of
preparing annual public expenditure reviews, though the results framework was weak.
Borrower performance was also moderately satisfactory because a strong network of
highly-committed reformers were able to maintain reform momentum particularly on
public sector issues, even as monitoring instruments were weak and ownership was lacking
in some key sectors, notably agriculture.

Series 2: PRSCs 4-8 (2006-2011, USD 1,025 million)
The objectives of the second series were not clearly stated at the outset, but the program put
emphasis on the harmonization and ownership goals of the Paris Declaration, and so it was
organized around the government's National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty
(known by its Swahili acronym as MKUKUTA).

With regard to the first objective, growth and reducing income poverty, GDP growth
remained strong throughout, never dipping below 6 percent per annum even in the face of
the global fmancial crisis. Reliable data are not available regarding the trend in income
poverty. The 2007 household survey showed a very low elasticity of poverty with respect
to GDP growth, a circumstance that has likely persisted. While three-quarters of Tanzania's
poor derive their income from agriculture, agricultural productivity improvements were
marginal. Attribution of the strong growth performance to the PRSC program is difficult,
because implementation of relevant portions of the program were generally limited. The
agriculture sector development strategy was severely delayed. Slow progress on business
environment reforms, even the risk of their reversal, suggests that few new income-
generating opportunities for the poor were created in rural areas. And progress in·
improving reliability, quality, and access to electricity and improving transportation
networks--considered critical steps to accelerating private sector growth- was modest.

There was modest progress in improving quality oflife and social well-being. Earlier gains
in access to education at both the primary and secondary levels were maintained. However,
evidence on quality-as measured by literacy and numeracy of schoolleavers- is mixed
and suggests learning achievements have lagged. Key outcomes in health-including infant
and under-5 mortality, AIDS prevalence, and child nutrition--continued to improve.
Survey data suggest an improvement in access to clean water in rural areas from 45 percent
to 58 percent from 2007-2010 (still short of the 65 percent target), but backsliding in access
to basic sanitation facilities. The program's contribution to these outcomes was tenuous. It
made important contributions to improving the process-helping to set standards for
assessing the sector review process in the first year or two-but thereafter added little value
beyond what was already occurring at the sector level.

Governance and accountability reforms covered wide-ranging topics with modest results.
Little progress was made with respect to budget and public financial management issues
according to available indicators and counterpart feedback. In civil service reform, the
adopted strategy relied on across-the-board pay enhancements, despite evidence suggesting
that payments targeted to areas of need are more likely to enhance performance. Although
more money was disbursed to local goverrunents, little authority was granted for human
resource management. Compliance with national procurement regulations rose from 39 to
70 percent and the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability score rose substantially
on this dim ens~on, but external assessments questioned the integrity of the procurement
selection process at national and local levels. Corruption perception indicators suggest the
government's anti-corruption measures had little traction.

Overall, the PRSC program stalled abruptly around 2006/07 as the stage of the reform
process moved from policy design to implementation. This change in outcomes coincided
with three interrelated dynamics. First, changes in personnel across development partners
resulted in multiple, and hence less coherent, perspectives of the reform agenda. Second,
some development partners deemed the Public Expenditure Review process too Bank-
centric, while new leadership in the Bank and government viewed it as too time intensive.
A joint annual review of general budget support, comprising each development partner
participating on an equal footing irrespective of their financial contribution, became the
primary vehicle for dialogue, diluting trust and communication with government partners
especially around public financial and public sector management issues. Third, the series
covered many more sectors, greatly expanding the potential number of government
counterparts, many of whom had limited interest in, and commitment to, the PRSC agenda.

The outcome of the second series (PRSC 4-8) was moderately unsatisfactory. Objectives
were aligned with the CAS, MKUKUTA, and the programs of other donors, and their
relevance is rated substantial. Program design adhered to Paris Declaration principles but
had shortcomings, including a lack of selectivity and a delay in making the results
framework fully operational until the third operation, and was modestly relevant. All three
objectives were modestly achieved. Risk to development outcome is significant because of
weakening government commitment to both public sector r~fonns and sector-specific
policies (although the Bank reports that the intense process for dialogue around core public
sector issues has been revamped). Bank performance was moderately satisfactory due to
solid grounding in analytical work and adherence to the Paris Declaration-inspired
approach of the day. But the results framework linking support to expected outcomes,
largely shared by the government and development partners, was weak. Borrower
performance was moderately unsatisfactory because of a weakening of government
commitment, and because policies agreed to by central ministries were not pursued with
vigor by relevant line ministries.

Lessons
The implementation ofPRSCs 1-8 spanned nearly a decade during a period of sustained
macroeconomic stability and fast economic growth, offering lessons both for Tanzania and
other countries with similar development challenges.

    •   Direct and sustained focus and clarity of vision over the entire course of
        implementation of PRSC programs that cover many years is required to
        facilitate lasting reforms, particularly with regard to public sector governance.

    •   PRSCs can make little progress without a foundation of trust between the
        Bank and the government, and among development partners at the
        institutional and individual levels.
•   PRSC programs risk becoming irrelevant if the design, scale, and scope are
    not adjusted as conditions change.

•   The lack of well-defined and realisti.c objectives and a fully developed results
    framework makes adjustment to changing circumstances difficult.

•   Regular reporting on key outcome indicators is essential so that data can drive
    adjustments to the PRSC program.

•   Transitioning to the use of PRSCs as the primary instrument for resource
    transfer is only likely to be successful in rare circumstances, when strong
    central ministries can fully pursue a sector-inclusive dialogue representing the
    perspectives of key players throughout government.

•   Elevating to the national dialogue sector-specific structural reforms that
    stalled at the sector level does not guarantee their implementation.

1. Background and Context
1.1     The United Republic of Tanzania (Tanzania) has a per capita income estimated at
USD509 per year (2010, Atlas Method), land area of 886,100 square kilometers, and
projected population of about 43.2 million (2010), growing at about 2.5 percent a year. The
economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 50 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP) and provides 85 percent of exports and 80 percent of employment.
Agricultural products are primarily maize, paddy, coffee, cotton, tea, cashew nuts, sisal fiber,
and tobacco. Industry accounts for some 15 percent of GDP and is mainly limited to
processing agricultural products and light consumer goods. The mining sector has great
potential, yet to be fully and carefully developed. Tourism (wildlife and coastal) also has
tremendous potential and has become one of Tanzania's most dynamic sectors, showing
significant growth in recent years. The service and informal sectors are growing rapidly and
are increasingly important sources of employment.

1.2     Economic and Political Background for PRSCs 1-3 (2003-2005). Economic policies
following independence in 1961 proved damaging as the country‘s rural development
strategy for self-reliant villages resulted in drastic decline in food production. Beginning in
1967, the government adopted the ‗Arusha Declaration‘ as a blueprint for the country‘s
development. It involved the nationalization of most of the economy, as well as the
resettlement of villages into larger communities in the countryside in order to improve their
proximity to services. This policy stance, based on Ujamaa (or African socialism) was
supported by many donor countries as well as multilateral institutions, resulting in
considerable inflows of aid. However, the Ujamaa experiment failed to deliver the promised
rapid social advancement. This was compounded by an inefficient public sector: overstaffed
state agencies in the banking, industrial and farming sectors were allocated a significant share
of budget resources at the expense of the social services. In addition, external shocks
throughout the 1970s led the country into economic crisis by the early 1980s. The war with
Uganda and the second oil shock, both at the end of the 1970s, led to a severe resource
shortage.

1.3     The economic policies pursued under the Arusha Declaration were issues of much
debate in the early 1980s, with policymakers divided between those supporting and opposing
market reforms. In the political sphere, Julius Nyerere, Tanzania‘s leader since
independence, retired as President in 1985 but continued to be the head of the ruling party,
Chama Cha Mapinduzi. Ali Hassan Mwinyi, the second president, initiated an economic
recovery program during 1986–89, which was accompanied by political changes in the late
1980s and early 1990s. During his second term of office, however, President Mwinyi‘s
government demonstrated a much lower commitment to economic reform. As a result,
overall macroeconomic performance deteriorated and jeopardized the economic recovery
plan‘s achievements of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

1.4     In addition, a confluence of factors—poor economic performance and policies, and
deteriorating governance—led to a breakdown in the relations between Tanzania and its
external partners in the mid-1990s. In mid-1994, a group of ―Independent Advisors on
Development Cooperation Issues between Tanzania and its Aid Donors‖ chaired by



                                               1
Professor Gerald Helleiner, was formed to assess whether development cooperation could be
strengthened. The Helleiner Report (Helleiner and others, 1995) led to a major revamping of
relations with development partners, organized around the principle of ‗mutual
accountability.‘ With donor rapprochement in the wake of the Helleiner Report and the
election in 1995 of Benjamin Mkapa, as Tanzania‘s third president, the government initiated
another economic recovery plan in 1996. There was a strong commitment to improving fiscal
performance and instituting structural reforms to enable both accelerated growth and poverty
alleviation, and a new dynamic of donor engagement including IMF and World Bank
support. During this period the government placed reformers in key leadership positions in
the Ministry of Finance and elsewhere. In April 2000, the International Development
Association (IDA) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) supported a comprehensive
debt reduction package for Tanzania under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative (IDA/IMF, 2000) that cancelled outstanding debts to the two institutions1,
as noted in Table 1-1.

1.5     The government‘s program was laid out in a number of new strategy documents,
including the Development Vision 2025, National Poverty Eradication Strategy, Tanzanian
Assistance Strategy, and the Public Expenditure Review/Medium Term Expenditure
Framework, jointly produced by the government and Bank.2 The Development Vision 2025
document updated Tanzania‘s national vision, first expressed in the Arusha Declaration. It
projected a future free of poverty, with high levels of human development, and Tanzania
graduating to a middle income status by 2025. The National Poverty Eradication Strategy
was more specific in defining goals and strategies in the areas of economic growth, income
levels, primary education, literacy, access to water and sanitation, disease burden, mortality
and health, employment, housing and infrastructure, some with quantitative indicators and
targets specified. The Tanzania Assistance Strategy set out to ―restore local ownership and
leadership by promoting partnership in the design and execution of development programs‖
following the rapprochement with development partners in 1995. The process for preparing
annual public expenditure reviews became the main avenue for policy dialogue and strategy
formulation among domestic stakeholders and with development partners before the poverty
reduction strategy paper (PRSP) process was launched.3

1.6    The economy appeared to respond swiftly to the new reforms, with an average real
GDP growth rate of 5 percent from 1999 onwards. This was a significant improvement
compared to the less than 3 percent growth realized in the early 1990s which had resulted
from the constraints posed by falling commodity prices, the slowdown in the world economy,
and declining world tourism. Simultaneously, the government dealt with many of the

1
  Assistance depended on several conditions, including the adoption and implementation of a
participatory poverty reduction strategy (IMF, 1996).
2
 In addition, an Anti-Corruption Strategy which emphasized increased transparency, accountability
and governance, and an External Debt Strategy aimed at preventing the country from reverting to
serious external debt problems post-HIPC, were also introduced.
3
  The PRSP became a required input for accessing financial support from both the Bank (IDA) and
the IMF, beginning1999 (Independent Evaluation Office and Operations Evaluation Department,
2004).


                                                 2
distortions that existed in the 1990s—markets became freer and the public sector smaller.
Inflation also declined from over 30 percent in 1995 to 5 percent in 2000. Prospects for
improved real GDP growth for the medium term increased, with agriculture, mining and the
tourism sectors becoming the driving forces as their shares of the growth rate increased.

1.7     The Bank‘s program assistance to Tanzania prior to the PRSC series included a
sequence of structural adjustment credits, combined with sector investment and sector
adjustment lending and analytical and advisory services. In the social sectors, Bank
assistance included a human resources development pilot project which closed in 2005, an
adjustment lending operation for primary education executed between October 2001 and
October 2004 and another adjustment operation supporting secondary education
implemented between June 2004 and December 2007. In the health sector, the Bank
contributed to the health sector multi-donor ―basket fund‖—in which the government pools
funds from multiple partners in support of a broad sector program—through two adjustable
program loans (APLs), the Health Sector Development I and II with two rounds of additional
financing between 2000 and 2009. The basket fund supported specific sector reforms through
the line ministry‘s budget and also provided significant funding for non-wage expenditures at
both national and local levels. A multi-sector HIV/AIDS project supported Tanzania‘s efforts
to reduce HIV transmission and to mitigate the adverse consequences of AIDS. A project in
the water sector supported technical, commercial, and financial rehabilitation of the water
supply and sanitation services in Dar es Salaam. A second Tanzania Social Action Fund


                                                        3
project was approved on November 30, 2004, as a follow-up to continue with the successful
outcomes in supporting social protection and inclusion at the community level.

1.8     Other sector projects complemented the Bank‘s policy dialogue initiated under the
poverty reduction support process. The Agriculture Sector Development project (1998-2004)
was deepened by the Participatory Agricultural Development and Empowerment Project
Credit, which was approved by the Bank‘s Board in May 2003 to support investments in
appropriate technologies to reduce soil fertility decline. Efforts to improve Tanzania‘s
infrastructure were supported through projects in the road and railway sectors, as well as
through an urban rehabilitation project. In the power sector, the Bank helped the government
implement the Power Sector Restructuring Program. It encouraged the government to
develop the domestic gas market and to generate lower-cost power through the Songo Songo
Gas Development and Power Generation Project. The Bank also provided support under the
Local Government Support Project to strengthen fiscal decentralization, improve
accountability in the use of local government resources, and improve the management of
intergovernmental transfer systems.

1.9     Economic and Political Background for PRSCs 4-8 (2006-2010). The second series of
the PRSCs were initiated under the economic momentum built by the economic recovery
plan, and continued through the first PRSC series. Economic reform in Tanzania had started
to yield positive results during the late 1990s and the early 2000s. GDP growth accelerated,
resulting in around 4 percent per capita per annum growth since the early 2000s (see Table 1-
2). Growth was accompanied by higher investments and a favorable external environment
with strong prices for commodities exported by Tanzania. Economic performance remained
strong even during the subsequent global financial crisis, beginning in 2008. But the
improved growth during the decade was not translated into a significant decline in income
poverty. Available poverty data4 indicate that there was only a marginal change in poverty
between 2000 and 2007, from 35.6 percent households below the national poverty line to
33.4 percent.5 In addition to the weak income poverty response to growth, household
consumption data also indicated that the poorest households had little gains in consumption
between 2000 and 2007, while the top deciles experienced consumption growth well above
the average, thus indicating rising inequality. The modest reduction in income poverty
surprised government officials and development partners, some of whose attention was
devoted to attacking or supporting the data. The ensuing rethinking of the programs of
development partners, including the Bank, and the government‘s ongoing defense of its
development strategy became a factor in eroding trust and confidence among the government
and development partners according to multiple interviews.

1.10 On the other hand, the strong growth and foreign aid flow increased resources
available to the government, which translated into sizable gains in access to education and

 The most recent poverty data are based on the Household Budget Survey of 2007 (See United
Republic of Tanzania, 2011).

 The Government first poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) adopted in 2000 projected that GDP
growth of around 4 percent could likely halve Tanzania‘s level of poverty by 2010, but the elasticity
of poverty reduction to growth has been much weaker than expected (World Bank, 2008b).

health services. During the 2000s, Tanzania enjoyed improved health outcomes such as
increased life expectancy largely due to vaccination campaigns and a reduction in malaria,
and apparent reduced maternal mortality towards the end of the decade. These resulted in
substantial increase in Tanzania‘s composite health index of United Nations‘ Human
Development Index. Remarkable gains were also achieved in education, especially in terms
of average years of schooling, although slow income growth translated into very little success
in reducing malnutrition faced by the poorest households.

1.11 During the period 2000-2010 the Government was highly reliant on foreign aid
(Figure A). Official Development Assistance averaged 13 percent of GDP, with general
budget support (GBS) providing roughly one-fourth of this (4 percent of GDP) in the years
for which data is available. The World Bank's PRSCs accounted for roughly one quarter of


                                                                   5
GBS. In recent years, development partners, including the Bank, have begun to scale back
resource transfer through general budget support. Persistent heavy reliance on GBS has
provoked questions from the Bank (World Bank 2012a) and development partners about the
sustainability of official development assistance as a contributor to Tanzania‘s growth.

1.12 Overall, public expenditures on education and health increased from 3.6 and 1.5
percent respectively of GDP in 2000-02 to 6 and 3 percent of GDP respectively by end of the
decade. The introduction of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the PRS
process in early 2000s helped to streamline and prioritize donor assistance to Tanzania.
Relationships between Tanzania and its development partners were shaped also by the
principles developed under the multi-donor budget support mechanism, which resulted in the
share of budget support in total donor funding to increase from 33 percent in 2003/04 to
about 51 percent by 2007/08 and stabilize thereafter at that level (Ministry of Finance, 2008).

1.13 The Bank has been an important partner in Tanzania‘s economic reform process
during the second half of the decade as in the first half (Table 1-3) with increased financial
and technical support. By 2004 outstanding credit to the Bank reached around USD4 billion,
of which about 75 percent was written off as part of the HIPC process. As of 2011 the
outstanding debt to the Bank was about USD3 billion.

1.14 Overall, the effort by the Bank to transition from traditional adjustment lending to
poverty reduction support was motivated by the goal of promoting country ownership of the
reform process and donor harmonization (as per the emerging principles of the Paris
Declaration).6 Indeed, Tanzania and development partners were on the leading edge in

Declaration on Aid Harmonization (2003), the Marrakech Memorandum on Managing for Results

implementing the harmonization agenda. While the previous Bank‘s adjustment lending
relied primarily on externally monitored, ex-ante policy conditionality, the PRSC sought to
reinforce government ownership and the participation of local stakeholders by promoting the
use of country processes for policy design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. The
PRSCs also provided added flexibility for adjusting the direction of policy reform in
response to changing circumstances. Importantly, the second PRSC series put major
emphasis on the harmonization goals of the Paris Declaration. The Bank‘s country strategy
served as an annex to a joint partner strategy—the Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania—
and the Bank entered into a new arrangement for dialogue with the government that was
more inclusive of other development partners.

1.15 The PRSC was the means by which the Bank coordinated with other donors in
including its policy measures in the existing general budget support policy matrix, the
performance assessment framework (PAF). GBS was initially an outgrowth of the poverty
reduction strategy process and dialogue surrounding the HIPC initiative. The PRSC began
outside of GBS, which was at the time focused on priority sectors and the allocation of
budget resources. While the Bank gave this aspect of GBS some degree of attention, it
viewed budget support primarily as an instrument to support growth and poverty reduction.
Other development partners were not in universal agreement regarding this adjustment, but
agreed to modify the PAF so the Bank could participate in joint GBS. This tension between
the Bank and several other development partners persisted, and the results of the 2007
household budget survey that showed a weak growth-poverty linkage became a source of
contention, with the Bank left in somewhat of a defensive position. Moreover, different
partners preferred different strategies for support—with varied focus on processes, inputs,

(2004) leading to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005) laid down a roadmap to
improving the effectiveness of aid by emphasizing harmonization, alignment, country ownership and
mutual accountability.




                                                       7
and outputs/outcomes—and so general budget support retained these multiple approaches in
spite of a common PAF.

1.16 Under GBS, the dialogue between the government and development partners was
heavily and increasingly driven by process—with the creation of an elaborate system of
working groups and annual reviews of sector progress. At the outset, this emphasis was
useful and according to multiple interviews it helped to re-establish trust among partners,
keeping all parties informed and allowing broad participation. The government was able to
use the GBS process to coordinate disparate agendas among donor partners; donors were able
to ensure access to top policymakers. But starting around 2007, process came to dominate
content as development partners cut back on technical staff in the field and a less reform-
minded government came to power. The increased focus on process led skeptics, including
on the Bank‘s country team, to become disenchanted with GBS and the PRSC instrument.
Some viewed the government as intent on doing only the minimum required, while other
development partners saw the Bank as trying to undermine the process. This disillusionment
with GBS led partners to abandon their early enthusiasm to use the instrument as the primary
vehicle for development support, with plans to use it in a more modest fashion for the
foreseeable future.

2. Series 1: PRSCs 1-3
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
2.1     Objectives. The program objectives for PRSCs 1-3 were first articulated in the
program documents for PRSC-2, and repeated in PRSC-3. This evaluation considers these
objectives, specified below, as those of the full series:

      Sustaining and accelerating economic growth and broadening its impact;
      Supporting results orientation of public service delivery;
      Enhancing public sector performance; and
      Strengthening environmental management.

2.2     The objectives of the series were not settled until the second operation. In the
program document for PRSC-1, objectives were stated as: (i) promoting accelerated growth;
(ii) broadening the impact of growth; (iii) aligning public investment with [Poverty
Reduction Strategy goals; and (iv) increasing the efficiency of public service delivery.
Program documents for PRSCs 2-3 adjusted and condensed these objectives, and added an
objective on environmental management.

2.3     Complementing PRSC-1, which focused on private sector development and public
sector management, PRSC-2 aimed at reducing poverty, improving M&E, sustaining
macroeconomic stability, improving the effectiveness of service delivery, and fostering
environmental sustainability. The last operation of the series, PRSC-3 focused on enhancing
the reforms targeted by the first two operations, leveraging progress in the implementation of
sectoral programs to reduce poverty (especially primary education, basic health, water, rural
roads, agricultural research and extension, the judiciary and HIV/AIDS), facilitating actions



                                              8
to strengthen public sector performance and enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the use
of resources, supporting government's efforts to promote environmental sustainability of
Tanzania's development program, and strengthening the alignment of the PRSC to
government strategy.7

2.4     Relevance of Objectives. The Bank‘s PRSC objectives were built on the country
assistance strategy (CAS) of 2001-03, which was extended to 2006, and had anticipated
development policy lending in 2003. This strategy focused on creating higher growth and
economic opportunities for the poor as well as helping build country capacity, empowerment
and accountability. It was fully consistent with Tanzania‘s own poverty reduction strategy
(United Republic of Tanzania 2000), whose two pillar approach to tackling income poverty
and supporting human capabilities, survival and well-being included action on maintaining
macroeconomic stability, rural sector development and export growth, private sector
development, education, health, social well-being, vulnerability, and the environment. The
PRSC focus on governance, growth, and income poverty reduction supplemented the focus
on human development services in the programs of other development partners.

2.5      The series also built on a prior operation—the Programmatic Structural Adjustment
Credit (PSAC), which supported the government‘s efforts to sustain macroeconomic
stability, strengthen financial accountability, deepen the implementation of the privatization
program, improve competitiveness and transparency of markets, and further reduce barriers
to internal and international trade (World Bank, 2000). The program document for PRSC-1
explicitly noted that the operation would focus on private sector development and public
sector management to complete and deepen the reform agenda implemented under the PSAC,
and lay the ground for attacking income poverty more aggressively. The scope of the PRSC
series was country-wide and intrinsically aligned to the government‘s PRSP and the Bank‘s
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). In this respect, the objectives of the PRSC were relevant
in helping deal with the constraints to growth and poverty reduction which were the concern
of the government‘s program. In addition, the focus of the program reflected the lessons from
previous reforms initiated under the Tanzania poverty reduction strategy and supported by
the Bank under the PSAC. While the range of the objectives of the supporting government
program was very broad, the focus of the PRSC concentrated on public sector issues, an area
in which other development partners were less involved. Relevance of the objectives of
PRSCs 1-3 is therefore rated substantial.

2.6      Design. The PRSCs identified important policy areas to achieve their objectives. For
the first objective on growth and broadening its impact, the program focused on
macroeconomic stability, rural development and export growth, and private sector
development. For the second objective on results orientation of public service delivery, the
PRSCs were to monitor resource allocation to, and outcomes in, the poverty reduction
strategy pillar covering enhancing human capabilities, survival, and well-being. The series
supported reforms in public expenditure management, which could help the country to better
monitor resource allocation. For the third objective on enhancing public sector performance,

7
 In addition, over time the PRSC was increasingly integrated into the Poverty Reduction Budget
Support (PRBS) framework of other development partners (Refer to the Partnership Framework
Memorandum, Annex 7 of World Bank, 2005).


                                                 9
the PRSCs sought to improve the effectiveness of public services, minimize resource
leakage, and strengthen accountability. The program focused on most of the important policy
areas, including public financial management, civil service pay, procurement, and to some
extent decentralization. For the fourth objective on strengthening environmental
management, the PRSCs were to support the mainstreaming of environmental concerns into
the poverty reduction strategy, budget process, and sectoral policies, improve the
understanding of poverty-environment linkages, and strengthen institutional capacity to
integrate environmental assessments into sectoral strategies, policies, and activities as the
district and local level.

2.7     Relevance of Design. The policy areas selected for inclusion in the PRSCs were
largely appropriate. On accelerating growth and broadening its impact, a focus on
macroeconomic stability, rural development, and private sector development made sense:
more than 80 percent of Tanzania‘s poor live in rural areas and three-quarters derive their
income from agriculture (United Republic of Tanzania 2009); private sector development
particularly in rural areas could enhance non-agriculture employment opportunities for the
poor; and macroeconomic stability was a precondition for strong growth. The policy areas
under the third objective could also contribute directly to enhancing public sector
performance.

2.8     Linkages of the policy areas supporting the second and fourth objectives were less
clear. There were no specific policy actions related to improving data collection or analysis.
Support for the fourth objective was not anticipated until the second of three operations and
only delivered through dialogue. The intention appeared to be to introduce the topic to the
national dialogue rather than influence policies directly, but the program documentation does
not make the case that the dialogue would, or could, lead to the outcome desired.

2.9      Many of the policy actions in the first series were ‗low hanging fruit‘, actions that
were relatively easy to complete due to political consensus, but which would require a
number of follow-on actions before development outcomes could be improved. Only nine of
the 28 prior actions in the first series involved implementation of specific reforms (which
could plausibly contribute to achieving the program‘s objectives), while 13 related to drafting
and approving legislation or executing the budget in line with poverty reduction strategy
priorities, and six involved developing frameworks for future reforms or reporting on
progress.

2.10 The series lacked a functional results framework. Objectives for the series were not
settled until the second operation, and program documents did not clearly articulate how
progress in adopting the proposed policy measures would help to achieve the program‘s
objectives. Outcome indicators were inconsistent for each operation and for the overall
series. For several objectives, it was not obvious that these policy changes would contribute
much to the desired outcomes, with prior actions and proposed triggers often preliminary in
nature. This evaluation reconstructs a plausible route by which PRSC-supported activities
could have been expected to contribute to achieving the stated objectives.

2.11 Overall, due to the relevance of the program‘s policy areas to its objectives but the
weak results framework, the relevance of program design is rated modest.

Implementation
2.12 Table 2-1 summarizes the approval, effectiveness, closing dates and size of each of
the three PRSCs. All three operations were co-financed by the Kreditanstalt für
Wiederaufbau (KfW, Germany) and complemented by the GBS partners (African
Development Bank, European Union (EU), Canada, Denmark, Finland, Japan, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Ireland and the U.K. Department for
International Development (DfID)). All three PRSCs were consistent with a performance
assessment framework (PAF) common to all GBS partners—indeed, the PAF was adjusted
and made more complex to accommodate them. Triggers were developed in close
cooperation with government counterparts. None of the three PRSCs was restructured, and
there was no mid-term review for an individual operation or the series as a whole. The actual
amount of PRSC-3 was USD150 million rather than the USD175 million which was
originally envisaged in the CAS as development policy lending. Budget support was
expected to gradually become the primary vehicle for resource transfer from IDA to
Tanzania. Because of delays in the implementation of agriculture sector reforms (see below),
and in order to maintain consistency between IDA's PRSC financing and the pace of
structural reforms, the USD25 million increase in PRSC financing was postponed until the
follow-up PRSC-4 (the first credit in the second series of PRSC support).

2.13 Within the context of the regular supervision by Bank staff, PRSC implementation
was supported by ongoing IDA operations—for example, a FY1999 tax administration
project, a FY2000 public sector reform program, and a FY2003 participatory agriculture
development and empowerment project. The government also coordinated implementation of
its program through sector working groups, which were set up as instruments for dialogue
and monitoring of the PRSP for all stakeholders. The coherence of the government‘s policy
framework in the context of the first PRSP8 facilitated the yearly selection of triggers, while
the ex-post nature of financing allowed for a more flexible matching of PRSC policy areas
with the government policy choices, although various program documents of the PRSC series
noted that perceptions of implementation speed on some actions diverged considerably
between the government and Bank staff. Slow implementation was attributed by Bank staff
to capacity limitations, although some development partners consulted pointed to conflicting
political commitment and personalities in government as the program evolved. Several

 The Government‘s second PRSP, subsumed under the broader policy framework of MKUKUTA
was issued in 2005 (United Republic of Tanzania, 2005a).

government officials noted the Bank was slow to provide no objection when necessary, but
these complaints appeared to be limited to sector investment lending rather than the PRSCs.

2.14 Performance of the PRSCs was formally monitored in the context of the GBS annual
review process, which involved a mid-year review around March-April and an Annual
Review in October, with inputs from various parts of government, civil society and the GBS
partners as organized through the technical committees and working groups. A critical
underlying instrument that facilitated the monitoring of PRSCs 1-3 was the Public
Expenditure Review (PER) process which pre-dated the PRSCs. This process involved bi-
weekly meetings between the Bank and government officials as a means to co-author an
annual PER, and associated Poverty and Human Development Reports. But the dialogue
reached far beyond the purview of the reports themselves, covering many of the critical
development issues Tanzania was facing. According to multiple government officials and
Bank staff interviewed, this intensive process created a degree of trust on a technocratic level
among Bank representatives and key technocratic reformers in the government. It was
helpful that the Bank‘s Lead Economist in the country became the Governor of the Central
Bank during the series, solidifying a technical client relationship.

2.15 The data generated by the two set of documents allowed for some evidence-based
assessment of progress of the PRSCs, although some development partners9 have noted that
the government commitment to the PER and associated MTEF seemed to have begun
weakening by the end of the series. Overall, the results framework for PRSCs 1-3 was
rudimentary and accounted for the major effort made during the follow-up series to
strengthen the M&E system.

Achievement of the Objectives
2.16 In the absence of a robust results framework that organizes policy areas—and their
associated triggers and prior actions—around the series‘ four objectives, this evaluation
reconstructs the most plausible route by which the activities undertaken by the operations
could have been expected to contribute to achieving the stated objectives. Indicator areas
were identified in the program document for PRSC-2, but without specific indicators or
targets. Trends for key outcome indicators for the four objectives, as identified by this
evaluation, are summarized in Table 5. Analysis on the achievement of each objective
follows, with greater detail provided in Annex C.

OBJECTIVE 1: SUSTAINING AND ACCELERATING ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BROADENING
ITS IMPACT.

2.17 Results for sustaining and accelerating economic growth and broadening its impact
were mixed.10 Economic growth was robust during the period 2003-2005, with real GDP
growth ranging between 6 percent and 8 percent per annum, more stable than other strong

10
  ―Broadening its impact‖ is taken to mean that growth is shared with the poor, and a reduction in
income poverty is taken as the key associated indicator.

performers in the region and significantly faster than the region as a whole, as shown in
Figure 2.1. From the Bank's own analysis, much of this growth (and that in subsequent years)
was fuelled by fiscal expansion supported by massive aid inflows (World Bank 2012a,
'Tanzania Economic Update'). Over 2000-2005, government spending mostly financed
through increased aid flows contributed 3.8 percentage points of the 6.8 percent annual
growth. Growth otherwise would have remained at levels experienced during the 1990s,
calling into question whether reliance on this external support was contributing to the goal of
sustainable growth.

2.18 Moreover, Tanzania's strong growth did not translate into the expected income
poverty reduction, a result similar to the disappointing experience in nearby fast-growing
sub-Saharan African countries (figure 2.2 shows the relationship between growth and
extreme poverty for non-fragile low income countries). Data were infrequently available. But
the 2007 Household Budget Survey revealed only a comparatively modest reduction in
income poverty (using the government‘s basic needs poverty line) between 2001 and 2007,
which fell from 35.7 percent to 33.6 percent. Among rural populations, the poverty
headcount fell from 38.7 percent to 37.6 percent, while it fell slightly faster in urban areas (a
substantial portion of the overall modest decline was due to urbanization).11 At the country‘s
extreme poverty line, the headcount rate also fell modestly from 18.7 percent to 16.6 percent.


11
  This is substantiated by a 2005 independent evaluation of general budget support to Tanzania,
which concluded that the disappointing outcome on poverty was a result of the fact that ―the structure
of growth is skewed towards urban rather than rural areas, towards mining and services rather than
agriculture and towards the richer rather than the poorer‖ (Overseas Development Institute and Daima
Associates Limited 2005).


                                                      13
2.19 When using the much higher international threshold for extreme income poverty of
$1.25 per day, there was more progress, with the overall poverty headcount falling from 84.6
percent in 2001 to 67.9 percent in 2007, while the Gini measure of inequality grew from 35
to 38 (PovcalNet). The major discrepancy in measured outcomes was largely a result of a
different choice of price index. But even this measure compares unfavorably to other low-
income countries given Tanzania‘s fast growth, demonstrating a low growth elasticity of
extreme poverty—below -0.5—compared to international benchmarks identified in the
literature of -1.6 (Bourguignon 2003) and -2.6 (IEG 2005).12 The elasticity in Tanzania was,
however, roughly on par with neighboring Mozambique and Uganda, and was greater than
that in Rwanda, each of which experienced fast growth but comparatively low poverty
reduction during similar periods.13

2.20 What was the PRSCs‘ contribution to these outcomes? The program document for
PRSC-2 outlined three areas through which the series would contribute to the government‘s
program:

12
  Poverty appears to be less elastic to growth among low-income countries than across all countries,
but Tanzania‘s record remains below par in this regard.
13
  Mozambique and Rwanda have clearly had disappointing poverty outcomes in the early- and mid-
2000s. Uganda‘s poverty reduction has been steady, but still not as fast as expected given its very fast
economic growth.


                                                                     14
      Sustained macro-economic stability, seen as a precondition for growth and
       implementation of the development strategy, by supporting a broader effort among
       development partners;
      Enhanced opportunities in formal and informal sectors through private sector
       development and strengthening the business environment; and
      Raised agricultural productivity and profitability to enhance incomes of the
       population in rural areas, where poverty was most widespread and deeply entrenched.

2.21 There was substantial progress in the first area, and modest progress in the second
and third. The country was successful in maintaining macro-economic stability, with the
Bank‘s contribution coming through a broader effort among development partners led by the
IMF. The business environment did not change markedly according to available indicators,
and reforms in private sector development were slow. Similarly, reforms in the agriculture
sector were delayed and diluted, and growth in the sector does not appear to have translated
into higher income among the rural population.

2.22 Monitoring indicators were inconsistent from operation to operation. Many indicators
identified in PRSC-1 were dropped, without discussion, in the program documents for PRSC-
2 and PRSC-3. This was because the Bank committed to adhere to the common Performance
Assessment Framework, which was developed after the first PRSC program document and
utilized a second specific set of indicators.

2.23 The Bank recognized that achieving the overall growth and poverty reduction
objectives of the PRSCs required the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. The IMF
took the lead on these issues under its Poverty Reduction Grant Facility; its reviews under the
Facility served as an input into the Bank‘s assessment of the macroeconomic situation, an
implicit condition for the program. The Bank focused on ensuring sustainability of
Tanzania‘s external debt following the substantial debt cancelation under HIPC, and the
preservation of budget allocated to priority sectors. This was intended to maintain the
accelerated economic growth that was seen to be in part a result of improved fiscal
performance in the late 1990s, while directing additional resources generated through debt
cancellation toward development priorities. The program thus encouraged prudent
management and contracting of external debt by emphasizing the adoption of a national debt
strategy, amendments to laws and ordinances related to the contracting and procurement of
debt, an annual borrowing and repayment plan, stronger controls on contingent liabilities,
and the establishment of a national debt management committee.

2.24 Macroeconomic management during 2003-05 overall was strong. The IMF deemed
Tanzania‘s structural reform program on track, with the country meeting all but one
quantitative indicator for the Poverty Reduction Grant Facility in December 2005. The
country‘s growth, inflation, and external position were all considered consistent with IMF
program assumptions (IMF 2006). While growth was strong, inflation remained low,
hovering around 5 percent per annum. The fiscal deficit grew somewhat 5 percent of GDP in
2005, but even this was in part due to a drop in grant finance. As discussed under the second
objective, the budget resources allocated to priority sectors were flat as a share of GDP.
Investment continued an upward trend rising from 19.1 percent of GDP in 2002 to 22.9



                                              15
percent in 2005, while gross domestic savings fell modestly. The current account deficit,
after hitting a low of -1.0 percent in 2002, rose to 7.8 percent in 2005.

2.25 Reforms in debt management were successful, in part because the PRSCs built on the
dialogue around, and overlapped with the final stages of, the HIPC initiative,14 as well as
with the multilateral debt relief initiative process which created strong incentives for
Tanzania to reform its debt management system and introduce institutions for prudent macro-
policies. All envisaged debt targets were met, and the country had significant scope to
expand its fiscal space at the end of the period. With debt cancellation under HIPC and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the debt to GDP declined to 60 percent in 2005, while
debt service declined from the peak of almost 40 percent of exports to about 5 percent. The
net present value of debt-to-export ratio was estimated to be 64 percent by 2006. These
figures were considered well below debt sustainability thresholds (World Bank, 2007e: 14).

2.26 Private sector development was perceived as essential for growth and poverty
reduction. The PRSC built on tangible steps taken with support from the PSAC, which
included the advancement of the privatization agenda, with government disengagement from
commercial activities almost completed and significant progress toward greater private sector
involvement in the provision of utilities; progress in strengthening the business environment
and reform of land legislation; and the establishment of an improved regulatory environment.

2.27 By the available indicators, the business environment did not improve, suggesting
that this was not a major contributor to strong industrial growth. The results from the two
investment climate assessments roughly corresponding to the beginning and end of the period
(2003, 2006) suggest no major change.15 The PRSCs focused on three primary constraints to
private sector development: the lack of a private sector development strategy and small and
medium enterprise policy, rigid labor laws, and a need to improve the business environment.
The lack of a comprehensive strategic framework to help with coordination and targeting of
the various initiatives in support of private sector development was seen as major problem, as
earlier efforts had been piecemeal.

2.28 The industrial growth rate for the period 2003-05 was indeed strong, at 10 percent per
annum, meeting the targeted range of 8 to 10 percent. This rapid growth, however, was
driven by capital-intensive sectors, including for example a strong supply-side response in
the mining sector to high commodity prices, and later a slowdown as global aggregate
demand subsided in 2008 and 2009 (see Figure 2.2). It was not related to broad economy-
wide reforms or growth across sectors targeted by Bank-supported government reforms.
Average annual growth in mining and quarrying over 2000-2005 was 15.2 percent and
accounted for roughly one-third of industrial growth, despite its one-sixth share of industrial
GDP (World Bank 2007e). Moreover, the impact of industrial growth on poverty is limited



14
  The dialogue surrounding the HIPC initiative was in itself a trust-building exercise which laid the
groundwork for GBS and the PRSC series.
15
  There were eight crop boards covering tobacco, cotton, pyrethrum, sisal, coffee, cashew nut, tea,
and sugar.


                                                  16
because the labor intensity of mining is low, and the manufacturing sector remains small and
concentrated in Dar es Salaam.

2.29 Reforms supported by PRSCs 1-3 do not appear to have had a significant effect on
private sector development. Implementation remained in its early stages. Under PRSC-1, the
Ministry of Industry and Trade prepared a small and medium enterprise policy and launched
an associated public awareness campaign, but its implementation was much slower than
expected due to insufficient funding from the budget. The private sector strategy that was
expected to be completed under PRSC-3 was delayed because the government wanted to first
complete the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, which was not finalized until June 2005,
and later dropped during the next series.

2.30 Fragmentation of labor policies in six different, outdated pieces of legislation
impeded market-oriented deployment of labor. The government was expected to prepare a
new labor policy and approve it under PRSC-2, while in the context of PRSC-3 a new Labor
Act was expected to be prepared and presented to parliament for approval. Phase-1 labor
legislation covering employment relations, collective labor relations, dispute resolution, and
labor market institutions was submitted to the Parliament in November 2003, and approved
in April 2004. A task force assigned to do the preparatory works for phase-2 legislation
(covering occupational safety, health workers compensation, and employment and skill
development) was expected to be finalized under PRSC-3 (2005), but was postponed for
2006 (and was not followed up by the second PRSC series).

2.31 There was a significant unfinished agenda in improving the investment climate and
the business environment. In July 2002, the government approved the Business Environment
Strengthening for Tanzania program, partly supported by the PSAC. The PRSC focused on
the implementation plan for the business environment program that targeted eight priority
areas of action. Following approval of the program under PRSC-2, the PRSC program shifted
focus to replacing the business licensing regime by a registration system. A draft bill on
Business Activities Registration that outlined the direction of the business environment
reforms was submitted to Parliament in July 2005.

2.32 Agriculture and rural development were considered critical in broadening the
impact of growth to generate poverty reduction given the preponderance of poverty in rural
areas, and the reliance of the vast majority of the poor on the sector. The envisaged outcomes
for the sector were: an increase in growth of real agricultural GDP from 3.6 percent in
2000/01 to an average of 5 percent by 2010. This was expected to lead to: (i) an increased
share of income or consumption accruing to the poorest 20 percent, (ii) a reduced share of
population living on less than USD1 per day, and (iii) an increased ratio of trade to GDP. The
targeted growth performance in agriculture was roughly achieved. The share of income
accruing to the poorest 20 percent fell from 7.3 to 6.8 percent (PovcalNet). A poverty
assessment in 2008 suggests that poverty reduction due to agricultural growth was marginal.
Overall, the rural poverty headcount barely budged between 2001 and 2007, falling from
38.6 percent to 37.4 percent,16 and rural income only grew 4 percent in total between 2001
and 2007 (URT 2009). Trade as a share of GDP increased from 37 percent in 2002 to 51

driver.

2.33 The PRSCs supported implementation of the government‘s 2001 Agricultural Sector
Development Strategy, and associated Agriculture Sector Development Program, which
identified improving agricultural productivity and profitability as a key objective.
Fluctuations in agricultural sector growth were more associated with changes in rainfall
rather than changes in policy. The 5 percent growth rate was not sustained after the PRSCs
closed, and growth was overall flat during the 2000-2010 decade, as shown in Figure C.
Rather than serving as evidence of increasing productivity, much of the growth could be
attributed to expanding the area of land cultivated rather than increases in land yields,
especially given modest or nonexistent gains in use of improved seeds, fertilizer, and area
developed for irrigation.

2.34 The government‘s Agriculture Sector Development Program included a broad array
of measures to address the identified constraints in the sector, including insecure land rights,
lack of clarity on responsibility for regulatory decisions, limited access to agricultural credit,
high levels of agricultural taxation, and limited access to markets due to poor transport
infrastructure. The PRSCs specifically sought to support this program with an extremely
ambitious agenda, including reforms of crop boards17 particularly with respect to input
supply, product quality, and competitiveness; micro-finance legislation; the institutional
arrangements governing rural roads; local government taxation; property rights; and overall
coordination of public interventions in the agricultural sector. A separate investment
project—the Participatory Agricultural Development and Empowerment Project—
complemented this policy work by financing small agricultural development subprojects

17
  There were eight crop boards covering tobacco, cotton, pyrethrum, sisal, coffee, cashew nut, tea,
and sugar.


                                                                   18
planned at the community level, but there was no broad agriculture sector project until the
second series.

2.35 In practice, policy reforms supported by PRSCs 1-3 were structural in nature, and not
likely to generate a rapid supply response. Regardless, implementation of those reforms was
slow and weak, and the sector‘s temporarily improved growth performance owed little to the
credits. The passing of the Land (Amendment) Act in 2004 provided for improved clarity of
property rights and better securitization of land, but the PRSC-2 trigger to support its
implementation was delayed one year, and its benefits did not have time to affect growth
during the period. Slow consensus-building between the European Union and Ministry of
Lands and Housing Services delayed the preparation of the land sector strategic plan, which
was to receive financial support from EU‘s European Development Fund. As a consequence,
the reform was redefined as a trigger for PRSC-3, but there was no evidence of immediate
―operationalization‖ as envisaged. Similarly, the approval of the strategy to reform two crop
boards was only partially met and was repeated as a trigger for the follow-up PRSC series.
The cabinet approved changes to the financing of crop boards, but did not endorse specific
reforms of their role and functions, including regulation, governance structures, and
accountability to stakeholders.18

2.36 In view of the delays in getting the Bank‘s Agricultural Sector Development Program
(2006) approved internally and the initial slow pace of implementation, it appears that the
range of issues undertaken by the Bank in this area overstretched its capacity, since this
involved coordinating the activities of many sector experts.

2.37 The overall efficacy of PRSCs in achieving the first objective was modest—strong
growth was not matched by a broadening of its impact, and there is little evidence that the
improved growth performance can be attributed to measures supported by the credits.

OBJECTIVE 2: SUPPORTING A RESULTS ORIENTATION OF PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY

2.38 PRSC support for this objective was particularly poorly defined. The dialogue was to
focus on establishing a robust monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system to feed into
assessment of the results of sectoral programs (without directly supporting those programs).
The processes for preparing annual public expenditure reviews and medium term expenditure
frameworks were to provide a mechanism for monitoring the use of resources through public
expenditure management and revenue mobilization. Most of the Bank‘s support was focused
on monitoring the use of resources rather than helping to establish the M&E system, where
the intention appeared to be to remain engaged in the government-identified priority sectors
with an eye to shifting the Bank‘s investment lending support in these sectors into future
PRSCs.


18
  The joint evaluation of General Budget Support (ODI and DAL 2005) in their assessment of the
implementation of this policy noted that it was not so clear that there was a strong political thrust in
favor of it from the government side. The report further concluded that agricultural policy could have
been more coherent if the three ministries involved directly in the sector were subjected to the
common discipline of the MTEF/Budget Guidelines/PER processes.


                                                   19
2.39 Monitoring and evaluation. On the M&E side, there were some tangible results.
First, and most importantly, when the Bank and government agreed to bring the PRSC under
the umbrella of general budget support in 2003, the Bank introduced two new outcome-
oriented areas for monitoring under the joint performance assessment framework (PAF)—
reduction of income poverty and environmental sustainability—and added detail to the policy
matrix that ―brought a greater policy content and a higher level of rigour‖ (ODI and DAL
2005). Second, the government, Bank, and other development partners set up a system for
monitoring progress in some sectors through sector working groups. Third, building on the
2002 Poverty and Human Development Report, two additional reports were produced in
2003 and 2005, and have been published every two years since. These reports present and
analyze the available data on progress toward achieving poverty reduction strategy goals,
organized around the objectives of the national development strategy. By 2005, Bank
analytical work served as a major input to analysis.

2.40 Outcome data were widely available in the health and education sectors. While data
collected in the course of administering programs—much of which was not considered to be
of high quality—provided the backbone of information in these sectors, it was verified
through regular Demographic and Health Surveys. The data indicated expanded access to
education, reductions in infant mortality, and declining incidence of AIDS.19 However, the
quality, frequency, and availability of data on outcomes of other government programs, such
as water and electricity, were weak, relying heavily on data collected at the local level at the
point of service delivery. And meaningful data on the incidence of income poverty were too
infrequent, with household budget surveys conducted in 1991, 2000/01, and 2007. The
government and development partners were surprised by the lackluster income poverty
results of the 2007 survey, and were forced to rethink their development approach.

2.41 Another avenue to support the transformation of the public service to results-
orientation was by introducing annual plans, performance budgets, and linking each to the
results of new service delivery surveys. In all ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs),
the government approved strategic plans and action plans, as well as budgets that were linked
to the medium term expenditure framework. Service delivery surveys, with beneficiaries as
respondents, were completed for all MDAs, but the results were of uneven quality and
because the surveys were designed and implemented by five separate firms, the aggregation
of results produced by the President‘s Office-Public Service Management was of limited use
(United Republic of Tanzania 2004a). More importantly, they were not captured in the
strategic planning process, and so the critical link between policy and budgets on the one
hand, and results on the other was missing.

2.42 Monitoring use of resources. The program was partially successful in helping to
monitor the use of resources, with the Bank playing an important role. The PRSCs drew
extensively on the annual Public Expenditure Reviews, and provided the main focal point for
operational dialogue around public sector reform. The government adopted a

19
  This should not be construed as an impact of the PRSC program, which only indirectly contributed
to progress in the education and health sectors by helping to protect them from budget cutbacks
through dialogue and monitoring the use of resources, and building the infrastructure for monitoring
progress.


                                                 20
recommendation from the Bank-supported 2003 PER that requires each agency to explicitly
link proposed budget allocations with PRSP objectives, which allows observers to understand
resource allocation in terms of broad development goals. In addition, through public
expenditure management, the Bank supported the development of three-year rolling budget
guidelines, strengthening policy units in MDAs for priority sectors, improvement in
expenditure tracking and reporting on budget execution, and upgrading of budget processes
for local government authorities.

2.43 The share of the budget allocated to priority sectors was flat as a percentage of GDP
during the period, although actual allocations rose with GDP in real terms. Priority sectors
were protected even after HIPC support was irrevocably granted, but they did not grow
relative to other sectors. It should be noted that this was during a time of relative plenty, as
development partners were increasing their support to Tanzania, rather than an adverse fiscal
environment where priority sectors may have been more susceptible to budget-cutting.

2.44 There was improvement in budget execution, as resources spent were more in line
with the approved budget. There was a reduction in the total absolute deviation between
approved budget allocations and actual expenditures at the level of Ministries, Departments,
and Agencies, as shown in Figure D.20 The aggregate deviation indicator, while indicating
important progress, hides a shortcoming for the quality of expenditures. According to the
public expenditure review (PER) of 2004/05, which covered most of the period of the first
series of PRSCs, ―over-spending‖ units leaned toward more of administrative expenditures
(public administration, defense, foreign affairs), while ―under-spending‖ units constituted
those with more expenditures directly going to growth and poverty reduction (health,
education).




20
  The PRSCs used a different indicator—the share of ―votes‖ (MDA budget allocations) with budget
deviations greater than 5 percent. The government and development partners later abandoned this
indicator as insufficiently comprehensive.

2.45 The PER identified other shortcomings, including that (i) there had been no major
shift in investments toward infrastructure, although it had been identified as the main
constraint for growth; (ii) despite a strengthened formulation of medium term budget
strategy, there was still a need to transform the budget guidelines into a comprehensive
instrument for guiding public finances over the medium-term; and (iii) little progress had
been made in compiling actual expenditure data for the local government authorities. The
slow progress reflected weak capacity in local and central governments and the lack of a
standard reporting format.

2.46 An important dimension of enhanced public service was the mobilization of resources
for local authorities. PRSC-2 supported actions aimed at the rationalization of local
government taxes and levies. In the name of supporting private sector development the
government abolished ―nuisance taxes‖—small taxes levied by local government authorities
on the marketing of agriculture—in the 2002/03 budget, and introduced compensatory grants
to local government authorities to replace the lost revenue. However, the effectiveness of
these grants was undermined by: (i) delays and unpredictability in the flow of funds from the
Ministry of Finance; (ii) continued erosion of local governments‘ fiscal autonomy due to the
inadequacy of other revenue sources; (iii) the inability of councils to transfer a share of the
compensation grants to villages; and (iv) a weakened drive to strengthen good governance.

2.47 Did the results orientation of public service delivery improve with the better
availability of data on results and resource allocation? Where data was available at regular
intervals, as in health and education, government counterparts paid close attention and
focused on achieving quantitative objectives. The Poverty and Human Development Reports,
while far from perfect, were outcome-oriented served as important inputs to the dialogue on
general budget support. This was an important step toward orienting the development


                                              22
program to focus on results. Overall, there was important progress toward achieving
Objective 2, and while the results-orientation agenda is incomplete, efficacy of Bank
assistance is rated substantial.

OBJECTIVE 3. ENHANCING PUBLIC SECTOR PERFORMANCE

2.48 The objective to enhance public sector performance, minimize leakage, and
strengthen accountability was the centerpiece of the PRSC program. The PRSCs were
considered successor operations to the PFM Reform Program and the Public Service Reform
Program, which had previously been the primary focus of dialogue on these issues. It was
expected that measures in this area—concentrated on public financial management, civil
service pay, procurement, and decentralization—would enhance public sector capacity to
implement poverty reduction programs in the priority sectors and generate additional funds
for poverty reduction. The government, World Bank and other development partners
believed that strengthening the civil service and public financial management (including
procurement and decentralization) would benefit society by enabling better service delivery
and would be indispensable for the success of the budget-support strategy for delivering aid.

2.49 The available data indicate that there were good outcomes on the public sector
objectives, especially in policy areas for which the PRSC included prior actions to
supplement the dialogue, as elaborated below. Much of the progress in implementing reforms
was attributed by government officials and Bank staff to the open and intensive dialogue
surrounding the government-led preparation of the annual public expenditure review, as well
as the mutual trust that accompanied it.

2.50 Figure E summarizes trends in one measure of public sector performance, the
Worldwide Governance Indicators for government effectiveness, voice and accountability,
and control of corruption. These indicators are not ideal—ratings are based on perceptions
and normalized such that the global average is constant at zero—but they do show trends in
perceptions of governance relative to global changes.21 The indicators suggest an
improvement in the control of corruption and in voice and accountability, but not in
government effectiveness which was flat during the period.




21
  The Worldwide Governance Indicators aggregate scores from a number of primary sources on
governance—mostly surveys—and then compares each country‘s aggregate score for the year with
that of over one hundred other countries in the world. The indicator shows how many standard
deviations the country‘s score is above or below the mean for all countries. Tanzania, like most low-
income countries, is below the mean, so a less negative score indicates improvement. While giving a
good estimates and confidence intervals for a country‘s relative position in a given year, the WGI is
less useful for comparisons over time, because the changes result not only from changes in a
country‘s absolute performance, but also from changes in the primary indicators that are used in
calculating the country‘s raw score and from changes in the collection of comparator countries.

2.51 Prior actions with respect to public service performance were well-linked to the
desired outcomes, and implemented almost in their entirety. Public financial management
(PFM) was seen as the critical entry point, increasing transparency and leverage of reformers
in MoF to press for other reforms. Moreover, minimally acceptable PFM is considered a pre-
condition for provision of general budget support. Progress was made on most of the
components of the PFM Reform Program, particularly in areas supported by parallel
investment projects (such as the integrated financial management system, external resource
management, and procurement). The 2006 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability
Report (World Bank 2006b) observed that performance in Tanzania was stronger than the
average for East African comparators for cash management and policy-based budgeting, with
average performance in accounting and reporting, comprehensiveness and transparency,
procurement, and budget credibility. Although one cannot say definitively whether the
PRSCs led to the better performance or whether those issues were picked up in the PRSCs
because performance was good anyway, the PRSC series concentrated its triggers and prior
actions on these issues, and the dialogue and support can be plausibly linked to that
progress.22 On the other hand, fiduciary concerns—external scrutiny and auditing, which
were not in focus under the PRSC—got lower scores in the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA)23 ratings, while establishing the PFM Reform Program as a


22
   As noted in the PPAR on PRSCs 4-8, the core budget areas were not singled out as targets in the
second series, and the 2009 PEFA scores declined in all five. The revenue administration and
fiduciary areas, on the other hand, had triggers in the second series, and their PEFA scores all
improved from 2006 to 2009. Irish Aid and DFID (2011, p.36).

2.52 Civil service pay reform was part of a longer agenda that had included an earlier
phase of downsizing in the 1990s. That experience was deemed to have succeeded better
than in most countries (PER 2002; IEG 2008) largely because it came at a time when
privatization and private sector growth opened job opportunities in the private sector, while
inflation reduced the real value of public sector salaries, especially at the upper levels,
leading to loss of staff. In the 2000s, the remaining problems were the inadequate salaries at
upper levels to compete with the private labor market, the use of allowances to compensate
for this, and insufficient incentives for teachers and health specialists to work in under-served
areas. While the pay raises during PRSCs 1-3 met the triggers, they were not well targeted
and did not make progress on the difficult issues, which reflected a problem with program
design in terms of targeting.24 Rather than enhancing pay for positions that were most
difficult to fill, such as service-delivery personnel in remote areas, employees in Dar es
Salaam and other cities were permitted to access travel allowances that exceeded the cost of
travel. This was, in effect, a salary supplement. But it was concentrated among civil servants
with strong connections who were not on the front lines, and gave them incentive to travel
excessively away from their jobs (Twaweza, 2010).



with A‘s for advanced economies like Denmark and Chile, so a B or C is a good mark for a low-
income country.
24
   The program document for PRSC-3 noted: ―At present the gains made in reducing the number of
allowances at the beginning of the program seem to be eroding.‖ (World Bank, 2005, p. 37).


                                                                25
2.53 Procurement received substantial attention, with prior actions in PRSC-2 and 3.
PRSC-1 included an annex with the recommendations of the 2003 Country Procurement
Assessment Review, which were prepared ―in parallel‖ with the PRSC and found that
―procurement is a neglected function‖ by the government (Country Procurement Assessment
Review, 2003, p. 121). Procurement reform was necessary for reducing corruption and
generally for increasing the value for money in public investment, whose expansion the
PRSCs intended to finance. The main measure was the transfer of procurement activity from
a central tender board to ministries, agencies and local government, and the establishment of
a Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA). The PPRA would enforce regulations
and provide an independent check on the procuring entities, and reduce leakage of
government resources by providing a more competitive process. By 2006, the PEFA review
gave good marks for the improved set up of the procurement process, although there was not
a track record yet of implementation (implementation proceeded rapidly during the second
series, with the share of agencies complying with PPRA regulations reaching roughly 70
percent). The Auditor General‘s report on Central Government for 2006/07 also gave good
marks for procurement, but noted that ―justification for use of less competitive methods is
weak and is not yet routinely monitored,‖ an issue that still remains unresolved.

2.54 With regard to decentralization, PRSC-2 intended to support the strengthening of
capacity of the central administration to monitor activity by local governments and extending
decentralized procurement authority to local governments, in order to improve the
transparency and efficiency of the public sector.25 The central ministry charged with
oversight of local government authorities hired three staff and procured information
technology equipment in the central office and some regional offices to enhance the
monitoring function. The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority was intended to regulate
the local government tender boards. That approach did not, however, address the largest
areas of nominal sub-national spending—wages in education and health—as the local
governments had little discretion in these areas. As the program document for PRSC-2
(World Bank, 2004a, p. 40) noted, ―the lack of a clear and unified position with respect to
decentralization of human resources management raises concern.‖ This assessment concurs.
In PRSC-3 there were no triggers or prior actions for decentralization, but rather descriptions
of delays and vague plans to address the issue in the future. There were no specific indicators
identified to measure whether or not the decentralization and oversight measures specifically
improved public sector performance, but the very limited attention to the issue by the PRSC
to this objective suggests a modest contribution to achieving the objective.

2.55 Overall in the most important public service areas with Bank support, there were
performance improvements, and so efficacy is rated substantial.

OBJECTIVE 4: STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT

2.56 Tanzania faced a number of important environmental challenges at the outset of the
PRSC series. Chief among these were land degradation from human activity—including

25
  See, for instance, United Republic of Tanzania 2004b for the earliest Local Government Fiscal
Report in which the Prime Minister‘s Office-Regional and Local Governments monitors local
government budgets.


                                                26
deforestation, soil erosion, overgrazing, degradation of water resources, and loss of
biodiversity, which were aggravated by poor agricultural practices—and pollution from
improper treatment and disposal of solid and liquid wastes, especially in expanding urban
areas. These challenges cut across sectors, including energy and mining, forestry, agriculture,
and water and sanitation at a minimum, and the country lacked proper instruments to enforce
existing legislation and policies of central and local authorities, especially with respect to
resource management in agricultural and range land, forestry, wildlife, and minerals.

2.57 The Bank and government introduced a new objective under PRSC-2 to strengthen
environmental management because, it was asserted, the poor were heavily dependent on the
environment for both income generation and consumption.26 In addition, the cross-sectoral
nature of the challenge required a cross-ministry response in order to be effective. Neither the
Bank‘s PRSC, nor the government under the Performance Assessment Framework, identified
indicators to measure the achievement of this objective. The late introduction of the topic and
limited focus in the program suggest this was considered a lower-priority objective by the
government.

2.58 There were no triggers in the series directly related to the objective; rather the PRSC
used dialogue to support the government‘s efforts to address environmental issues identified
in the National Environmental Action Plan (1994) and the National Environmental Policy
(NEP) adopted in 1997. This was done through three approaches: (a) mainstreaming of
environmental concerns into the dialogue on poverty reduction through the budget process
and sectoral policy dialogue; (b) improving understanding of the poverty-environment
linkages in Tanzania; and (c) strengthening institutional capacity to integrate environmental
assessment procedures into sectoral strategies and policies.

2.59 In December 2002, the Cabinet approved an Institutional and Legal Framework for
Environmental Management Program, which provided the basis for Environmental Impact
Assessment, cross-sectoral coordination, and integration of environment management into
local government planning processes. A number of key sector policies and strategies in
forestry, agriculture, fisheries and mining that followed reflected an increasing focus on
internalizing environmental sustainability objectives and empowering the poor for improved
resource management.

2.60 During PRSC-1 and PRSC-2, the Bank undertook analytical work that identified
entry points for mainstreaming environmental issues into other activities, including an
environmental review of all taxes and levies associated with the agricultural sector (which
served as the basis for policy reforms of the crop boards), and increased attention to
removing land tenure uncertainties. During PRSC-3 the Bank supported an intensive
consultation process leading to the passage of the Environmental Management Act (EMA), a
new legal and institutional framework for environmental management.



26
  The mechanism for this dependence was not discussed in the program document, but the heavy
reliance of the poor on rain-fed agriculture and fishing for income and sustenance, and the economy‘s
dependence on natural resources was likely the source of this assertion.


                                                 27
2.61 The Bank provided capacity support to the Vice President‘s Office and the National
Environmental Management Council for the development and implementation of sector-
specific guidelines for environmental assessment in roads and agriculture, and pursued
procedures for strategic and sectoral environmental assessment. It also contributed to an
initial needs assessment for implementation of the EMA as part of the first public
expenditure review on environment. The production of a large number of key sector policies
and strategies in forestry, agriculture, fisheries and mining that followed reflected an
increasing focus on internalizing environmental management at the sectoral level as directed
by the EMA. But implementation of strategies remains weak because of the undeveloped
institutional structures and the lack of qualified personnel. In addition, Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA) training manuals and guidelines were prepared. Implementation of this
aspect of the EMA seems to have been effective, as the number of projects undergoing EIAs
that complied with the regulations increased from 8 in 2005/06 to 166 in 2010/11 (United
Republic of Tanzania 2011b) and the number of districts allocating budget to EMA
implementation rose from 0 in 2005 to 121 (out of 132) in 2009, according to the 2010 PAF.

2.62 The lack of pre-identified outcome indicators or reporting on environmental
outcomes, combined with the focus of the PRSC series on legislative and process reforms
through dialogue, makes assessment of development outcomes and attribution to Bank
support difficult. PRSC-2 specified five output indicators—the share of sectors with
environmental units, the share of districts that have officers with environmental functions, the
share of district-level environmental officers that have been trained, the share of districts with
committees of environment, and commencement of activities to implement 50 percent of
obligations under international environmental conventions and agreements—to monitor,
none of which was tracked, nor available in the field. Targets for three of these indicators
were reduced in the program document for PRSC-3 without explanation. For instance, the
target for the share of sectors with environmental units was reduced from 90 percent to 40
percent.

2.63 Because there are no measured outcomes from the support provided on environmental
issues under the PRSC series (in the absence of clear results framework), but some evidence
of increased attention to environmental management across local government authorities,
efficacy is rated modest.

Ratings
OUTCOME

2.64 The objectives of the series of PRSCs were relevant to the conditions in Tanzania,
particularly the primary focus on improving public sector performance, including issues of
public financial management, given the weak environment for development in the country.
The objectives were closely linked to both the Bank‘s and the government‘s development
strategies, and the circumstances of the country at the time. Objectives of the PRSC series are
substantially relevant.

2.65 The PRSCs for the most part identified important policy areas to achieve its
objectives. But for several objectives, it was not obvious that these policy changes would


                                               28
contribute much to the desired outcomes, with prior actions and proposed triggers often
preliminary in nature and unlikely to deliver results during the implementation period.
Moreover, the results framework was rudimentary, without a clear articulation of how
progress in adopting the proposed policy measures would help to achieve the program‘s
objectives and without consistent outcome indicators for each operation and for the overall
series. Relevance of design is rated modest.

2.66 The PRSCs had a mixed result in terms of the achievement of the four key
objectives of the program. On sustaining and accelerating economic growth and broadening
its impact, efficacy was modest because poverty reduction was slow and the PRSCs did not
directly contribute to robust growth. On supporting results orientation of public service
delivery, efficacy was substantial because there was more focus on poverty reduction in the
joint donor performance assessment framework, greater availability of data on health and
education outcomes, and a more systematic sector-level planning process, but there was also
great variability in the quality of data on other government services and attention remained
focus on monitoring budget allocations to priority sectors rather than measuring outcomes.
Efficacy for improving public service performance, the primary focus of the series, was
substantial. Outcomes on public financial management were strong in almost every area,
with the exception of procurement (which improved following reforms under the program),
audit (not a focus of the program), and tax collection (also not a focus of the program), while
ratings on transparency and anti-corruption improved and outcomes for managing
decentralization services were weak. On strengthening environmental management, efficacy
was modest—little could be attributed to Bank support as its role was primarily in bringing
the issue into the dialogue with development partners and no data on outcomes were
available.

2.67 How far would Tanzania have gone in achieving its objectives without the PRSCs?
The intense public expenditure review dialogue and careful macroeconomic management, to
which the PRSC was a direct contributor, contributed to the stabilization and acceleration of
growth. Public sector performance improved as a result of improved budget execution and
public financial management, although later improvements from procurement reforms may
have been achieved on a slower track if addressed sector-by-sector. Tanzania‘s IDA envelope
would have otherwise been committed through investment loans. While implementation of
investment projects may have delivered important development outcomes at the sector level,
they would be unlikely to achieve the public sector performance results of the PRSCs, most
of which required national level dialogue with government officials holding a cross-sectoral
perspective.

2.68 Overall, the outcome of PRSCs 1-3 is moderately satisfactory. Table 2-3 summarizes
the subcomponents of the rating. In the face of mixed ratings on both the series‘ relevance
and its achievement of objectives, the overall rating falls above-the-line at moderately
satisfactory for two reasons. First, the program‘s design was modest in its relevance, but
introduced without the benefit of the current Bank guidelines, which were put into effect in
late 2004. Moreover, the relevance of design improved over time and maximized continuity
with the previous two adjustment credits. Second, the third objective—improving public
sector performance—is assigned the greatest weight, given its prominence in the program
design and dialogue, and the Bank‘s role as the primary development partner focusing on
these issues, while the fourth objective—strengthening environmental management—is
assigned the least weight due to its limited emphasis in the PRSC design, dialogue with
government, and the government‘s program.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

2.69 At the time the PRSC series closed, the primary risks to development outcomes of
PRSCs 1-3 were internal, and related to government ownership and a strong participatory
framework. Many of the cross-cutting reforms were yet to have been fully implemented
throughout government. If ownership were to fray or the broad-based participatory oversight
(through technical committees and sector working groups) were to diminish in importance
and critical actions to implement difficult policy reforms were to be abandoned, outcomes
would be at serious risk. At the close of the series, the government‘s commitment appeared
to be secure, although a change in Administration, and the movement of key reformers within
government has coincided with a lesser focus on the reform agenda since that time.
Development partner participation remained strong, and the broad-based participatory
process in formulating the government program was likely to continue.

2.70 In the event, participatory oversight has continued apace but broad government
ownership has since deteriorated, as the next phases of many reforms have been delayed and
commitment to macroeconomic stability has frayed. Shortcomings of the first series on
public financial management, such as inadequate reporting by local governments, was not
taken up in the second series. An additional important risk was the limited capacity of
government in policy and planning, which could undermine complex policy formulation and
implementation as the reform process moves to a higher order. Assessment by the GBS
partners (DAIMA and ODI, 2004) noted that some key senior policy staff lacked strong
institutional and technical backing, and were swamped by administrative tasks. This risk is
more likely to affect outcomes in the future, and is of particular concern because many of the
achievements came short of implementation.

2.71 One external risk to development outcome was the government's continued heavy
dependence on external resources to finance the reform effort. During 2003-05, while total
government expenditures increased from 22 percent to 28.4 percent of GDP, the total
revenues only increased from 12.7 percent to 14.2 percent, and much of the growth during
the period could be attributed to government consumption fuelled by external support. Were
the flow of concessional finance to slow, weak domestic revenue mobilization would likely
slow down the reform effort, an issue that would become increasingly constraining if policy


                                              30
performance were to falter. Since the series of operations closed, after rising to 15.6 percent
of GDP in 2008/09, revenue fell again to 14.6 percent in 2009/10 (IMF 2011). At the same
time, the scale of international budget support is tightening as a response to weakening
commitment to reforms, but domestic revenue cannot yet fill this gap.

2.72      Overall, risk to development outcomes is significant.

BANK PERFORMANCE

2.73 Quality at Entry was moderately satisfactory. The framework adopted under PRSCs
1-3 was tightly aligned with the government‘s development framework as outlined in the
PRSP. The focus on macroeconomic and cross-cutting governance issues was strategically
relevant. The existing dialogue surrounding the joint authorship of annual public expenditure
reviews served as an important jumping-off point for the series. Developing a reform
program based on a harmonized framework with government and other development partners
also meant dealing with trade-offs with respect to what to include and what to exclude. On
the whole, the Bank made strategically relevant choices of policies to support, focusing on
issues that were the most important for income and non-income poverty reduction—
agriculture and rural development, private sector development, public finance management
and service delivery. The PRSCs were sometimes used opportunistically—elevating
important reforms to the national dialogue if they stalled at the sector level. The weakest
aspect of the program with respect to quality at entry was the results framework, which was
poorly developed and had negligible value for monitoring progress of the program.

2.74 Program design incorporated lessons learned in the design and implementation of
support under the SAC and PSAC. Three were relevant to the PRSC. First, it was suggested
that forging a strong working relationship with the government and supporting capacity
building could lead to successful implementation of an operation that is broad in scope and
complexity (internal Bank evaluations). Second, promoting government ownership and using
national systems where possible could facilitate implementation performance and efficiency
(consensus under Paris Declaration). Third, monitoring and evaluation aided by quantitative
performance indicators could help identify the impact of programs and promote
accountability (internal Bank evaluations).27 In this respect, significant design characteristics
of the PRSCs included: (i) the adoption of an annual single tranche, ex-post framework that
assured the predictability of resource flow to government budget linked to prior actions;28
(ii) support for a coherent policy dialogue across sectors through the budget framework,
thereby avoiding fragmentation of assistance to critical sectors; and (iii) efficiency in policy
dialogue and performance assessment by aligning with other development partners in the use
of a common performance assessment framework (PAF). This design does involve a
potential trade-off between resource flow predictability and adjusting the credit commitment



27
     See also, IEG‘s review of PRSCs (IEG, 2010).
28
  The PRSC design (unlike that of the SAC) limited the number and scope of conditions (triggers and
prior actions, thereby helping to ensure that the actions were manageable prior to approval by the
Bank‘s Board.


                                                    31
in an event of failure to implement triggers for the subsequent operation, an issue that
became problematic later in the second PRSC series.

2.75 The design of PRSCs 1-3 was consistent with the harmonized support mechanism of
the poverty reduction budget support (PRBS), which initially had nine donor partners and
later became the general budget support (GBS) group.29 GBS was guided by the
government‘s PRSP, and aimed to provide a coherent policy dialogue at cross-cutting levels
and in sector wide programs, efficiency in policy dialogue and performance assessment, and
enhanced flexibility and predictability of resource flows (ODI and DAL 2005). Even so, the
Bank was able to inject critical issues—such as environmental sustainability—into the
dialogue that did not receive much attention in the PRSP. The development partners used a
common performance assessment framework (PAF). The PRSC review process was thus
conducted in the context of the annual review process of the PRBS, which involved a mid-
term review around March-April and an annual review in October, and included inputs from
various parts of government, civil society and the PRBS development partners.

2.76 The program was built on the analytic and participatory work that went into the
development of the PRSP, which included the Bank‘s April 2001 Country Economic
Memorandum, May 2001 Country Financial Accountability Assessment and April 2003
Country Procurement Assessment Review. There was also significant cooperation with other
development partners as discussed in the first chapter, including through the shared use of a
Performance Assessment Framework as well as co-financing from the German government
through KfW.

2.77 Quality of supervision was moderately satisfactory. Formally, there were two
supervision missions per year for each PRSC, but implementation support was intensive and
ongoing, delivered primarily through regular consultations surrounding preparation of annual
PERs. The Performance Assessment Framework served to coordinate general budget support
across multiple donors. On public sector reform issues, supervision of the PRSCs was closely
linked with supervision of related investment loans for public finance management reform,
public service reform, and local government reform. Some delays occurred in the
implementation of PRSC-3 (especially with respect to the reforms of the commodity boards),
but they reflected an underestimation on the part of Bank staff of the strong interests opposed
to reform and the time required to reach consensus. Although data on supervision are not
readily available, Bank staff total time (preparation and supervision) devoted to each PRSC
declined from 120 staff weeks for PRSC-1 to 104 staff weeks for PRSC-3. The Bank should
have, however, adapted the programs to better monitor and evaluate progress over time: the
results framework should have been overhauled to better link policy actions and outputs to
intermediate and final outcomes.

2.78 Overall, the preparatory work for the PRSC, underpinned by analytical work by the
Bank and supervision both by the substantial Bank team in the country office and staff in

29
  The PRSC series was the first policy lending instrument by IDA for Tanzania that was fully
integrated into the harmonized donor support mechanism (World Bank, 2007). The PAF was
expanded considerably to accommodate the Bank‘s priorities under PRSC-1 (Overseas Development
Institute and Daima Associates 2005).


                                               32
Washington assured a rating of moderately satisfactory for Bank performance, despite a
weak results framework.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

2.79 Government performance: The Ministry of Finance played a coordinating role and
served, along with the Office of the Vice-President and the Prime Minister‘s Office as the
key central agencies in driving the PRSC process in Tanzania. A small but strong network of
highly-committed reformers in these departments provided leadership in both the formulation
and the implementation of policy actions included in the PRSC through the intensely
collaborative annual public expenditure reviews30. They guided the harmonization of support
from development partners and facilitated the establishment of a common framework
through the PAF. Government ownership of the program and its commitment to the joint
PRBS process was also a key factor ensuring prompt implementation. When delays in
implementation of policy actions occurred, as under PRSC-2, the government, under
leadership of the Ministry of Finance, took swift action to bring back the program on track.
The performance of the central agencies was satisfactory.

2.80 Implementing agencies: The Ministry of Finance also led implementation, but with
support from several line ministries. These agencies worked in the context of sector working
groups to hash out policy issues and to monitor implementation. Sector policies were decided
upon at the technical committees, which were instrumental in generating indicators and
assessing progress. But because monitoring was weak and there were delays in implementing
reforms in the agriculture sector in part due to a lack of ownership, the performance of
implementing agencies is rated moderately satisfactory.

2.81 Overall, the performance of both the central agencies, spearhead by the Ministry of
Finance, and the implementing MDAs is rated moderately satisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.82 Design: There was no clear M&E framework at the outset of PRSC-1, nor were any
key indicators identified. As part of the agreement under the multi-donor framework, the
Bank waited on the framework being developed by the government and its development
partners, with significant Bank input. The follow-up PRSC-2 and 3 in the series only
included a rudimentary results framework, with virtually no consistent monitoring indicators
for each operation and for the overall series, while the PAF was too complex to monitor
effectively.

2.83 Implementation: The monitoring for the three PRSCs was conducted in the context
of the yearly PER process and joint GBS Annual Review, and a poverty monitoring system
that regularly reported on the implementation of the PRS through yearly Poverty and Human
Development Reports. Many of the indicators specified in the PAF were collected, but the
data often lacked relevance for the PRSC. No doubt implementation was hampered by the


30
     The joint Bank and Ministry of Finance team working on the PERs met on a bi-weekly basis.


                                                  33
poor and changing M&E design, but nevertheless, there was not a clear set of data collected
or presented in the program documents or Implementation Completion and Results report.

2.84 Utilization: Due to the infrequent availability of outcome data, the system was
focused on inputs and outputs (meeting budget targets for social sectors, etc.). The program
was not adjusted in response to the availability of information generated by M&E.

2.85 The PRSC results framework was rudimentary and although it evolved over the
course of implementation and with increasing assistance and involvement of the development
partners, it was still inadequate for tracking program implementation, especially with respect
to evaluating development outcomes. The quality of the M&E system for the series was
negligible.


3. Series 2: PRSC 4-8
Objectives, Design, and Relevance
3.1     Objectives. The program document of PRSC-4 (World Bank 2006) did not state the
series‘ objectives explicitly, but it noted that the proposed operation was the first in a series
of five annual operations to support the implementation of MKUKUTA, implicitly adopting
its objectives. In this respect, the objectives of the series were identical to the pillars of the
MKUKUTA:

       accelerate growth and the reduce income poverty;
       improve quality of life and social well being; and
       improve governance and accountability.

3.2     Beginning with PRSC-6, the Bank program articulated the objectives of the PRSC
series as ―(i) sustaining high and shared economic growth, and (ii) expanding the effective
delivery of basic services through the government budget.‖ The first of these is roughly
equivalent to the first pillar of MKUKUTA. The second of these is intermediate in nature,
and intended to support the second and third pillars of MKUKUTA. Given this restatement
serves as an output-oriented consolidation of the original more outcome-focused
MKUKUTA objectives, this evaluation takes the earlier formulation as the program
objectives for assessment.

3.3      The program did not distinguish between the objectives of individual operations and
those of the full series. That said, the emphasis of the operations changed over time. There
was an initial focus on core cross-cutting issues around budget execution and public sector
reform, as well as agriculture and rural development. The program document for PRSC-6,
after a change in team and country leadership, emphasized a shift to focusing on agriculture
and rural development and private sector development, seeing these as the binding
constraints to poverty reduction. But in practice, policy areas in infrastructure were
introduced at this time, and agriculture and private sector development all but disappeared as
part of the program.



                                                34
3.4     Relevance of objectives. The second PRSC series (PRSCs 4-8 covering the period
2006-2010) was deeply grounded in Tanzania‘s National Strategy for Growth and Reduction
of Poverty (NSGRP, 2005-2010, more commonly referred to by its Kiswahili acronym,
MKUKUTA). It was equally linked to the Bank‘s country assistance strategy (CAS) (World
Bank, 2007a) covering 2007-2011, which by that time, because of the evolving donor
alignment, was an annex to the broader Joint Assistant Strategy for Tanzania. Like
MKUKUTA, the CAS was focused on providing support for growth and reduction of income
poverty as well as supporting improvement of quality of life, social well-being, and
governance and accountability, and included four pillars: (i) private sector and infrastructure
development, to support the government‘s objective of making the private sector the engine
of growth; (ii) sustainable rural development, to improve the livelihood of most of the poor,
who live in rural areas; (iii) improved social infrastructure, to facilitate improvement in social
indicators through enhancement in the access to essential public services by the poor; and
(iv) public service reform and institution building, to increase the effectiveness of public
service delivery and improved governance.

3.5     In addition to consistency with MKUKUTA and the CAS, the objectives of the PRSC
series corresponded with the multi-donor performance assessment framework (PAF)31 built
around the MKUKUTA. The program‘s objectives were not articulated to specify its area of
focus within the government program. This distinction would have facilitated greater focus
on the Bank‘s contribution to such a broad program. Moreover, carefully defined objectives
could have helped to guide the reform program as circumstances changed, a particularly
important issue in Tanzania due to the unusually long duration of the series. Relevance of
objectives is rated substantial.

3.6     Design. The series was initiated in the context of a global push, with the Bank‘s
commitment at the highest level, for stronger aid coordination and country ownership of
development programs. This agenda, which was articulated as the 2005 Paris Declaration,
directly shaped the program, as was the case in many other PRSC programs.32 Indeed, the
Bank and other partners articulated a desire to increase general budget support to gradually
become the primary vehicle for resource transfer to Tanzania, maximizing country ownership
over the use of resources. Moreover, development partners adopted a joint strategy partway
through the series, with the government‘s development strategy as its core.

3.7      The PRSC design evolved during its implementation, as new policy areas were added
over time. Initially, in service of the first objective, the program included macroeconomic
stability and debt management, improving the business environment, and agriculture and
rural development as policy areas. Transport and energy were added under PRSC-6, and
31
  The revised framework of the PRSC and the PAF responded to the recommendations of the 2004
annual review of the PRBS/PRSC, which emphasized the application of the principles of the Paris
Declaration.
32
  IEG‘s evaluation of PRSC experience [IEG, 2010] finds evidence that overall the PRSC instrument
served to strengthen country ownership, shifted the focus of operations towards public management
reforms, eased conditionality, and provided more predictable funding. However, in several countries
there were challenges to donor harmonization, and little evidence of success of pro-poor service
delivery.


                                                35
natural resources was added under PRSC-7. Under the second objective, the PRSCs included
health, education, and water as policy areas from the outset. Under the third objective, public
sector reform was the policy area, and it included issues of procurement, auditing, civil
service pay, budgeting, and core public financial management.

3.8     Policy areas were derived from the dialogue emanating from the MKUKUTA and
were primarily intended to catalyze policy reform in the specific sectors, particularly those
that had stalled in the course of sector-specific dialogue. An exception was in health,
education, and water. In these policy areas, the program did not promote particular policy
changes, but rather provided support for an incipient process meant to build up and
strengthen the policy dialogue in those sectors, and monitor results. It helped to introduce
annual sector reviews in education and water, following the model in health that was already
well-established.

3.9     The program was backed by Tanzania‘s comprehensive monitoring system, designed
with input by both government and development partners, which covered outcome, output,
process, and input indicators. The structure comprised three interrelated tiers: (a) The
MKUKUTA monitoring system, which focused on the measurement of impact, outcomes,
and proxy indicators; (b) the sector programs, such as those for education and health, which
focused on the tracking of output indicators in the context of ongoing projects/programs
under implementation; and (c) the PER/MTEF processes, which focused on inputs, with
emphasis on budget allocation and budget execution. In order to strengthen domestic
accountability and facilitate participation, the PRSC also supported regular reporting to the
public in all areas under its scope.

3.10 The program made several different, and not always consistent, attempts to link
program activities to final outcomes. Because the initial program documents did not
sufficiently map out the chain leading to desired results, the program document for PRSC-
6—after two full years of implementation— introduced ―outcome areas‖ with associated
indicators and targets that were directly mapped to the three MKUKUTA program
objectives. This was too late in the process to drive the Bank‘s agenda. Program documents
for PRSC-7 introduced another framework for this linkage, mapping seven ―operational
policy areas‖ to the two restated objectives. The program document for PRSC-8 maintained
this terminology, but re-stated and expanded upon the operational policy areas. Finally, the
Implementation Completion and Results Report—the Bank‘s self-evaluation—reformulated
the MKUKUTA objectives as program objectives (―PDO 1: Reduce income poverty . . . PDO
2: Improve key human development objectives . . . PDO3: Improve the capacity of the
government to design and implement development policies in a transparent and efficient
manner‖), and adopted the outcome areas identified beginning with PRSC-6 to help assess
the program‘s achievements.

3.11 There were some clear shortcomings in the program design. First, the sectoral scope
of the series was too wide-ranging and lacked clear prioritization. The triggers and prior
actions associated with the PRSCs covered almost all the policy areas highlighted in the
MKUKUTA. Rather than selected to jointly form a single coherent program focused on
achieving realistic goals, many of these policy actions were selected to fill gaps when the
reform dialogue at the sector level stalled, and were not always drawn from the joint

Performance Assessment Framework.33 Second, as with the first series of PRSCs, a workable
results framework was only fully developed by the third operation of the series despite the
specification of a variety of indicators previously. This results framework, though not
repeated in the program documents for later operations in the series and so not entrenched in
the ongoing monitoring of the program, was more manageable than in the first series,
identifying intermediate indicators and attempting to link planned policy actions to expected
outcomes. Third, the PRSCs—and the broader general budget support—failed to address
directly the decentralization program, even though the program maintained service delivery
objectives and local governments were expected to take on many aspects of that agenda. This
agenda was largely pursued through a Bank-financed local government support project,
without linkage to the PRSCs. Finally, the dropping and dilution of many triggers during the
course of implementation points to a poor assessment of government commitment to
implement the planned reforms at the preparation stage of each operation.

3.12   Relevance of design is rated modest.

Implementation
3.13 The second PRSC series included 5 operations, associated with total financing
equivalent of USD 1,025 million during 2006-11, including supplemental financing to
PRSC-7 in response to the global financial crisis. Table 3-1 outlines the timing, approval and
closing modalities associated with the five operations. The size of PRSC-5 and of PRSC-7
was reduced by USD10 million each due to the fact that critical triggers were not met. PRSC-
8 was far smaller than anticipated in the CAS and less than the other operations in response
to cumulative delays in the reform progress. Overall, IDA commitments for PRSC-4-8 were
lower than anticipated in the 2002 and 2007 CASs by approximately USD 315 million, even
including the unanticipated Supplemental Credit, because of the shortfalls in policy
implementation on the part of the government. The 2007 CAS envisaged an increase in
PRSC commitment from about USD190 million in 2006/07 to as much as USD400 million in
2009/10, with the expectation that, as the government‘s policy dialogue with the Bank and
other development partners matured, the PRSCs would eventually replace investment
lending in several sectors, for example health, education, water, and agriculture. But this
vision of the PRSC was moderated when GBS was no longer seen by the Bank and other
development partners to be effective as the primary vehicle for resource transfer to the
government.

  The Bank team reports that some triggers were chosen outside the PAF because the formulation in
the PAF was not suitable to be monitored as a trigger.

3.14 Triggers and prior actions constituted the main architecture for ensuring consistency
between policy dialogue and implementation. There were numerous slippages in the
government‘s compliance with the triggers of the PRSC 4-8 series and this progressively
deteriorated over the course of the program (Table 3-2). The difficulties in meeting the
triggers cut across the three objectives of the program. For example, 16 of the 22 triggers
under the first objective of growth and the reduction of income poverty, 8 of the 11 triggers
for the second objective to improve the quality of life and social well-being, and 13 of the 19
triggers for the third objective of governance and accountability, were fully completed.
Implementation difficulties with triggers associated with agriculture and public financial
management were particularly prominent, especially after PRSC-6.

3.15    In addition to Bank financing, thirteen donors (African Development Bank,
European Union, Canada, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, Norway,
Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and DFID) also provided budget support in the context of the
GBS framework initiated at the beginning of the PRSC program, which included a
Partnership Framework Memorandum, a Performance Assessment Framework (PAF), and an
agreed Joint Review Process. Disbursement from the GBS increased from USD 393 million
in 2005/06 to a high of USD 918 million in 2009/10, before dropping to USD 616 million in
2010/2011 (Development Partner Group 2011b).


                                                              38
3.16 Supervision and preparation of the subsequent PRSC credits and grants took place in
close collaboration with other donors (GBS partners, the IMF and the African Development
Bank) and was consistent with the MKUKUTA review mechanism. This involved the use of
the PAF (or results matrix) defined by the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) framework of
the MKUKUTA.34 Little progress was made in strengthening Tanzania‘s routine data system
under the first PRSC series, which required sustained attention. The new Performance
Assessment Framework defined for PRSC 4-8 differed significantly from the previous one.35
It covered six focus areas: the three pillars or clusters of the MKUKUTA, macroeconomic
stability, resource allocation and budget consistency, and public financial management. The
PAF was supportive of the outcome orientation of the MKUKUTA and of domestic
processes by focusing primarily on defining a small number of indicators that allowed for an
assessment of overall progress and the definition of local processes, which was central to the
Joint Assistance Strategy for Tanzania between the GBS partners and the government.
Overall, while the M&E system for the MKUKUTA was elaborate, it produced M&E outputs
of uneven relevance. The system also suffered from the unavailability or low frequency
and/or quality of some of the critical outcome indicators, such as poverty estimates, access to
infrastructure, or learning achievements.

3.17 Sectoral and thematic reviews preceded and fed directly into the GBS Annual
Review, which provided two inputs to the budget guidelines process. First, it provided
feedback from GBS donors on strategic issues for consideration in the budget guidelines
process. Second, it provided a firm commitment of the amount of GBS for the next fiscal
year to allow government to prepare its budget within a relatively stable and firm external
financing framework.36

3.18 Partway through the series, trust between the Bank and government counterparts
began to erode, according to multiple interviews. This trust had been built prior to and during
the first PRSC series on a technocratic level, through intensive collaboration surrounding
preparation of the jointly-produced annual public expenditure reviews. But when the process
for preparing PERs receded as the primary entry point for dialogue, replaced by the GBS
Annual Review, this technocratic basis for collaboration was removed. As key reformers in
government with whom the Bank had built trust moved on to new posts, there was no longer
a solid foundation through which to build a common understanding on a technocratic basis
going forward. The Bank reports that as part of a third PRSC series, the process for preparing
PERs was revamped, and now is more demand driven with a group of champions for reform
in the government.


34
  For most of the program areas, supervision and dialogue were carried out on a continuous basis in
the context of sectoral or thematic programs. This included the PER process, the PFMRP, the
MKUKUTA, the Agriculture Sector Development Program, the Business Environment Strengthening
in Tanzania program and sectoral programs.
35
  In the 2004 annual review o f the PRBS/PRSC it was decided to start work on a new PAF and a
redesign of the PRBS (DAIMA and ODI, 2004).
36
 As noted above, the Bank disbursed USD 10 million less than its commitment for both PRSC-5 and
PRSC-7.

Achievement of the Objectives
3.19 As first articulated in the program document for PRSC-6, there were six primary
indicators to measure progress against the three program objectives, as summarized in Table
3.3. None of the targets for these six indicators was fully met, although two were nearly met.

a/ The only key indicator identified for growth and reduction of income poverty was related to rural income poverty. In the event, economic
growth was strong through the period, never dipping below 6 percent per annum.
b/ Governance and accountability indicators are from the Worldwide Governance Indicators, which combine the views of enterprise,
citizen, and expert survey respondents in industrial and developing economies to measure governance performance on a comparative
basis, with an average worldwide score of zero and ratings ranging from -2.5 to +2.5, Standard errors for the 2010 measurements are
0.11, 0.16, and 0.17 respectively.


3.20 Analysis on the achievement of each objective follows, with greater detail provided in
Annex D.

OBJECTIVE 1: GROWTH AND REDUCTION OF INCOME POVERTY

3.21 The sole outcome indicator identified in project documents for this objective was to
reduce the rural poverty headcount. Economic growth remained strong throughout the period,
never dipping below 6 percent per annum even in the face of the global financial crisis. The
latest reliable data available for income poverty are from 2007.37 They show little change in
the poverty headcount and a very low elasticity of poverty to GDP growth. The components
of the country‘s growth have not changed appreciably since 2007, and so a sharp reduction in
income poverty since then is highly unlikely to have occurred. An alternative measure of
poverty, the multi-dimensional poverty index constructed for the United Nations
Development Programme‘s Human Development Report, showed gains in all three
components of the index—health, education, and standard of living—and a 4.1% annual
reduction in the poverty rate between 2008 and 2010 (Alkire and Roche 2013).

3.22 The program document for PRSC-6 also identified three outcome areas, each with
associated indicators:
37
  The government introduced a panel survey instrument, but its limited design makes it unable to
accurately measure poverty trends.


                                                                   40

      Increased access of private sector to key inputs, in particular credit and backbone
       services (electricity, roads, information and communication technologies).
      Improved livelihoods in rural areas, where the majority of the poor work, through
       improved agricultural policies and expansion of rural infrastructure.

PRSC-6 introduced these outcome areas to define the Bank‘s objective better. This section
addresses these outcome areas in turn, considering the PRSC‘s contribution to progress made
on the reform agenda intended to improve these outcomes

3.23 Progress in the three outcome areas were likely to contribute to growth and poverty
reduction. A strong macroeconomic framework in the late 1990s and early 2000s provided
the stability necessary for economic growth. Studies have concluded that growth would have
been faster had not poor infrastructure—particularly an unreliable electricity supply and poor
transport facilities—constituted a significant barrier (see for instance Millennium Challenge
Corporation 2011 and Shkaratan 2010). And the vast majority of the poor live in rural areas,
meaning that improving livelihoods there could directly reduce income poverty.

3.24 However, progress in each of these outcome areas was modest. The macroeconomic
environment deteriorated and the business environment did not show signs of improvement.
Private sector access to key inputs, including electricity and credit, did improve, but by less
than had been anticipated. In rural areas, agricultural growth was weak and development of
rural infrastructure was limited.

3.25     Improving the business environment by maintaining a conducive macroeconomic
framework and reducing administrative barriers. The PRSC focus regarding macroeconomic
stability was on strengthening public expenditure management. Broad macroeconomic
indicators were chosen to measure progress—the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP and
the rate of inflation. The fiscal deficit remained below 5 percent until 2008/09, when it rose
above its target level due to poor revenue performance, a surge in discretionary spending, and
the fiscal stimulus put in place to withstand the global crisis (as advised by the Bank and
development partners). The balance dipped to 5 percent again in 2011/12 (IMF 2013). This
counter-cyclical policy was appropriate. By 2011, Tanzania‘s debt to GDP ratio was close to
40 percent, up from the lowest level of around 25 percent on the onset of the program in
2005. Both revenue and expenditure performance led to higher than expected accumulation
of debt. The tax revenue to GDP ratio was flat since 2007, and there was a rapid increase in
expenditures unrelated to the fiscal stimulus following the crisis. Inflation accelerated, driven
in part by global food and fuel price spikes, reaching into double digits by the end of the
period, and persisting since.

3.26 Regarding the business environment, there were a number of outstanding issues
from the first PRSC series. These included formulating a private sector development strategy,
a second phase of labor legislation, and improving the investment climate.

3.27 The program document identified improvement in Tanzania‘s Doing Business
ranking as the outcome indicator, with a MKUKUTA target value of 99 (and a PRSC target


                                               41
of 130) compared to the baseline of 136. This indicator is inherently weak—rankings are
relative to performance in other countries, data are revised frequently, conclusions are
sometimes based on interviews with only a few informants, and many indicators measure the
business environment de jure rather than de facto. The MKUKUTA target was not met—
overall improvement in the Doing Business indicator under the second series of PRSCs was
insignificant—although the much more modest PRSC objective was achieved. Tanzania‘s
ranking remains poor even by regional standards, suggesting the PRSC target was much too
modest.

3.28 There was progress on an absolute scale for some of the sub-indicators, notably for
the indicator of the cost of starting a business (down from 187 percent of per capita GDP in
2005 to 37 percent in 2010) and trading across borders, both in terms of number of
documents and number of days needed for transactions. For imports the number of
documents was reduced from 16 in 2005 to 7 in 2010, and the number of days was reduced
from 51 to 31. For exports the number of days was reduced from 30 to 24. There was,
however, deterioration for other sub-indicators, including the number of days required for
getting construction permits that increased from 276 to 303 days, and the cost of getting a
construction permit that increased from around 100 percent of per capita GDP in 2005 to
around 1,200 percent in 2010.

3.29 The Bank‘s program missed the opportunity to be shaped by the 2006 Investment
Climate Assessment, whose findings were released only in 2009. The implementation of
private sector development reforms under PRSC4-8 was slow and faded out after the
relatively easy low-cost reforms—removal of local fees for businesses—were picked up
through PRSC-5. The limited gains from these early reforms proved to be difficult to
maintain because the losses to local jurisdiction due to elimination of fees and taxes were not
properly compensated for, leading to a conflict between local authorities and the reform
agenda. Indeed, government informants indicated these legal changes were to be reversed.
The complexity arising from the heavy legacy of over-regulating and overtaxing regulatory
institutions that were present in Tanzania for the past decades was not properly taken into
account in the design.

3.30 The preparation of a private sector development strategy was never completed, and
the second phase of labor legislation that was also expected to be part of the policy dialogue
was delayed. The Business Activities Registration Act was adopted by Parliament, allowing
two of the three triggers in this policy area to be converted to prior action. But the
government could not reach political consensus regarding the direction of reforms in business
regulation, perhaps due to the lack of a reform champion, and thereafter commitment to the
program waned. This circumstance precluded the newly adopted law from becoming an
effective legislative framework and translating the system into a one-stop-shop for business
registration, the end-goal output for support in this area. As such, the final trigger was
dropped, and PRSC-7 was reduced in size by USD 10 million. Despite the purported
emphasis on this policy area in early program documents, no additional triggers were
considered in private sector development. A parallel investment project—the USD95 million
Private Sector Competitiveness Project launched in 2006—appears to have yielded limited
results in part due to the slow progress of PRSC-supported reforms.



                                              42
3.31 Increased access of private sector to key inputs, in particular credit and ‗backbone‘
services. The second outcome area for the objective of growth and reduction of income
poverty covers the program‘s contributions to energy and transport sectors.

3.32 A reliable and affordable supply of electricity was considered essential by the
MKUKUTA for economic growth and poverty reduction in Tanzania. The PRSC, as
articulated in the program document for PRSC-5, sought to help the government improve
access to electricity for the private sector, reduce vulnerability of the sector to climatic
conditions, achieve greater installed capacity, and help Tanzania Electric Supply Company
(TANESCO) to achieve full cost recovery. The PRSC included three relatively vague
triggers in the energy sector, which were focused on achieving financial recovery for
TANESCO. In parallel, three investment projects complemented the PRSC by financing the
expansion of generation capacity and provide emergency power to avert prolonged periods of
load-shedding. All three triggers and associated prior actions were considered completed on
time.

3.33 There was a mixed record during the period. On the positive side, Tanzania was able
to expand generating capacity and reduce reliance on hydro power. Capacity increased from
980 MW in 2007 to 1072 MW in 2010 (short of the MKUKUTA target of 1278 MW), and
1309 MW in 2012. The share of population with access to grid and non-grid sources of
electricity increased from a range of 8.1 to 11.3 percent in 2005 to a range of 10.1 to 14.2
percent in 2010, depending the assumptions you make on the number of people per
household (it should also be noted that it is assumed that all access points are functional once
they are constructed). On the negative side, the tariffs that can be charged by TANESCO are
far below costs for renting much of the recently added additional capacity, making full cost
recovery impossible. With regard to availability of the power supply,38 TANESCO data
indicate a modest improvement in the duration of outages, but this has not been accompanied
by reductions in frequency. The burden of power outages on the economy is estimated to
have been as high as 4 percent of GDP (World Bank 2010).

3.34 Efforts to improve the autonomy of TANESCO yielded limited results. Stakeholders
perceive TANESCO‘s commercial focus to have improved substantially, but still far short of
that to be expected from a private commercial entity. Collection improved and the new
regulator approved tariff increases, bringing them more in line with costs. But transmission
and distribution losses remained high, rising from 21.0 percent in 2007 to 23.3 percent in
2010, and tariffs have not risen fast enough for TANESCO to achieve operational cost
recovery by 2010 as targeted by PRSC-8. Indeed, as the unit cost of energy has increased, so
has TANESCO‘s operational losses since 2010 (IMF 2013). The Energy and Water Utility
Regulatory Authority is seen by stakeholders to have relatively strong capacity to monitor the
industry, and was named best regulator in 2010 in a study commissioned by the Africa
Forum for Utility Regulators, but it was unable to fully enforce rules for competitive
procurement and reported that TANESCO‘s cost of providing power was higher than it
would have been without sole source selection.


38
  The Bank considered capacity utilization, which improved from 62% to 85%, as the indicator for
power availability but this was an inappropriate indicator.


                                                43
3.35 In the transport sector, the focus of the PRSCs was on improving the condition of
the road network, and later, port efficiency. Prior actions covered four areas: enactment of
the Roads Act; development of a Transport Sector Investment Plan (TSIP) with adequate
provision for maintenance; adoption of a framework for public-private-partnership (PPP);
and actions to reduce port congestion. These were intended to strengthen the institutional and
policy framework for the transport sector, prioritize investment and maintenance spending,
and reduce transport costs for the private sector.

3.36 Improvement in the condition of national and regional roads was far short of the
target through 2010, with the share of national and regional roads in good condition rising
from 47 percent in 2005 to 53 percent in 2009/10 (against a target of 75 percent), and no
change in those in fair condition at 35 percent (against a target of 20 percent).39 The share of
passable rural roads increased from 50 percent to 59 percent, far short of the PRSC and
MKUKUTA targets of 70 and 75 percent. The shortcomings were likely accounted for by the
shortfall in maintenance financing. There was an impressive burst in resources made
available by a doubling of the fuel levy in 2007/08 following significant pressure by
development partners,40 but after that the need to fund maintenance continued to increase but
the funds available covered less than two-thirds of routine maintenance and less than 60
percent of periodic maintenance.41 Moreover, roads contracts were signed by government
agencies that amounted to twice the allocated funding in 2009/10, a problem that cut into
available resources for other development projects and led to the suspension of the signing of
any new contracts. A framework for public-private partnerships, which was expected to
encourage the private sector to fill the financing gap of 60 percent in a Transport Sector
Investment Plan, was delayed and ultimately lacked clarity on the division of government
responsibility among the various implementing agencies. To date, private sector investment
in infrastructure has been minimal, and no parallel Bank-financed projects have sought to
jumpstart these types of investments.

3.37 By contrast, there was real improvement in the efficiency of container operations at
the Dar es Salaam port, with container dwell time falling from its peak of 20.1 days in 2008
to 12.3 days for local containers and 16.3 days for transit containers even as traffic increased.
The issue of port congestion was elevated to the PRSC when there was no consensus at the
sector dialogue level. The PRSC contributed to the improvement in port efficiency by
encouraging an increased tariff and alternative means for port storage, but longer term issues
regarding port efficiency do not appear likely to be addressed given the lack of commitment
to the agenda by key counterparts. The Bank and government have agreed to pursue a
process by which the role of the Ports Authority evolves from operator to landlord, but the
Ports Authority does not intend to carry this out, which was the crux of the difference of
opinion at the sector dialogue level in the first place. Moreover, port clearance requires
approval by many players in the government, many of whom have not decentralized

39
     More recent data indicates some improvement in 2011, although still well below the target.
40
  The levy is extremely high by regional standards, but widespread tax evasion erodes the revenue
collected (Gwilliam and others 2011).
41
 Severe weather and the apparent reclassification of district roads as national and regional roads also
may have contributed to this result.


                                                    44
authority to the ―single window‖ at the port, while many procedures still need to be
automated and infrastructure remains insufficient (Tanzania Revenue Authority 2009).

3.38 Improved livelihoods in rural areas, where the vast majority of the poor live, through
improved agricultural policies and expansion of rural infrastructure. The third outcome area
for the objective of growth and reduction of income poverty covers agriculture and rural
development and natural resources sectors, as well as some aspects of the transport and
energy sectors which were addressed in the previous section.

3.39 Strong growth in the agricultural sector was expected to make possible sustained
economy-wide GDP growth of 6-8 percent, and help to reduce income poverty, but this did
not come to pass. Agricultural growth averaged 4 percent per year during 2006-10, short of
the PRSC program target of 6 percent and far short of the MKUKUTA target of 10 percent.
Even this modest outcome is uncertain as doubt was expressed by stakeholders about the
integrity of the data on agricultural growth. Taking the data as accurate, agricultural growth
is still only marginally faster than that of population growth, and appears to be, as under
PRSCs 1-3, derived mainly from continued expansion of cultivated areas rather than
increased yields, unrelated to the policies pursued under the PRSCs.

3.40 There was a mixed record in the areas of support. On crop board reform, the
government halted the price-setting function of crop boards, limiting their functions to
regulatory activities, an important step. But the government did not consolidate these gains,
as amendments to crop board legislation were not adopted and strategic plans for crop boards
were not completed. On performance-based budgeting at the local level, all 133 Districts
qualified for performance-based ―top-up grants‖ for agriculture-related public investments by
the end of the period.

3.41 On land reform, there was some progress, albeit slow. Decentralized land registration
was scaled up in both urban and rural areas. About 7,000 villages out of about 11,000 were
surveyed and registered, although participatory village land-use plans were prepared in only
1,000 of them. But the issuance of certificates of customary rights of occupancy for
individual customary landowners was not carried out. The development of efficient land
registries has been lagging, in part because local government authorities lack the capacity to
develop land registry systems that match their responsibilities under the law. This has led to
many land disputes and lack of transparency in land management practices. There is no
instrument to track women‘s ownership of land, although the country is working toward such
data with the implementation of a new information management system with support from a
parallel Bank investment project. These limitations reflect the inadequate implementation of
the land laws, particularly titling and registration (supported under PRSC-8), which has been
fragmented through a series of small and somewhat disjointed pilots.

3.42 Government commitment with respect to the policy dialogue in agriculture declined
appreciably under PRSCs 4-8, and several of the triggers were dropped or significantly
diluted. Even in those areas where some progress was made, such as land registration, and
reorientation of the crop boards towards regulation and away from marketing, there are, as
yet, no perceptible outcomes in terms of improved access to credit and reduction of



                                              45
―nuisance taxes‖—small taxes levied by local government authorities on the marketing of
agriculture.

3.43 Natural resource issues were highlighted in PRSC-7 and PRSC-8, in response to the
findings of the Bank‘s Country Economic Memorandum of 2007. Defined to include tourism,
mining, forestry, and fisheries, the sector was considered to be a significant income
supplement to many Tanzanians, although much of it operated in the informal economy. The
PRSC sought to initiate improvements in transparency and accountability in resource
management through reforms of the licensing and concession regimes.

3.44 Outcomes with regard to transparency and the regulatory environment for all four
sub-sectors were mixed. In forestry and wildlife, the level of revenues received from
concessions increased from TZS 23 billion in 2007/08 to TZS 33 billion in 2009/10 (IEG
2011)42 pointing to gains following improved transparency in allocating licenses and
concessions. But the more basic objective of creating an institutional framework for long
term sustainable management was not achieved. In tourism and coastal resources
management, the CAS Completion Report—the Bank‘s self-evaluation of the country
program—for the 2007-2011 CAS period concluded that Bank support was unlikely to
achieve its development objectives of improving the regulatory framework. In mining,
despite the issuance of a new Mining Act (United Republic of Tanzania, 2009), no significant
outcome in terms of improved regulatory framework was achieved, although mining sector
growth accelerated, with an average annual growth during 2000-09 estimated at 13.7 percent.
Tanzania is seeking validation for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which
would help generate a more transparent framework, a situation widely supported by operators
in the sector. Overall, despite meeting the triggers of the PRSCs and support from several
IDA technical assistance projects, including GEF resources, improvement in the regulatory
environment was limited.

3.45 To summarize, the overarching objective of poverty reduction did not materialize,
and sustained growth cannot be attributed to PRSC-supported reforms. Apart from some real
successes (including improving port efficiency and reducing crop board control of price-
setting) intermediate outcomes in each of the three outcome areas was weak, and not
improved by the slow pace of reforms supported by the PRSCs. Efficacy on this objective is
rated modest.

OBJECTIVE 2: IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING

3.46 This objective aimed to improve quality of life and social well-being through
improvements in access to education, health, and potable water supply, as well as mitigating
the effects of HIV/AIDS. The PRSC supported the objective through efforts to enhance the
sector dialogue among development partners and improve the monitoring and evaluation of
service delivery. There was no direct support to the underlying government program in the
sectors, nor dialogue regarding specific policies. Rather, the PRSC sought to encourage

42
  The proposed performance indicator—the level of revenues received from concession and license
in forestry as percentage of their estimated values—was not measured, nor was it sufficient to assess
achievement of objectives in the sector.


                                                  46
sector-based dialogue among a number of development partners, and strong monitoring of
the program, conditioning Bank support on a ―satisfactory‖ annual sector review in health,
education, and water. As such, there was a long chain between the Bank‘s PRSC support, and
development outcomes in the country.

3.47 The program document for PRSC-6 identified three outcome areas for this Objective,
each with associated indicators:

        Improved health status of the population.
        Expanded enrollment and enhanced quality in all levels of education.
        Improved well-being through better access to clean water.

3.48 Improved health status of the population. During 2006-2010 (PRSCs 4-8), health
outcomes continued to improve. In spite of the declining budget share, per-capita public
expenditure increased (due to the substantial increase in overall public expenditure) and was
anticipated to reach USD 14 per person by 2010/11. The 2010 Demographic and Health
Survey documents continued marked declines in infant and under-five mortality, putting
Tanzania on track to achieve its Millennium Development Goals in these areas (the trend for
under-five mortality is shown in Figure 3.1). These improvements were likely the result of
the government program—there was significant increase in the percent of children under two
receiving three doses of vaccines (from 71 percent to 88 percent in 2010) and the percent of
births attended by a skilled health worker (from 41 percent in 2006 to 51 percent in 2010 and
63 percent in 2012, but still short of the PRSC target of 65 percent). Targeted vaccination
rates and AIDS prevalence among 15-24 year olds which were set for 2010 had already been
achieved by 2008, and national HIV prevalence fell from 4 percent in 2003 to 2.4 percent in
2008. Child nutrition indicators also continued to improve and there was some evidence of a
beginning decline in maternal mortality (although large margins of estimation error preclude
a definitive trend).43 Significant disparities across districts remain and, as highlighted by a
review of the General Auditor‘s Office, little progress has been made in matching workload
to staff deployment. Little progress is evident on other issues raised by a 2007 joint
evaluation of the health sector in Tanzania (COWI and others 2007), including, for example,
poor hospital management, and a weak Public-Private Partnership framework.




43
  The 2010 Demographic and Health survey reported a decrease in child stunting from 38 to 35
percent and a marginal decline in underweight from 22 to 21 percent. The incidence of moderate
anemia declined from 43 to 28 percent. The DHS also reported that the estimated confidence interval
upper limit for maternal mortality declined from 578 to 545 per 100,000 over the same period.

3.49 During 2007-09 the Bank had intended to shift its financial support to the health
sector from the health sector basket fund (a pooling arrangement supported by most health
sector donors) to general budget support through the PRSCs relying on the budget to ensure
adequate allocations to the sector. This shift was conditional on (i) increased budget
allocation to the health sector commensurate to the IDA resources shifted to the PRSCs; (ii)
progressive improvements in procurement systems; and (iii) satisfactory implementation
reviews of a health care waste management plan. In the event, there was progress on the
second and third conditions, but health budget allocations (in terms of share of total
expenditure) remained relatively steady and perhaps increased slightly, but this was
insufficient for the Ministry of Health continue its support for the shift to GBS, and led the
Bank to drop its plan to use the PRSCs as its main instrument for financial support to the
sector.44 Nevertheless the PRSC attention to the health sector policy dialogue through the
annual reviews did underscore the Bank‘s concern with health sector performance and
contribute modestly to health sector outcomes.

3.50 Expanded enrollment and enhanced quality in all levels of education. Bank support
for education through the PRSCs was underpinned by the first ever annual sector review in
the sector prepared by the government with inputs from technical working groups, including
civil society and development partners, and modeled on the experience with health sector
reviews. The annual triggers in the education sector were the completion of a satisfactory
annual sector review dealing with sector performance issues.

3.51 Overall, there were significant achievements in expanding, and then maintaining,
high levels of enrollment at the primary and secondary level, and mixed evidence on quality.
Primary net enrolment ratios peaked at 97.2 percent in 2007/08 from a baseline of 73 percent,
falling back to 94 percent in 2010/11, just short of the ambitious MKUKUTA target of

installment of Additional Financing for the ongoing Health Sector Development Program II/


                                                                48
universal enrollment. Primary completion and the pass rate on the primary school leaving
exam fluctuated during the period (the trends for all three are shown in Figure 3-2). In
addition, the number of qualified primary school teachers increased and there was
improvement in pupil/teacher and pupil/classroom ratios, each a proxy for the quality of
education. Independent quality assessments were mixed: a large household-based survey by a
regional NGO45 found competencies of primary school leavers below those in Uganda and
Kenya, while a set of school-based surveys by a government-sponsored regional initiative46
concluded that Tanzanian students performed above regional averages in reading and
arithmetic and significantly improved performance between 2003 and 2007. Analytic work
undertaken for the 2010 PER found that education developments in Tanzania represented
good value for money overall considering that Tanzania would achieve the Millennium
Development Goal for education at relatively low cost; but it also found that quality issues
constituted the greatest threat to maintaining good value for money in the sector and that
there was scope for improvement by shifting resources to those under-served districts which
had demonstrated higher than average efficiency.

3.52 Public satisfaction with the extent to which the government was addressing
educational needs showed a declining trend, with 85 percent indicating fairly or very well in
2005, followed by 79 percent in 2008 and 56 percent in 2012 according to the Afro
barometer.

3.53 The secondary education net enrollment ratio continued to rise but at a slower rate
than earlier in the decade growing from 24.4 percent in 2007 to 34.5 percent in 2010. Even
this slowing growth put great strains on the overall system, with the capitation grant of TSh

25,000, intended to contribute to learning materials and other non-salary support to
secondary schools, being paid out at a small fraction of the mandated amount due to the
financial squeeze on the secondary sector from the drive to universal primary enrollment and
the remarkable expansion of the tertiary sector. After an initial deterioration in the ratio of
secondary school pupils to qualified teacher, the ratio improved slightly toward the end of the
period. Aggregate resources for secondary education appear to have been squeezed between
primary and higher education student loans, and spread across a much larger cohort of
students. The consequence was seen in a plummeting Form IV pass rate down from 26.7
percent in 2007 to 11.4 percent in 2009.

3.54 The MKUKUTA target for higher education was exceeded as the gross enrollment
ratio jumped from 0.27 percent in 2005/06 to 8 percent in 2010/11. However, this remarkable
growth threatens the fiscal sustainability of the whole sector through the commensurate
growth of a student loan scheme which lacks adequate repayment mechanisms and is
inherently regressive.

3.55 The Bank‘s contribution to these outcomes through the PRSCs was indirect, through
enhancing the quality of the sector dialogue. Bank staff presented a proposed set of criteria to
define a satisfactory sector review as part of the PRSC-5 documentation,47 but although the
sector review undertaken for PRSC-6 was more substantive than the previous year, it fell
short of these criteria in a number of aspects, primarily related to an inadequate integration of
progress on results with reporting on outputs and financial allocations. Under PRSC-7 and
PRSC-8, the Bank made it progressively more explicit that the annual sector review should
focus on performance and on the linkage between results and sector funding and policies.
The quality of the sector reviews did improve and were deemed satisfactory by the
development partners. However other developments made the determination of sector review
quality more difficult. The government clarified that it would only respond to a binary
determination – satisfactory or not satisfactory, and the development partner sector working
group decided to give equal weights to outcomes, resources and dialogue in determining the
overall rating for the annual performance reviews. In the view of Bank staff and some
development partners, the combination of these factors reduced the leverage of the annual
sector review on GBS and the PRSCs by narrowing the assessment range.

3.56 As with health, the Bank dropped its intention to shift its primary financial support
for the education sector from sector operations to the PRSC because it determined that its
leverage was needed to improve sub-sector allocations and focus attention on quality issues.
Bank staff concluded that this could be best accomplished through sub-sector financial
support and policy dialogue combined with general budget support through the PRSC with
its emphasis on the broad-based annual sector review carried out in conjunction with all other


47
  These included: (i) timely inputs to the budget process; (ii) involvement of a wide range of
stakeholders; (iii) assessment of performance against agreed benchmarks and targets; (iv) use of
reliable information stemming from sector MISs, Government of Tanzania statistics or MDA
implemented projects; and (v) a review of both retrospective and prospective actions. The definition
of ―reliable information‖ subsequently proved problematic as it could be interpreted to exclude third
party monitoring and data collection.


                                                 50
development partners in the sector.48 Overall, there was significant progress in expanding
enrollment and mixed outcomes with regard to quality, but the direct contribution of the
PRSC to education sector outcomes was modest.

3.57 Improved well-being through better access to clean water. Survey data, less
frequently available but more robust than administrative data, show an improvement in the
share of households using protected water sources between 2007 and 2010, from 45 percent
to 57.8 percent in rural areas and 73 percent to 86 percent in urban areas. 49 This fell slightly
short of the targets envisaged in the PRSC. There was also some improvement by 2010 in the
share of the rural population which could access clean and safe water within 30 minutes from
40 percent to 48 percent over the same period, but this constituted less than half the rural
population. Similar analysis for the urban population was subject to data limitations, but
there appears to be no improvement in the share of urban population with access of clean and
safe water within 30 minutes.50

3.58 For sanitation, the use of pour flush toilets rose from 1 percent to 1.6 percent in rural
areas and from 6 percent to 15.3 percent in urban areas during 2007 and 2010, but overall
there was an increase in the share of the population with no access to a toilet (even a pit
latrine), from 7.5 percent to 13.7 percent. This suggests reduced access to the most basic
sanitation facilities, primarily in rural areas, even as improved sanitation facilities became
more common. The 2011 Poverty and Human Development Report emphasizes that the
challenge to provide hygienic and safe sanitation for all Tanzanians is large.

3.59 With the exception of PRSC-6 when the water sector review was considered fairly
satisfactory as in health and education, the triggers and prior actions were all met. Initially,
the focus on jump-starting the annual sector review process was useful, particularly when
standards were introduced for what constitutes a ―satisfactory‖ sector review. But over time,
annual review meetings became excessively focused on negotiating the rating of the review
process (satisfactory or unsatisfactory) rather than a substantive discussion of results and the
policy actions critical to improve development outcomes. Ultimately, all parties faced strong
incentives to rate programs satisfactory, given their interest in maintaining dedicated funding
to the sector. Even when considering outcomes, administrative data were particularly weak,
and consistently overestimated access to water in rural areas when compared to surveys, for
two reasons. First, access was poorly defined and was sensitive to the assumption made on
how many people on average had access to an individual household connection or water
outlet. Second, the data provided from government sources assumed that all connections or
outlets were functional, given the absence of a mechanism to identify functionality, but

informants suggested there are a significant number of non-functioning water points,
particularly in rural areas.51

3.60 In summary, there were some remarkable gains across all three sectors, but
particularly in health outcomes and access to education. The PRSCs succeeded in upgrading
and providing standards for the dialogue among the government and various development
partners in each sector. This was an important contribution to improving the process, but far
from sufficient to generate the overly ambitious desired outcomes articulated in the program
documents. Reforms supported by the PRSCs were limited to early stage changes to process,
and required significant changes to policy for the objectives to be achieved. The large
balance of this work was undertaken by the government through sector interventions
supported by the Bank and other development partners. Overall, because of the tenuous link
between Bank support through the PRSC and these outcomes, efficacy is rated modest.

OBJECTIVE 3. IMPROVED STATE OF GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY

3.61 The PRSC‘s efforts to support reforms of public sector performance and improved
service delivery focused on strengthening governance and accountability. The program
documents identify three public-sector reform indicators from the Bank‘s World Governance
Indicators (on accountability, control of corruption, and government effectiveness). The first
two improved somewhat, but did not meet their target, and the third deteriorated. These are
weak indicators of outcomes, as they are scored relative to other countries, and so do not pick
up absolute improvement or deterioration.52 The evaluation thus looks more closely at other
indicators.

3.62 The program document for PRSC-6 identified the following three outcome areas in
governance and accountability:

        enhance the accountability of the state;
        improve the effectiveness of public administration through better incentives for public
         servants and decentralization; and
        improve public financial management.



51
   A one-time water point mapping exercise, currently underway, will survey the existence and functionality of
rural water points. But given this will only be an end-of-period single observation, household survey data is the
most useful source to measure progress.
52
  The Worldwide Governance Indicators aggregate scores from a number of primary sources on
governance—mostly surveys—and then compares each country‘s aggregate score for the year with
that of over one hundred other countries in the world. The indicator shows how many standard
deviations the country‘s score is above or below the mean for all countries. Tanzania, like most low-
income countries, is below the mean, so a less negative score indicates improvement. While giving a
good estimates and confidence intervals for a country‘s relative position in a given year, the WGI is
less useful for comparisons over time, because the changes result not only from changes in a
country‘s absolute performance, but also from changes in the primary indicators that are used in
calculating the country‘s raw score and from changes in the collection of comparator countries.


                                                       52
3.63 In the area of enhancing accountability of the state, primarily through control of
corruption, anti-corruption legislation was enacted, a greater share of investigated cases
were prosecuted, and a smaller share of court cases remained outstanding for more than two
years. But these figures are probably misleading because only about one-sixth of allegations
over the 2006-2010 period were investigated by the Prevention and Control of Corruption
Bureau.

3.64 Indirect evidence suggests corruption may have increased. During the period, there
was a series of high-level corruption cases, accounting for large sums of misappropriated
funds. Perception ratings also point to a deterioration: the International Country Risk Guide
rating fell from 3.5 in 2007 to 2.5 in 2010 on a 1-4 scale, with 4 indicating the lowest
perception of corruption and the Bank‘s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment rating
fell from 3.5 in 2007 to 2.5 in 2010 on a 1-5 scale, with 5 indicating the lowest perception of
corruption as shown in Table 3-4. Transparency International‘s Corruption Perception Index
(2011) showed improvement in 2011 after a rapid fall from the peak in 2007. Tanzania‘s
score on the Worldwide Governance Indicators (relative to performance in other countries)
improved but fell short of the program‘s target. The Afro barometer found the share of
people believing the government was fighting corruption well fell from 62 percent in 2005 to
56 percent in 2008 to 34 percent in 2012. Implementation of new anti-corruption
legislation—intended to extend the focus of anti-corruption efforts beyond national ministries
to local government, civil society, and the private sector—faced strong opposition. An
independent evaluation of anti-corruption efforts in Tanzania found that GBS dialogue has
had modest influence on combating corruption (Norad and others, 2011).

3.65 The second outcome area covers the PRSC‘s contributions to improving the
effectiveness of public administration through better incentives for public servants and
decentralization. With respect to improving civil service effectiveness, the PRSC-supported
reform objectives focused on remuneration with the intention of putting an effective public
service framework in place to provide a foundation for service delivery and improvements in
poverty. The objectives were not met. The ICRG rating for Bureaucratic Quality remained
steady, and the CPIA rating for Quality of Public Administration declined (see Table 3.4).
This is consistent with the Worldwide Governance Indicator on government effectiveness,
which deteriorated from -0.35 (2005) to -0.45 (2008), in contrast to the program target of 0.0
for 2010, although again this indicator was not appropriate to measure trends over time.



                                                   53
3.66 There were two main reasons for this result. First, there were weaknesses in design,
as reflected in the repetition of public service pay reform triggers, some of them imprecise.
Second, the strategy remained to increase pay across-the-board, an approach which had not
succeeded during the first PRSC series, and which empirical evidence elsewhere showed as
unlikely to succeed (IEG 1999 and 2008; Evans 2008). Success in meeting the intermediate
outcome target of increasing pay as a proportion of the government‘s pay target (from 86
percent to the PRSC target of 90 percent, but not the MKUKUTA target of 100 percent)
should be interpreted with caution. An alternative approach of targeting pay increases to
positions with the greatest need (for example, in remote areas) and in agencies critical for
delivery of prioritized services – which experience and analysis elsewhere shows to have
greater chances of success – was not adopted. The program document for PRSC-8 notes the
persistence of problems related to the structure of public service pay, emphasizing the
distorted incentives that arise from allowances and poor targeting.

3.67 Local government reform. With Bank support, the government sought to strengthen
the link between budgets of local authorities and MKUKUTA, while advancing
decentralization. This was a long-standing challenge given Tanzania‘s history of extreme
centralization. The share of the budget transferred directly to local government authorities
increased, following the de-concentration of the secondary education budget, and the share of
local government expenditures calculated on a formula basis increased from 16 percent in
2006/07 to 25 percent in 2009/10 (GBS Annual Review 2010). A system of
intergovernmental transfers, which provides performance-based discretionary grants (Council
Development Grants and Capacity Building Grants) to local government authorities, was
disbursing by 2010. There was, however, limited progress made in providing autonomy in
human resources management at the local government level. Moreover, transparency and
accountability of use of funds was undermined by multi-channeled funding at the local level,
and there were continued large inequities in the allocation of funds among districts (World
Bank 2010c). Although the PRSC series had the objective of improving the effectiveness of
decentralization, none of the five PRSCs directly supported policy measures through
triggers or prior actions to promote this, a serious design shortcoming. Moreover,
decentralization efforts seem to have declined in priority as an activity area for public sector
reform, according to interviews with country officials. Although more money in the
aggregate is going to local governments, the targeting to rural areas and accountability to
central authorities has weakened (there never were substantial mechanisms for accountability
to local populations).

3.68 Reforms in the third outcome area, improving public financial management, focused
on procurement, external and internal audit, and budget and core public financial
management (PFM) issues. Budget management is deteriorating, while auditing and
procurement are becoming more thorough.

3.69 For procurement reform, the strategy was to implement the new law passed during
the first PRSC series—to stop using a central tender board, to allow ministries and local
governments to manage their own procurement, and to create a regulatory body to set and
enforce standards for efficient and non-corrupt procurement. The number of agencies
participating in the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority evaluations grew from 20 in
2006/07 to 100 in 2007/08 and to 174 in 2010/11. The proportion of agencies found in


                                              54
compliance with PPRA regulations rose from 39 percent in 2006/07 to 50 percent in 2007/08
and reached a plateau around 70 percent in 2009/10 and 2010/11, while the number of
agencies included rose from 91 in 2009/10 to 174 in 2010/11 (PPRA Annual Performance
Evaluation Report, 2011). The 2009 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability review
rated competition, value for money, and controls in procurement as a B in 2009 compared to
D+ in 2005. But that report and the 2011 DfID Risk Assessment noted the continuing
problem of low compliance with procurement laws and regulations, stating that ―anecdotal
evidence and the national corruption survey still question the integrity of the actual
[procurement] selection process at both central and local government level‖ (DfID 2011).

3.70 External Auditing was strengthened through the approval of the Public Audit Act in
2008, increasing the independence, powers and responsibilities of the Controller and Auditor
General. The PEFA score for the scope, nature, and follow-up of external audits improved
from D+ in 2005 to B in 2009, and the country is one condition from ascending to (African
Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions) AFROSAI level 3 status, which only two other
sub-Saharan African countries have achieved. To reform internal audit in 2008 the
government moved the internal audit function from the office of the Accountant General to
make it independent, with direct reporting to the Permanent Secretary of the Treasury.
Auditing showed progress in terms of increased coverage capacity, independence of the
National Audit Office, and meeting regional and international standards. The audit office is
well respected in the region, as evidenced by Tanzania being elected chair of AFROSAI East
for 2011-2014 and the audit office winning the Swedish National Audit Office 2010 award
for the best performance audit report, and sitting as a member of the United Nations Audit
Panel. Its annual reports were on time since 2005 and contained substantive analysis and
frank critiques. Outcomes reported by the audits (a measure of the quality of public financial
management) showed progress in increasing the proportion of ―unqualified opinion‖ until
2009, which reversed in FY 2010, but recovered for FY 2011. Some important ministries,
like Finance and Education, were still not getting ―unqualified opinions‖. Also ―adverse
opinions‖ in audits of local governments continued to be prevalent (TWAWEZA, 2010).
These reflected PFM problems in the audited agencies, but also the ability of the auditors in
identifying them. However, government responsiveness to National Audit Office
recommendations has been lacking. The audit office report on FY2010/11 said the following:
―Most of the recommendations issued in the previous year‘s General Report of the Central
Government were not responded to, which is an indicator of lack of seriousness on the part of
the Government in implementing those recommendations.‖ (p. xxiv)

3.71 The government‘s umbrella PFM reform program began to slow down in 2006-07 as
government commitment deteriorated, so that there was little further progress regarding
budget and core public financial management issues. The focus was on ensuring that the
approved budget was in line with policy objectives and actual expenditures were consistent
with the approved budget. Outstanding issues from the first series of operations, such as
inadequate budget reporting by the local governments, were not followed up in the second
series.

3.72 Starting in July 2008, there were improvements in specific systems—cash
management, payment systems, coverage of the Integrated Financial Management System,
and budget classification. Despite this, the CPIA and Public Expenditure and Financial

Accountability ratings for PFM deteriorated over the period, and the Open Budget ratings did
not make net improvement.53 Recurrent budget deviation at vote level improved, but
remained above the target of 10 percent, as shown in Figure 3-3 (the same as Figure 2-4. in
Chapter 2). The main recipients of reallocated funds were those Ministries with large staff
complements—the Education, President‘s Office and Cabinet, Defense, and Police—because
most of the reallocations were for salary arrears and adjustments.

3.73 The early years of the second series of PRSCs saw the adoption of budgets in line
with MKUKUTA priorities, as well as satisfactory budget execution. The situation changed
in later years. But commitment to budget execution and alignment of expenditures to
MKUKUTA deteriorated and outcomes were worse than expected in PRSCs-7 and -8,
although the situation seems to have improved in 2009/10 (Public Expenditure Review
2011). The allocations for capital spending remained low, about 18 percent of the total
budget, and allocation for infrastructure maintenance declined, despite unreliability and low
accessibility of electricity and rural roads. Spending on wages and salaries remains high at 32
percent of total; this is down from the peak of 34 percent in 2008/09 but still above the target
and the pre-2008 levels.

3.74 The PRSC 4-8 series was unable to greatly influence policy performance to enhance
governance and accountability in the public sector. Policy dialogue and assistance for
reforms in civil service, local government, procurement, control of corruption, public finance
management and economic stabilization resulted in little progress, as reflected in the key
indicators. Support to external and internal audit yielded substantial improvements in the

Ratings
OUTCOME

3.75 The relevance of the objectives of the PRSC 4-8 is assessed as substantial.
Objectives were strongly aligned with, indeed identical to, the government program and
consistent with the objective of the Bank‘s 2000 CAS, as well with subsequent CASs. In
addition, the objectives of the PRSC series were drawn to correspond with the multi-donor
performance assessment framework (PAF). But the program did not articulate its priorities
within the government‘s program in order to guide the program as circumstances changed.

3.76 The relevance of design of the PRSC series was modest. The framework
appropriately included a modest number of triggers and prior actions. These were derived
from the policy dialogue emanating from the MKUKUTA. But the sectoral scope of the
series was too wide-ranging and lacked clear prioritization—the program covered almost all
the policy areas highlighted in the MKUKUTA. The results framework, much improved from
the first series, was only fully developed by the third operation. Moreover, the operations
should have more directly addressed the challenges of decentralization in delivering services,
with better linkages to the parallel investment project.

3.77 The achievement of the objectives of PRSC 4-8 was mixed. With respect to growth
and reducing income poverty, efficacy was modest. There are no up-to-date data to measure
progress toward the primary objective—to reduce poverty in rural areas. It is very unlikely
that the target was met because the drivers of economic growth have not changed much since
2007 when analysis showed a very low elasticity of poverty to GDP growth. Efficacy of
improving quality of life and social well-being is also modest because of good outcomes in
health and mixed outcomes in education and water and sanitation, and limited plausibility
linking the PRSCs to these outcomes. Efficacy of improving governance and accountability
was modest, with little progress in improving public financial management, improving the
effectiveness of public administration, and enhancing the accountability of the state.

3.78 How far would Tanzania have gone in achieving its objectives without the PRSCs?
Implementation of many of the specific policies promoted through dialogue under the
program was slow—for instance in agriculture, transport, and private sector development.
While there was some initial progress in governance reforms, there was substantial
backsliding in the later years. Thus the program appears to have contributed little to national-
level results. Without the PRSCs, Tanzania‘s IDA envelope would have been delivered either
through additional sector investment loans, or a larger scale of the investment loans already
under implementation. Given that one of the primary barriers to progress was related to
government ownership—as agreed policy actions were dropped, diluted, and even likely to
be reversed—it is unlikely that the specific reforms pursued under the PRSC series would
have been better implemented through AAA or investment lending. Indeed, many of the
sector-specific policy issues were ―elevated‖ to the PRSC precisely because they had not


                                              57
been addressed at the sector level. If these sector level reforms had not been elevated, they
would have faced the same political economy and ownership constraints as they did under
the PRSC. Cross-cutting reforms were pursued through the PRSC dialogue specifically
because they could not be addressed at the sector level. Aside from policy and institutional
changes, allocation of Tanzania‘s IDA resources to investment lending may have yielded
more tangible results at the sector level, for instance through direct investment in new
infrastructure or the social sectors.

3.79 There were significant shortcomings in the program‘s achievement of objectives,
particularly with regard to the first and third objectives. Despite strong growth, the likely
poverty impact was minimal. None of the targets for improvement in governance were
achieved. Given this modest efficacy, and some shortcomings in the design of the program,
the outcome of the PRSC series is rated moderately unsatisfactory. Table 3-5 summarizes
the subcomponents of the rating.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

3.80 As a result of weakening government commitment to the established modalities for
dialogue under the PRSC, modest ownership of specific policy actions (as triggers were
increasingly dropped or diluted), and high aid dependence during implementation, the risk to
development outcome is significant.

3.81 A fundamental internal risk that could affect the development outcome of PRSC 4-8
is waning government commitment with respect to the established modalities for dialogue
on policy reforms, especially the analytic processes that underpinned the reform effort.
Specifically, the PER—which provided a platform for the Bank, key government
counterparts, as well as other development counterparts to engage in an intense dialogue on
public finance management and service delivery issues—came to be perceived by
government officials as externally owned. The PERs were still produced on an annual basis
with officially joint authorship between the Bank and the government, but the primary
vehicle for policy dialogue on core issues has been transferred to joint annual reviews of
general budget support, a process that is seen by some senior government officials as
insufficient.54 Under the follow-up PRSC series, the Bank reports that it has worked with the

54
  This development could be traced to three factors: First, some development partners preferred a
broader authorship and viewed the PER as a Bank product. Second, changes in the composition of


                                                    58
government to revamp the PER process, and that early signs suggest that the government has
begun to expand its commitment to the dialogue. The proliferation of parallel strategy
documents, such as the National Development Plan, manifests parallel movements for
ownership.55 In sectors where specific policy actions were targeted, implementing agencies
did not champion the reforms in question, so that triggers were met, if at all, in letter rather
than in spirit, and anticipated outcomes were not realized.

3.82 The second internal risk pertains to implementation modalities at the sectoral levels.
For example, risk to development outcome in education remains high. While the evidence is
mixed, the record of achievement in primary schools is highly variable and household-based
survey data suggest that performance levels may be lower than the school-based survey data
gathered through a government-sponsored regional initiative indicate.56 Similarly, the
declining share, in recent years, of public expenditures devoted to the health sector, even as
population grows at a rapid pace, suggests that the development outcomes are at risk.

3.83 The key external risk to sustaining the high levels of service delivery supported by the
PRSCs is that the country remains highly dependent on aid flows even to finance recurrent
expenditures. Domestic resource mobilization is low, although increasing, and so the
government has faced challenges as some donors have begun to reduce their general budget
support.

BANK PERFORMANCE

3.84 Quality at Entry: Of the five operations in the series, the Bank‘s Quality Assessment
Group assessed only PRSC-5 for quality at entry, and gave it a highly satisfactory rating. The
operation was commended for best practice in its design of the mechanisms for harmonizing
aid. Indeed, development partners and the Bank were on the leading edge of implementing
the Paris Declaration principles of donor harmonization, with a joint strategy and a complex
system for dialogue. Preparatory work by Bank staff on all PRSCs was intensive. Fiduciary
aspects were addressed directly—for example, under PRSC-6, the handling of potential
fiduciary problems stemming from alleged corruption at the Bank of Tanzania was made a
condition for negotiations. And the overall approach was strategically relevant.

3.85 The Bank carried substantial analytical and advisory activities (AAA). Areas covered
included nutrition analyses, private sector development, trade, growth, poverty, agriculture,
and public expenditures. While these reports were of high quality, the Bank in an internal
review was concerned that they did not always reach the policy makers. AAA was less
intensive during the latter part of the series (the last Country Economic Memorandum and


staff in both the Bank and government sides have weakened the dynamics of the partnership. Third,
the new decision-makers on the part of government viewed the process as too intensive, with
excessive transaction costs.
55
  In agriculture, the Agriculture Sector Development Program is being overshadowed with the recent
―Agriculture First‖ agenda.
56
 The household-based survey was fielded by the regional NGO Uwezo. The school-based survey
was fielded by the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Measuring Educational Quality.


                                                59
Poverty Assessment were begun in 2007 and completed in 2010). The annual PER was
prepared jointly and in close consultation with key government officials at the start of the
series. The technical quality of the PERs was high, and the government used them to guide
its budget operations. However, the participation of the Ministry of Finance team in their
preparation and the accompanying policy discussions declined significantly during the
second series as the process came to be seen as too intensive, a change that was seen to
diminish the quality of the dialogue.57

3.86 The chain linking the objectives of the program and expected activities to help
achieve them was not adequately specified across sectors, and the monitoring and evaluation
system was not designed to provide regular feedback on progress. This is a challenge in
implementing PRSCs while subscribing to Paris Declaration principles—the Bank adopted
and adjusted a country-owned and donor-harmonized results framework with significant
shortcomings in the belief that it would lead to better results than a stronger framework with
less ownership. This is consistent with a finding from the Bank‘s recent retrospective on
development policy lending, which found weaker results frameworks in countries with joint
budget support (World Bank 2012b). On balance, these were moderate shortcomings that
require elevated attention. Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

3.87 Quality of Supervision: Supervision and preparation of the annual PRSCs took place
in close collaboration with other donors and were conducted in accordance with the review
mechanisms established under MKUKUTA, with the Bank playing a central role. For most
of the program areas, supervision and dialogue were carried out on a continuous basis in the
context of sectoral or thematic programs. This included the PER process, PFM Reform
Program, PSRP/MKUKUTA, Agriculture Sector Development Program, the Business
Environment Strengthening program and sectoral programs. A joint general budget support
(GBS) review was conducted on an annual basis for an overall assessment of progress made
in each of the program areas. Progress toward achieving the objectives of general budget
support was centered on the performance assessment framework (PAF), for which the Bank
was the leading technical adviser. The harmonized GBS system helped the government
reduce transaction cost with development partners, and gave the Bank a mechanism to
materially affect the thrust of the government‘s partner-financed program. At the same time,
as has been documented in other countries (IEG 2010; World Bank 2012b), the coordination
process among development partners was complex and costly in terms of Bank staff time and
resources as the system evolved with increasingly comprehensive Performance Assessment
and M&E frameworks, and required broad consultation for even minor adjustments. The
government‘s reform program established quantitative and qualitative benchmarks for the
implementation period of the MKUKUTA. Starting with the third operation, the PRSC
program adopted its own set of targets that were linked but not identical to MKUKUTA
targets (the M&E system is assessed below).

3.88 Both MKUKUTA and the joint donor strategy were based on the presumption that
income poverty had been reduced during the years of rapid growth in the early 2000s. When,
after a long period in which no new reliable data on poverty was available, it became clear
57
  The Bank reports that it has since renewed the process for joint preparation of PERs, with early
signs of success.


                                                  60
that this was not the case, the strategies themselves lost credibility, according to government
and development partner informants, and development partners reformulated their programs.
This abrupt change may have been a rush to judgment, as the various measures of the poverty
record, based on different price indices, suggested different trends. Yet the Bank did not
prioritize supporting the country to collect robust data more frequently.

3.89 The program document for PRSC-6 suggested a renewed focus on agriculture and
rural development and private sector development in order to stimulate poverty-reducing
growth, a welcome change. In practice, however, the only trigger for private sector
development for the final three operations of the series was dropped, while the three triggers
for agriculture were diluted, dropped, and partially completed.

3.90 The Bank was confronted with a deterioration of government commitment to the
reform effort, and lacked the leverage to reverse it. There was a tension between achieving
the implementation of important policy reform objectives on the one hand, and the stated
commitment—consistent with the Paris Declaration—of external partners, including the
Bank, to provide regular, predictable financing on the other. In the event, the Bank reduced
the size of two operations by USD10 million late in the budget cycle to signal to the
government that there were consequences to missing triggers,58 and responded to the
government‘s protest to this unpredictability by drafting a memo that explained the Bank
would adjust indicative amounts based on in-year program performance. The adjustments
appear to have had an unintended effect of eroding the trust of government counterparts
without materially affecting the program. Government officials considered the reductions as
an unwarranted nuisance, but did not view them as a major impediment to financing or
implementing the program. Given this mixed performance, including moderate shortcomings,
the quality of supervision was moderately satisfactory.

3.91    Overall, Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

3.92 The Ministry of Finance successfully managed the process of conducting the annual
MKUKUTA national policy dialogue, ensuring that the process was participatory for NGOs,
academics, and other development partners. It also successfully managed the deliberations of
the complex general budget support annual review process, starting from the sector review,
including interactions with the GBS donor group to agree on assessment outcomes of current
performance assessment frameworks and jointly formulate contents of future PAFs.

3.93 But the commitment in central ministries to pursue important cross-cutting reforms,
particularly in the governance and accountability objective, deteriorated as a new government
administration and project counterparts took leadership during the initial year of the series,
and key reformers associated with the first PRSC series process moved into different roles.

58
  At USD115 million, the size of PRSC-8 was much lower than the USD400 million initially
anticipated in the CAS. This reduction, however, was primarily the result of general disenchantment
with GBS and the PRSC as the primary instrument for policy dialogue rather than a shortfall on
specific policy actions.


                                                 61
Moreover, the willingness or ability of central ministries to influence line ministries in the
implementation of PRSC-related reforms in other areas was less than anticipated, and so the
program was beset by delays and modest backsliding.

3.94 This preferred modality by the government for policy dialogue—implementation and
monitoring of the MKUKUTA and the GBS—created potential conflict of interest in sector
reporting, undermining the quality of the dialogue. Government representatives in the annual
sector reviews of specified policy areas were primarily from line ministries, while their
counterparts from the development partner agencies were primarily sector specialists.
Development partners reported that this was conducive to a lack of candor in performance
rating, since acknowledgment of poor results would be expected to lead to reduced financial
support for the sector concerned. Further, some policy actions agreed to by the central
ministries were not then pursued with vigor by line ministries. Finally, over time government
officials became accustomed to and increasingly expected annual general budget support
disbursements from development partners without due regard to the performance of the
program. The expectation that it was the responsibility of development partners, under their
Paris Declaration commitments, to provide the predictable flow of resources in this fashion
generated significant tension in the relationship with the Bank, and contributed to the erosion
of trust.

3.95 During the PRSC period non-income indicators of poverty, such as access to
education and health services, improved. Public spending on education and health also
increased slightly as a share of GDP. While borrower performance in supporting these basic
services is remarkable, this was not a significant focus of the PRSC policy dialogue and prior
actions.

3.96 Borrower performance thus had significant shortcomings, and is assessed as
moderately unsatisfactory.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

3.97 Design: The design of the M&E for the PRSC was weak at the start of the series
because it needed to await the development of the M&E for the government‘s MKUKUTA to
which it is aligned. Over time an elaborate and comprehensive M&E structure for
MKUKUTA was jointly developed by the government and development partners. But
counterparts indicated it was largely donor-oriented, producing M&E outputs intended to
satisfy donors rather than influence policies. Because it was targeted as a support for the GBS
system of aid coordination, it was integrated with the budget process, notably through (i)
implementation of a new national statistical master plan under the auspices of the National
Bureau of Statistics; (ii) implementation of an annual Living Standards Measurement Study
and a panel survey instrument, started in 2009 that has yet to provide meaningful data; and
(iii) supporting the strengthening of the internal reporting requirements of the government, in
particular, the output and performance reports associated with the PAF and the now well-
established biannual Poverty and Human Development Reports. The PAF is a matrix of
commitments consisting of three categories monitored by the Cluster Working Groups
throughout the year: (i) Underlying Process; (ii) Temporary Process Actions; and (iii)
Outcome Indicators. The M&E system was over-designed, and not practically linked to the


                                              62
capacity and timing constraints for implementation and use., though complex, was well
thought through and had the potential for generating useful data

3.98 M&E Implementation: Gathering data through the government M&E system and
the associated performance assessment framework for monitoring progress on MKUKUTA
posed substantial challenges. The low frequency of the surveys was a major limitation in the
generation of accurate data on a timely basis. Indeed, strategic priorities of both the
government and development partners—relying on poverty simulations—were distorted due
to infrequent feedback on progress on poverty reduction. Furthermore, the vague definition
of certain concepts made interpretation of data difficult. For example, progress related to
access to clean water or electricity depended heavily on assumptions regarding how many
people can access a given water or electricity hook-up, and further presumed that all existing
connections were functional. The M&E system associated with PRSCs 4-8, therefore, had
significant weaknesses with regard to data generation, quality, and use.

3.99 Utilization: The data derived from the government M&E system served as the basis
for annually reviewing progress of the MKUKUTA. However, much of the effort in
preparing and carrying out the review focused on inputs and processes rather than outputs
and results (World Bank 2009a). Little of the data generated, therefore, provide useful
feedback on the effectiveness of the program. On the other hand, the Poverty and Human
Development Reports provided a useful synthesis of the available data on the country‘s key
development priorities, and its analysis was independent and candid.

3.100 The quality of monitoring and evaluation is rated modest.


4. Lessons
4.1     The implementation of PRSCs 1-8 spanned nearly a decade during a period of
sustained macroeconomic stability and fast economic growth, offering lessons both for
Tanzania and other countries with similar development challenges.

4.2     Lesson 1: Direct and sustained focus and clarity of vision over the entire course
of implementation of PRSC programs that cover many years is required to facilitate
lasting reforms particularly with regard to public sector governance. There is a
significant risk of backsliding when attention is shifted to other priorities. Yet joint budget
support is a messy attempt to reach a common understanding, always subject to change, with
a wide range of domestic stakeholders and international development partners. In Tanzania,
intense dialogue and very high government commitment led to early successes in improving
public financial management and budget execution in the first PRSC series. But some
achievements stagnated or were reversed in the second series, when attention was diluted to
include a broad range of sectoral reforms and other aspects of governance.

4.3     Lesson 2: PRSCs can make little progress without a foundation of trust between
the Bank and the government, and among development partners at the institutional and
individual levels. Without sufficient trust, negotiated and agreed-upon triggers can quickly
be transformed into more heavy handed conditions, whereby the level of future support is


                                              63
determined by strict adherence to pre-identified policy changes. In these circumstances, a
scaled-back operation, more tightly focused around areas of agreement might gain more
traction than one used as an enforcement mechanism for previously agree reforms that no
longer have political backing.

4.4     Lesson 3: PRSC programs risk becoming irrelevant if the design, scale, and
scope are not adjusted as conditions change. The advance expectation that such changes
will occur may smooth the transition should events warrant a scaling back of the program.
Circumstances changed substantially during the second PRSC series in Tanzania: reform
champions in government and among development partners moved on; the presumption that
sustained growth of 6-8 percent would lead to significant poverty reduction proved false; a
new President was elected; and the country was affected by higher food and fuel prices and
by the global financial crisis. The mechanisms for dialogue also need to evolve so that the
program can continue to support and influence policy decisions at the highest strategic level.
To avoid misunderstanding, the Bank and government could plan in advance to recalibrate
the program at a set point during implementation.

4.5      Lesson 4: The lack of well-defined and realistic objectives and a fully developed
results framework makes adjustment to changing circumstances difficult. A results
framework that clearly explains how policy actions are expected to lead to desired outcomes,
in light of the support provided through investment lending and by other development
partners, can provide a results-focused discipline to the program, improving selectivity in the
process.

4.6     Lesson 5: Regular reporting on key outcome indicators is essential so that data
can drive adjustments to the PRSC program. Adequate investment in statistical capacity
and the creation of a robust monitoring and evaluation system that addresses each step of the
results chain to identify the key drivers of success or failure, while remaining focused on a
few key outcome indicators, can help guide long PRSC series as circumstances evolve.
Policy makers need to be aware of trends in outcomes in order to adjust the program
accordingly. In Tanzania, reliable data on, for example, income poverty were available only
once every seven years or so. Interim poverty simulations suggested significant poverty
reduction as a result of sustained growth, but these projections turned out to be inaccurate.
Household surveys every 3-4 years could provide much more timely and meaningful data to
policymakers to allow for evidence-based adjustments during implementation.

4.7    Lesson 6: Transitioning to the use of PRSCs as the primary instrument for
resource transfer is only likely to be successful in rare circumstances, when strong
central ministries can fully pursue a sector-inclusive dialogue representing the
perspectives of key players throughout government. PRSCs themselves have very limited
leverage in sector ministries, and the number and specificity of sector-specific triggers are
necessarily curtailed when many sectors are covered.

4.8     Lesson 7: Elevating to the national dialogue sector-specific structural reforms
that stalled at the sector level does not guarantee their implementation. Even as the
depth of sector exposure and experience permitted the sector content to be brought
opportunistically into the PRSC, there is no evidence that this accelerated sector reforms or


                                              64
achieved greater cross-cutting momentum. Indeed, many of the same obstacles can prevent
these reforms from taking hold, as was the case in energy, transport, agriculture, and water.
Moreover, policy reforms committed to by central ministries are likely to be seen by
implementing agencies, less vested in the PRSC program, as externally-imposed conditions,
and subverted rather than adopted.

Annex B. Complementarity of PRSCs with Other Bank
Support
1.     The PRSCs were implemented in parallel with a number of analytical products and
investment projects financed by the Bank that were directly related to the PRSC objectives.
This annex identifies those relevant activities, and assesses the extent to which the PRSCs
and other Bank support were complementary.

2.      Public Sector Reform. Analytical work was central to the Bank‘s public sector reform
dialogue in Tanzania. During the first PRSC series and prior, annual Public Expenditure
Reviews were produced through a highly participatory process, with meetings between the
Bank and government counterparts almost every two weeks. The major objectives was to be
sure that actual expenditures matched closely with what was in the approved budget and to
have expenditures focused on poverty reduction, outcomes that were central to the early
PRSCs as well. The PRSCs drew heavily on the reports as well as other analytical work
during the first series, and provided the main focal point for operational dialogue around
public sector reform issues. In this regard, the PRSCs and analytical work were highly
complementary.

3.      There were six relevant operations aimed at improving the performance of the public
sector (highlighted in Table B.1).

                                of MKUKUTA programs.

4.      The PRSCs may be considered as successor operations to the Public Financial
Management Reform Program and Public Service Reform Program, which had previously
been the primary focus of dialogue on these issues. Subsequent investment lending, topic-
specific or agency-specific, was generally more important for the associated government
agencies that the broad PRSC agenda. They tended to fill particular niches in the overall


                                                  89
ANNEX B


program (on tax reform, local government, and judicial access, for example). But they were
not central to the PSRCs, nor were government counterparts always invited in participate in
the PRSC process.

5.      Agriculture and rural development. Two pieces of analytical work—the 2000
"Agriculture in Tanzania since1986: Follower or Leader of Growth?‖ produced jointly with
the International Food Policy Research Institute and a Bank-led 2005 Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study—covered some of the same issues that later appeared in the PRSCs. These
emphasized Tanzania‘s comparative advantage in maize, paddy and the traditional export
crops, the potential of livestock production, the promise of agricultural research and
extension, the need to reduce transport costs and rationalize and reduce agricultural export
taxes, and the importance of crop board reform. While the there are some evident linkages
between this analytical work and the focus of the PRSCs, issues of crop board reform and
land were long-standing policy issues in the Tanzania agricultural sector with antecedents
well beyond the time period of the PRSCs.

6.     There were three agriculture lending operations approved during implementation of
the PRSCs, summarized in Table B.2.

Table B.2. Bank Investment Lending for Agriculture and Rural Development.

                                agricultural private investment based on an

                                access to critical agricultural inputs.

7.      The lending operations supported by the Bank during the PRSC period appear to
reflect contemporaneous priorities and approaches to agriculture in Tanzania. While
successful implementation of the policy actions supported by the PRSCs would conceivably
have improved the overall policy environment for agriculture and therefore enhance the
likelihood that the three projects would be successful, the complementarity is quite broad and
unspecific. The PRSC and investment lending in agriculture appear to have proceeded along
two relatively independent tracks.

8.      Private Sector Development. The private sector development agenda for the first
series of PRSCs was shaped by sectoral analytical work, including the 2003 Investment
Climate Assessment. But the linkage weakened in the second series. The findings of the 2006



                                                   90
                                                                                       ANNEX B


Investment Climate Assessment were released only in 2009, a missed opportunity in terms of
influencing the policy dialogue.

9.      The PRSC focused on creating the general framework for a growing private sector,
including the basic legislation and the national strategies that would facilitate effective
interventions at operational level, including sector lending. At face value this took place, and
the private sector development reforms under the PRSC program were followed by an
investment loan—the USD95 million Private Sector Competitiveness project launched in
2006. While the project complemented the PRSCs at the conceptual level—supporting
Tanzania‘s business environment strengthening program, building up private sector capacity
to respond to regional and international opportunities, and improving access to financial
services—implementation shortfalls in both resulted in missed opportunities.

10.     Relatively poor outcomes in the competitiveness project reflected shortcomings in the
legislation approved under the PRSC (such as the failure to change other acts to make the
new legislation operational, and a delay in the adoption of subsidiary acts) as well as lack of
political commitment and consensus about private sector development reforms. In addition,
slow progress under the investment lending project reduced the space for potential
intervention at policy level under PRSCs.

11.      Health, Education, and Water. The second PRSC series was intended to provide
additional leverage to the health, education, and water sectors dialogue among the
Government, the Bank, and other development partners without adding additional layers of
triggers, indicators, or review. The PRSC did not suggest any additional policy actions, but
rather focused ―strictly on the monitoring and evaluation of effective service delivery‖ and
addressing cross-cutting issues. PRSC prior actions were simply a rating of ―satisfactory‖ for
annual reviews in each sector, defined as a mix of process, measurement, and outcome
targets.

12.     This approach reflected an assumption that development partners would adopt a sharp
division between general budget support financing (including the PRSCs) and sector program
support and policy dialogue. Sector financing would be absorbed would eventually be
absorbed by general budget support, while policy support and dialogue would continue
among sector working groups. In a sense this reflected the deepest potential complementarity
between the PRSCs and sector investment and policy reform. Yet in practice, the ideal fell
short as the coordinating role of the Ministry of Finance waned, and the line ministries in
each of the sectors feared a shortfall in resources should their external financing mechanism
be shifted to general budget support. As the ministries refused to recognize any link between
general budget support and sector engagement with development partners, the Bank and
other partners retained their support of sector arrangements. The Bank approved broad sector
financing in all three sectors: additional financing totaling USD100 million for its Health
Sector Development Program in 2008 and 2010; a USD150 million Secondary Education
Development Program in 2010; and a USD200 million Water Sector Support Project in 2007.

13.    Energy. The key issues in energy during the period were (i) frequent electricity
shortages due to limited generation capacity and over-reliance on hydro-power; (ii) very low



                                               91
ANNEX B


accessibility to electricity; (iii) poor quality of electricity supply; and (iv) unsustainable
financial position and poor management of the government-owned utility, TANESCO.

14.     Three investment projects in the sector sought to address, to varying degrees, the first
three issues, but the challenges persist. The Songo Songo Gas Development and Power
Generation project, approved in 2002 and closed in 2011, used private sector management
and expertise to develop and operate a gas infrastructure system and a commercial market for
gas. After a severe drought in 2003, the Emergency Power Supply project was a short-term
intervention to help avert a prolonged period of severe load-shedding by acquiring
emergency electric energy from a private independent power producer and purchasing fuel
for TANESCO. The Tanzania Energy Development and Access Expansion project, approved
in FY2008 and still active, financed investments in TANESCO‘s transmission and
distribution networks and supported rural off-grid alternatives.

15.     The PRSC‘s focus was squarely on improving the management and financial position
of TANESCO, while encouraging an environment for private investment in the sector. This
was seen as the major obstacle to each of the other key issues—generating capacity, access
expansion, and quality of supply—and was not addressed through any of the other projects.
Moreover, the IMF considered the large transfers from the general budget to TANESCO as a
major obstacle to fiscal sustainability in the country, and so cost-reflective tariffs and
financial recovery for the utility could contribute to a stable macroeconomic environment in
addition to private sector development.

16.    In this sense, the design of the PRSC was a strong complement to the Bank‘s other
investments and policy goals. But in practice, the PRSC had trouble overcoming the political
economy barriers to improving TANESCO‘s financial position dramatically.

17.     Transport. The key issues in transport during the period were the low quality of the
trunk and regional road network, overcrowding of the Dar es Salaam port, weak functioning
of the railways, and limited access of rural areas to markets due to a lack of all-weather rural
roads. It was thought that in addition to public investments, private sector resources could be
leveraged to address these shortfalls in the transportation sector.

18.     The PRSC focused on policy and institutional improvements, including on roads,
ports, and public-private partnerships (PPPs). One important trigger was the completion of a
Transport Sector Investment Program with adequate allowance for road maintenance. The
Investment Program was completed and addressed maintenance to an extent, although it
turned out that there was a one-year surge in maintenance funding that receded rapidly
thereafter. The government anticipated a number of sectors would benefit from private sector
investment to help fill gaps in infrastructure development and maintenance, including in
ports, roads, and energy. But the country lacked a national policy on PPPs, and dialogue or
investment in a single sector was insufficient to remedy the situation. The PRSC helped to
push through an imperfect national PPP policy, a necessary (but insufficient) step to invite
this type of investment.

19.      The Bank had three open investment projects during implementation of the two PRSC
series, as summarized in Table B.3, focused on financing specific transport investments. The

Central Transport Corridor Project and its successor financed upgrading strategic road links
in the central corridor, a bus rapid transit system in Dar es Salaam, and repair of a runway at
the airport on Zanzibar. The Transport Sector Support Project and its additional financing
financed a three-year slice of the Investment Program that the PRSC helped to jumpstart and
improve. This included including rehabilitation of paved trunk roads, improvement of
regional airports, improvement of road safety, promotion of public-private partnerships,
emergency road and bridge repair, improvement of the Zanzibar airport, and rehabilitation of
the jetty at Songo Songo island. But no project addressed the shortcomings of the railways or
has yet picked up on the national PPP policy.

1.      The Bank recognized that achieving the overall growth and poverty reduction
objectives of the PRSCs required the maintenance of macroeconomic stability. The IMF
took the lead on these issues under its Poverty Reduction Grant Facility (PRGF), with PRGF
reviews serving as an input into the Bank‘s assessment of the macroeconomic situation, an
implicit condition for the program. The Bank focused on ensuring sustainability of
Tanzania‘s external debt following the substantial debt cancelation under HIPC. This was
intended to maintain the accelerated economic growth that was seen to be in part a result of
improved fiscal performance in the late 1990s. The program thus encouraged prudent
management and contracting of external debt by emphasizing the following actions:

       adoption of a national debt strategy (PRSC-1);
       amendments to the Loans, Guarantees, and Grants Act Number 30 of 1974 to ensure a
        prudential debt contracting and management system for government and public
        independent institutions (PRSC-1);
       amendments of Treasury Registrar‘s Ordinance (1959) and other laws that relate to
        the procurement of debt (PRSC-2);
       a comprehensive review of all laws that relate to the procurement of debt to ensure
        consistency with the provisions of, and elimination of loopholes concerning the
        enforcement of the amended Loans, Guarantees and Grants Act Number 30 of 1974
        (PRSC-2);
       preparation of an annual borrowing and repayment plan (concessional and non-
        concessional loans and attention to limits), presentation of this to parliament as part of
        the annual budget (PRSC-2);
       the development of a complete inventory of- and a verification and audit of- the
        contingent liability component of domestic debt (PRSC-2);




                                                    94
                                                                                                             ANNEX C


         the establishment of a National Debt Management Committee which meets quarterly
          to advise the Minister o f Finance on all proposals for new credit and to monitor the
          implementation of the National Debt Strategy (PRSC-3).

2.      Table C.2 outlines the status of the triggers and prior actions used as catalyst in
effecting policy actions for macroeconomic stability and debt management under the PRSC
series. The policy actions were to be assessed by using three key indicators: the net present
value of public external debt to exports; debt service (domestic and foreign) (ratio between
actual and budgeted); and gross borrowing (domestic and foreign) (ratio between actual and
budgeted). There was substantial improvement in macroeconomic management during 2003-
05. Reforms in debt management were successful, in part because the PRSCs overlapped
with the final stages of HIPC initiative, as well as with the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
process which created strong incentives for Tanzania to reform its debt management system
and introduce institutions for prudent macro-policies. All envisaged debt targets were met,
and the country had significant scope to expand its fiscal space at the end of the period. With
debt cancellation under HIPC and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the debt to GDP
declined to 60 percent in 2005, while debt service declined from the peak of almost 40
percent to exports to about 5 percent. The net present value of debt-to-export ratio was
estimated to be 64 percent by 2006. These figures were considered well below debt
sustainability thresholds (World Bank, 2007e, p14).

3.       Private sector development was perceived as essential for growth and poverty
reduction. The PRSC built on the tangible results under PSAC, which included the
advancement of the privatization agenda, with government disengagement from commercial
activities almost completed and significant progress toward greater private sector
involvement in the provision of utilities; progress in strengthening the business environment
and reform of land legislation; and the establishment of an improved regulatory environment.
The PRSCs focused on the three primary constraints, focused on the lack of a private sector
development strategy and small and medium enterprise policy, rigid labor laws, and a need to
improve the business environment.



                                                             95

4.      The lack of a comprehensive strategic framework to help with coordination and
targeting of the various initiatives in support of private sector development was seen as major
problem, as earlier efforts had been piecemeal. Under PRSC-1, the Ministry of Industry and
Trade prepared a small and medium enterprise policy and launched an associated public
awareness campaign. The government also initiated the preparation of an integrated private
sector development strategy, which was approved under PRSC-2.

5.      The lack of a single comprehensive labor law was a major problem as the labor
legislation was encompassed in six different, outdated pieces of legislation. This
fragmentation impeded market-oriented deployment of labor. The government was expected
to prepare a new labor policy and approve it under PRSC-2, while in the context of PRSC-3 a
new Labor Act was expected to be prepared and presented to parliament for approval.

6.      There was a significant unfinished agenda in improving investment climate and
business environment. In July 2002, the government approved the Business Environment
Strengthening for Tanzania program for carrying forward the reform agenda to improve the
business environment, partly supported by the PSAC-1. The PRSC focused on the
implementation plan for the business environment program that targeted eight priority areas
of action: (i) harmonization of local government taxation to remove excessive tax burden on
private enterprise; (ii) resolution of outstanding issues emanating from the Land Act; (iii)
review and amendment of labor laws constraining business operations; (iv) streamlining of
work permit procedures; (v) review and amendment of licensing legislation to reduce the cost
of business establishment and continuation; (vi) review and revision of export-import
procedures to reduce time costs and corruption-related costs; (vii) development of
competition policy, incorporating advice given by the Facility for Investment Climate
Advisory Services; and (viii) design and implementation of a program for enhancing access
to commercial courts by small and medium enterprises.

7.      The industry growth rate for the 2003-05 period was strong, at 10 percent per annum,
meeting the targeted range of 8 to 10 percent. This rapid growth was probably due to external
factors—such as a supply-side response in the mining sector to high commodity prices—
rather than government reforms supported by the Bank‘s program. Moreover, the impact of
industrial growth on poverty is limited because the labor intensity of mining is low, and the
manufacturing sector remains small and concentrated in Dar es Salaam.

8.      By the available indicators, the business environment did not improve: the results
from the two investment climate assessments roughly corresponding to the beginning and
end of the period (2003, 2006) suggest no major change.59 Implementation of private sector
development reforms under PRSCs 1-3 remained in its early stages, as shown in Table C.3.
Implementation of the small and medium enterprise strategy was much slower than expected
due to insufficient funding from the budget. The private sector strategy that was expected to
be completed under PRSC-3 was delayed because the government wanted to first complete
the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study, which was finalized in June 2005.

9.     Phase-1 labor legislation covering employment relations, collective labor relations,
dispute resolution, and labor market institutions was submitted to the Parliament in
November 2003, and approved in April 2004. A task force assigned to do the preparatory
works for phase-2 legislation (covering occupational safety, health workers compensation,
and employment and skill development) was expected to be finalized under PRSC-3 (2005),
but was postponed for 2006 ( and was not followed up by the second PRSC series).

10.      Following approval of the business environment program under PRSC-2 the efforts
shifted focus to replacing the business licensing regime by a registration system. In
particular, measures to rationalize business licensing announced in the budget for 2004/05
and subsequently implemented included the abolition of business license fees for health
facilities operated by religious organizations and small businesses, as well as the replacement
of annual business license fees by a one-off fee payable at the time of business registration. A
draft bill on Business Activities Registration that outlined the direction of the business
environment reforms was submitted to Parliament in July 2005.

11.     Agriculture and rural development were considered critical in broadening the
impact of growth to generate poverty reduction given the preponderance of poverty in rural
areas. Implementation of the government‘s agricultural sector development strategy and,
within it, the Agriculture Sector Development Program, both issued in 2001, focused on
resolving the constraints facing agriculture through a transformation from subsistence to
commercial agriculture, thereby help combat both rural and urban poverty. The underlying
themes of the strategy were to create a favorable environment for commercial agriculture, to
delineate public and private roles in the sector, and to decentralize service delivery
responsibilities to local governments. Insecure land rights affecting the use of land as
collateral for credit; limited access to agricultural credit in general, high levels of
agricultural taxation, as well as limited access to markets as a result of poor transport
infrastructure were identified as key constraints to agricultural sector growth.



                                                             97

12.     The government‘s Development Program included a broad array of measures to
address the identified constraints in the sector. From there, the PRSCs specifically sought to
support this program by focusing on reforms of crop boards particularly with respect to input
supply, product quality, and competitiveness; micro-finance legislation; the institutional
arrangements governing rural roads; local government taxation; property rights; and overall
coordination of public interventions in the agricultural sector. The program document for
PRSC-1 expected the proposed reforms to contribute to agricultural sector growth on a
sustained basis by 5 percent annually.

13.     The envisaged outcomes for the sector, derived from the program were: an increase in
real agricultural GDP from 3.6 percent in 2000/01 to an average of 5 percent by 2010,
resulting in the 2015 Millennium Development Goals targets of: (i) increased share of
income or consumption accruing to the poorest 20 percent, (ii) reduced share of population
living on less than USD1 per day, and (iii) increased ratio of trade to GDP. Growth
performance in agriculture was achieved; despite the impact of the drought on agriculture in
2003, agriculture grew by about 4 percent and rose further to 6 percent in 2004 and 5 percent
in 2005. There were no data to assess the poverty impact of growth, but a poverty assessment
in 2008, suggests that the poverty reducing impact of agricultural growth could be marginal.

14.     The implementation of policy reforms in the agriculture sector supported by the
PRSCs was slow and weak as shown in Table C.4. The passing of the Land (Amendments)
Act in 2004 provided for improved clarity of property rights and could help facilitate
securitization of land. On the other hand, the trigger for PRSC-2 to support its
implementation was only met under PRSC-3. The preparation of the land sector strategic
plan was initially expected to start in October 2003 and be completed by March 2004, with
financial support from EU‘s European Development Fund. The start of this activity was
delayed as agreement on the work plan, scope of work, and budget for the preparation of the


                                                              98

strategic plan between the Ministry of Lands and Housing Services and EU took longer than
originally envisaged. As a consequence, the reform was redefined as a trigger for PRSC-3.
The strategic plan was discussed during a stakeholders meeting in March 2005. Comments
from stakeholders were incorporated into the draft and the strategic plan was submitted to the
Ministry, but no evidence of immediate ―operationalization‖ was subsequently reported.
Similarly, the approval of the strategy to reform two crop boards was partially met and was
converted to a trigger for the follow-up PRSC series. Cabinet approved reforms to the
financing of crop boards, but did not endorsed specific reforms of role and function of crop
boards, including their regulatory functions, governance structures, and accountability to
stakeholders.60

16.     Budget formulation and execution was a possible contributor to this objective, given
the poverty reduction strategy‘s emphasis on increasing budgetary funding to the priority
sectors, which included education, health, agriculture, roads, water, the judiciary, and

60
  The joint evaluation of General Budget Support (ODI and DAL 2005) in their assessment of the
implementation of this policy noted that it was not so clear that there was a strong political thrust in
favor of it from the government side. The report further concluded that agricultural policy could have
been more coherent if the three ministries involved directly in the sector were subjected to the
common discipline of the MTEF/Budget Guidelines/PER processes.


                                                                      99

HIV/AIDS, which were seen as having the greatest development impact. The PRSC series
continued the reforms in public expenditure management through budget formulation
initiated under PSAC-1 toward strategic allocation of public spending to meet PRSP targets,
as indicated by target spending shares for social sectors. As noted in the table, the share of
the budget allocated to priority sectors was flat during the period, with the actual allocations
rising in real terms. In addition, the government adopted a recommendation from the Bank-
supported 2003 PER that requires each agency to explicitly link proposed budget allocations
with MKUKUTA objectives.

17.     Key achievements under PSAC in public expenditure management included
introducing cash budgeting in 1996/97 and adopting a participatory PER/MTEF approach to
monitor, inform, and improve the quality of government expenditures, enhancing funding for
key activities in the priority sectors, and ensuring a greater proportion of donor support was
transferred though the budget. The PRSC process identified a number of residual areas on
which to focus:

      approved budget (delineating priority sector budget codes in the context of PRSC-2
       and PRSC-3) in line with PRSP objectives and continued protection of priority sector
       allocations from cuts during budget execution;
      three-year, rolling budget guidelines, consistent with PRSP priorities (and resource
       needs identified during the PRSP-sectoral review process), issued to Ministries,
       Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and Local Government Authorities (LGAs);
      strengthening of policy units in all key or priority sectors of MDAs;
      use of the IMF‘s Government Finance Statistics classification for preparation of LGA
       budgets, as well as for the FY2005 development budget, and preparation of 2004
       LGA budgets using the MTEF format;
      consistent reporting on budget execution starting in FY2003 as per identified
       expenditure budget codes for priority sectors and items;
      expenditure tracking work undertaken and recommendations to strengthen the
       reporting system implemented;
      provision of user-friendly information to the public on budget performance, including
       LGAs‘ budget and accounts information; and

18.     The PRSC used public expenditure management prior actions that were consistent
with the PRSP/MKUKUTA objectives as well as expenditure outturns with projected budget
allocations and reporting of expenditures by budgetary codes. The government completed all
prior actions related to public expenditure management reforms under the PRSCs (Table
C.6), but the program was only partly successful in terms of outcomes. According to the PER
of 2004/05, which covered the period of the first series of PRSCs, there were a number of
areas in which progress had been less than expected. In particular, in terms of consistency of
budget with actual expenditures, the PER found that the aggregate deviation indicator based
on MDA‘s (spending units) might have hidden the fact that ―over-spending‖ units leaned
toward more of administrative expenditures (public administration, defense, foreign affairs),
while under-spending units constituted those with more expenditures directly going to

the monitoring indicator on the share of votes with deviations greater than 5 percent was the
adequate one to use for assessment.

orientation of public services.


19.     The PER also concluded that public investment projects remained not quite in line
with the growth focus of NSGRP. There had been no major shift in investments toward
infrastructure despite the fact that infrastructure had been identified as the main constraint for
growth. In addition, it noted that in spite of impressive efforts made in enhancing the link
between policy and resource allocation by strengthening the formulation of medium term
budget strategy, there was still the need to develop strategic nature of the Budget Guidelines
so that they become a comprehensive instrument for guiding public finances over the
medium-term. The PER also found that in spite of the recommendation made in the previous
PER external evaluation, there had been little progress in compiling actual expenditure data
for the local government authorities. The main reasons for slow of progress seemed to be
weak capacity in local government authorities and the Prime Minister‘s Office-Regional
Authorities and Local Government and the lack of a standard reporting format, which were
areas of emphasis of the PRSCs.

20.      With respect to resource mobilization issues, there was only one prior action targeted
at the rationalization of local government taxies and levies in PRSC-2. While this policy
action was completed, it introduced unintended consequences. The government abolished
nuisance taxes in the 2002/03 budget, and introduced compensatory grants to local
government authorities to replace the lost revenue. But these grants were characterized by: (i)
delays and unpredictable flow of the compensatory funds from the Ministry of Finance; (ii)


                                                                   101
ANNEX C


inadequacy of remaining sources of revenue for local government authorities and a further
erosion of their fiscal autonomy; (iii) the inability of councils to transfer a share of the
compensation grants to villages; and (iv) a weakened drive to strengthen good governance.
Some local government authorities invented mechanisms to cope with the abolition of
various levies, including by collecting more from city service levies and property taxes,
selling rights to erect bill boards, and dropping some projects.

Objective 3: Enhancing public service performance.

21.     The relevant triggers and prior actions for this objective included core public financial
management (PFM) policies (implementing the recommendations of the Country Financial
and Accountability Assessment and linking them with the PFM Reform Program working
group and the technical assistance project) and pay enhancement for the Civil Service
(linking with the Public Service Reform working group and technical assistance project), as
shown in Table C.7. Prior actions for procurement reform—which could improve efficiency
and help minimize leakage from the budget—and implementation of the recommendations of
the Country Procurement Assessment Review were included in PRSC-2 and 3. PRSC-2 also
supported capacity building in the president‘s office for monitoring local government
finances, the expansion of which was being assisted by the 2004 Bank‘s Local Government
Reform operation, part of which served as budget support for local governments.

22.     Prior actions with respect to public service performance were implemented almost in
their entirety. With respect to public financial management, progress was made on most of
the components of the PFM Reform Program, particularly in areas supported by parallel
projects (such as, further development of the integrated financial management system,
external resource management and procurement). In the 2006 Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability report, stronger than average performance was observed in cash
management and policy-based budgeting, with average performance in accounting and
reporting, comprehensiveness and transparency, procurement, and budget credibility.
Although PRSCs 1-3 concentrated its targets and prior actions on these issues, one cannot
say whether the PRSCs led to the better performance in those issues, or whether those issues
were picked up in the PRSCs because performance was good anyway.61 On the other hand,
fiduciary concerns—external scrutiny, and auditing, which were not in focus under the
PRSC—got lower Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability scores, while
establishing the PFM Reform Program as a coordination mechanism took more time than
expected.

23.     Civil service pay reform was part of a longer agenda that had included an earlier
phase of downsizing in the 1990s, which had succeeded better than in most countries (PER
2002; IEG 2008), largely because it came at a time when privatization and private sector
growth opened job opportunities in the private sector, while inflation decimated the real
value of public sector salaries, especially at the upper levels leading to loss of staff. In the
2000s, the remaining problems were the inadequate salaries at upper levels to compete with
the private labor market, the offsetting arrangements to have allowances make up for low
regular salaries, and the insufficient incentives for teachers and health specialists to work in

61
   As noted in the PPAR on PRSCs 4-8, the core budget areas were not singled out as targets in the
second series, and the 2009 PEFA scores declined in all five. The revenue administration and
fiduciary areas, on the other hand, had triggers in the second series, and their PEFA scores all
improved from 2006 to 2009. Irish Aid and DFID (2011, p.36).

under-served areas. While the pay raises during PRSCs 1-3 met the triggers, they were not
well targeted and did not make progress on the difficult issues, which reflected a problem
with program design in terms of targeting.62 Rather than enhancing pay for positions that
were most difficult to fill, such as service-delivery personnel in remote areas, employees
were permitted to access travel allowances that exceeded the cost of travel. This was, in
effect, a salary supplement. But it was concentrated among civil servants with strong
connections who were not on the front lines, and gave them incentive to travel excessively
away from their jobs (Twaweza, 2010).

24.     Procurement received substantial attention, with prior actions in PRSC-2 and 3.
PRSC-1 included an annex with the recommendations of the 2003 Country Procurement
Assessment Review, which were prepared ―in parallel‖ with the PRSC and found that
―procurement is a neglected function‖ (Country Procurement Assessment Review, 2003, p.
121). The centerpiece of procurement reform, which was important for improving the
effectiveness of public investment and for reducing corruption, was the transfer of
procurement activity from the central tender board to ministries, agencies and local
government, and the establishment of a Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA).
In accord with recommended best practice, the PPRA would enforce regulations and provide
a somewhat independent check on the procuring entities, ensuring a more competitive
process and reducing leakage of government resources. By 2006, the procurement
assessment for the PEFA review was giving good marks for the improved set up of the
procurement process, although there was not a track record yet of implementation. The
Auditor General‘s report on Central Government for 2006/07 also gave good marks for
procurement, but noted that ―justification for use of less competitive methods is weak and is
not yet routinely monitored.‖

25.     Although there were no triggers in PRSCs 1-3 for explicit anti-corruption measures,
the concern with corruption and possible remedies was mentioned over 40 times in the
program document for PRSC-1. It was also a policy trigger for the high-case scenario in the
2001-03 CAS, which required the ―dissemination of the national and sector specific anti-
corruption plans; implement sector specific action plans against corruption in the seven areas
surveyed‖ (World Bank 2003). In general, the improved financial management, procurement
and transparency during the implementation of the PRSC series seemed to have had
beneficial anti-corruption effects, in line with the findings of the PSRC evaluation (IEG,
2010). Although subject to technical limitations, Tanzania‘s International Country Risk
Guide (ICRG) rating on corruption improved from 2 (on a 1-6 scale) to 2.6 in 2006 and 3.5 in
2007 (before declining again), and the Bank‘s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA) rating for transparency and anti-corruption was up to 3.5 in 2005-07, after which it
also declined. 63



62
   The program document for PRSC-3 noted: ―At present the gains made in reducing the number of
allowances at the beginning of the program seem to be eroding.‖ (World Bank, 2005, p. 37).
63
  The CPIA is based on Bank economists‘ and sector specialists‘ rating of 20 items in four
categories. The rating scale is 1-6, with 6 representing the highest achievement.

26.     The Bank‘s support for decentralization in Tanzania (referred to as decentralization
by devolution) came mainly through the LGRP credit, which was partly for local capacity
building and partly for formula-based grants to support local government investment, which
was where local government had the most control. To complement this, PRSC-2 supported
the strengthening the capacity of the central administration to monitor activity by local
governments (hiring 3 staff and for getting information technology equipment in the central
office and some regional offices) and extending decentralized procurement authority to local
governments.64 The Public Procurement Regulatory Authority was intended to regulate the
local government tender boards. The approach did not address the largest areas of nominal
sub-national spending—in education and health—as the local governments had little
discretion in these areas. As the program document for PRSC-2 (World Bank, 2004a, p. 40)
noted, ―the lack of a clear and unified position with respect to decentralization of human
resources management raises concern and it is hoped that the study will provide a clear
direction for the way forward.‖ This assessment concurs. In PRSC-3 there were no triggers or
prior actions for decentralization, but rather reports of delays and plans to make more
progress in the future.

Objective 4: Strengthening environmental management.

27.      The PRSC introduced a new objective under PRSC-2 to strengthen environmental
management because, it was argued, the poor were heavily dependent on the environment for
both income generation and consumption. There were no triggers in the series designed to
achieve the objective; rather the PRSC used dialogue to support the government‘s efforts to
address environmental issues identified in National Environmental Action Plan (1994) and
the National Environmental Policy (NEP) adopted in 1997. This was done through three
approaches: (a) mainstreaming of environmental concerns into the dialogue on poverty
reduction through the budget process and sectoral policy dialogue; (b) improving
understanding of the poverty-environment linkages in Tanzania; and (c) strengthening
institutional capacity to integrate environmental assessment (EA) procedures into sectoral
strategies and Policies.

28.     In December 2002, the Cabinet approved an Institutional and Legal Framework for
Environmental Management Program, which provides the basis for Environmental Impact
Assessment, cross-sectoral coordination, and integration of environment management into
local government planning processes. A number o f key sector policies and strategies in
forestry, agriculture, fisheries and mining that followed reflected an increasing focus on
internalizing environmental sustainability objectives and empowering the poor for improved
resource management.

29.     The Bank conducted under PRSC 1 and 2 various pieces of economic and sector work
focused on identifying the linkages between key macro and structural reforms policies and
the environment. This analysis identified measures at both national and local government
levels to reduce poverty and enhance environmental sustainability of policy reforms. The

Report in which the Prime Minister‘s Office-Regional and Local Governments monitors local

analysis highlighted two findings linking the environment and poverty: (a) it is important to
ensure that poverty reduction programs do not damage the resource base and the environment
of which poor depend for their livelihood; and (b) improving environmental conditions could
help reduce poverty and promote sustainable pro-poor growth. It is not clear what the nature
of the follow-up to these findings was.

30.     Through support for an intensive consultation process, PRSC-3 assisted in the
passage of the Environmental Management Act (EMA) by Parliament. An initial needs
assessment for implementation of the EMA was conducted as part of the first PER on
environment. A draft Environmental Impact Assessment training manual was prepared, as
well as a Strategic Environmental Assessment for the PRSC. The ICR for PRSC 1-3 noted
that there were ongoing discussions regarding the potential for initiating a Sector Wide
Approach for environmental management to support the implementing the National
Environmental Management Act, but this did not materialize.

31.    PRSC-2 specified five indicators to monitor, none of which were tracked, nor were
available in the field. Targets for three of these indicators were reduced dramatically in the
program document for PRSC-3. For instance, the target for the share of sectors with
environmental units was reduced from 90 percent to 40 percent.

1.     The first outcome area covers the program‘s contributions to macroeconomic policy
and improving the business environment. Indicators for this outcome are summarized in
Table D.1—two targets were not met, and the modest PRSC target for the third was met
while the more ambitious MKUKUTA target was not.

2.      The Bank did not devote as much attention in this series of PRSCs to policies to
support macroeconomic stability as in the first series, with the IMF continuing in its lead role
through the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The PRSC input was limited to strengthening of
budget and public expenditure management, without specific triggers related to debt
management. This PRSC series focused on two broad policy actions: (a) approved budget in
line with policy objectives and (b) expenditure outturn consistent with approved budget as
shown in Table D.2. These results were under the ―Resource Allocation and Budget
Consistency‖ section of the result framework. Residual items from the first series of
operations, such as inadequate budget reporting by the local governments, was not
specifically followed up in the second series of PRSCs. Similarly, the PER reforms were
categorized under the objective of ―improved state of governance and accountability.‖ The
aggregate deviation of expenditures for recurrent budget was the only monitoring indicator
applied here and differed from the indicator used in the first series of PRSCs, which was the
percentage of agencies with deviation above 5 percent.

3.      Fiscal sustainability and debt management were monitored in the context of
discussion on fiscal deficit (with a target of below 5 percent of GDP) and CPI inflation
(annual inflation below 4 percent). The fiscal deficit rose above its target level during 2008-
10 due to the poor revenue performance since 2008, a surge in discretionary spending, and
the fiscal stimulus put in place to withstand the global crisis (as advised by development
partners). By 2011, Tanzania‘s debt to GDP ratio was close to 40 percent, up from the lowest
level of around 25 percent on the onset of the program in 2005, but below the MKUKUTA
target of 50 percent. Both revenue and expenditure factors led to higher than expected
contracting of debt. The tax revenue to GDP ratio did not improve since 2007; and there was

a rapid increase in expenditures (not related to the fiscal stimulus following the crisis). The
PRSCs paid little attention to macroeconomic stability in the series, and so it cannot be
plausibly argued that it contributed directly to these outcomes.

4.     Improving the business environment was central to the effort of the MKUKUTA to
promote shared growth. PRSC-4 highlighted residual actions from the first PRSC series that
needed attention. These included supporting a private sector development strategy, a second
phase of labor legislation, and improving the investment climate. Triggers and prior actions
(Table D.3) were identified for reforms to improve the business environment, while the
progress in the private sector development strategy and the second phase of labor legislation
was expected to be achieved through policy dialogue.

5.      The expected outcome was an improvement in Tanzania‘s Doing Business ranking,
with a MKUKUTA target value of 99 (and a PRSC target of 130) compared to the baseline
of 136. The MKUKUTA target was not met—overall improvement in the Doing Business
indicator under the second series of PRSCs was insignificant—although the much more

modest PRSC objective was achieved. There was progress on an absolute scale for some of
the sub-indicators, notably for the indicator of the cost of starting a business (down from 187
percent of per capita GDP in 2005 to 37 percent in 2010 ) and trading across borders, both in
terms of number of documents and number of days needed for transactions. For imports the
number of documents was reduced from 16 in 2005 to 7 in 2010, and the number of days was
reduced from 51 to 31. For exports the number of days was reduced from 30 to 24. There
was, however, deterioration for other sub-indicators, including the number of days required
for getting construction permits that increased from 276 to 303 days, and the cost of getting a
construction permit that increased from around 100 percent of per capita GDP in 2005 to
around 1,200 percent of per capita GDP in 2010. Tanzania‘s ranking remains poor even by
regional standards.65

6.      The implementation of private sector development reforms under PRSC4-8 was slow
and faded out after PRSC-5. Initial delays in preparation of the private sector development
strategy were prompted by the need to complete a Bank-initiated Diagnostic Trade
Integration Study, although completion of the trade study did not lead to follow-up activities
on the private sector development strategy. Similarly, the second phase of labor legislation
that was also expected to be part of the policy dialogue was delayed. On the other hand, two
of the three triggers related to the legislation for business environment reforms were carried
out and converted into prior actions (Table D.3). The legislation was submitted to the
Parliament in July 2005 and was approved in January 2007. The expectation that the
government would follow up on the adoption of legislation by introducing governmental
decrees for establishing one-stop-shop business registration system did not materialize. The
associated trigger was dropped and subsequently led to the USD 10 million reductions in the
size of PRSC-7. There was minimal plausibility linking policy actions carried out under the
PRSCs to the very modest improvements in the business environment as measured by the
Doing Business Indicators.

  Indicators that are based on country rankings are not ideal—a country may make significant
progress, but slower than other countries, and this would not be reflected in the indicator.

7.     The second outcome area for the objective of growth and reduction of income
poverty—increased access of private sector to key inputs—covers the program‘s
contributions to energy and transport sectors, which were expected to provide backbone
services. Indicators for this intermediate outcome are summarized in Table D.4. The country
met PRSC targets for two of the five indicators, and nearly met two others.

8.      A reliable and affordable supply of electricity was considered essential by the
MKUKUTA for economic growth and poverty reduction in Tanzania. The PRSC, as
articulated in the program document for PRSC-5, sought to help the government improve
access to electricity for the private sector, reduce vulnerability of the sector to climatic
conditions, achieve greater installed capacity, and help Tanzania Electric Supply Company
(TANESCO) to achieve full cost recovery. These reforms were expected to (i) address
energy generation shortages by expanding capacity and reducing reliance on hydro power;
(ii) improve TANESCO‘s autonomy and commercial focus to avoid repetition of recent
energy crises; (iii) improve TANESCO‘s cash flow to reduce fiscal drain on federal budget
by increasing tariffs to meet long run marginal cost, securing a commercial loan, and
optimizing the mix between hydro and thermal plants; and (iv) improve the monitoring of
service delivery and financial performance of TANESCO by the Electricity and Water
Utilities Regulatory Authority, ensuring competitive procurement (World Bank 2007b). In
this respect, the PRSC included three relatively vague triggers in the energy sector, which

were focused on achieving financial recovery for TANESCO (Table D.5). All three triggers
and associated prior actions were considered completed.

9.       One of the two targets for electricity was largely achieved, but the other indicator was
inappropriate and evidence suggests the goal was not achieved. During the period, Tanzania
was able to expand generating capacity and reduce reliance on hydro power. Capacity
increased from 980 MW in 2007 to 1072 MW in 2010 (Figure 13). The Bank team reported
that installed capacity reached 1,309 MW by March 2012, the difference a result of new (and
costly) emergency power supply. The growth through 2010 fell just short of the PRSC target
of 1091 MW in 2010 and significantly short of the MKUKUTA target of 1278 MW for 2010,
although production levels increased. The increase in capacity through 2010 was largely due
to a Bank-financed project that introduced natural gas power plants operated by independent
power producers, which helped to reduce TANESCO‘s reliance on hydropower from 57
percent to 52 percent, as shown in Figure 4. But private investment fell far below
expectations. Since 2010, TANESCO has been renting high-cost emergency plants, with
capacity of an additional 262 MW in 2012. Tariffs that can be charged by TANESCO are far
below costs for renting this additional capacity. The government has a plan for further
expansion, but development partners offered serious doubts that these investments would be
financed. Further, the increases in capacity and production notwithstanding, the quality and
reliability of electricity supply remained poor.66



66
  A 2010 World Bank report noted that at about 22 MW per million people, installed capacity per
capita in Tanzania is roughly on par with other low income countries whose average is roughly 24
MW per million (Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic 2010). But per capita electricity


                                                             111

10.      The Implementation Completion and Results Report indicated that electricity capacity
utilization improved from 62 percent to 85 percent, but this is not an appropriate measure of
the availability of the power supply. Power outages remain a fact of life in Tanzania. While
there may have been modest improvement in recent years in the duration of outages
according to TANESCO data, their frequency has changed little. A 2010 World Bank report
estimated the burden of power outages on the economy as high as 4 percent of GDP, noting
that ―Excessive levels of outages result in elevated demand for emergency power and a high
level of own generation by firms. The latter pushes the costs of production up; complicates
survival of businesses, especially small ones; and makes the economy less competitive.
Emergency power supply, another major problem for development, poses a serious fiscal
burden that amounts to 0.95 percent of GDP‖ (Shkaratan 2010: 8). A World Bank study on
self-generation in Sub-Saharan Africa reported that, according to World Bank Enterprise
Surveys, there are roughly 63 days with power outages per year in Tanzania, more than all
but three other countries in the region, and as a result 59 percent of firms own their own
generator (Foster and Steinbuks 2009). And a recent survey by the Confederation of
Tanzania Industries found that on average over 2008-2010 ―24 working-hours of labour (all
employees) and all other respective employed factors of production are lost each month
owing to electricity supply interruptions‖ (CTI 2011: 18). That report also cites concerns
among manufacturers about significant fluctuations in the voltage level.

11.     Efforts to improve the autonomy of TANESCO yielded limited results. Stakeholders
perceive TANESCO‘s commercial focus to have improved substantially, but not yet close to
a private commercial entity. Investment in pre-payment systems improved collection but
transmission and distribution losses remained high, rising during the period from 21.0
percent in 2007 to 23.3 percent in 2010. As such, operational cost recovery was not achieved

consumption in Tanzania falls far below comparator countries, suggesting leakage and unreliability of
power plants.

by 2010 as targeted by PRSC-8, but claims to the national budget were reduced considerably
(TANESCO, Annual Reports 2005-2010).67 The establishment of the Energy and Water
Utility Regulatory Authority has led to successive increases in electricity tariffs, bringing
them closer in line with costs. The Authority is seen by stakeholders to have relatively strong
capacity to monitor the industry, and was named best regulator in 2010 in a study
commissioned by the Africa Forum for Utility Regulators. But the Authority was unable to
fully enforce rules for competitive procurement and reported that TANESCO‘s cost of
providing power was higher than it would have been without sole source selection.

12.    The PRSC contributed to these outcomes to a limited extent. The focus of the
dialogue was the financial recovery of TANESCO and improving its management. While
TANESCO is not fully self-sufficient, it has made significant strides by winning approval to
increase tariffs. Improved management has likely contributed to a reduction in the duration of
outages, but expansion in capacity has been driven by the availability of government and
development partner funds.

13.     Policy support under the PRSC for the transport sector was intended to contribute to
the objective of promoting sustainable and broad-based growth by improving the condition of
the road network, and later, improvement in port efficiency. The triggers and prior actions
that formed the basis of the PRSC dialogue are outlined in Table D.6. Four of the six triggers
were fully completed within the stipulated timeframe and two others were delayed. Among
those triggers converted to prior actions, the trigger for ports—to prepare a time-bound action
plan—was diluted considerably, and the prior action was reworded to preparing a
preliminary version of a time-bound action plan.

14.     Because the two of the six triggers were essentially repeated after delays, prior
actions covered four areas: enactment of the Roads Act; development of a Transport Sector
Investment Plan (TSIP) with adequate provision for maintenance; adoption of a framework
for public-private-partnership (PPP); and actions to reduce port congestion. The Roads Act,
the TSIP, the framework for PPPs, and an action plan for the Tanzania Ports Authority were
intended to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for the transport sector, and
prioritize investment and maintenance spending. The reduction of port congestion was
intended to reduce transport costs for the private sector directly.




67
  While the drain on the budget has been reduced, hidden costs remain. For instance, a private
investor was awarded $65 million in an arbitration case in 2010, and a corruption case is currently
under court review, but neither the award nor a contingent liability appear on TANESCO‘s balance
sheet, suggesting that the government will be covering relevant costs.

15.     The effort to strengthen the institutional and policy framework for the transport sector
was spearheaded by the passage of the Roads Act in April 2007. It addressed three key
issues: (i) replacing the out-dated 1932 ordinance and recognizing the existence of Tanzania
National Roads Agency (TANROADS), the executive agency charged with developing and
maintaining the national and regional roads network, as well as the Roads Fund intended for
road maintenance; (ii) classifying public roads utilizing a Bank-financed inventory; and (iii)
specifying the roles and responsibilities of relevant government ministries and authorities,
including their clarifying their governance.



                                                             114
                                                                                       ANNEX D


16.    The Ports Authority, which was to prepare an action plan to transform itself from an
operator of the ports to a landlord in line with the Port Act of 2004, only managed a
preliminary action plan while the actual transition to landlord status, beyond existing
arrangements whereby some container terminals are already operated by a private party, was
not expected to change until 2018, according to government officials.

17.     To promote private investment in the transport sector, the Bank and government
agreed that a strong institutional and policy framework for investment was required given the
poor track record of PPPs in Tanzania. Initially, a framework for PPPs in the transport sector
was to be developed as part of the TSIP (a trigger for PRSC-7), but the government instead
decided to expand the policy beyond the transport sector, and so the TSIP included a
―roadmap‖, which outlined the timing in which a framework would be prepared and
approved. As of May 2009, the Bank considered the proposed PPP framework as putting
Tanzania ―on par with some of the best institutional and regulatory regimes in developing
countries,‖ with a central PPP agency under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs
responsible for PPP promotion, packaging, negotiations, and vetting of fiscal impacts. But
the final bill, which was ultimately approved by Parliament in July 2010, was considered by
the Bank to be only on par with policies in other countries because of its lack of clarity on the
division of government responsibility among the various implementing agencies (the
Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, the Attorney General and the ministry
responsible for investment in the relevant sector).

18.     To prioritize investment and maintenance spending, the TSIP was prepared in 2006 as
agree under PRSC-6. Prior to the introduction of the PRSC trigger, there was a doubling of
the fuel levy to TSh 200 per liter and a concomitant increase in the size of the Roads Fund
from TSh 101 billion in 2006/07 to TSh 208 billion in 2007/08. Because the Roads Fund
finances road maintenance, the coverage of routine maintenance needs rose that year to over
115 percent, and the coverage of periodic maintenance needs stood at 54 percent, according
to internal Roads Fund figures. Since the changes occurred prior to the introduction of the
trigger/prior action, the PRSC trigger appears to have been meant to institutionalize the
prioritization of maintenance. But the coverage of routine maintenance subsequently fell to
82 percent in 2008/09, 70 percent in 2009/10, and 64 percent in 2010/11, and the coverage of
periodic maintenance fluctuated from 52 percent in 2008/09, to 64 percent in 2009/10, to 58
percent in 2010/11 (Road Fund internal sources). Nevertheless, the TSIP did make attempts
to align itself with the actual budget allocations, but indicated that only 40 percent of the
estimated cost of implementing the program had been committed by the government and
development partners. The program expected the private sector to fill most of the gap, which
did not happen. The government produced a transport sector medium-term expenditure
framework and several rolling short-term TSIPs to try to match the required investment in the
program with the available budget, but these were unsuccessful. Indeed, in 2009/10, roads
contracts were signed by government agencies that amounted to twice the allocated funding,
a problem that cut into the available funding for other development projects and rolled over
into subsequent years and led to the suspension of the signing of any new contracts.

19.    Complementing the efforts to strengthen the institutional framework and improve
investment spending priorities, the Ports Authority was expected to reduce port congestion
through several measures. An increase in port storage tariffs and a reduction in free time


                                              115
ANNEX D


were granted by the Surface and Maritime Regulatory Authority (SUMATRA), and the
government established inland container depots to store containers outside the port area.
These measures helped reduce some congestion, which may have also been affected by the
global economic slowdown, but Bank and IFC staff and informants from the private sector
still views delays in port clearance of cargo as a significant obstacle for investment. A
constraining factor is that port clearance requires approval by many players in the
government. Aside from logistics handled by Tanzania Ports Authority, cargo must be
cleared by customs, the Tanzania Revenue Authority, the Government Chemist Laboratory
Agency, the Tanzania Food and Drugs Authority, and like institutions. The government has
created a single window system where all relevant institutions have an office at the port. But
a number of agencies have not decentralized authority and require clearance from
headquarters, generating additional delays. A 2009 study by the Revenue Authority
concluded that processes for document submission needed streamlining; that many
procedures still need to be automated and harmonized across agencies; and that infrastructure
including access roads and cargo handling equipment remain insufficient (Tanzania Revenue
Authority 2009).

20.     Overall, the government‘s program in the transport sector was unable to achieve the
key targets it set out for itself. Improvement in the condition of national and regional roads
was negligible; more recent data indicate some improvement in the past year, although still
well below the target. The shortcomings were likely accounted for by the shortfall in
maintenance financing—after a burst in resources made available in 2007/08, maintenance
funds covered less than two-thirds of routine maintenance and less than 60 percent of
periodic maintenance—although severe weather and the apparent reclassification of district
roads as national and regional roads may have contributed. There was real improvement in
the efficiency of the Dar es Salaam port, with container dwell time falling from its peak in
2008 even as traffic increased. The PRSC likely contributed modestly to this improvement in
performance by encouraging an increased tariff and alternative means for storage, but longer
term issues regarding port efficiency do not appear likely to be addressed given the lack of
strategic consensus between the Bank and the Ports Authority.

21.     The third outcome area for the objective of growth and reduction of income
poverty—improved livelihood in rural areas—covers the program‘s contributions to
agriculture and rural development, natural resources, and transport sectors. Indicators for this

22.     The agricultural sector was expected to grow in excess of 5 percent per annum in
order to make possible sustained economy-wide GDP growth of 6-8 percent, and help to
reduce income poverty. The government‘s strategy to facilitate agricultural growth was a
continuation of the policies in the previous three years in the context of the agricultural sector
development strategy, which included (i) reform of crop boards; (ii) reform of local
government taxation; and (iii) improvements in rural infrastructure. Other important areas of
policy included reform related to improving the security of land rights to increase on-farm
investment. Following amendments to the Land Acts (under PRSC 1-3), the government
initiated a strategic plan for its implementation, which included land surveys and titling of
land.

23.     PRSC 4-8 supported the agricultural drive of MKUKUTA through the
complementary IDA supported Agricultural Sector Development Project, approved on June
15, 2006, with a closing expected on June 30, 2013. The series focused on residual issues
related to uncompleted reforms on the crop boards and land registration from the previous
PRSC1-3 series. In addition, issues related to ―nuisance‖ local taxes on agriculture were also
highlighted by the close of the series (Table D.8).

24.      The trigger and prior actions related to crop boards under PRSC 4-6 were met against
significant political pressure, although somewhat diluted. The important step of halting the
price-setting function of crop boards was achieved with the issuance of a circular abolishing
the use of levies by crop boards and requiring them to limit their functions to regulatory
activities. On the other hand, the trigger under PRSC-5 requiring amendments of crop board
legislation for at least two crop boards was not submitted to Parliament. Instead the
government decided to conduct consultations as preparatory work to reform all four crop
boards simultaneously, a more ambitious agenda that would take longer and to sign a
memorandum of understanding, which became the binding prior action. In the end, only draft

amendments to crop board legislation, which was submitted for stakeholder consultations,
were achieved. Follow-up strategic plans for all crop boards have not yet been finalized.

25.     The PRSC 4-8 series also supported the government‘s initiative to scale up
decentralized land registration both in urban and rural areas. Some progress was realized with
about 7,000 villages surveyed and registered out of about 11,000, but the issuance of
certificates of customary rights of occupancy (CCROs) for individual customary landowners
was delayed. In addition, the development of efficient land registries has been lagging, with
limited progress in modernizing the central and zonal land registries, and limited capacity of
local government authorities to develop land registry systems that match their responsibilities
under the law. With limited access to titling and registration, management of land has
remained problematic on the ground, with many land disputes and lack of transparency in
land management practices, as well as lack of an instrument to track women‘s ownership of

land. The limitations are in part due to the inadequate implementation of the land laws,
particularly titling and registration (PRSC-8) which has been fragmented through a series of
small and somewhat disjointed pilots. As a consequence, it has received insufficient
resources and little policy attention. The Strategic Plan for the Implementation of Land
Legislation was finalized in 2005 but its implementation has been slow. To date,
participatory village land-use plans have been prepared in 1,000 villages out of more than
11,000 villages that exist in mainland Tanzania. The National Land Use Framework Plan has
been drafted and is in the process of being finalized for the Cabinet‘s approval. Implementing
the Land Use Planning Act 2007, the Framework Plan is an indicative, basic, general plan
that facilitates rational allocation of land resources, decision-making, and management at the
national level while ensuring their sustainability.

26.     The trigger introduced in PRSC-8 to begin tackling the issue of ―nuisance‖ taxes was
dropped because the updating of the Facility for Investment Climate Advisory Services study
was not completed. In general, government commitment with respect to the policy dialogue
in agriculture decline appreciably under PRSC 4-8. It could in part be due to the political
sensitivity of the nature of the dialogue and the impending presidential and parliamentary
elections for the fall of 2010.

27.     In terms of outcome, it is estimated that growth in agriculture averaged 4 percent per
year during 2006-10, short of the PRSC program target of 6 percent and far short of the
MKUKUTA target of 10 percent. Even this modest outcome is questionable as some doubt
has been expressed about the integrity of the data on agricultural growth. Taking the data as
accurate, agricultural growth is still only marginally faster than that of population growth,
and appears to be, as under PRSCs 1-3, derived mainly from continued expansion of
cultivated areas rather than increases in yields. Similarly, the impact of policy successes such
as progress on land registration, and reform of the crop boards towards regulation and away
from marketing are too early to yield perceptible outcomes in terms of improved access to
credit and reduction of ―nuisance taxes.‖ As such, much of the outcomes under agriculture
cannot be attributed to the PRSCs.

28.     Natural resource issues were specially highlighted in PRSC-7 and -8, in response to
the findings of the analytic work on growth contained in the Bank‘s Country Economic
Memorandum of 2007. The natural resource sector, defined to include tourism, mining,
forestry, and fisheries, was considered to be a significant income supplement to many
Tanzanians, although much of it operated in the informal economy. The sector was viewed as
a growing source of income, generating exports from traditional activities in forestry,
fisheries, mining, and tourism. A key issue that needed attention was the failure of public
oversight in the form of adequate regulatory framework and enforcement leading to
production and marketing practices for these resources that undermined sustainable growth in
the sector. The focus of the PRSC in the area of natural resources was thus ―to build a policy
agenda to bring better transparency, to achieve poverty education and environmental
sustainability‖ (World Bank, 2009a).

29.     The initial trigger and prior action (Table D.9) had the objective of setting the stage
for reform of the licensing and concession regimes in natural resource management. Meeting
this conditionality was hindered by data availability and therefore the prior action had to be
watered down. The follow-up trigger in PRSC 8 aimed at enhancing reform of the licensing
and concession regimes in natural resources management. This was completed satisfactorily
as the action plan to improve accountability and transparency in allocating natural resource
licenses and concessions was approved and implementation initiated.

30.      Overall, the objective to improve the natural resource institutional environment,
especially in terms of transparency, to allow for a more sustainable and profitable
exploitation of the resources for local communities was substantially attained and the PRSC
played a substantial role in this effort.68 Using as a performance indicator, the level of
revenues received from concession and license in forestry as percentage of their estimated
values, the rise from 15 percent in 2007 to 50 percent by 2010 points to gains in the new
framework. In addition, concerns over the mining sector, including the level of revenue
generated by the sector and captured by the government (through royalties, taxes, and so on),
prompted the government to issue a new Mining Act (the United Republic of Tanzania,
2009). On February 16, 2009, with Bank support, Tanzania joined the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative as a Candidate Country and is currently at the validation stage.
Following a request for extension, Tanzania has until February 15, 2013, to undertake
validation, in which its compliance with the Initiative‘s principles and standards would be
assessed. Successful validation pave the way for a more transparent framework in the sector,
a situation widely supported by operators in the sector.

Objective 2: Improvements in the quality of life and social well-being.

31.     The three outcome areas serve roughly as a further articulation of the objective, and
so progress in these areas would lead directly to achieving the objective. But the PRSC‘s role
in contributing to progress was modest. It played a potentially important but supportive role,
giving extra incentive to have a productive sector-level dialogue.

32.     In total, four out of seven targets were met, and substantial progress was made toward
reaching two others. The country met two of the three targets with regard to improving the
health status of the population, on child vaccinations and HIV/AIDS prevalence, while
limited progress was made on the third indicator related to births attended by skilled health
workers. Similarly, two of three targets were met in the outcome area of education. The
primary completion and tertiary education enrollment targets were met, and the primary
enrollment target nearly so, but progress in improving the quality of education was slow and
the program fell short of the target. In improving access to clean water, there was significant
progress, but the target was missed.

33.    The first outcome area covers the program‘s contributions to the health sector to
improve the health status of the population. Indicators for this outcome are summarized in
Table D.10, which shows that two of the three targets were met.

34.     The triggers and prior actions for health in the second PRSC series focused on the
annual sector reviews, with greater specificity in defining a satisfactory review toward the
end of the series, as shown in Table D.11. The documentation of the PRSCs and of GBS
generally made clear that implementation of the PRSCs in the health sector was expected to
be a continuation of the process that had been underway in the health sector since 1999. This
had both resulted in improved performance in the sector and in a sector dialogue, which was
recognized as best approximating the ideals of donor harmonization under the Paris
Declaration. The assessment of the annual sector reviews under both PRSC-4 and 5 were
mixed pointing out both achievements and shortcomings in the sector; but overall the process
was regarded as satisfactory with adequate progress made. PRSC-6, the first under a new
CD and TTL, seemed to take a more critical tack. While acknowledging the continued
achievements of the health sector, including the overall positive assessment of the just
published Joint External Evaluation for 2000-2006, the evaluation stressed the continuing

shortfall in the share of the budget devoted to health, difficulties in deploying health care
workers to underserved areas, delays in cash releases to spending units, especially local
government authorities, poor infrastructure maintenance, performance data gaps, and weak
management. On this basis it rated the annual sector review as ―fairly satisfactory.‖ This
resulted in the trigger being regarded as only partially completed, although these problems
had been recognized in earlier annual reviews.

35.     PRSC-6 and 7 had been intended to mark the transition from the health sector basket
fund to general budget support funding for the health sector. Bank staff clarified that this
transition would be conditional on commensurate increases in the allocation of resources to
the health sector by the Ministry of Finance, and on progressive improvements in
procurement systems and the satisfactory implementation of a health care waste management
plan. Critically, health budget allocations continued a steady negative trend (in terms of
share of total expenditure minus consolidated fund services in order to exclude non-
discretionary overheads such as debt service) begun in 2005 when the peak of 14 percent had
been reached. As a result the Ministry of Health opposed shifting funds from the health
sector basket fund to general budget support and reportedly told the development partners
that those who did not participate in direct health financing (such as the basket fund) would
not have a seat at the table with respect to sector dialogue. This was in sharp contrast to the
position of a few years earlier in which the Ministry of Health appeared ready to de-link
policy dialogue from direct sector financing. In an extreme example the MOH cited its
experience when DFID had abruptly shifted its entire health financing to general budget
support. The Ministry of Health claimed that it received no compensatory allocation from
the Ministry of Finance and consequently lost about USD 70 million from its annual budget.
While a more gradual transition with strengthened dialogue between the Ministry of Finance
and the Ministry of Health should have mitigated such a negative outcome for the Ministry of
Health, it seems that the general momentum toward general budget support away from sector
pooling had also begun to dissipate on the part of many development partners including the
Bank. In 2009, the Bank prepared a second installment of additional financing for the second

Health Sector Development Program II clearly signaling that the PRSC was no longer
expected to take over for sector financing.

36.      Over the PRSC 4-8 period, health outcomes continued to improve. In spite of the
declining budget share, public expenditure per-capita increased (due to the substantial
increase in overall public expenditure) and was anticipated to reach USD 14 per person by
2010/11. The 2010 Demographic and Health Survey documents continued marked declines
in infant and under-five mortality (of 30 percent and 22 percent respectively), putting
Tanzania on track to achieve its Millennium Development Goals in these areas. Targeted
vaccination rates and AIDS prevalence among 15-24 year olds which were the specific
results listed in the PRSC4-8 results matrix had already been achieved by 2008. Child
nutrition indicators also continued to improve and there was some evidence of a beginning
decline in maternal mortality (although large margins of estimation error preclude a
definitive trend). Significant disparities across districts remain and, as highlighted by a
review of the General Auditor‘s Office, little progress has been made in matching workload
to staff deployment. Little progress is evident on other issues raised by a 2007 joint
evaluation of the health sector in Tanzania (COWI and others 2007), including, for example,
poor hospital management, and a weak Public-Private Partnership framework.

37.    The second outcome area covers the program‘s contributions to the education sector
to expand enrollment and enhance quality in all levels of education. Indicators for this
outcome are summarized in Table D.12.

39.     PRSCs 5-8 focused on strengthening of the sector policy dialogue in education. The
process of annual sector reviews had only just begun in education, in contrast to the health
sector in which annual reviews were well established; but the performance of the Education
Sector Development Program (ESDP) and especially the Primary Education Development
Program (PEDP) had been widely regarded as successful (including by IEG in its Project
Performance Assessment Report of Bank support to education in Tanzania). As a result
education was regarded as one of the sectors most likely to mark the transition to GBS as the
primary aid modality. The satisfactory rating for the first education sector review in PRSC-5
seemed largely based on the successful initiation of the annual review and not on the
substance of the review. Recognizing the need to improve the annual review process, Bank
staff presented a proposed set of criteria to define a satisfactory sector review as part of the
PRSC-5 documentation.69 The education sector review carried out as a prior action for
PRSC-6, although more substantive than the previous year, fell short of these criteria in a
number of aspects, primarily related to an inadequate integration of progress on results with
reporting on outputs and financial allocations. The rushed timing and limited consultative
process may have also played a role. As a result, the PRSC-6 prior action was revised to a
―fairly satisfactory sector review.‖ This downgrading was across the board for similar
triggers in the health and water sectors. While no specific reductions were made from the
credit amount related to the diminished actions, the size of the PRSC-6 was USD30million
less than PRSC-5 marking a clear reversal from the previous upward trend in PRSC
contributions to GBS.




69
  These included: :( i) timely inputs to the budget process;(ii) involvement of a wide range of
stakeholders; (iii) assessment of performance against agreed benchmarks and targets;( iv) use of
reliable information stemming from sector MISs, Government of Tanzania statistics or MDA
implemented projects; and (v) a review of both retrospective and prospective actions. The definition
of ―reliable information‖ subsequently proved problematic as it could be interpreted to exclude third
party monitoring and data collection.

40.     By the mid-point in the series (PRSC6), the initial intention to gradually shift the bulk
of the Bank‘s education support from investment operations to the PRSC had changed and
preparation for a second secondary education development program as a sector adjustable
program loan (APL) supporting specific measures to address problems arising from the
spectacular expansion of secondary enrollment was initiated. The triggers for PRSC-7 and
PRSC-8 progressively made more explicit the requirement for the annual sector review to
focus on performance and on the linkage between results and sector funding and policies.
The quality of the sector reviews did improve and were deemed satisfactory by the
development partners. However other developments made the determination of sector review
quality more difficult. Following the ―fairly satisfactory‖ determination in 2008, the
government clarified that it would only respond to a binary determination – satisfactory or
not satisfactory. In addition the development partner sector working group developed a
weighting system which gave equal weights to outcomes, resources and dialogue in
determining the overall rating for the annual performance reviews. In the view of Bank staff
and some development partners, the combination of these factors reduced the leverage of the
annual sector review on GBS and the PRSCs by narrowing the assessment range.

41.      For the sector as a whole, the remarkable progress in increasing access to both
primary and secondary education leveled off during the second PRSC series. Primary net
enrolment ratios peaked at 97.2 percent in 2007/08, falling back to 94 percent in 2010/11.
Thus, the MKUKUTA target of 100 percent NER by 2010 was not achieved. However, the
MKUKUTA target of a 50 percent transition rate to secondary school was exceeded during
all but one year of this period. In addition, the number of qualified primary school teachers
increased and there was a slight improvement in pupil/teacher and pupil/classroom ratios.
Independent quality assessments were mixed. Uwezo, a regional NGO which conducted
surveys of literacy and numeracy across 38 randomly selected districts in Tanzania found
severe shortcomings in the competencies of primary school leavers: results which suggested
that Tanzania learning achievements were well below those in Uganda and Kenya. However
a regional initiative supported by 16 Ministries of Education, the Southern and Eastern Africa
Consortium for Measuring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) which conducted surveys in
2003 and 2007 found that Tanzanian students performed well above regional averages in
reading and arithmetic in both years and were one of the few countries to have significantly
improved performance between the two surveys. The SACMEQ and Uwezo assessments are
not comparable. Uwezo had a much larger sample and included household characteristics;
SACMEQ used more traditional school-based testing which may have been biased in the
selection of students. Analytic work undertaken for the 2010 PER found that education
developments in Tanzania represented good value for money overall; but that there was still
scope to improve value for money significantly by shifting resources to under-served
districts. Major differences in the efficiency of resources use across districts also suggested
that district efficiency be factored in to district resource allocations.

42.     The secondary education net enrollment ratio continued to rise but at a slower rate
than earlier in the decade growing from 24.4 percent in 2007 to 34.5 percent in 2010. Even
this slowing growth continued to put great strains on the overall education system.
Independent evidence from the NGO Twaweza suggested that the capitation grant of TSh
25,000, which was intended to contribute to learning materials and other non-salary support
to secondary schools, was actually being paid out at a small fraction of the mandated amount.


                                              125
ANNEX D


(The same shortfalls were found in the payout of the capitation grant to primary schools.)
After an initial deterioration in the ratio of secondary school pupils to qualified teacher, the
ratio did improve slightly toward the end of the period. Overall it appeared that aggregate
resources for secondary education were being squeezed between primary and higher
education student loans in addition to being spread across a much larger cohort of students.
The consequence was seen in a plummeting Form IV pass rate down from 26.7 percent in
2007 to 11.4 percent in 2009. In this context the Bank‘s focus in SEDPII for tackling the
problems that emerged with the rapid expansion of secondary enrollment seemed highly
appropriate. The MKUKUTA goal for higher education was met as the gross enrollment ratio
jumped from 0.27 percent in 2005/06 to 8 percent in 2010/11. However this remarkable
growth threatens the fiscal sustainability of the whole sector through the commensurate
growth of a student loan scheme which lacks adequate repayment mechanisms and is
inherently regressive. Overall, there were significant achievements in maintaining high levels
of enrollment at the primary and secondary level, and mixed evidence on quality.

43.     Actions in the water sector were intended to contribute to the objective of improving
quality of life and social well-being through increased access to clean, affordable and safe
water and sanitation. With the exception of PRSC-6 when the water sector review was
considered fairly satisfactory as in health and education, the triggers and prior actions were
all met (Table D.14). Initially, the focus on jump-starting the annual sector review process
was useful, particularly when standards were introduced for what constitutes a ―satisfactory‖
sector review. But over time, annual review meetings became excessively focused on the
rating rather than a discussion of policy actions critical to improve development outcomes.
Ultimately, all parties faced strong incentives to rate programs satisfactory, given their
interest in maintaining dedicated funding to the sector.

44.     To evaluate performance, the percentage of the population that had access to clean
and safe water, distinguished by rural and urban populations, was the only indicator
specified. This indicator was, however, subject to two significant limitations. First, access
was poorly defined and was sensitive to the assumption made on how many people had
access to household connection or water outlet. Second, the data provided from government
sources assumed that all connections or outlets were functional, given the absence of a
mechanism to identify functionality, but informants suggested there are a significant number
of non-functioning water points, particularly in rural areas.70




70
   A one-time water point mapping exercise, currently underway, will survey the existence and functionality of
rural water points. But given this will only be an end-of-period single observation, household survey data is the
most useful source to measure progress.

45.      Despite this limitation, available survey data71 suggested modest improvement in the
share of households using protected water sources, from 45 percent 57.8 percent in rural
areas and 73 percent to 86 percent in urban areas during 2007 and 2010, as shown in Table
D.15. This slightly fell short of the targets envisaged in the PRSC. There was also some
improvement by 2010 in the share of the rural population which could access clean and safe
water within 30 minutes (arise of nearly 20 percentage points over the baseline for 2007), but
this constituted less than half the rural population. Similar analysis for the urban population
was subject to data limitations, but there appears to be no improvement in the share of urban
population with access of clean and safe water within 30 minutes.72 For sanitation, the use of
pour flush toilets rose from 1 percent to 1.6 percent in rural areas and from 6 percent to 15.3
percent in urban areas during 2007 and 2010. The surveys also indicate significant drops in
the use of latrines in rural areas, and thus suggesting reduced access to basic sanitation
facilities.

46.    This link between the satisfactory completion of PRSC triggers and progress made in
meeting expected outcomes is weak and very indirect. The PRSCs succeeded in upgrading
and providing standards for the dialogue among the government and various development
partners in the water sector. This dialogue gave direction to the sector, and contributed to
improvements in access to water and sanitation.

baseline for 2007and decreased (or even make negative) the percentage change for 2010.

Italicized indicators were not identified in program documents but collected for this evaluation.


Objective 3: Governance and accountability.

47.     The three outcome areas were used to better define the overall objective, but there
was little improvement in any of them. In total, six out of eight targets were met, but several
of these were flawed in their construction and focused on outputs rather than outcomes. On
enhancing the accountability of the state, the two output targets focused on prosecuting
corruption were met, but perception data on corruption cases suggest that the outcome has
not been achieved. On improving the effectiveness of public administration, the two flawed
output targets were met. But one indicator—resources paid to public workers—did not help
to achieve the desired outcome, as enhanced pay was not successfully targeted to positions
key to delivering public services. Similarly, the other indicator—share of local government
expenditures allocated on a formula basis—provides no information about whether or not
those resources were used effectively, and there were no major actions taken to ensure that
they were. On improving public financial management, two of the four targets were met,
with progress in auditing functions, but deterioration in budget execution and limited
improvement in compliance with procurement rules.

48.     The prior actions in the series, highlighted in Table D.16, covered 5 aspects of public
sector reform: anti-corruption (PRSC 6), public service pay (PRSC 4, 7 and 8), procurement
(PRSC 4, 7 and 8), external audit (PRSC 4, 5 and 6), and internal audit (PRSC 7).
PFM/budget and decentralization were identified in the objectives although there were no
associated triggers or prior actions.

49.     The Bank had investment and TA credits covering several areas of public sector
reform—Public Finance Management Reform Program, Public Service Reform Program,
Tax Administration Reform, FY05 Local Government Support Project (LGSP), FY06
Accountability, Transparency and Integrity Project (ATIP), and a FY08 Performance, Results
and Accountability Project (PRAP). The government counterparts for the first two were
informed of and involved in the PRSC process. The tax (Tanzania Revenue Authority) and
local government counterparts (even at the center) were less involved in the PRSC process,
and there were no prior actions linked with them. The Regional and Local Government
(RALG) office in the Prime Minister‘s Office was somewhat involved with PRSC
discussions, but not local government officials.

51.     Control of corruption was intended as an important area for the PRSC 4-8 series, but
the results seem poorer than in the first series. Even as anti-corruption legislation was
enacted, perceptions of corruption increased, as reflected in ratings by the International
Country Risk Guide, the Bank‘s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, and WGI
rankings for Tanzania, shown in Table D.18, and described above. In retrospect, the passage
of a new anti-corruption bill seems to have been a suboptimal choice as a prior action for
PRSC-6 because there was not much implementation and it may have detracted attention
from other actions that may have combated corruption, including through increasing
transparency and improving financial management.

53.      With respect to the issue of improved quality of civil service, the PRSC series focused
on pay reform, which again failed to meet its objectives over the PRSC period. The repetition
of public service pay reform triggers, with a vague one in PRSC 4 and unmet triggers in
PRSCs 7 and 8 (Table 15) points to problems in design. The pay strategy remained across-
the-board, continuing the failed approach from the first series. Table D.19 shows the results
according to the flawed indicators associated with this design. The intermediate output target
was current pay as a percent of the government‘s pay target rather than targeting pay
increases to positions with the greatest need (for example, in remote areas) and in agencies
critical for delivery of prioritized services, despite the empirical evidence that such attempts
are usually unsuccessful (IEG 1999 and 2008; Evans 2008). Even on this indicator, progress
was modest, meeting the PRSC target but not the MKUKUTA target. The program document
for PRSC-9 notes the persistence of problems related to ―(i) the excessive use of allowances
to augment pay by public servants, which distorts incentives to service delivery; (ii) pay and
incentives for staff working in underserved and remote areas; as well as (iii) decompression
of the salary structure that has in recent years faced the pressure of increased employment of
public servants, particularly in the social sector.‖ Indicators suggest that outcomes were not
good: the WGI on government effectiveness deteriorated from -0.35 (2005) to -0.45 (2008),
in contrast to the program target of 0.0 for 2010.73 This is consistent with the ICRG rating for
Bureaucratic Efficiency, which remained steady at 1 on a 0-4 scale, and the CPIA rating for
Quality of Public Administration, which declined from 3.5 in 2005-09 to 3.0 in 2010.

54.     Local government reform in Tanzania has had a mixed record since 2005—
disbursing more money but taking few actions to improve the effectiveness of that funding.
The share of the budget transferred directly to LGAs increased, following the de-
concentration of the secondary education budget. A system of intergovernmental transfers,
which provides performance-based discretionary grants (Council Development Grants:
CDGs; and Capacity Building Grants: CBGs) to LGAs, was disbursing by 2010. The
development partner group on local government reform gave the program an unsatisfactory
rating because of limited progress made in providing autonomy in human resources
management at the LGA level; transparency and accountability of use of funds undermined
by multi-channels of funding at the local level; and continued large inequity in the allocation
of funds among districts (World Bank 2010c). Although the PRSC series had the intention of
improving the effectiveness of decentralization, none of the five PRSCs had prior actions to
promote this—a flaw of project design. On the other hand, decentralization efforts seem to
have declined as an activity area for public sector reform. Although more money in the
aggregate is going to local governments, the targeting and accountability have weakened.
There were no prior actions for this issue in any of the PSRCs 4-8. No Public Expenditure
and Financial Accountability review has been done at the local level since 2006, although the
funding going through those governments has increased greatly.

55.     The third outcome area covers the PRSC‘s contributions to improving public
financial management through reforms in procurement, external and internal audit, and

73
  Fundamental problems with the WGI as a measure of change over time imply that it was a flaw of
program design to pick it as an indicator.

56.      For procurement reform, the strategy was to implement the new law passed during
the first PRSC series—to stop using a central tender board, to allow Ministries and local
governments to do their own procurement, and to create a regulatory body to set and enforce
standards for efficient and non-corrupt procurement. This is international best practice and
aimed to expedite procurement with independent checks, appeals and audits. The number of
agencies participating in the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority evaluations grew from
20 in 2006/7 to 100 in 2007/8 and to 174 in 2010/11. The percent of agencies found in
compliance with PPRA regulations rose to 50 in 2007/8 and reached a plateau around 70
percent in 2009/10 and 2010/11 (PPRA Annual Performance Evaluation Report, 2011). The
2009 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability review and the 2011 DfID Risk
Assessment, nonetheless, noted the problem of low compliance with procurement laws and
regulations, stating that ―anecdotal evidence and the national corruption survey still question
the integrity of the actual [procurement] selection process at both central and local
government level‖ (DfID 2011).

57.     External Audit was strengthened with the passage of the Public Audit Act in 2008,
increasing the independence, powers and responsibilities of the Controller and Auditor
General. To reform internal audit the government moved in 2008 the internal audit function
from the office of the Accountant General to make it independent, with direct reporting to the
Permanent Secretary of the Treasury. Auditing showed progress in terms of increased
coverage capacity, and independence of the National Audit Office. The Audit Office is well
respected in the region and through 2014 is the chair of AFROSAI-East. Their annual reports
were on time since 2005 and contained substantive analysis and frank critiques. Outcomes
reported by the audits (a measure of the quality of PFM) showed progress in increasing the
proportion of ―unqualified opinion‖ until 2009, which reversed in FY 2010, but recovered for
FY 2011. Some important ministries, like Finance and Education, were still not getting
―unqualified opinions‖. Also ―adverse opinions‖ in audits of local governments continued to

be prevalent (TWAWEZA, 2010). These reflected PFM problems in the audited MDAs, and
a plus for the auditors in identifying them. While problems in the audits of some Bank
projects showed room for improvement in quality of audits, the timeliness and independence
of the National Audit Office met expectations. The main problem recently has been the lack
of government responsiveness to National Audit Office recommendations.74

58.     There was little progress made with respect to Budget/PFM issues, as the
government umbrella PFM reform program slowed down in 2006-7. The third phase of the
PFM Reform Program started in July 2008, with focus on improvements to cash
management, payment systems, coverage and integration of Integrated Financial
Management System, and budget classification. Despite this, the CPIA and Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability ratings for PFM deteriorated over the period, and
the Open Budget ratings did not make net improvement. Recurrent budget deviation at vote
level improved, but remained far above the target of 10 percent, as shown in Table D.21. The
main recipients of reallocated funds were those Ministries with large staff complements—the
Education, President‘s Office and Cabinet, Defense, and Police—because most of the funds
were for salary arrears and adjustments.

59.     The early years of the second series of PRSCs saw sound implementation of the
public expenditure management agenda, including adoption of budgets in line with
MKUKUTA priorities, as well as satisfactory budget execution. The situation changed
toward the final operations, with varying outcomes. Two triggers on budget execution and
alignment of expenditures to MKUKUTA were missed in PRSC7 and PRSC8, respectively,
although the situation seems to have improved in 2010/11 after deteriorating the year before
(Public Expenditure Review 2011). The PERs also found major decline in allocations for
capital spending, very high and growing share of wages in total budget, and a very large
increase in discretionary spending in the 2009 budget, all quite separate from the fiscal
stimulus needed for mitigating the global financial crisis of 2008. In terms of the adequacy of
monitoring indicator and its target level, the PER stated that the 13 percent deviation of
actual expenditure from the budget (the actual indicator) was high, and suggested the need to
aim for less that 10 percent. However, the PRSC target remained 18 percent throughout the
second series of PRSC operations.

   The National Audit Office report on FY2010/11 said the following: ―Most of the recommendations issued in
the previous year‘s General Report of the Central Government were not responded to, which is an indicator of
lack of seriousness on the part of the Government in implementing those recommendations.‖ (p. xxiv)
