POLAND - Roads Maintenance & Rehabilitation project               Project Operational Manual
The Polish Environmental Impact Assessment System
including the Road Sector
1. The Polish Environmental Impact Assessment
Under the Polish system, the classification of projects which are subject to EIA procedure follows the one
adopted by the European Union. The relevant EU Directive describes types of projects in a very detailed
way, very often including not only the type of project but also its size. Basically the list of projects refers to
new developments, however modifications and upgrading are also treated as a new development under some
conditions.
In Poland, projects are classified into two different groups of projects:
Group 1 includes a list of projects, which may have significant impact on the environment, and which
always require an EIA report.
Group 2 includes a list of projects, which also may have significant impact on the environment, but for
which EIA report is not always required.
A significant number of project types listed in Group 1 is repeated in Group 2, while what makes them
different is scale. The competent authorities are responsible for deciding whether for issuing a development
consent they need conclusions from EIA report. In order to facilitate that process the regulation includes also
a set of screening criteria, which are listed below:
- project characteristics (the magnitude of the project and the dimension of the occupied land, as well
as their mutual proportions, the connections with other projects, especially multiplication of impacts,
the use of natural resources, the production of waste, pollution and nuisances, the risk of accidents,
having regard in particular to substances or technologies used)
- project location, considering potential environmental threats, taking into account: existing land use,
relative abundance, quality and regenerative capacity of natural resources in the area, values of
natural environment and landscape, conditions of the local land-use plans, having regard, in
particular, to:
(a) wetlands;
(b) coastal zones;
(c) mountain and forest areas;
(d) protected areas, including the protection zones of water intakes and protection areas of
surface-waters ponds;
(e) special protection areas because of existing fauna and flora and natural habitats;
(f) areas in which the environmental quality standards have already been exceeded;
(g) populated areas;
(h) landscapes of historical, cultural or archaeological significance.
- type and magnitude of potential impact, in relation to the scale and siting criteria, and having
regard in particular to:
(a) extent of the impact (geographical area and size of the affected population),
3

(b) transboundary nature of the impact on the different environmental elements,
(c) magnitude and complexity of the impact, including existing technical infrastructure,
(d) probability of the impact,
(e) duration, frequency and reversibility of the impact.

2. Environmental Assessment in the Roads Sector
2.1 The Polish Legal Framework
The Act of 10 April 2003 on Special Procedure for Construction of National Roads (Dz.U of 2003 No
80 item 721) [hereinafter referred to as Special Roads Procedure Act] excludes - on temporary basis (till the
end of 2007) the location and construction of certain categories of roads from generally applicable
procedures and requirements, and establishes its own rules instead. Those special rules affect in particular
issues related to environmental protection, including EIA, to public participation and to compulsory land
acquisition.
Most public roads are subjected to EIA several times in accordance with the system of 'tiering' applied in
Poland. First, there is a document called "concept of the national land-use policy" which sets the scene for all
roads, then there are governmental programs for development of roads, finally, there are regional (voivodship)
land use plans setting the proposed routes for public roads. Preparation of all those strategic documents is
obligatory and they all are subject to SEA. Specific routes of public roads are also included in local land use
plans, which - if prepared - are also subject to SEA [SEA procedure is described in the main part of this report].
All national roads and roads sited in cities having county status are subject to mandatory EIA under the
Special Roads Procedure Act, while some other public roads are subject to general EIA scheme under
EPLA and the Land Use Planning Act.
2.1.1 Roads subject to special EIA procedure
Roads subject to special EIA procedure under the Special Roads Procedure Act include motorways and
express roads and other national roads.
2.1.2 Roads subject to "general" EIA scheme
General EIA scheme applies to any public road other than mentioned above which is classified as regional
(voivodship), county (poviat) or municipal (gmina) road, has hard surface and is longer than 1 km. If it has at
least 4 traffic lines and is longer than 10 km it belongs to Group 1 projects, i.e., those which always require
EIA, otherwise it falls into Group 2 - i.e. projects which require screening. [General EIA scheme is described
in the main part of this Report].
2.2 Special procedure for siting and construction of roads and institutional set-up
Under the Act of 10 April 2003 on Special Procedure for Construction of National Roads [ Special Roads
Procedure Act], the special rules of siting and construction of roads apply to national roads and roads
sited in cities having county (poviat) status (this applies to 65 biggest agglomerations in Poland) and
financed by such cities. Those rules replace temporarily (till the end f 2007):
* the relevant rules of the Toll Motorways Act of 27 October 1994 - in relation to siting and construction
of toll motorways and express roads,
* the relevant rules of the land Use Planning Act of 27 March 2003 (Dz.U of 2003 No 80 item 717) - in
relation to siting and construction of other national roads (and roads in cities with the county status).
In both cases the new rules either replace or significantly reduce the application of other laws, in particular
those regulating environmental protection, including EIA,  public participation and compulsory land
acquisition.

5. Minutes of the public workshop held in Josefow (January 19, 2004).
Discussion notes
1. Piotr Kuropatwiiiski
-  investment - promotion - bicycle project
-  hierarchy of transport space users
2. Marek Kobus
-  possibility to submit applications - until January 23d this year.
-  unequal provisions of the Special Act (for large investments) and of the Environmental Protection
Law (for smaller investments)
3. Danuta Cesarska
-  Social participation under the Special Act:
* consultations stage too late
* lack of possibility for the voivod not to issue a decision
4. Ryszard Zakrzewski - answer
-  at the stage of siting decision art. 53 of the Environmental Protection Law is applied, so the voivod must
ensure social participation. A decision issued without considering the comments is invalid by the law
(art. 10 of the Environmental Protection Law)
5. Ewa Szulc
-  provisions of the law vs. practice (example: Oktcie): protestation about the limited use area was
unsuccessful
-  social consultations - what is the supervision?
-  what is the point of EIA report if the conclusions are not taken into consideration?
-  do business-plans include the cost of expropriations and relocations?
6. Tomasz Zapasnik
-  objective of Roads III loan - rehabilitation of roads
-  problems with calculation of external cost
-  railway safety calculation method
-  development of railways is tied with construction of connecting roads
-  road construction is related to social needs
7. Sabina Nowak
-  impact of highways and express ways' network on integral features of wild nature in Poland
-  rehabilitation - does it mean:
* increased capacity?
* increased traffic speed?
* necessity to fence the roads?
-  for which stretches social participation is still possible (no siting decisions yet)?
8. Tomasz Zapasnik
-  rehabilitation doesn't mean changing the class of the road
-  rehabilitation improves traffic safety
-  animal crossings width - at least 35 m

9. Robert Cyglicki
-  specifying the topic of the meeting - rehabilitation of roads is a part of infrastructure development
strategy
-  ad. REC report
* provision concerning scenario analysis for protected areas - incompliant with the World Bank
practice
* the parties have a possibility to appeal against the siting decision, but the voivod may refuse to
disclose the justification
10. Tomasz Zapa§nik
-  according to the Special Act, scenario analysis is required
11. Ryszard Zakrzewski
-  it was agreed with the Directors of GDDKiA branches, that the minister of Environment will issue an
opinion not only in protected areas, but also in neighboring areas
12. Marek Szuba
-  need for compromise
-  investment financing comes from taxes, it's not business investment
13. Jan Pakulski
-  it is not a meeting about loan III, but about infrastructure development program
-  the project financed by the World Bank is a government program - social consulting initiative is on the
Government's side
14. Maninger Gill
-  this project doesn't require social consultation, but the World Bank is interested in how issues involved
in social consultations are solved
-  the World Bank wants to avoid a situation, in which a part of the project would be treated differently
because of the World Bank procedures
-  Polish procedures are close to World Bank procedures - the objective of the visit is to identify the
differences
-  does EIA report include resettlement issues?
-  are there separate consultations on the matter of resettlement?
15. Andrzej Kassenberg
16. Stefan Sarna - answer
-  number of expropriations is very small compared to the number of buyout cases
-  procedure:
* property documentation
* offer to the owner
agreement signed       expropriation procedure
resignation and buyout          expropriation

POLAND - Roads Maintenance & Rehabilitation project                  Project Operational Manual
- EIA reports do not include the issues of expropriation
- feasibility study includes social aspects
17. Krzysztof Rytel
- program for use of loan III is not known
- what is the interest rate on the loan?
18. Stefan Sarna - answer
- interest: 5 - 6%
- every zloty is accounted for - it cannot be used for other purposes
- rehabilitation doesn't exclude building e.g. animal crossings

Group I - Environmental protection in road investments
1. Introduction - Beata Wiszniewska
-  Adjusting Polish law to EU regulations
-  More precision is required in scope of regulations on:
* trans-border assessments
* habitats directive
* Aarhus convention - directive 35/2003
The habitats directive will be implemented within the framework of the Act on protection of wild nature.
2. Possibilities of proecological organizations having an influence on planned investment, in the light of the
Special Act.
3. In issuing the opinion, Minister of Environment takes into consideration the quality of the report. For the
siting decision, an opinion from State Voivodship Sanitary Inspector is required for the entire length of the
road. Opinions are available to anyone.
The basic task for the Ministry of Environment for 2004 is integration, of environmental protection and
physical planning.

4. Issues connected with A-2 route through Warsaw
- The two scenarios (city vs. suburb) were not compared
- Routing an international corridor through the town will not solve the city transport problems
5. Example - Wroclaw highway bypass
- Construction is not possible because of social protests
6. Social consultations
- referenda in Warsaw districts
- a study of conditionality and directions for development of Warsaw has not solved the problem of route
of A-2 highway
- there is a need to prepare a strategic assessment for the Warsaw node within the framework of
voivodship plan for land development
CONCLUSION:
A strategic assessment should be prepared for infrastructure development strategy in Poland.
7. Who gains from construction of roads?
8. The stage of program concept or siting decision is too late, it makes scenario analysis impossible. Social
consultations should be conducted at the stage of preparation of voivodship plans for land development.
9. Cost of filing a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court (NSA) is very high.
10. A bigger control and supervision role of ecological organizations in scope of preparation of EIA report and
road planning.
11. Decisions are required from:
- Powiat Sanitary Inspector
- Starosta
- At the stage of construction permit.
12. Example: expressway S-3 on the territory of Wolinski National Park
Internal procedure of the Ministry of Environment:
-   Opinions:    Wild Nature Protection Department
Forestry Department
Water Resources Department
Geology Department
- Rejection of EIA report
- To voivodship, for information
- publication
- RESULT: a second analysis and a new EIA report

MOTION:
At the stage of siting decision the role of ecological organizations should be that of control.
The most important stage is planning.
Consultations should start at as early a stage as possible.
13. Ecological review as environmental protection instrument for existing roads:
- Voivod / starosta - at the request of an organization.
14. Closer cooperation between ecological organizations and Ministry of Environment.
CONCLUSION:
Participation of interested parties should be on the stage of planning - by using the procedure of strategic
environmental impact assessment.
Comments of ecoloeical or2anizations concerning rehabilitation:
1. Rehabilitation will improve the state of environment by:
- Ensuring smoother flow of traffic
- Increased safety
2. Use permit makes it impossible to implement construction instead of rehabilitation (control of compliance
with construction permit provisions):
- Post-implementation analysis
- Ecological review.
Group II - Social aspects
1) Social consultations
2) resettlement
3) cultural values

WILL THERE BE COMPENSATIONS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE?
ARE VALUATIONS OF THE HOUSES LOCATED IN THE LIMITED USE ZONE DONE BY THE
VALUE BEFORE OR AFTER THE ZONE IS IDENTIFIED?
ARE THERE COMPENSATIONS FOR BUILDING A ROAD CLOSE TO A HOUSE?
Conclusion:
TRAINING IN COMMUNICATION FOR ALL INTERESTED PARTIES.
DEVELOPING DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR SOCIAL CONSULTATIONS.
Group III - Network of corridors
Network of migration corridors and protected areas vs. road infrastructure - conflict
alleviation methods
The participants of the workgroup " Network of migration corridors and protected areas vs. road
infrastructure - conflict alleviation methods" after a discussion have agreed that:
*  Process of designing and building national roads and highways has started many years ago. The
knowledge about the impact of infrastructure on natural environment and animal migration paths was
very low then, so envisaging appropriate solutions at the planning stage was not possible. Currently the
knowledge about the impact that the fragmentation of environment by roads has on animal populations
and integrity of natural environment is well advanced. We can use results of research concerning
parameters and functioning of animal crossings in Western Europe, Canada and USA, we also have
research on migration corridors in Poland.
*  In order to avoid conflicts, it is extremely important that this knowledge is put to practical use when
implementing road infrastructure. It would be desirable to prepare base materials, including the routes of
migration corridors, places of potential conflicts with planned road infrastructure and parameters for
crossings for particular groups of animals. Such documents should be made available to broadest possible
group of recipients among people responsible for road infrastructure development and environmental
protection alike (GDDKiA and its branches, voivodship nature conservators, Ministry of Environment,
Ministry of Infrastructure, protected areas management bodies, National Forest Administration etc.).
*  Since there are discrepancies between the parameters for animal crossings in the current catalogue of
environmental protection measures and the current knowledge on the subject, we recommend updating
this catalogue by including solutions suitable for large mammals' migrations.
*  Locations of animal crossings should be indicated as early as possible, included at an early stage of
investment planning, at the best during development of technical/operational study.
*  For more efficient planning and design of road infrastructure, as well as identification of places of
conflict between migration corridors and on the borderline of environmentally valuable areas and new
road investment, we suggest creating a working team including representatives of Ministry of
Infrastructure, Ministry of Environment, GDDKiA, NGOs and scientific community.
