I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Growth on Transport
1.01      Yugoslavia has an area of about 255,800 sq km and a population of
about 21 million growing at a rate of 0.9% per annum. Its topography has
largely influenced the shape of the transport system. Major national and
international routes traverse the country in a northwest-southeast direction
avoiding the crossings of the rugged coastal and southern mountains. For
historical reasons the northern part of the country is better served than the
southern part.
1.02      Yugoslavia's location makes it an important crossroads of Europe.
The trunk routes and international connections are of special concern because
Yugoslavia has borders with seven countries. Traditionally, the Yugoslav
transport system has provided access to the sea for a number of central
European countries. Several international land connections, particularly
with Italy and Austria, have acquired special significance for foreign tour-
ism. The corridor shared by the Trans-Yugoslav Highway (TYH) and the rail-
way, spanning Yugoslavia from its Austrian border in the northwest to Bulgaria
and Greece in the southeast, is the shortest route linking Europe with the
Near and Middle East and has become a major transit route; it is the backbone
of Yugoslavia's transport network and within its influence areas lies most of
the country's industrial and commercial activity. Although the TYH corridor
does not pass through all of Yugoslavia's eight Republics and Provinces, all
benefit from its use and are affected when its operation is impaired or inter-
rupted. Since early 1976, and as part of its normal transportation project
and sector activities in Yugoslavia, the Bank has been discussing the devel-
opment of the TYH corridor with the Government.
1.03      Yugoslavia's diversified economy has grown rapidly since World War
II. During the past decade, per capita income has grown by about 6% per
annum to reach about US$1,480 in 1975. Rising economic activity and personal
incomes led to a rapid growth in transport requirements. Between 1960 and
1975, total freight traffic grew at about 6% per annum and total passenger
traffic by about 12% per annum as indicated below (Table 1.1).

B. The Transport System
1.04      Yugoslavia's transport system is well diversified, comprising about
100,250 km of roads, 10,000 km of rail lines, 7 main ports and 15 airports (10
of which handle international flights) and a sizeable network of inland and
coastal waterways, including the Danube, which is navigable through its whole
length in Yugoslavia (588 km) and is the country's most important waterway.
Pipelines have come into increasing use in recent years.
1.05      Roads and railways are the backbone of the transport system but
traffic growth for these and other modes has been rather uneven. Between
1965 and 1975 the freight traffic (ton-km) on railways increased by about 2%
per annum compared to an increase of about 13% per annum on highways. The
passenger traffic on railways declined by about 2% per annum during the same
period in contrast with an increase of about 20% per annum on highways. As a
result, road transport has gained in relative importance and has replaced rail
transport as the dominant carrier. The railways, however, continue to be the
main carrier of bulk commodities over relatively long distances for key indus-
tries (Table 1.2). River transport has retained an important and competitive
place, carrying about 10% of total freight traffic. Ports have more than
doubled their cargo handling since the early 1960's and currently move about
20 million tons per annum.

1.06      During the early 1960's transport facilities developed more slowly
than other sectors of the economy and accounted for only about 10-11% of total
investment, the lowest in Europe. The position has improved and transport has
accounted for about 16-18% of the total investments since 1970; but in view of
the considerable gaps in the transport infrastructure, the resources devoted
to the sector appear to have been insufficient and much still remains to be
done. One of the most urgent needs at present facing the transport sector is
the modernization of the railways, which has been hampered through lack of
funds. In this context, Government support measures should be paralleled by
improved utilization of railway capacity and more vigorous marketing and pro-
motional efforts. The capacities of some ports, also, need to be increased.
For highways, many roads are still inadequate for the traffic volumes and load-
ings they now carry and need improvement to handle anticipated traffic effi-
ciently and economically.
C. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.07      Since the mid-1960's the Yugoslav system has been increasingly char-
acterized by decentralization of decision-making, with enterprises operating
under workers' management in a market-oriented economy. During the late
1960's, principal governmental responsibility for transport was transferred
from Federal to Republican and Provincial authorities. The Federal Secretariat
for Transport was replaced in 1975 by a Federal Committee, whose Chairman
and Vice President are Federal officials, and whose other members are the
Republican and Provincial officials responsible for transport. This committee
is left with a mainly coordinating function. Governmental responsibility is
now being transferred to Communities of Interest (COIs), which consist of one
or more transport enterprises and their users, and whose authority is normally
confined to only one Republic or Province. In due course, it is intended to
form associations of such Communities for coordinating purposes.
1.08      The extension of autonomy to the "grass roots" agencies and trans-
port organizations has increased the number of decision-making bodies, and
made the country-wide transport planning and coordination (especially between
road and rail) more difficult. Until recently there has not existed an over-
all, clearly stated transport policy, although the basic rationale for such
a policy has been implicit in the country's main economic principles: free
choice by users and competition in a market economy among autonomous trans-
port enterprises. In late 1976, however, with a view to creating the neces-
sary conditions for integrated development of transport, the Federation, the
Republics and the Autonomous Provinces mutually agreed to establish a long-
term transport policy for the country. Since then considerable progress has
been made in this direction, and the authorities are concluding Social Agree-
ments on the various aspects of future transport policy.  Much of the success
in translating the tranport policy into a concrete action program will depend
on the effectiveness of the decentralized decision-making process.
1.09      The Yugoslav authorities are also acutely aware of the need for a
satisfactory institutional framework within which various transport agencies



- 4 -
and enterprises can collaborate effectively. The Bank has provided some
stimulus in promoting these institution-building policies, resulting in:
(i) the establishment of the Federal Committee (originally a,
Secretariat) for Transport and Communications;
(ii) the establishment of the Secretariats or Committees for
Transport in most Republics and Provinces;
(iii)  the establishment of the Council of Republican and
Provincial Road Organization (CRO); and
(iv)  strengthening the Community of Yugoslav Railways (CYR).
1.10      In the Yugoslav political system these institutions are essentially
advisory. With decision-making so decentralized, the main thrust for better
coordination must necessarily originate voluntarily from the various transport
enterprises and the Republics and Provinces. A tangible manifestation of
their willingness to work together is the formation of associations among
enterprises in the various sub-sectors which provide varying degrees of coor-
dination. For example, the CRO, established by the various road organizations
in the Republics and Provinces in 1971, has been active in the nationwide
standardization of engineering and design criteria, data collection and other
technical matters. The joint approach of the concerned administrations in
preparing a prefeasibility study of the entire TYH route in an effort to solve
the problems of this key highway in a planned and logical manner is another
encouraging example of their willingness to cooperate.
1.11      Further improvements are still needed and the Government needs to
define its transport policies more precisely and delineate more clearly the
responsibilities of the Federal, Republican and Provincial governments and the
COIs in the transport sector. Fuel policies in relation to transport develop-
ment should also be clearly stated. The Government may well wish to balance
the need for economic development, in which transport plays a vital part,
against its desire to substitute other sources of energy for oil, of which
transport is the principal user. The basic principal of the transport policy
will continue to be free competition in the market and the main policy instru-
ments will be pricing measures. For this reason, and to promote transport
coordination more effectively, the need was becoming increasingly pressing for
studies on road user charges and on railway costs to ascertain and eventually
eliminate overt and hidden subsidies or cross-subsidies which might exist.
1.12      The recently approved Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU) included
as an important component, therefore, a study of Road User Charges as well
as a corresponding Rail Costs Study. These two complementary studies are
designed to establish an appropriate basis for developing a policy framework
(including tariffs) which would permit the orderly economic development of
the transport sector, and are expected to provide a firm basis for the effi-
cient and economic utilization and coordination of transport facilities.
Both studies are now in progress; the Road User Charges Study should be
completed towards the end of 1978 and the Rail Costs Study about mid-1979.



1.13      The basic thrust of the Bank's activities in Yugoslavia is to sup-
port the country's efforts to accelerate development in the less developed
regions by identifying the need for and providing financial assistance to elim-
inate shortcomings in basic infrastructure, particularly transport which is
an essential component of all other sectoral development. For example, the
Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU) provides for technical assistance to the
Autonomous Province of Kosovo in the preparation of an integrated highway
master plan. The concept of region-based highway sector loans is being in-
cresingly appreciated, and is becoming particularly attractive to the less
developed regions, others of which have already commissioned such highway
master plan studies on their own initiative. These studies might well be the
basis for future Bank sector loans to these economically less fortunate re-
gions of Yugoslavia.
1.14      In the past t1e Bank's main objectives in Yugoslavia's transport
sector have been the development of the local skills needed to operate the
modal institutions. Under the Third and Fourth Highway Loans the laws and
decrees related to the highway subsector were reviewed, the organizations for
road maintenance and their operations were overhauled and improved; traffic
counting, which earlier had been rudimentary, was reorganized on a systematic
and planned basis. Subsequent highway loans provided technical assistance
in the formulation of standardized guidelines for the preparation of feasibil-
ity studies, highway master plans and other important studies like road users'
charges. The thrust of future transport sector lending will be to consolidate
progress in institutional development and to foster inter-modal coordination.
D. Previous Projects
1.15      The proposed project would be the seventeenth for the transport sec-
tor and the ninth for the highways. The Bank has lent US$776.4 million equiv-
alent to the transport sector, including US$276 million for eight highway
projects, US$108.4 million for two pipeline projects, US$44 million for the
Port of Bar Project, and US$348 million for five railway projects. Out of the
eight highway projects, five have been successfully completed so far and the
remaining projects are well in hand. Government's execution of the highway
projects has been generally satisfactory. Brief details of all transport
projects are in Annex 1.
II. THE HIGHWAYS
A. The Network
2.01      At the end of 1975, Yugoslavia had about 100,250 km of roads, of
which about 38,700 km were paved (Table 2.1). The rapid development of the
paved network began in the early 1960's when only about 9,000 km of paved
roads were open to traffic; since then the paved length has increased four-
fold.

2.02      However, despite its rapid development in the last decade, the paved
network is still inadequate to meet the needs of traffic growth. Large sec-
tions of the main highway arteries, particularly of the TYH, are heavily con-
gested and are in need of upgrading to provide greater capacity. Several
roads already paved have foundations and other design features inadequate for
the traffic loads they carry. Many gravel roads are carrying relatively high
volumes of traffic and are becoming inadequate for the needs of modern motor
traffic, necessitating their reconstruction to paved standards.
2.03      The highway network is divided into four administrative classes:
Glass I roads connecting the Republics, Provinces or important commercial and
industrial centers; Class II roads interconnecting regions within Republics
or Provinces; Class III roads serving Communes within the regions; and Class
IV road which are local roads. The Federal Government determines which roads
in the network should be Class I roads; these include roads of the European
network ("E" roads); the Republics and Provinces are responsible for the con-
struction and upkeep of the Class I network, but themselves decide which roads
should be included and maintained in the Class II and III network. The Com-
munes are responsible for the Class IV roads.
B. Traffic
2.04      Road transport has developed rapidly and the vehicle fleet has grown
from about 203,000 in 1960 to about 1,944,000 in 1975 (Table 2.2).

During the last decade, the registration of passenger cars increased about
eightfold, and trucks and buses more than doubled. Most of the increase in
the vehicle fleet was supplied by domestic production. Private car ownership
is steadily rising as per capita incomes grow. The trucking industry is
highly competitive. Motorization in the different regions of the country,
however, varies widely in line with their state of development: Slovenia,
the most developed has seven inhabitants per car; Kosovo, the least developed,
has about 100 inhabitants per car.
C. Administration
2.05      Highway administration in Yugoslavia is decentralized and concen-
trated in the Republics and Provinces. The Federal Government's role is
restricted to general policy and regulatory matters such as regulations on
vehicle dimensions, axle loading and road safety aspects and the international
aspects of highway administration and road transport.
2.06      At the Republican and Provincial levels, responsibility for highway
administration lies with the Republican or Provincial Road Organizations.
These organizations are governed by "Boards" comprising relatively large
numbers of members of various interest groups such as transport companies,
industrial enterprises, agricultural cooperatives and professional and road
user organizations. The members elect Executive Boards which are responsible
for day-to-day administration and preparation of highway proposals, which are
coordinated through the planning system with the plans of other sectors and
need the approval of Republican or Provincial Governments. Purely local roads
are under the jurisdiction of the local communities which have special depart-
ments. In cities, the City Planning Authorities are given increasing atten-
tion to urban transport impact with a view to rationalizing the use of trans-
port facilities.
2.07      Coordination among the Road Organizations is provided through the
Republican and Provincial Assemblies, the Federal Committee for Transport and
Communications and the CRO.



- 8 - 
2.08      The organization of highway administration has changed repeatedly
during the postwar years. At present, for example, the physical planning
and administration of the road plans of Macedonia are handled by the Republican
Road Council, which replaced the Republican Road Fund about two years ago. The
council is governed by a board of members and is headed by a Secretary (Chart),
aided by a professional staff of 22 engineers, 3 economist, 4 lawyers and
various technicians. This organization is expected to evolve further and to
become an "Association for the Communities of Interest for Roads." The Com-
munities of Interest, it is understood, would further promote increased citizen
and user organization participation in the decision-making process. It should
be recognized, however, tnat the organization of the highway sub-sector is com-
plex, that the highway administration is still in a period of transition as a
result of the continuous decentralization process, and no firm long-term plans
on highway investment are as yet available. However, a medium range highway
master plan study (covering the period up to 1985) for the Autonomous Province
of Kosovo, on which work has just commenced, is being financed under the Eighth
Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU). Similar studies have also been initiated in
the other less developed regions in Yugoslavia. These studies may form the
basis of future Bank Sector Loans in Yugoslavia as the highway sector lending
concept is increasingly becoming attractive, particularly to the less developed
regions.
D. Planning
2.09      Five-Year Highway Plans are prepared by the Road Organizations,
coordinated with the plans for other sectors by the Republican or Provincial
Assemblies. The plans for 1976-80 have been finalized by the Assemblies.
Inter-Republican roads are planned on the basis of agreements among the
respective Republics and Provinces.
2.10      Although no problems have arisen in these connections in recent
projects, during loan negotiations assurances should be obtained from the
Borrowers that they will continue to collect and record such technical, eco-
nomic and financial data as shall be reasonable for the proper planning of the
highway network, and continue to ensure that the dimensions and axle loads of
vehicles using the roads shall not exceed the design limits of the roads.
2.11      Recently, a Working Paper has been prepared under the aegis of CRO
to assist the authorities in preparing Investment, Financing, and Action Plans
for improving the TYH, which includes a preliminary ranking of proposed proj-
ects by economic priorities. In this context, a Social Agreement has already
been reached amongst the Federation, Republics and Autonomous Provinces for
the development of the TYR as well as certain other major roads during 1976-
80. This Agreement also commits the Republics and Provinces to mobilize the
required resources, a demonstration that the mechanism for country-wide plan-
ning, coordination and cooperation does exist.

E. Investment and Financing
2.12      Highway expenditures have increased steadily over the last decade
(Table 2.3). However, inflation eroded a substantial portion of the increased
outlay and in real terms the highway expenditures did not keep pace with the
rapid growth of highway traffic. Overall highway expenditures for new con-
struction and upgrading in 1975 amounted to about 75% of total highway expen-
ditures (US$357 million equivalent), with the remaining 25% earmarked for
highway maintenance (Table 2.4).

2. 13     The Federal Government's role in highway financing has been phasing
out since 1970, when it was decided that the Federation should cease its part-
icipation and only carry out obligations under previous commitments. In 1975,
the Federal Government's remaining contribution to highway financing was only
about 2% of the total expenditure. The main source for highway financing is
the revenue from taxes on gasoline and diesel oil, license fees as well as the
revenues from taxes paid by foreign motorists on entering Yugoslavia. In 1975,
these revenues yielded about Din 6.4 billion (US$0.36 billion); in the same
year expenditures on construction and maintenance of the highway system also
totalled about the same amount. About 40% of these revenues were earmarked in
1975 for highway maintenance and improvement.

Table 2.5 above shows that about 60% of the outlay on highway development and
maintenance was made up of IBRD and domestic loans (24%), the Fund for Less
Developed Regions (4%), contributions by the Federal Government (2%), contri-
butions by the Republics, Provinces, Communes (21%) and other sources (9%).
Since the earmarked revenues cover only about 40% of the total expenditures,
the road development plans of the Road Organizations depend heavily on budget-
ary allocations, public loans, bank credits, and voluntary contributions of
enterprises and citizens.
2.14      Expenditures for highway maintenance in 1975 amounted to about Din
36,275 (about US$2,015) per km for the highway network maintained by the
Republics and Provinces. The satisfactory standard of road maintenance in
Yugoslavia indicates that adequate amounts have been made available during the
last few years.



- 12 -
F. Engineering
2.15      Preinvestment studies of highway projects may be commissioned by
the Road Organizations from either local or foreign consulting firms and, in
general are satisfactorily executed. The subsequent design of the projects
and the supervision of their construction is usually performed, also satisfac-
torily, by the Road Organizations who may enlist the support of competent
Yugoslav consulting engineers and technical institutes.
G. Construction
2.16      Road construction and improvement is normally executed by means of
unit-price contracts. As a rule, participation in bidding for locally fi-
nanced projects is limited to the domestic contracting industry, which is
capable, highly competitive, and sufficiently aggressive to continue winning
contract awards outside Yugoslavia. Bidding for Bank-financed projects, how-
ever, is subject to international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement"; such bidding for past highway projects,
however, has resulted in the participation as a joint-venture partner of one
foreign contractor only, an indication of the competitive edge of the local
industry has on its own ground. Quality of construction work is generally of
a high standard.
H. Maintenance
2.17      Road maintenance is carried out on the basis of yearly contracts
negotiated between the Road Maintenance Enterprises and the Road Organiza-
tions. The Maintenance Enterprises are deployed widely in each Republic or
Province, enabling prompt and effective maintenance to be carried out. The
standard of road maintenance is satisfactory (2.14). However, during loan
negotiations assurances were obtained from each of the Borrowers that it will
continue to ensure that all roads falling within its jurisdiction will be
adequately maintained in accordance with sound engineering and financial
practices, and that funds, facilities, services and other resources required
therefore will be provided promptly, as needed.
[II. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The primary aim of this project is to facilitate traffic flows on
Yugoslavia's main highway artery, a route vital to the economic life of each



- 13 -
and every constituent Republic and Province. From the purely national stand-
point, economic activity in the influence area of the TYH corridor generates
about 35% of Yugoslavia's GDP, a cogent factor in appraising the importance
of this route, but looked at more globally, TYH is also a vital linked needed
to meet the growing demands of road transport between Europe and the Middle
East (Map IBRD 12416).
3.02      At present, high traffic volumes (10,000-12,000 vehicles/day), often
comprising more than 30% heavy trucks, are clogging sections of this mainly
two-lane road. The sections selected for reconstruction under this project,
therefore, are those currently seen to be in the most urgent need of added
traffic capacity.
3.03      In recognition of the seriousness of the mounting congestion pro-
blems, the losses to the economy from the heavy accident toll on life and
property and the increasing problems of maintaining the road under heavy traf-
fic, Government, early in 1976 approached the Bank for assistance in preparing
a rational program for the development of this vital route. The program should
be such that, given the weight of the Bank's involvement in its preparation
and the catalysis of Bank financing of certain TYH sections in earlier highway
projects as well as the presently proposed one, it could provide multilateral
and bilateral lenders with a sound and attractive basis for project financing.
At the Bank's instigation, therefore, the CR0 commissioned a prefeasibility
study of the whole route in order to determine such a program and an action
plan for its implementation. This study has been completed and provides
forcible evidence of the urgency to reconstruct the present pavement to modern
standards and to increase the road's traffic capacity. Moreover, it emphasizes
the road's international character and its priority as a key link in the trans-
European highway network. The four project sections were selected on the basis
of the study's findings. Although there are other pressing needs for invest-
ment in the highway sector, the importance of TYH to Yugoslavia is so great
that this proposed project deliberately focusses solely on the needs of this
primary route. A proposed future project, preparation of which is already
well advanced (para. 1.13), will cater to other network needs (secondary and
perhaps tertiary roads as well), under the umbrella of highway sector lending.
B. Description
3.04      The project comprises:
(a) the construction of the following sections of TYH identified
by the TYH Prefeasibility Study as being those where addi-
tional traffic capacity is most urgently needed (Map IBRD
10862R3):
(i) in the Republic of Slovenia a new four-lane limited
access highway from Celovska to Dolgi Most (9.2 km)
serving to divert TYH through traffic from the city
network of Ljubljana;



- 14 -
(ii) in the Republic of Croatia, two additional traffic
lanes to, and the reconstruction of the existing two-
lane limited access highway from Ivanja Reka to
Popovaca (48.3 km); and
(iii)  in the Republic of Serbia, two additional traffic
lanes to, and the reconstruction where needed of the
existing two-lane limited access highway from Pojate
to Deligrad (22 km), and the construction of a two-
lane bypass of the city of Nis (6.3 km); and
(b) the procurement of equipment for maintenance and for
monitoring the loadings of vehicles using the primary
network.
Road Construction
3.05      A detailed description of the project road section follows:
Slovenia:  Lujblana Bypass (9.2 km)
3.06      The Lujbljana Bypass is a vital link in the TYH system needed because
of the increasing congestion on the Lujbljana surface street system caused by
heavy truck transit traffic. The bypass will improve travel for through (THY)
traffic and by diverting heavy commercial transit traffic from the city network
will also reduce current traffic hazards and provide considerable relief to
city traffic. The bypass is designed as a four-lane divided, controlled access
facility on new alignment between Celovska and Dolgi Most, and includes the
construction of seven interchanges. Horizontal and vertical alignments of the
bypass have been designed to provide maximum protection from noise pollution
and to preserve the green areas. The bypass is depressed through the more
densely populated areas to minimize the effects of noise pollution on adjoin-
ing property and to maintain the general aesthetics of the area. No existing
housing need be demolished to make way for the project road. Adequate provi-
sion has been made to maintain traffic service and its smooth flow around
the Lujbljana road network, minimizing adverse environmental effects. To
avoid congestion problems resulting from a change in traffic flow patterns at
the southern terminus of the by-pass, the Slovenian authorities are carrying
out studies of traffic operations. These studies would determine the design
of a traffic control program which would ensure a smooth transitional traffic
flow from the city street network of southern Ljubljana to TYH.
Croatia: Ivanja Reka-Popovaca (48.3 km)
3.07      The section Ivanja Reka-Popovaca extends the improved TYH facility
an additional 48.3 km southwest from Zagreb toward Belgrade. This link, by
addition of two new traffic lanes to the existing two lane road is designed
as a four-lane divided, controlled access facility. Most of the existing two-
lane road also requires reconstruction as the pavement has been distressed
beyond salvage. The project includes the construction of two interchange
structures. It was not possible to include this section, urgently needed



- 15 -
as it was, in earlier Bank-financed highway projects, since the benefits of
its construction could not have been fully realized while the problems of
TYR traffic transisting Zagreb remained unresolved. However, the Republic of
Croatia is currently constructing not only a bypass of Zagreb city to the
south of the Sava River, but also an urban expressway across Zagreb to facil-
itate flows of city traffic as well as the TYH transit traffic.
Serbia: Polate-Deligrad (22.6 km)
3.08      This two-lane section of TYR is located near Nis on the Belgrade-Nis
link and has substandard horizontal alignments and many long, steep gradients,
which causes congestion and bottlenecks to traffic flow, particularly in bad
weather. The link will be improved by construction of two additional lanes
to provide a four-lane divided highway on the original horizontal and vertical
alignments with local improvements as needed. No new interchanges are in-
cluded.
Serbia:  Nis bypass (6.3 km)
3.09      The Nis Bypass is designed as a two-lane limited access facility on
new alignment and includes one new interchange. The bypass alignment is 6.3
km in length, compared with 14 km for the present route through the city.
Equipment Procurement
3.10      In order that the loadings of vehicles using the primary highway
network, and in particular TYH, may be monitored and controlled within the
roads' design limits, the loan provides for the purchase of vehicle weighing
systems which would be installed at key junctions in the network. In addi-
tion and to facilitate road maintenance certain other specialised equipment
items in accordance with the following list would also be purchased.

C. Engineering
3.11      Engineering according to the design standards of Table 3.1 below
which are satisfactory, has been carried out by competent Yugoslav engineering
consulting firms (design institutes) and by institutes for geology, soil
mechanics and civil engineering. The data used in the preparation of the
project and the source material are listed in Annex 2.

1/ Excludes costs of land acquisition,  final design and construction supervision which are met in toto
by Government, but includes approximately 12% taxes.
2/ Construction cost estimates are of 7/1/77.   Price escalations based on the periods of the contracts
and the annual escalation rates (para. 3.13), are:
Celovska-Dolgi Most              307,
Ivanja Reka-Popovaca             307.
Pojate-Deligrad                  25%
Nis                              20%
During loan negotiations, the project cost estimates were discussed and con-
firmed with the Borrowers.
3.13               Construction cost estimates are based on quantities from the sub-
stantially completed final designs, and on unit rates.
3.14               A 10% physical contingency has been included to allow for unfore-
seen increases in quantities of work in road construction. Price escalation
has been calculated using annual rates of 9% for each year up to 1980 and 8%
thereafter, and has been assessed the same for both local and foreign costs.



- 18 -
3.15      The foreign exchange component is estimated at US$80 million, based
on the assumption that as in earlier projects local contractors will win the
awards of construction contracts after international competitive bidding.
This component has declined from about 40% to the present 31% of total cost
over the past 10-15 years, indicating the country's increasing self-sufficiency
in this sector.
E. Financing
3.16      The proposed loan of US$80 million corresponds to the foreign ex-
change component of the project costs (31.1% of total costs); local costs
amounting to US$177 million will be borne by the Republics of Slovenia,
Croatia and Serbia. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan would
be that each of the three participating Republics will have adopted the legal
authority to construct its respective road sections.
3.17      For all procurement under the proposed project, the loan would be
made to the Road Organizations of Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia, guaranteed by
the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A condition of effectiveness
would be that the Government of each participating Republic will have approved
a guarantee to cover the financing of its respective section of the project
roads, including possible cost over-runs.
3.18      Although the project provides for construction of toll-free sec-
tions of TYH, nevertheless at some future time the participating Republics
may wish to operate their sections as toll roads. Some Republics have al-
ready done so for road sections financed under the Third and Fifth Projects
and tolls may also be applied to roads built under the Seventh and Eighth
Projects. It was agreed under those earlier projects, that if tolls were
to be imposed, they should be applied flexibly and set at such limits as not
to divert an unduly large proportion of through traffic to the alternative
toll-free facilities or means of transportation. During loan negotiations
the Borrowers agreed to the same principle applying to the highway sections
financed under the proposed project.
3.19      The Road Organizations of the three Borrowers concerned with civil
works have all participated satisfactorily in earlier Bank highway projects.
Each entity executes efficiently the annual program of work approved by its
Republican or Provincial Assembly.
F. Implementation
Responsibility for Implementation and Supervision
3.20      The Road Organizations of the three participating Republics would be
responsible for executing their respective construction works. As in earlier



- 19 -
projects, the concerned Republican Governments' acceptance of these arrange-
ments is expected without difficulty, but their formal agreement to this
effect would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. Also, as
in earlier projects where such arrangements proved satisfactory, supervision
over the construction work would be exercised by the Yugoslav consulting
engineers and technical institutes which designed the project roads. The CR0
would act as fiscal agent for the project and as liaison on project-related
matters between the Republics and the Bank, and would coordinate requests
for reimbursement/disbursement on the Bank. The CR0 would also be responsible
for the procurement of road maintenance and load monitoring equipment provided
for under the loan. A condition of loan effectiveness would be that the
concerned Republics and the Federal Government will have delegated authority
to CR0 to enable it to discharge these obligations.
Procurement
3.21      Construction contracts based on unit prices would be awarded after
international competitive bidding in accordance with the "Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement."  Contracts would be of such a size as to encourage maximum
participation of the local industry, allowing firms to bid for one or more
sections up to their prequalified capacity. Contractors would be prequali-
fied for the works. Prequalification procedures were initiated in January
1978, bids will be invited in April and contracts awarded to the lowest
evaluated bidders in July 1978. Contracts will include satisfactory price
escalation clauses.
Land Acquisition for Right-of-Way
3.22      The three Republican Governments are at present acquiring the land
needed to build the project road sections. Although no major problems are
foreseen, during loan negotiations assurances were obtained from the Borrowers
that they will make available all right-of-way as needed for the timely
implementation of the project.
Project Implementation Schedule
3.23      The construction of the Nis bypass should be completed in mid-1979,
the Pojate Deligrade section in mid-1980 and the Ljubljana bypass and the
Ivanja Reka-Popovaca section in mid-1981. The procurement of road maintenance
and load monitoring equipment and installation of the weigh bridges should be
completed by the end of 1980. The Project Implementation Schedule, Table 3.3,
which follows, was discussed and confirmed with the Borrowers during loan nego-
tiations, as were appropriate progress reporting procedures. The Borrowers
were also asked and have agreed to prepare project completion reports within
six months of the Loan Closing Date for each of their project sections.

G.  Disbursements
3.24      The proceeds of the loan would finance the foreign exchange com-
ponent of project costs amounting to 30% of the works in Slovenia, 30% of the
works in Croatia and 34% and 32% of the main road and Nis bypass works respec-
tively in Serbia, as well as the foreign exchange costs of the equipment
procurement.
3.25      Based on the loan becoming effective in July 1978 the following
schedule of disbursements (Table 3.4) has been estimated. This schedule
was discussed and confirmed with the Borrowers during loan negotiations.

H. Environmental Impact
3.26      There is little habitation along the alignment of the existing road
sections to which two additional traffic lanes will be added. There will be
little disturbance, therefore, to land-holders.



- 22 -
3.27      To the extent that traffic congestion along the project road sec-
tions will be obviated, reduction in noise and air pollution will result.
Where the road sections in Slovenia and Serbia afford bypass facilities of
Ljubljana and Nis, the urban environment of these centers will be enhanced
by the diversion of these large volumes of mainly heavy through truck traffic.
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01      The proposed project aims at relieving the most congested segments
of TYH in the Republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia. TYH is connected
with primary and secondary highways at a number of points along its alignment;
the influence of this facility, therefore, extends beyond its immediate cor-
ridor, and affects much of the country. In addition to its important role in
the national economy, TYH has a vital function in providing a bridge between
the western and central European countries and the southeastern European and
Middle Eastern countries. The growing economic relationship between these
regions of the world during the recent years has led to an increased usage of
this route particularly by international truckers.
4.02      The proposed project will provide direct benefit to all road users
in terms of reduced transport costs. Several industrial centers which are
directly served by TYH and which produce the bulk of the country's output of
construction materials, fuels, chemicals products, wood and wood materials
will receive benefits in the form of reduced transport costs. The favorable
impact of the project will also be felt by local traffic and therefore addi-
tionally by the farming communities along the proposed highway sections.
The project will provide a stimulus both to international trade and to the
Yugoslavian tourism industry, thereby increasing the country's foreign ex-
change earnings. In 1974 more than 78,000 trucks and truck trailers operated
on TYH and carried more than a million tons of international freight traffic.
Since then freight traffic has been increasing rapidly on this route. Because
of the competitive nature of the road transport industry, it is expected that
the benefits of the project, which initially accrues to road users, will be
passed on to the economy in general. In those cases where road users are
carriers on their own account reduced transport costs will also be passed on
to the economy in terms of reduced production and distribution costs and,
therefore, prices in the market place.
B. Economic Evaluation
General
4.03      The state and characteristics of the existing links which are to
be reconstructed by the proposed project are described in paras 3.06-3.09.



- 23 -
Table 4.1 shows the traffic volumes as of 1975 and indicates projected volumes.
The projections are based on recent origin and destination studies employing
planned increases in the production activities, growth in per capita income
and recent trends in traffic volumes. The projected traffic volumes for all
roads segments included in the project represent the expected growth mainly
of normal traffic. Therefore, the rates of returns estimated do not incorpo-
rate the full benefits that would result from traffic generation effects of
the proposed project.
4.04      The projected traffic volumes imply annual growth rates in the range
of 3% to 10%. These rates are well below those that occurred in the project
road segments as well as in all other links of TYH during the period 1965-1975,
which fluctuated around 15% per annum, when the road transport industry ex-
perienced a rapid development. The earlier high growth rates reflects the
initial spurt in the development of road transport following a more liberal
transport policy in the sixties. Up till then Government has emphasized rail-
ways as the principal transport mode; thereafter, however, Government policy
favored the development of all modes of transport, a climate in which road
transport development was given a great initial thrust. It is believed that
road transport has largely closed the gap during the past decade and that
its growth is now stabilizing at an adequate level (together with the planned
capacity increases in other modes) to meet the growing transport demands of
the developing economy.
4.05      The quantitative economic analysis of the project road sections
takes account of savings in vehicle operating costs, passenger travel times
and road maintenance costs. For business journeys made within the influence
area of the project roads, time savings were valued at 1.1 x average hourly
wage rate to take some account of overhead costs. Since, however, the value
of time for non-business trips is more difficult to establish, these were
given a conservative value of 1/4 x average hourly wage rate. Benefits due
to increased comfort, convenience and safety have not been considered.
4.06      The expected cost savings in vehicle operating costs per vehicle km
in the opening year of the project roads range between 22-37% for passenger
cars and 29-43% for buses and 24-37% for trucks and truck-trailers (Table
4.2 below). Savings in operating costs accruing to foreign tourists and
truck operators are included in the benefit calculations on the grounds
that they can be regarded as a stimulus of at least equal value to tourism on
the Yugoslav economy in general. Further, if they so wish, the authorities
may recoup some of the benefits derived by foreign vehicles from the improved
road conditions through pricing policies such as variations in present border
taxes or entry fees. Additionally, they may also consider a part of these
benefits as equivalent to the advantages gained by Yugoslav vehicles from road
improvements in neighbouring countries. However, of all the vehicles using
TYH about 25% were foreign, and less than half of these were in transit.
Savings in transport costs, excluding passenger time savings, account for
about 90% of the total benefits from the Nis bypass construction because of
the substantial distance reduction in avoiding the congested city center.
These savings also account for about 25% to 50% of total benefits in the case
of other arterial routes included in the project.

4.07      The proposed project works were selected among several alternative
solutions developed in response to the transport problems posed by the capac-
ity limitations of the existing roads. These were: improving or recoilstrucL-
ing the existing road; constructing a new road; changing the existing align-
ment partially or wholly; stage construction of the road both in terms of the
number of lanes and the quality of pavements, etc. For each project section,
the most economical alternative in terms of total transportation cost has been
selected.
4.08      The TYH corridor is shared by different modes of transport; only
two, road and rail, are, however, of major importance. In determining the eco-
nomic viability of the proposed project works the rational allocation of future
freight and passenger movements between road and rail facilities has been taken
into account with due regard to their service characteristics and total distri-
bution costs. Transport requirements in the TYH corridor will grow in future
with the growth and diversification of the economy. A large measure of expan-
sion will be called for in the coming years both in railways and road transport
and both systems of transport will have vital and complementary roles.
4.09      Based on the most probable estimates of traffic growth, and construc-
tion costs, maintenance costs, vehicle operating costs, travel time costs, the
proposed investments on the project road sections produce economic returns
(ERs) ranging from 27% to 54% (see Table 4.3 below). In the extreme case
where all benefits derived from foreign vehicles (para 4.06) are excluded, the
rate of return for each of the project road sections is still more than 20%.
ERs are evaluated at domestic prices excluding taxes. Shadow price adjustments
for foreign exchange, labor, etc. do not change the results by more than 0.5%.
All sections yield first-year benefit ratios ranging from 17% to 42% on the
proposed investment (Table 4.3 below). The weighted average ER of all the
civil works components, which account for about 99% of total project cost is
31%. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to test the effects of variations
in construction costs and users' benefits on the above estimates. Even under
the unfavorable assumptions of a 15% higher construction costs combined with a
15% reduction in users' benefits the ERs remained within the range of 21% to
46% with an overall economic return of 25% which is still a highly acceptable
level.

Celovska - Dolgi Most (S.R. Slovenia)
4.10      The proposed project section is a link on TYH located on the peri-
phery of the city of Ljubljana and is designed to provide a bypass for the
through traffic. About 8,500 vehicles, 750 of which were heavy vehicles would
have used this section of TYH in 1975 if it had been built. With the planned
reconstruction of TYH and the completion under a Bank project (Loan 1143-YU)
of the freeway from Vrhnika to Dolgi Most by 1980, it is estimated that
traffic on the bypass will increase at a rate of about 8% per annum reaching
17,500 vehicles in 1985 and thereafter increase at a rate of about 6% per
annum to about 39,000 in 2000. Construction of this facility by diverting
considerable through traffic from the city streets would result in consider-
able savings in vehicle operating and travel time costs not only for the
vehicles using it but also for the intra-urban traffic. The estimated ER for
this road section is about 33%.



- 28 -
Ivanja Reka - Popovaca (S.R. Croatia)
4.11      In 1975 the average daily traffic volume was about 12,500 vehicles;
about 27% of which was heavy commercial vehicles. Traffic is further expected
to grow between 5% and 9% per annum over the next 25 years, reaching about
29,000 vehicles in 1985 and about 57,300 in 2000. Upgrading of the existing
two-lane road to divided four-lane standard would increase the capacity of
the road and would bring about considerable savings in vehicle operating and
travel time costs. That work has already started on construction of satisfac-
tory transit facilities of Zagreb for through traffic and the fact that the
authorities have already contracted a 40 km road section from Popovaca towards
the east, will ensure that benefits expected from the project work should be
fully realized. For the economic evaluation the subproject was divided into
two subsections with ERs 28% and 32% respectively. The entire subproject will
yield a satisfactory ER of about 30%.
Pojate - Deligrad (S.R. Serbia)
4.12      In 1975 on the average about 9,600 vehicles per day were operating
on this section. About 28% of this traffic consisted of trucks, heavy truck-
trailers and buses. This high percentage of heavy vehicles constrained to
travel on the long and steep gradients found on this section, slows the pace
of all traffic in their direction resulting in high operating and travel time
costs. Traffic along this section is expected to grow at an annual rate of
4% to 8% during the next 25 years, reaching, on the average, 21,000 vehicles
per day in 1985 and 35,000 in 2000. The proposed project which is designed
to add two lanes to the existing facility and to improve the alignments and
gradients where needed is expected to yield an ER of about 27%.
Nis (Trupale) - Nis (South) (S.R. Serbia)
4.13      The construction of this two-lane bypass would eliminate one of the
most severe bottlenecks of TYH. At present through traffic, again with a high
percentage of heavy vehicles, is channelled into the city network where con-
ditions are exacerbated by a number of at-grade road/rail crossings. Pro-
longed stoppages of road traffic are frequent and congestion is at unaccept-
able levels. In 1975 about 3,700 vehicles would have used the proposed by-
pass facility if it had been built. With the expected growth of TYH traffic
it is estimated that ADT on the proposed bypass would reach about 6,500 in
1985 and 13,800 in 2000 and about 30% of this traffic would be heavy commer-
cial vehicles. The proposed bypass will not only relieve the congested city
street network by diverting this high volume of through traffic but also pro-
vide a distance saving of about 8 km. As a result, the construction of the
bypass section shows a high ER 54%, approximately 42% for the first year.

C. Other Project Elements
4.14      Benefits were not quantified for the equipments proposed for the
project. However, the procurement of maintenance equipment is considered
essential, in particular the weighing equipment is needed to monitor the
loadings of vehicles using the primary highway network and to ensure that
the design and construction standards of this network are not dangerously
exceeded. By ensuring that existing assets are given adequate maintenance
attention when needed a substantial return on investment is obtained, and the
costs of ultimate reconstruction may be postponed. The specialised items of
road maintenance equipment and the equipment needed to monitor the loadings
of vehicles using the primary highway network will assist the authorities
concerned in meeting their maintenance objectives and prevent the accelerated
deterioration of road pavements through vehicle overloading.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following prin-
cipal issues:
(i) if tolls are to be introduced on any of the project
highways, such tolls would be set at rates that would
ensure an economic use of such highways and alternative
routes or means of communication (para 3.18); and
(ii)  the CRO would act as fiscal agent for the project and
also as coordinator in the Borrowers' dealings with the
Bank (para 3.20).
5.02      Conditions of loan effectiveness would be that the Borrowers:
(i) will have adopted the legal authority for constructing
their respective road sections (para 3.16) and have
authorized their respective Roads Organizations to
construct their project road sections (para 3.20);
(ii)  will have given a guarantee covering the financing of
their respective road sections, including possible cost
overruns (para 3.17); and
(iii)   will have delegated authority to the CRO to act as
fiscal agent for the project, as coordinator of dis-
bursement requests to the Bank and as liaison between
the Borrowers and the Bank on project-related matters
and to procure the road maintenance and load monitoring
equipment (para 3.20).
5.03      With the understandings indicated above, the project would be suit-
able for a Bank loan of US$80.0 million to the Road Organizations of Slovenia,
Croatia and Serbia for a 15-year term including a 3-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF
A NINTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
YUGOSLAVIA
Transportation Projects Previously Financed by the Bank
Previous Projects
1.        So far the Bank has lent US$776.4 million in total to the transport
sector, including US$276 million for eight highway projects, US$108.4 million
for two pipeline projects, US$348 million for five railway projects and US$44
million for the Bar Port Project.
Highway Projects
2.        The First Highway Project (Loan 344-YU, US$35 million) was financed
in 1963 for the completion of the coastal section of the Adriatic Highway (422
km) and parts of the Belgrade-Nis road (174 km).  The Second Highway Project
(Loan 485-YU, US$10 million), financed in 1967, was for the improvement of 367
km of roads connecting the Zagreb-Belgrade highway via Sarajevo and Tuzla with
the Adriatic highway. Both projects were completed within the original cost
estimates and agreed time schedules. The Third (Loan 608-YU, US$30 million),
financed in 1969, comprised about 120 km of roads in Croatia, Macedonia and
Slovenia, and was completed in August 1974 with a 20-month delay primarily due
to delays in completing an access road, but which did not impede the operation
of the main highway. This project had an 8% cost overrun, because of infla-
tion and foreign exchange adjustments. The Operation Evaluation Department's
Project Performance Audit Report (No. 1385 dated December 10, 1976) highlights
the completion of the Third Highway Project, with most of the civil works car-
ried out close to the appraisal schedule. The Audit Report (No. 1385), how-
ever, emphasizes the need to adequately study tolls, so that their imposition
does not impede the optimum use of roads and this caution has been taken into
account in the proposed project. The Fourth (Loan 678-YU, US$40 million) was
financed in 1970 for the construction of about 220 km of roads in Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and Vojvodina. Because of expropria-
tion problems in the section of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the project was completed
in December 1975 with an 18 month delay. There was a 12% cost overrun due to
inflation and foreign exchange adjustments. The Audit Report (No. 1632, dated
June 15, 1977) highlights the difficulties encountered in securing right-of-
way, even after assurances were made to the Bank that right-of-way and loca-
tion had been settled before negotiations. Such difficulties, the Audit
Report observes, stem from the decentralization of authority in Yugoslavia,
which enables bodies such as Communities of Interest groups to appeal and over-
turn decisions on location and right-of-way after they have been taken. There
seems to be no easy solution to this problem but more communication between
all groups concerned is being assured to achieve better results. The Fifth



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Highway Project (Loan 751-YU, US$35 million) became effective 8 months late
due to Government administrative delays. The project comprises 153 km of
roads in Kosovo, Macedonia and Slovenia, procurement of US$1.7 million worth
of engineering equipment, consultants' services and a staff training component
to improve highway planning and project preparation. All roads are open for
traffic. The engineering equipment is being delivered and the consultants'
services are completed. The staff training component was delayed because of
difficulties encountered in securing training of candidates in the head office
of foreign consultants and in foreign institutes and because of language pro-
blems. A restricted program is now well underway. Present estimates indicate
an 8% cost overrun because of the combined effect of inflation and foreign
exchange adjustments. Because of the delay in training it is expected that
the project will be completed by the end of 1977, involving a delay of about
15 months. The loan for the Sixth Highway Project (Loan 990-YU, US$30 million)
was made in May 1974 and became effective six weeks later than estimated in
December 1974. The project finances six road sections in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
totalling 150 ki, the training of transportation economists and road engineers
and US$1.1 million worth of engineering and laboratory equipment. Civil works
have been completed satisfactorily. In view of the difficulties encountered
in the earlier project, a part of the training program is being modified by
inviting foreign consultants and specialists to give training courses in
Yugoslavia. The loan for the Seventh Highway Project (Loan 1143-YU, US$40
million) was made in July 1975 and became effective in March 1976. The proj-
ect comprises about 90 km of road construction in Slovenia, Serbia and Mon-
tenegro, and US$0.1 million worth of technical assistance to improve prepara-
tion of highway feasibility studies and to provide a related training program.
The work has progressed satisfactorily in Serbia but is slightly behind sched-
ule in Montenegro and Slovenia, because of expropriation problems and the
challenging difficulties presented by the swampy terrain in Slovenia. The
Eighth Highway Project (Loan 1377-YU, US$56 million) was made in April 1977
and became effective in September 1977. The project comprises about 130 km
of roads in Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo, studies by con-
sultants of road-user charges and rail cost and technical assistance for the
preparation of a highway master plan for Kosovo. Only the road contracts in
Macedonia and one in Kosovo remain to be awarded. Work has started on all the
other contracts. Construction works for all eight projects have been or are
being satisfactorily carried out, reflecting the competence of the Yugoslav
contracting industry.
Naftagas and Oil Pipeline Projects
3.        The loan for the Naftagas Project (Loan 916-YU, US$59.4 million) was
made in June 1973, but, due to organizational reforms within the enterprise,
became effective only in March 1974 after six month's delay. The project is
for the expansion of the gas transmission and distribution systems in Serbia
and Vojvodina by provision of gas field compressors, pipelines, treatment
plants and distribution rings. The supply of natural gas will come from gas
fields in Vojvodina and from Hungarian imports. Due to a substantial increase
in the project costs and a reallocation of priorities in the use of natural
gas, which caused the elimination of some consumers who withdrew their finances



ANNEX 1
Page 3
from the proejct, a delay of more than two years in project implementation has
occurred. It has been decided that the implementation will be carried out in
three phases and only the first two will be implemented now. The additional
funds required will be provided by agencies in Yugoslavia and by a supple-
mentary loan of US$11 million from the Bank under the Sarajevo Air Pollution
Control Project, Loan 1264-YU. Construction started in late June 1976 and the
project is scheduled for completion by year end 1978. The loan for the Oil
Pipeline ProJect (Loan 1173-YU, US$49.0 million) was made in November 1975 and
became effective in July 1976 after four month's delay. The project comprises
the construction of an oil port on the Adriatic coast at Omisalj, near Rijeka,
as well as oil storage tank farms, pumping stations, and pipelines running
from the port through Croatia and Vojvodina and to the Hungarian border.
Phase I is to provide a yearly capacity of 16 million tons and Phase II, 20
million. The international transit portion of Phase I, which is to provide
oil to Hungary and Czechoslovakia, should be completed on schedule in 1978 but
the domestic portion, due to problems of design and procurement, will be com-
pleted a year later. Phase II should be completed on schedule by May 1979.
Railways
4.        The First Railway Loan (Loan 361-YU, US$35 million) was made in 1963
and was substantially completed and put into operation in 1970, i.e. with a
delay of about two years. The Second Railway Loan (Loan 395-YU, US$70 million)
was made in 1964 to help finance a Modernization Program for the main lines.
The Program, which covers electrification, signalling, telecommunications and
marshalling yards, was to be executed between 1964 and 1968, at an estimated
cost of US$185 million, but due to long delays, completion is not expected
before 1978 at over twice the original cost estimated in U.S. dollar terms.
The Bank loan was fully disbursed in November 1972 and completion of the Pro-
gram is being assisted by the Fourth Loan (below). The Third Railway Loan
(Loan 531-YU, US$50 million) in 1968 helped to financed the completion of 372
km of the Belgrade-Bar line.  Completion was originally scheduled for 1973,
but geo-technical and other construction problems in difficult mountainous
terrain delayed the opening of the line until 1976. The cost estimate has in-
creased from US$225 million to about US$422 million. The Fourth Railway Loan
(1026-YU, US$93 million) was made in July 1974 and became effective by the
revised date of February 1975. The loan finances the completion of the 1964
Modernization Program and certain related investments, including track rehab-
ilitation and further signalling works, which are needed to maximize the bene-
fits of the program, all to be completed by the end of 1976. There have been
serious delays in project execution due principally to financial and adminis-
trative difficulties. Government efforts to combat severe inflation have
caused freight rates to lag too far behind the increase in railway costs.
This limited investment funds and the impact on the execution of investments
was compounded by other anti-inflationary measures aimed at reducing the rate
of investment throughout the economy. The railways now expect an acceleration
of project execution and it is hoped that most of the investments to which the
Bank loan is allocated will be completed by the end of 1978. The Fifth Rail-
way Loan of US$100 million is being made in 1978. The project covers the

the principal objective to modernize railway facilities in order to improve
efficiency and the competitive position of the railways.
Port of Bar Project
5.        The loan (Loan 1060-YU, US$44 million) was made in November 1974 to
finance port and railway facilities.  The loan became effective on June 13,
1975. The project is now about 9 months behind schedule due to delays on pro-
curement of grain silos and retendering and negotiations with the lowest bid-
der for the main items of civil works.
