Description         The CEDPL supports legal, institutional, and structuralreformsthat
                    promote growth andthe creationof more andbetterjobs inTurkey
                    by helping(a) maintainthe currently enabling macroeconomic
                    framework;(b) improvethe investment climate-includinga large
                    program ofprivatizationof state owned enterprises (SOEs), (c) set

                    generationof knowledge and innovation,the adoptionofnew
                    technologies, andupgradingthe skills ofthe labor force.

                    The government program supported by the Loancontains core
                    actions, milestonesfor possible future policy actions, and expected
                    results in each ofthe above five broad areas of public policy. The
                    loan supports a portionof the authorities' sustainable andequitable
                    growth strategy with a focus on microeconomicand institutional
                    reforms.

                    The first program area supports the maintenanceof an adequate
                    macroeconomic framework, such as the frameworkthat has
                    underpinnedthe ongoingsustainedphaseof rapideconomic growth
                    that beganin2002 andcontinues to date.

                    The secondprogramarea focuses on improvingthe investment
                    climateto foster the investment andproductivity increases required
                    to maintainrapidgrowth and generate sufficientformal sector jobs
                    to absorbthe large supply of laborresultingfromthe country's
                    demographic dynamics and structuraltransformation.This program
                    area also rewardsthe outcomes of the privatizationprogram
                    implementedby the authoritiesin 2005 and2006 which has
                    contributedto raise competitiveness, productivity, andfiscal
                    revenues.

                    The third program area laysthe foundations for changing labor
                    market regulations so that hiring formal sector workers becomes
                    more attractivefor the privatesector and working inthe formal

sector also becomesmore attractivefor workers. The Loansupports
adiagnosis of labor markets and the discussion of policy options.

The fourthprogramarea assists in consolidatingthe soundnessof
the financial sector and increasingaccess to investment credit and
other forms of investment capital.

The fifth programarea supports increasingthe capacityof the
privatesector to innovate, adopt new technologiesand quality
standards as well as adiagnosis ofthe policiesneededfor endowing
the labor force with better skills-with a view of augmenting
competitiveness over the mediumand longterms.
The potentialbenefitsofthe policiesand reforms supportedby the
loanare high.

An enablingmacroeconomic framework will continueto be an
importantunderlyingdriver for the sustained growth experienced by
Turkey since 2002. At the same time, conduciveand stable
macroeconomic conditionsby themselves are unlikely to guarantee
popular support to structuralreformsbasedon a longterm vision
and requiringsustained implementationover a number ofyears.

Rapidgrowth and convergence with EUper capita income levels
need more investment, higher productivity,more participationin
formal labormarkets, and lower unemployment-all underpinned
by the reformssupported by this operation.Incomeconvergence in
turn would assist in securing popular support for mediumand long
term reformsrequiredfor Turkey to fully realize its economic
potential.
The risksinvolvedare diverse innature and not negligible.Onthe
external front, the current account deficit (CAD) continues to be a
cause for concern as it widened to about 8 percent of gross national
product(GNP) in 2006-in part as a consequenceof higherenergy
prices.

Other risk factors includechanges in financialmarkets sentiment
and their potential effect on public debt sustainability,spillovers
from global liquidity tightening, or fallout from possibleemerging
marketdistress. These factors may affect Turkey becauseof a
comparativelyhigh debt to GNP ratio-although the ratio has
decreasedsubstantially and is expectedto continuedecreasing. The
relatively short average maturityofpublic debt as well as exchange
and interest rate risks add to the possibility of distress-although the
structureof public debt also continues to improve.In addition,
inflation reversedits trend in 2006 increasingto about 10percent-
significantly higherthan the official target of 5 percent. The target
for annual CPI inflation is likely to be missedalso in 2007.
However, inflation is expectedto ease inthe second half of 2007
due to base effects and decreasingdemandside pressures. Volatility

                    2007 and the impacton domestic markets showedthat Turkey is
                    vulnerableto suddenchanges in investor sentiment. Nonetheless,
                    these events also demonstrated that the resilience to shocks has
                    increasedsubstantiallydue to the implementationof sound
                    economic policiesand structuralreformsover the last years.

                    The potentialphasingout in 2008 ofthe programsupportedby the
                    InternationalMonetaryFund(IMF) andthe possibility of a slow EU
                    accessionprocess couldweaken reformanchors that have
                    contributedconsiderablyto the strength of economic policies.

                    Finally, Turkey would benefit from further policy actions in a
                    number of areas suchas labor marketsand educationreform.These
                    reforms,which are challengingto complete even in a stable
                    environmentwith abroad socialconsensus,would be especially
                    difficult to implementina politically discordantenvironment.Thus,
                    continuedoverallstability in Turkey's political economy after the
                    parliamentaryand presidentialelectionsof2007, irrespectiveof
                    their outcome, will likely be importantfor the implementationof
                    key reforms, and its absence would poserisks to the sustainabilityof
                    the objectivesachievedthroughthe reformsto datethat this

                                     I. INTRODUCTION

1.      Turkey is well into a new stage of reform following its impressive recovery from the
economic crises of 2000 and 2001. The country is now addressingsecond and third generation
policy issues that emerged after regaining stability. Turkey has had a very large primary fiscal
surplus since 2001,andmuchhas beenachievedinterms ofbanking sector stability. Economic
stability has helped, but is not enough, to achieve fast convergenceto EUincome levels. Against
the backgroundof low employment generation, declining employment ratios, and comparatively
high unemployment, the authorities are determinedto sustain rapid growth and to improve the
quality of life of its citizens. A comprehensive longterm program to modernize the economy is
under implementation.

2.      The authorities want future growth to be associatedwith morejob creation-as      2002
through 2006 was a period of fast growth but with comparatively low generationof formal sector
jobs. Accordingly, the authorities adoptedand are implementing a program of structural reforms
aimed at increasing competitiveness, sustaining growth, and generating morejobs.

3.      CEDPL supports policy actions infive areas, to help (a) maintain an enabling
macroeconomic framework; (b) improve the investment climate -includinga large program of
privatization of SOEs; (c) set the foundations for overhauling labor market regulations; (d)
increaseaccess to investment capital, and (e) promote the generationof knowledge and
innovation, the adoption of newtechnologies, and upgrading the educationand skills of the labor
force. The Loan supports a portionof a larger governmentprogram which contains actions,
milestones, and expectedresults inthese program areas as well as inother subjects.

4.      The first program area supportsthe maintenanceof an adequate macroeconomic
framework, such as the framework that has underpinnedthe ongoing period of rapidgrowth that
began in2002. The second program area focuses on enhancingthe investment climate to
promote investment, sustain growth close to potential, and to create more formal sectorjobs-
includingthe privatizationprogram implemented in2005 and 2006. The third program area
supports laying the foundations for improvinglabor marketregulations-including       a diagnosis of
labor marketsandthe discussionof policy options for suchdelicate reforms. The fourthprogram
area assists inconsolidating the soundness of the financial sector and increasing access to finance
and investment capital. Finally, the fifth area supports increasingprivate sector capacity to
innovate, adopt newtechnologies and quality standardsas well as a diagnosis ofthe policies
neededfor endowing the labor force with better skills-with     aview underpinning
competitivenessinthe mediumand long terms.

5.      Turkey i s experiencing highgrowth driven in good part by the government's commitment
to sound economic policies. Annual growth averaged 7.5 percent inthe period 2002-2006.
Output increased more than a third inthis period-the      strongest growth performance among
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) members. A critical change
from previous episodes of rapid growth i s that this expansion has been driven by the private
sector. Public sector consumption and investmentexpenditures have been kept under control by
tight fiscal policies.

6.       Substantial progress has beenachieved inreducing inflation and real rates o f interest,
improving public finances, restructuringthe financial sector, improving the business
environment, and reformingthe public sector. Key markets have been liberalized and regulatory
capacity inthe economy has been strengthened-including        bankingsupervision. Strong fiscal
and monetary policies helped improve debt sustainability as well as lower inflation and
inflationary expectations. Stability, predictability, and market confidence have improved.
Convergence with EUlevels o f income per capita i s on-going which-if       maintained-would
represent a significant break from past short-lived economic booms followed by downturns.

7.       Three key challenges remain-namely:      (a) the C A D widened to 7.9 percent o f GNP in
2006-in    part caused by oil prices, domestic demand, and real appreciation o f the currency; (b)
inflation reversed its trendin2006 increasing to about 10 percent-significantly      higherthanthe
official target o f 5 percent; and (c) unemployment persists at about 10 percent in2006-
notwithstanding strong growth for five consecutive years.

8.       Fiscal consolidation has beenthe cornerstone o f the economic program. The public
sector primary balance movedto an average surplus o f about 7 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) during 2004 and 2006 from a deficit o f 1.6 percent in 1999. The public sector
primary balance reached about 6.6 percent in2006-assisted       by increases innon-tax revenues.
Large primary surpluses, falling interest rates, and currency appreciation reduced net public debt
from 91 percent of GDP in2001 to about 45 percent in2006.

9.       The size o fthe fiscal adjustment is unprecedented and its effects onthe economy have
been very positive. Nonetheless, the quality o f fiscal adjustment could be improved as the
primary surpluses were obtained mostly by increasing taxes and reducing the expenditures o f
SOEs. Expenditure rationalization inthe rest o f the general government has been limited.

10.     Monetary policy has focused on price stability-which      has been facilitated by the
adoption o f a flexible exchange rate regime. Implicit inflation targeting was adopted in2002 and
fiscal consolidationrelaxed fiscal dominance over monetary policy. The Central Bank o fthe
Republic o f Turkey (CBRT) uses short-term interest rates as the main instrument to influence
inflation expectations together with targets for monetary aggregates. Explicit inflation targeting
was adopted inJanuary 2006.

11.          On balance, favorable global economic conditions have contributed to a strong economic
performance, Healthy growth inworld trade, low global interest rates, and appetite for emerging
market assets helped Turkey inexpanding exports and attracting capital inflows infavorable
terms-although               oil prices have deteriorated the current account and created inflationary
pressures.

12.          EUaccession negotiations were formally launched inOctober 2005. Turkey completed
the screening process o f all o f the negotiation chapters, provisionally concluded the negotiations
o f the chapters on science and research and i s conducting negotiations o fthe enterprise and
industrypolicy chapter. Therehas beenrecent uncertainty regardingthe pace of EUnegotiations
because o f unresolved issues related to the coverage o f the custom union agreement between
Turkey and the EU.Nonetheless, the government i s committed to accelerating EUrelated
reforms because o f their importance for the country's development.

RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS                                     INTURKEY
13.         Global volatility inthe summer o f 2006 affected all emergingmarkets including Turkey.
There were domestic developments prior to the episode of global volatility which were perceived
negatively by investors andwhich seem to have intensified the effect that the global events had
on local markets. The lira depreciated by 25 percent and the main stock market index lost about
20 percent between early May and end June 2006. This reaction was the strongest inemerging
markets.Turkishassets have bounced back andrecovered most ofthe territory lost duringthis
episode inpartly becausethe CBRT reacted firmly by increasing its policy rates inby 425 bps



                                                                               3

betweenMay and June 2006.' This action was seen as areaffirmation ofthe independenceofthe
CBRT and a signal of its continuing commitment to the disinflation process.

14.     The Turkish economy grew at a fast pace inthe first halfof 2006 as GNP grew by 7.9
percent-driven by high growth inconsumption andprivate investment. Domestic demand grew
faster than total output which caused the CAD to widen in2006. Domestic demand slowed down
inthe second halfoftheyear as aresult ofthe monetarypolicy tightening that followedthe
volatility of May-June 2006. GNP grew 4.4 percent inthe secondhalf of 2006 and 7.9 percent in
the first half- annual growthwas about 6 percent, down from 7.6 percentin2005. The
reduction ingrowth is expectedto continue in2007 and the resulting stabilization of the CAD
makes a soft-landing scenario a more likely outcome. Economic turbulence cannot be totally
discardedincase external or domestic events were to leadto a significant deterioration in
investor sentiment.

17.     Fiscal performance has beenstrong since 2002. The primary surplus reached6.8 percent
of GNP andthe overall deficit declined to below 1percent of GNP in2005. The primary surplus
i s estimated to have reached6.6 percent of GNP in2006-helped         by buoyant one-off revenues.
Exceptional arrears collections-including   from owners of failed banks and social security
participants-are   expectedto reachabout 1.2 percent of GNP. Underlying revenues were also
generally strong. This over-performancewas partlyoffset by spendingoverruns inareas
includinghealth, agriculture, and personnel.

 18.         The government reaffirmed its commitment to a headline primarysurplus o f 6.5 percent
o f GNP inthe 2007 Budget Law. This target will be challenging because o f accounting changes,
civil service wage increases amounting to 0.3 percent o f GNP, and difficulty incontaining the
growth innon-discretionary spending under current political circumstances.2 The government has
committed to implementing measures requiredto attain the primarysurplustarget in2007-
including reducing the public investment envelope.

 19.         The government deserves praise for its commitment to fiscal consolidation. Nonetheless,
there are concerns that improving the quality o fpublic expenditures i s not currently inthe short
term agenda. The Bank's recent Public Expenditure Review indicates that functional allocations
o f public expenditures could be improved interms o f efficiency and cost containment.

20.           Interest rates increased by almost 6 percentage points after the turmoil inthe summer o f
2006. The average yield o f new public borrowing was 19.8 percent inMarch2007-considerably
higher than the levels o f 2005 and 2006 at 17.2 and 14percent respectively. There will be an
additional burdenon the budget from servicing public debt inan environment o f higher rates.

21.      The C A D poses challenges for the economy and remains a source o f concern. Together
withthe strongrecovery inthe economy, the deficit beganwideningin2003. Itcontinued
deteriorating due to rising oil prices and the growing trade imbalance fueled by the appreciation
o fthe currency caused by reverse currency substitution and large capital inflows. A strong
recovery o f private investment and buoyancy o f domestic demandalso contributed to a growing
deficit. After reaching 5.2 percent o f GNP in2004, the C A D widened to 6.3 percent o f GNP in
2005 and 7.9 percent in2006. It i s now expected that deficit will stabilize at around 7 percent o f
GNP in2007 as domestic consumptionhas slowed down.

22.      Turkey's dependence on imported energy together with rising oil prices have led to a
large trade deficit as imports o f oil and natural gas increased from US$ 8 billion in2001 to US$
28 billion in2006. Growth has gone hand inhandwith the growing overall trade imbalance.
Nonetheless, exports have also increased significantly over the last four years and continued to
increase in2006-by        about 12 percent inreal terms. The composition o f exports has improved
with more exports of goods located higher inthe value chain such as automobiles, electronic
equipment andmachinery-which            bodes well for the sustainability o f future exports growth.

of the services, income, andtransfer balanceby 2.2 billion dollars contributed to the current
account balance deteriorating by about 0.6 percent of GNP in2006. Inaddition, the average
services, income and transfers balanceto GNP ratio for the period 2002 and 2006 declinedby 2.6
percentagepoints relative to the average of the 1990s. This fall may be explained by the
adoption by the CBRT of the IMF Manual 5thfor the calculation of balance of payments (BOP)
statistics after 2000 and the high level of dollarization inthe economy during the 1990s-which
madeidentifying whether currency transactions are among residentsor betweenresidents and the

26.     Another factor that contributed to strong domestic demand and the widening inthe CAD

consumer credit. Banking sector loans to the            Figure 3: Substantial Deceleration in Private Credits

29.     The projected slowdown indomestic demand growth andthe monetary and fiscal policy
framework inplace could facilitate a soft landingscenario starting in2007. The long term
sustainability of the current account will greatly depend on two key factors: (a) increased
confidence due to continued political and macroeconomic stability and improvements inthe
investmentclimate to attract more non-debt creating flows-especially green-field FDIand (b)
continued fiscal discipline and improvements inthe quality o f fiscal adjustment to mobilize more
domestic savings to the financing o f investment.

30.     IMFDevelopments:The IMFapproved athree-year SDR 6.7 billion(US$10billion)
Stand-By Agreement (SBA) to support Turkey's economic and financial program inMay 2005.
The program envisions low single digit inflation and a reductioninthe government`s net debt
ratio of 10 percentagepoints o f GNP to about 45 percent. Cumulative purchases amount to
SDR 3.7 billion and an additional tranche o f SDR 750 million was disbursedfollowing
completion of the Sixth Review on May 18,2007. OutstandingIMF credit amounted to
SDR 5.2 billion at end-April.

MACROECONOMIC ANDDEBTSUSTAINABILITY
                     OUTLOOK
31.     Turkey currently has the conditions to sustain growth rates o fabout 5 percent inthe
mediumterm-as       envisaged inthe IMF program. The strong growth inprivate investment
expenditures in2004 (32.4 percent), 2005 (24 percent), and 2006 (14 percent) and strong
industrial production since 2005 support this prospect.

32.     Specific factors underlying the medium-term 5 percent annual growth projection between
2007 and 2009 include: (a) confidence inthe policy framework; (b) macroeconomic stability-
which would stimulate private investment and consumption demand; (c) strong export
performance-which      would permit faster import and output growth; and (d) capital flows-
including FDI. Underthis plausible scenario, the ongoing level o f fiscal adjustment would yield
a permanent reduction inpublic sector borrowing requirements up to a surplus o f about 1percent
in2009.

33.     The CAD increased from the 6.3 percent of GNP in2005 to 7.9 percent in2006 and is
projected to decline gradually thereafter-while    the composition of financing is expected to be
favorable inthe mediumterm. Turkey needs to generate enough medium and long term capital
inflows to meet its large levels o f external financing requirementsto finance high CADS,service
sizeable loan repayments, and keep short-term debt inflows at prudent levels. Net FDIinflows
reached US$19.2 billion in2006 and i s projectedto moderate to about US$ 10 billion per year
on average over 2007-2009-a      major contributionto the country's mediumterm external
financing requirements.

34.     Sustainabilityof publicdebt. The net public debt to GNP ratio fell fi-om ahighof 90.5
percent in2001 to below 45 percent o f GNP in2006. The net debt ratio i s projectedto fall
further in2007-2009. Realization o f this outcome hinges on sustained growth, continuous fiscal
adjustment as represented by primary surpluses o f 6.5 percent o f GNP, stable exchange rates and
a favorable external environment. However, increasing interest rates and the widening ofthe
C A D that have accompanied growth generate risks-given       the short average maturity o fthe
domestic debt and the composition o f the existing debt stock. A considerable portion o f the

exchange (FX) and FX-linked instruments.

                           111.   THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

35.     Turkey's economic policy framework andreform program are described ina number of
separate but consistent documents. The long-term agenda is articulated inthe 23-Year National
Development Plan (2001-23). The initial priorities o f the current administration were spelled out
inthe UrgentActionPlan(UAP) publishedonJanuary 3,2003 and inthe 5gthGovernment
Programpresentedto Parliament on March 18,2003. Turkey also produces an annual EUPre-
Accession Economic Program which details short and medium term policy actions and structural
reform priorities related to EUaccession. The 2005 Pre-Accession Program which covers the
period between 2006 and 2008 was adopted by the HighPlanning Council (HPC) inNovember
2005. Updates to the economic program are approved by the Cabinet o f Ministers which on April
21,2006 adopted the NinthDevelopment Plan (NDP) Strategy for the period 2007 - 2013. In
addition, the country i s implementing an economic program supported by an IMF SBA which i s
expected to be completed inMay 2008.

36.     Key long-term development goals include transforming the country's economic and
social structure inorder to become an influential regional economic power, raisingthe level of
health and education inthe society, improving income distribution, strengthening scientific and
technological capacity, enhancing effectiveness ininfrastructure services and protecting the
environment. The vision i s that o f a modern and secular participatory democracy, fully
integrated inthe European community, playing a critical role inits region, with an export-
oriented, technology-intensive productive structure. Turkey sees the EUaccession process as an
important opportunity for harmonization with international norms and standards.

37.     The NDP for the period 2007 -2013 sets out many o f the elements inthe government's
reform program supported by the CEDPL. The NDPvision i s "a Turkey whichgrows in
stability, shares her income more equitably, is competitive at aglobal scale, transforms into an
information society and has completedthe stage of legal harmonizationfor EU membership."

38.     Inorder to achieve this vision, theNDP comprises five "development axes" or strategic
areas o f action, namely: (a) Increasing Competitiveness, (b) Increasing Employment, (c)
Strengthening HumanDevelopment and Social Solidarity, (c) EnsuringRegional Development
and (d) Increasing Quality and Efficiency inPublic Services. Competitiveness and employment
are the development axes supported by CEDPL. The program supported by CEDPL is a subset o f
the actions included ineach o f these two development axes.

39.     For instance, the competitiveness axis includes actions aimed at (a) achievingpermanent
macroeconomic stability, (b) improving the business environment and investment climate, (c)
decreasing informality inthe economy, and (d) promoting productive research and development
(R&D) and innovation. The employment axis includes actions aimed, among other things, at (a)
bringingabout betterperformance of labor markets with a reasonable balance betweenjob
security and flexibility and (b) increasing the responsiveness of the education system towards the
skills requiredby the market. Annex V presents more details about the NDP.

40.     Consistently with the Country Assistance Strategy ProgressReport (CAS PR) of
November 8,2005 (Report No. 33005-TU), the government and Bank agreedthat this loan will
supportkey componentsof the NDP, namelyapackageof reform containing specific policy
actions aimedat (a) maintaining the currently enabling macroeconomic framework; (b)
improvingthe investment climate -includinga large program of privatization of SOEs, (c)
setting the foundations for overhauling labor marketregulations inthe near future, (d) increasing
access to investment capital, and (e) promoting the generationof knowledge and innovation, the
adoption of newtechnologies, andupgradingthe skills ofthe labor force.

41.     These program areas were chosen inview of their importance, the quality of the
economic and sector work on the subjects conductedjointly by government and the Bank, their
strong relationship to the CAS PR objectives, andthe close relationship and complementarities
amongthemselves which allows combining these elements into a coherent packageof reforms.

              IV.     BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY

LINKTO CAS
42.     The Board of Executive Directors discussed the FY04-06 CAS for Turkey onNovember
6,2003. InNovember 2005 the Board received a CAS PR taking stock of the implementation of
the CAS, setting out some adjustmentsto reflect Turkey's preparation for EUmembership,and
extending the CAS period by another fiscal year through FY07. The ProgressReport left the
strategic framework of the Bank's involvement inTurkey largely unchanged, but appropriate
refinementswere introduced to address emerging issues.

43.     The objective ofthe CAS has beento help Turkey implement fundamental reforms to
reduce economic vulnerability and achieve high and stable growth, and continue the process of
addressinglong neglected social and environmental problems. Inprovidingthis assistance, the
CAS PR envisages two series of Development Policy Loans (DPLs). Public sector reforms have
beensupportedthrough the Programmatic Public Sector Development Policy Loan(PPDPL) and
will be continuedto be supportedunderthe PPDPL 11.

44.     The high case benchmarksenvisioned under the CAS PR have been substantially met-- as
presentedinBox 1below. The following are the CAS PR benchmarksfor the two DPLs and their
status.

    Establishing a UniversalHealth Insurance Fund (UHIF) and a Social Security Institution
    merging three social security system. These two actions were met prior to the presentation
    of the PPDPL to the Executive Directors for approval. The three social security systems have
    been mergedlegally and there has beensubstantialprogressintheir operational merger. The
    legislation relatedto the UHIFwas passedtwice in2006-0ne time to override a Presidential
    veto. Subsequently, the Constitutional Court canceled21 articles and issued an injunctionfor
    portions of nine articles ofthe Law. After the Constitutional Court ruling, the final
    effectiveness and implementation of the law are pending Parliamentaryre-approval. The
    Government is currently devising options to address the Court's decision inaway that would
    preserve as muchas possible the economic benefits from this legislation.

  nearly monopolizedthe reform agenda inthe country causing a delay inthe implementation
  o f other items inthe program; (b) significant political capital has been allocated to reforming
  the social security systemwhich makes adding labor market reform, anintrinsically
  controversial subject, to the national debate unadvisable at thisjuncture; and (c) labor market
  reform inthe present political environment entails the risk of rejection, partial adoption or
  major modification.

COLLABORATION       WITH THE IMFAND OTHERDONORS
45.     The IMF and World Bank teams have collaborated closely inTurkey, andworking
arrangements broadly follow the guidelines for enhanced Bank-Fundcollaboration. This has
included participation o f Bank staff inmeetings with government on the Fund's program review
missions, and IMF staff invitedto key Bank review meetings and meetings with government.
The IMFhas taken the lead inmacroeconomic stabilization andthe World Bank insocial and
structural areas, with close collaboration in structural areas that have a particular impact on
macroeconomic stability. The IMFhas particularly valued the work undertakenby the Bank on
the fiscal analysis ofpensionreform andUHI. The Bank's dialogue and conditionality has
maintained consistency with the macroeconomic framework endorsed by the IMF.

46.     Inthe areasof the government's program supported bythe CEDPL, collaboration
between the Bank and the IMFhas focused on the joint Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), analyzing labor marketperformance, the process o fprivatization o f the state banks, and
CIT and PIT policies. Inaddition, the IMF has taken the lead in short-term measures needed for
fiscal adjustment such as incomes policy, urgent revenue and expenditure measures, and budget
monitoring and reporting. The Bank has taken the lead inassisting government on the medium-
term Public Expenditure Management (PEM) strategy, rationalization o fthe public investment
program (PIP), public procurement reform, accounting reform, and public liability management.
Public employment policy, medium-term tax strategy, anti-corruption strategy and civil service
reform are further areas of Bank involvement.

47.     The ongoing EUaccession process has generated increased demand for the Bank's
services inTurkey. Incollaboration with the European Commission (EC) the Bank completed in
March 2006 the first of a series o f Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) focused on EU
accession and a second C E M i s under preparation. The program i s fully consistent with and
supportive of the Lisbon Agenda which envisions to make the EUone o f the most competitive
and productive regions ofthe world.

48.     The Bank has coordinated closely with the EUits advice on public procurement and
follow up technical assistance to the Public Procurement Agency (PPA). The social security
reforms supported under the first and second PPDPL are inconformity with the EuropeanSocial
Model, and will help Turkey both stay on track interms o f Copenhagen criteria but also move
forward interms of meetingthe Lisbon agenda. The establishment o f regional development
agencies, supported under the PPDPL 2, will help establish the institutional infrastructure
requiredfor the use ofEU's structural funds.

49.     The Bank's assistanceon public debt management issues has beenorientedtowards EU
practices and the Maastricht criteria. The Bank i s coordinating its dialogue on financial
management issues with the EU, and the law on PFMC i s consistent with EUstandards on
internal controls. The EUhas provided support for additional institution-building initiatives
underthe public sector reformprogram, including support for peer review and twinning
arrangements for the Turkish Court o f Accounts (TCA) and support for the Ministry o f Finance
(MOF).

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANKOPERATIONS
50.     The CEDPL is the backboneof the Bank's collaboration with Turkey inimprovingthe
business environment, innovation and knowledge, and the functioning of financial and labor
markets. The CEDPL builds on the reforms inthe financial sector supportedby the Economic
ReformLoan (ERL), FSAL, PFPSAL, PFPSAL 11, and PFPSAL I11loans to Turkey between
2000 and 2004. Reforms related to the CEDPL program areas achievedwith the support ofthese
previous loans include: (a) strengtheningthe regulatory framework for banking, (b) building
institutional capacity at the BRSA and SDIF, (c) restructuring and initial steps inprivatizing state
banks, (d) improving the corporateinsolvency regime, and (e) regulatory reforms, increased
private sector ownership and liberalization of the energy and telecommunications sectors

51.      The investment loansto Turkey financing activities related to the CEDPL program areas
include the Industrial Technology Project of June 1999; Export Finance Intermediation Loan I,I1
and I11of May 2003, January 2004, and May 2006, respectively; and the Access to Finance for
Small and MediumScale Enterprises (SMEs) of June 2006.

LESSONSLEARNED
52.      The World Bank made its first loanto Turkey in 1954, shortly after the country became a
member.The Bank has beenactive invirtually all sectorsandhas conductedagreat amountof
analytical and advisory services. Consequently, numerous lessonshave beenlearned inthis
relationship andthe most relevant from the perspectiveof this Loanare summarizedinthe
Country Assistance Evaluation (CAE) for the period July 1, 1993 to June 30,2004. The Bank's
2005 Review of World Bank Conditionality constitutes another source of lessons learned
relevant to developmentpolicy loans to Turkey.

53.      Lessons learned have beenreflected inthe design of the CEDPL program as follows.
First, inTurkey the Bank benefits from bundling its analytical work and policy dialogue with
lending to achieve effectiveness. The 1993-2004 CAE found that little formal economic and
sector analysis was carried out up to the late 1990s butthat thereafter economic and sector
analysis has become a larger part of the Bank`s program which has increasedprogram
effectiveness materially. The CEDPL program has been designedon the basis of a substantial
amount of analytical work.

54.      Because of benign international liquidity conditions, Turkey is able to borrow from
financial marketsat low spreads andmaturities, sometimes, longer thanthose offered by the
Bank. Inaddition, Turkey has accessto funding from avariety ofother development partners,
which insome cases are able to lendat lower financial and compliance costs thanthe Bank.
Thus, the Bank's ability to effectively engage with the governmenton program design depends
largely on the quality of its analytical work and policy dialogue capability-key  elements in
supporting program ownership. Inthis latter regard, the CAE also found that the policy dialogue
has beenmore effective with the increasedmanagementfocus on Turkey that resultedfrom
greater decentralization of Bank decision-making to Ankara and the increasedrole of the Country
Office inprogram monitoring and implementation. The CEDPL program is being managedfrom
the Country Office with input from staff based inheadquarters, as required.




                                                  14

55.    The 2005 Review of World Bank Conditionality indicates that disbursementconditions
should be few and focused on actions critical for achieving the results sought under aprogram.
The Bank's policy loans to Turkey have seen a dramatic decrease inthe number of conditions.
For example, the ERLwas disbursedin2004-four          years after Board approval. One reasonfor
this long delay is that this loanhad about 40 disbursementconditions. Since the approval of the
ERL,policy loans havebeenincreasingly focused on critical actions. CEDPL has only eight
prior actions.

56.     InTurkey there is aneedto balancebetweenbenchmarksandconditions entailing the
predictability of the overall program supported by the Bank and flexibility relative to agreed
triggers. The CEDPL program attemptsto reachthis balance. Key labor marketreformactions
hadbeen agreedwith the authorities as benchmarks for the CEDPL inlate 2005 during
discussions surrounding the CAS PR. At the time, the authorities were inthe processof
concluding a comprehensivepackageof labor marketreforms with aview of approving it in
2006. Nonetheless, the authorities reactedto unfolding developments by postponing labor
marketreform forjustifiable reasons. The authorities proposedto delay the reform andto obtain
Bank support for the actions that have already beenimplemented.To enhance the substantive
content of the program supportedby CEDPL, the authorities requested Bank support for the
outcomes of the very successfulprivatization program implementedin2005 and 2006.

57.     The Bank agreed to be flexible regarding labor marketreform becausethe substantive
content of the revised program merits support. The Bankrecognizesthat the governmenthas a
well definedprogram which needs to be implementedflexibly and with due regardto the national
debate and politicalcycle. The Bank recognizedthat timing and sequencingofparticular actions
within awell defined program may needto change as national consensus is built and political
negotiations take place.

58.     Country ownership is fundamental for the program supportedby this Loan as evidenced
by the political difficulty entailed by some of the elements inthe envisagedprogram of reforms.
This recognition calls for flexibility and for collaboration with key domestic reforms leaders in
developing the analytical underpinning of the reform for their use intheir own policy dialogue
withnational constituencies.

ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS
59.     The Bank has provided analytical support to the government's program through extensive
economic and sector work on the program areas of the CEDPL including the following formal
reports (a) Labor Market Study-2006, (b) CEM -2006, and (c) CEM inprogress and expected
for mid-2007, (c) Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) -under discussionswith the authorities
andexpectedto be finalized by mid-2007, (d) Joint Bank-Fund FSAP recently delivered to the
authorities, (e) Education Sector Study -2006, and (f) Higher Education Study-inprogressand
expectedfor late 2007. Inaddition, the Bank has contributed numerousnotesandpolicy
discussionswith the authorities to the design and discussionof the program.

62.     Highinvestment will not necessarily lead to higher growth ifit is concentrated inthe non-
traded goods sectors. Such investmentboosts domestic demand-and temporarily also
employment-but       has little impact on productive capacity inexporting and import-competing
sectors. It eventually may leadto even larger CADSand growing foreign debt. By contrast,
private sector investmentinproductive capital intradable goods sectors improves the
sustainability o f the C A D as it can contribute to its reduction inthe future (Figure 5).

63.     Turkey has under-investedinhumancapital (especially as regardseducation andtraining
of women) andhas underutilized the human capital it has-especially female labor. Turkey's
unemployment rate of about 10percent while highis not unusual by the standards o f the EU.
However, what i s unusual i s the very low employment rate. Inmost countries, at least half o f the
working age populationi s employed. The average for the EU-25 was 64 percent in2005, while in
Turkey only 46 percent o fthe working age population hadjobs. Less than 25 percent ofworking
age women was employed in2005, compared to 56 percent inthe EU-25. Improving the
employment content o f growth i s a prerequisite for sustained highgrowth.

64.     The sustainability of fast growth also depends on the capacity ofthe Turkish economy to
fwther improve its competitiveness. Sustaining fast growth will be challengingwithina context
o f global international markets and stronger competition from low-cost producers-especially


                                                    16

from China and India intraditional sectors, such as textiles and clothing, but also inmore
technologically advanced sectors. Improving competitiveness i s important for attracting larger
FDIinflows to finance the CAD, especially inexport-oriented sectors, as pressures on Turkish
exporters may intensify with exchange rate appreciation duringEUaccession. Indeed, exchange
rate appreciation, ifexcessive, `may eliminate some o f Turkey's low-cost competitive advantages,
possibly discouraging export-oriented FDI.Maintaining a fast pace o fproductivity growth will
thus be important to preserve competitiveness.

 65.      Turkey has compensated growing wages with productivity gains that partly offset the
 growth inlabor costs and currency appreciation. Manufacturing wages inUS$ terms more than
 doubled since 2001 after beingdepressedby the crisis. Before 2003 nominal wages were
 effectively tied to the US$ but since inflation has come down labor costs appear to be priced in
 local currency, and as the Turkish lira has appreciated. Consequently, Turkishlabor costs have
 become less competitive. Real wages are now high compared to some competitors innew EU
 memberstates. However, whentakingthe productivity of Turkish firms into account, unitlabor
 costs remain competitive across sub-sectors o f manufacturing (Figure 6).

 66.     The post-crisis period in2002 and 2003 offered an opportunity to increase productivity
 and grow by utilizing idle capacity, but sustaining highgrowth will be increasingly challenging.
 Early inthe recovery period improvedcapacity utilization allowed firms to expand andkeep unit
 labor costs from rising without fundamentally changing production technology and capacity. In
 2002 and 2003, increased capacity utilization added more than 10 percentage points o f
productivity growth inmanufacturing. Since 2003, when capacity utilization reached 84 percent,
the growthhas mostly been sustained by anexpansion o fthe productive capacity ofthe Turkish
economy. As firms are back to normal capacity it becomes more difficult to continue high
growth, and attention must be shiftedto efficiency gains, greater employment growth, and faster
accumulation o f capital.




                                                                      17

67.     Entry and exit among small firms inTurkey has beenvibrant, but surviving entrants tend
to not grow much. Their limited growth may be a result o f rigidities inthe use o f labor,
inadequate access to capital, and some distortions to competition. As a result, most o fthe
productivity growth inTurkey (70 percent) comes from general improvements inproductivity
within firms rather thanthrough reallocation across firms-that      is, through the creation o f new,
more productive firms. Hence, net entry o f new firms contributes to productivity growth because
exitingfirms have very low productivity, but the productivity o f entering firms does not initially
outperform that o f incumbent firms. The lower initial productivity o f new firms (compared to
incumbents) may reflect the cost o f marketing, building capacity, gettingestablished inthe
market, and limitedaccess to credit -areas     where start ups may require attention and better
support.

68.     Expansion o f existing firms can be assisted by implementing reforms aimed at improving
the investment climate-including increasing competitionthrough, for instance, privatization of
SOEs; making labor markets more flexible; providing better access to investment capital; and
promoting the generation o f knowledge and innovation, the adoption o f new technologies, and
upgrading the skills of the labor force.

69.      Evidence from firm level data confirms that external financing helps firms grow, but it
also suggests inefficiencies inthe allocation o f credit. Turkish firms with higher leverage grow
faster. Moreover, export as a share of sales i s positively related to leverage. However, tangibility
(collateral value as a share o f debt) has a negative refationshipwith leverage suggesting that
collateral i s not effectively usedinTurkey. Finally, more profitable firms borrow less again
suggestingthat intermediaries are not very sophisticated inallocating funds where they are best
applied.

70.     Improvedallocation o f capital requires deepening financial intermediation, and Turkeys'
financial sector i s developing rapidly but is still well behind comparator countries. Since the
2001 crisis credit to the private sector doubled to 30 percent o f GDP, but half o fthe growth has
gone to consumer credit. Inadequacies remain in credit markets, where financial reporting i s
underdeveloped, credit information on firms i s scarce, and use of collateral i s inefficient. In
particular, movable collateral (as opposed to land and buildings) suffers from legal impediments
and inadequate collateral registration. Improving those institutionalunderpinningsis likely to
support greater access to finance for firms inTurkey.

71.     Privatizationo f SOEs has contributed to increase Turkey's competitiveness. The
Government substantially accelerated its long-standing privatization program in2004 and 2005.
The agenda is not yet finished as 5 percent o f GDP (and 15 percent o f value added in
manufacturing) is still accounted for by state enterprises. A continued strong privatization
program will help strengthen productivity and create a level and more competitive playing field
inthe private sector. Inalmost every manufacturingsub-sector, laborproductivity growth o f
private manufacturing firms has exceeded that o f manufacturing SOEs over the past five years
(Figure 7). Moreover, SOEs' labor productivity growth has been negative inmany manufacturing
sub-sectors.

74.      There is clear evidence that the authorities are committedto the reformprogram
supported by the proposed Loan. The government's strong commitment to fiscal discipline and
sound macroeconomic policies i s evidenced by the largeprimary surpluses inthe past years and
ensuingreduction inthe ratio net public debt to GDP, the dramatic decrease ininflation andreal
rates of interest-outcomes that have been recognized by the main credit rating agencies with
better country risksratings. Efforts to make the economy more efficient through, for instance, a
privatization program are by nature difficult to implement.

DESCRIPTION THEOPERATION
                OF

76.     The CEDPL is the backbone of the Bank's supportto Turkey's program of medium-term
legal, institutional and structural policy actions aimed at triggering a cycle of investment,
competitiveness, employment and growth inTurkey. The government has adopted awell defined
mediumterm programthat will be implementedflexibly inorder to reactto unpredictable events
as they unfold-including, for instance, the processof EU-accessionnegotiations, political cycles,
and global events.

77.     Accordingly, the CEDPL supports important initial implementation achievementsinfive
connectedsubjects withinthe government's program. All actions and milestones supportedby
CEDPL are includedinTurkey's broader economic policy and reformprogram (see Section IV).
The following are the core policy actions supportedby the Loan. All of them have been
successfully met.

         Thegovernment has maintained a satisfactory macroeconomicframework.
        Bank staff finds the current macroeconomic framework to be satisfactory. IMF Article IV

       Agreement (ILAC-MRA) in the areas of testingand calibration.

78.     Inadditionto the above core policy actions, the authorities have completeda substantial
number of other important policy actions and milestones inthe implementationo fthe broader
reform program supported by CEDPL-as         presented inthe programmatrix inAnnex 11.
Progress of this magnitudebodes well for continued future implementationo f a comprehensive
mediumterm competitiveness and employmentreform program.

79.     What follows is a briefdescription o fthe structural constrains that the actions
implementedunder the program seek to ameliorate or remove. Annexes VI through IX present a
full analysis ofthese issues.

POLICY AREASSUPPORTED BY THELOAN
PROGRAM AREA I:ANENABLING             MACROECONOMIC        FRAMEWORK
80.     Over the last few years, Turkey has beenamong the fastest growing economies inthe
world. Inflationhas fallen to single digits for the first time inmore than two decades, and
macroeconomic vulnerabilities have been significantly reduced. Elements inthis performance
include a tight fiscal policy, a flexible exchange rate, and reforms inthe financial sector. A large
public debt stock andhighroll-over rates imply some vulnerability to exogenous shocks (see
details in Section 11).

81.      The challenge for the authorities i s to minimize the impact that the realization o fthese
risks would have on growth, employment, and poverty. Therefore, the government and the Bank
have agreed that maintaining a satisfactory macroeconomic framework should be a condition for
disbursingthe CEDPL.

82.     Inassessingwhether themacroeconomic framework is satisfactory, Bank staffhave used
projections o f Turkey's medium-termmacroeconomic outlook to assess the sustainability o f its
fiscal program, balance o fpayments, and associated debt dynamics. These projections have been
madeusinga macroeconomic consistency model which focuses on (a) fiscal and debt
sustainability risks, (b) balance o f payment vulnerabilities, (c) monetary and exchange rate risks,
and (d) financial sector risks.

83.     Bankstaffhas also taken into consideration the views o fthe IMFandregardsthe status of
the IMF Stand-Byprogram-in place since May 2005-as             an additional element to conclude that
Turkey's macroeconomic situationis adequate andthat government policies are likely to be
sustainable over the mediumterm.

PROGRAM AREA 11:INVESTMENTCLIMATE
84.     The investment climate supports or hindersopportunities andincentives for firms to
invest productively, createjobs, and expand output affecting economic growth and welfare.
Structural reforms to strengthen the investmentclimate are, therefore, a condition for higher
private investment, faster growth, and for attracting FDI.



                                                  23

85.      The authorities have improvedthe investmentclimate by (a) simplifying administrative
barriers for firms' entry, operation and exit; (b) reducing and simplifyingthe Personal and
Corporate Income Taxes (CIT and PIT) and improving effectiveness o f the tax administration;
(c) drafting state aid legislation, (d) implementing a large program o fprivatization o f SOEs; (e)
contributing to increased FDIinTurkey, and (f) focusing on improving corporate governance.
                                         I




Firm entry, exit, and licensing

 86.     Streamlined entry and exit procedures encourage entrepreneurs to open new firms and
favor a process o f creative destruction, that is, the exit o f less productive firms which increases
average productivity levels. Turkey has streamlined business registrationprocess since 2003. As
a result, it now takes only 9 days to open a business inIstanbul, one o fthe fastest registrations in
the world. However, registration costs-estimated between US$ 726 and US$ 1,255-are                   high
and significantly above those o f comparator countries (Table 4). Some fees could be more
transparent and others-such         as those for notarizing a company's articles and accountingbooks
and those related to the trade registry-are        excessive.

87.      Closing a businessi s expensive inTurkey. According to the Doing Business Report,
insolvency procedures take about 6 years and recovery rates are very low at 10 percent inthe
average. Turkey's performance on exit i s worse than comparator countries (Table 4).

88.      Complex and costly licensing procedures create incentives for entrepreneurs to conduct
business without all the permits required by law or to remain completely informal. Costly
procedures provide opportunities for corruption. It takes 66 days on average to obtain a business
license inTurkey, more than inall comparator countries, and the licensing process i s expensive
as obtaining a license from a Turkish municipality costs US$319 incomparison to an average o f

about US$50 inEuropean countries (please see Figure 8 and Table 5). Factors that complicate
the licensingprocess include: (a) an excessive number oflicenses requiredfrom firms -estimated
at about 200 (including licenses for general business, sector licenses and special permits); (b)
requirementofmandatory licenses evenfor purposes beyond health, safety and environmental
protection; (c) an excessive number o f agencies involved ingranting licenses-such              as the
Chambers o f Commerce, the Ministries o f Environment and Health, Fire Departments, the State
Hydraulic Works Department, and the State Railways Administration; and (d) an unclear role o f
municipalities, which inTurkey differently from other countries-are              often responsible for
examiningother authorities' approvals inseveral areas (e.g., urbanplanning, safety, healthand
environment)-increasing      bureaucratic costs for firms andresults inan unclear and often
discretionary decision-making process.

89.      The authorities' program supported by the CEDPL includes measures aimed at improving
entry, exit and licensing. The loan supports (a) the drafting and submission to Parliament o f a
Commercial Code, (b) pilot testing o f electronic execution of company registrations with the idea
o f expandingelectronic access to all companies wishing to register inthe future; (c) unifying
registrationprocedures for the entire country; and (d) streamliningthe process for licenses.

Taxpolicies and tax collection

90.     The 2007 ICA found that avoidance o fValue Added Tax (VAT), CIT, and other taxes is
a key determinant inthe decision to remain inthe informal sector by entrepreneurs. Because o f
extensive tax evasion and a narrow tax base, hightax rates inTurkey do not necessarily translate
into hightax revenues (Figure 9). The ICA also reveals that informal firms have lower
productivity and employment than formal firms, supporting the importance o f reforms aimed at,
reducing tax rates and at facilitating tax payments to increase the tax base.

91.     CIT rateshave beenhigh and complex -although reductions have beenrecently
introduced. Previous CIT investment allowances distorted relative prices of capital and labor in
ways which provided artificial incentives to adopt capital intensive and labor saving
technologies. The comparatively high CIT rates increasedincentives for informality, decreased
incentives to hireworkers, and, everything else the same, affect negatively FDI.

92.     PIT has also beenhigh and complex. The top PIT rate was at 40 percent and there were
five tax brackets within a systemwhere the regimes for wage and non-wagewere not unified.
This system contributed to creating incentives for self-employed entrepreneursto remain inthe
informalpart of the economy. Recently the top PIT was reducedto 35 percent and the number of
brackets i s now four.

93.     To the extent lower incometax rates reduce incentives for evading taxes, the impact on
lower average tax rates needs to be mitigated by reducingtax evasionby strengthening tax
administration.

94.     The program containsactions to bringabout improvements intax policy andtax
administration as key components of the business environment. The loan supports (a) reducing
the maximumCIT bracket from about 30 to 20 percentoftaxableprofitsand eliminating capital
investment allowances, (b) first steps inreducing informality and increasing the share of direct
taxes infiscal revenues by reducing and simplifying PIT as well as unifying the taxation of wage

State aid

95.      Turkeydecided to implementreforms of its state aid regimein 1996 inthe context o f its
Customs Unionwith the EU. These commitments include makingTurkish State Aid legislation
compatible with the EUAcquis, as well as notifying the EC o f all aid schemes inforce and o f any
aid to be granted. Turkey has yet to fulfill these commitments. An initial assessment shows that,
although Turkey has made progress towards horizontal objectives, it still uses a wide range o f
state aid instruments without formal procedures for monitoring and control o f potential
distortions.

96.      Several programs and instrumentschannel state aid, inamounts that still lack sufficient
clarity. Examples include grants, state guarantees, exemptions from customs duties and VAT,
reduced electricity tariffs, credit allocations from the budget, and landallocation. The total fiscal
cost of these programs is not available due to the general lack o f systematic disclosure on the
issue.

97.      Some o fthese instruments have a potentially distorting effect on competition-such                           as
electricity consumption subsidiesgranted to firms establishedinless developed areas, as they
constitute operating rather than investment aid. Overall lack of transparencyinTurkey's state aid
may contribute to perceptions (regardless o f whether founded or not) o f favoritism toward certain
firms or industries which represent a significant deterrent for the contestability indomestic
markets and FDI. Consequences o f this situation include less intense competition which reduces
efficiency and growth and lower levels o f investment due to uncertainty on the part o f potential
entrants.

98.      The loan supports a first step aimed at increasing competition, levelingthe playing field,
and reducing distortions by drafting o f satisfactory state aid legislation inconformity with EU
directives.

Privatization

99.      Historically, Turkey has relied heavily on SOEs-a         large number o f which were
established duringthe 1930s with a view to accelerating economic development. Over time,
their performance includedpoor financial results, overstaffing, dependence on subsidies and
unilateral budget transfers, protected markets, and non transparent business practices. The
implications o fthis performance included, through out the years, budget deficits, inflation,
uncompetitive markets, and highdomestic input costs.

100.     SOEs have cost substantial tax payer resources interms o f direct transfers and high
opportunity cost o f the capital invested. Transfers from the Government to the SOEs have
averaged about US$ 1.4 billion annually since         -
1985 (Figure 11). Inaddition, the opportunity              Figure 11: BudgetaryTransfers and External

because real interest rates have also beenhigh.
SOEs have raised external financing o f about
US$800 million on average per year. Inshort,
the operation ofthese enterprises hasbeen
costly.

101.     SOE presence has also impaired
productivity over the last five years becausein       I    -41                                                            I

manufacturing sub-sectors. The economic
transformationexperienced by the private sector       7,000
over recent years has not spilled over to SOEs.
A privatizationprogram was launched in 1984
but it was largely stalled by the resistance from     4,000
organized interest groups which successive            3,000
coalition governments were not able to
overcome.

102.    The government reinitiated privatization            1989   1991     1993   1995   1997     1959  2001    2003 2005

state involvement ineconomic activities, relieving the financial burden on the national budget,
increasing competition, and developing domestic capital markets.

103.    In2005 and 2006, the authorities privatized 58 enterprises andmajor state-owned assets
with total value o f sales o fUS$ 17.7 billion(Figure 12). This accomplishment has no precedent
interms ofthe number, revenue collectedbythe Treasury andimportance o fthe privatized
enterprises. Several factors contributed to this positive result including enhanced



                                                 28

macroeconomic stability, a revised legal and regulatory framework, and support of World Bank
loans to finance labor restructuring and severance paymentsfor displacedworkers.

104.   The authorities expect the medium term outcome ofthe privatization processto include
enhanced efficiency through private ownership and better product market competition-key
elements for raising production efficiency. Importantly, privatization has contributed to
positioning the country as an attractive and investment-friendly location adheringto free trade
principlesand fostering more dynamic capital marketswhere bothdomestic andinternational
investors are welcome. The signaling power of the privatization processhas beenpowerful.
Additional benefits include developing domestic capital markets.Privatization has also been
accompaniedwith enterprise reforms and labor restructuring for the remaining SOEs. As aresult,
the performanceof these other SOEs has improved. Dividends grew andbudgetary transfers
from the Treasury declined.

105.    The Bank reviewed of the practices usedby the Privatization Administration (PA) by
analyzing indetail the sale processusedfor a sample of 20 out the 58 enterprises privatized in
2005 and 2006. This sample of SOEs and major state assets corresponds to 97 percent by value
of the 58 privatizations (Annex VII). The Bank's review concluded that the PA usedappropriate
sales methods inits privatizations inthe two year period-namely:    block sales where strategic
buyerswere needed, IPOs where broadpublic participation was the aim, asset sales where
appropriate and concessions where it was deemed that public assets (mostly infrastructure)
neededto be under governmentcontrol but where private operatorswere requiredto bring
operational efficiency.

106.    Outside financial advisors have beenusedappropriately, inline with best practice, for the
bigger privatizations and where reputablefinancial advice is akey to success. Privatizations
have beenadequately announcedand publicized by the PA andthe government and bothforeign
and domestic buyershave beengenerallyencouragedto participate. The sales processes have
beenopen, transparent andcompetitive andtender pre-conditions appropriate. Post privatization
conditions have not beenonerous and golden shares, while common, have not involved excessive
government interference inthe private market.

107.    The Bank also reviewed the procedures followed by the PA to address environmental
pollution by SOEs privatized in2005 and 2006. As presentedindetail inthe environmental
aspects sectionof this document and inAnnex VII, the review concludedthat these
environmental procedures deserve Bank support-although it also established that they are
subject to further improvement along recommendations shared with the authorities.

108.    Overall, the Bank's findings are consistent with awidely heldview that the process of
privatization in2005 and 2006 was broadly fair and its results transparent. Table 6 lists the 58
transactions inthe 2005-2006 privatizations. The 20 transactions usedas the sample are
highlighted.

FDI

109.    FDIinflows inTurkey surgedto more than US$9.8 billion (2.7 percent of GNP) in2005
(Figure 13) and to about US$20.1 billionin2006-more              than twenty times the average annual
amount of inflows observedprior to 2003. FDIinthe first quarter o f 2007 reachedUS$9.2
billion. The 2003 "FDI Law" assistedinincreasing flows by, among other things, streamlining
investment procedures, enhancingrights of foreign investors so that they are treated equally to
their domestic counterparts, andeliminating minimumcapital requirements.

110.    The service sector including banking andtelecommunications haveattractedthe largest
share of foreign investment, closely followed by non-regulatedservices, such as trade and hotels.
Most of the FDIflows reflect acquisition of existing businesses, including privatizations.
Comparatively limited amounts of FDIhave financed "green field" projects. FDIinthe
manufacturing sector has beenlow (Figure 14).

111.      While welcoming the recent increasesinFDI, the authorities recognize that Turkey still
receives lower FDUGNP than selected comparator countries and that further actions to improve
Turkey's broadinvestment climate will have further positive impact on FDI. The authorities
envision additional specific reforms to promote FDIbecause of its importance inthe sustainable
funding of country's investment requirementswhich are expectedto remain above domestic
savings inyears to come.

112.      Accordingly, the program contains policy actions to make Turkey a more attractive FDI
destination. The loan supportsthe recent establishment of Investment Support and Promotion
Agency of Turkey (ISPA) as an important implementationmilestone of the program. ISPA

PROGRAM AREA 111:LABOR              MARKET      REFORM
113.      While Turkey faces the challenge of atwin "jobs deficit"-low                 employment rates and
high informality, inthe past year employment has improved moderately The latest Household
Labor Force Survey figures indicate that employment as of January 2007 was 915,000 higher
than it hadbeen 12months earlier. The unemploymentrate for those 15 years of age and over
was 11percent, down from 11.8 percent inJanuary 2006. The employment rate is well below the
rate inany of the EUmembercountries, and 17.5 percentagepoints below the EU-27 average for
2005.6

114.      These gains notwithstanding, labor marketsinTurkey have performed poorly interms of

Statistical Institute(TURKSTAT) figures which are basedon a working-age populationdefinition of 15 years and
over.

o f primeworking age explain much o f the
difference inemployment rates between
Turkey and the EU. As Turkey has
urbanizedand families have moved out o f
agriculture, employment rates for women
have fallen significantly. As a result,
women o f prime working age are
employed at less thanhalf the rate inthe
EU-15 (Figure 16). A significant numbero fwomen who are not working are not looking for
employment, a principal reason for the low labor force participation rates.

117.     Unemploymentrates are especially highfor educated young people (Table 7). Both
demand and supply factors are likely to matter inthis outcome inthat the economy may not be
generating jobs that can absorb educated young, but also the educated young may not be well-
suited to thejob market.

118.     Finally, a large share of employment is inthe informal economy. Approximately one in
three workers inurbanareas and three infour inrural areas are not registered with the social
security institutions. Since much o f Turkey's formal social protection system (pensions, health
insurance, and unemploymentinsurance) i s based on membership inthe social security
institutions, this means that many workers are not receivingthese protections. While few receive
pensions, health insurance, and unemployment insurance, even fewer receive the full severance
pay and other protections stipulated inthe employment legislation.

119.     The policy actions inall program areas will assist labor market performance through
elements outside labor markets that also affectjob creation as, for instance, a sustainable
macroeconomic framework, improvementsto the investment climate, and investment inphysical
and humancapital are all buildingblocks for growth and morejobs. Risinglabor productivity
through competitiveness andimproved labor skills provide a basis for better formal sector jobs.

120.     This said, more flexibility is required inlabor markets. Flexibility could be
complemented with more effective social protection through retraining and active and passive
labor market programs. Bothelements are critical for creating more andbetterjobs as Turkey
continues to open up to the global economy. These general principles have been adopted by the
authorities indesigning a comprehensive labor market reform which i s expected to be
implemented when the political environment becomes more conducive to a national dialogue
leading to the adoptiono f such reforms.

121.     This Loan supports laying the foundations for designinga package o f labor market
reform-including      that the objectives o f such programhave beenadopted as one o f the five
strategic priorities (development axes) o f the NDP.

PROGRAMAREA         Iv:CREDIT     AND CAPITAL MARKETS
122.     Improving firms' access to finance i s a cornerstone inupgrading Turkey's
competitiveness. The banking sector, which dominates the financial system, i s evolving from
lendingalmost exclusively to the government and to bigand often related firms to lendingmore
to the private sector-although     government securities still represent about 35 percent o fthe
system's total assets.

123.     The recent improvementin financial intermediation has been facilitated by better
economic policies and improved regulation and supervision o fthe banking sector inparticular.
Bankshave gained better accessto internationalcapital marketsthus loweringtheir cost of
financing, and thereby fostered a strategic shift infocus to credit generation to the private sector.
As a result, credit has grown from 12.3 percent o f GDPin2002 to 30 percent in2006. However,
consumer lending has been an important driver of the recent credit growth, because it i s a fairly
straightforwardbusiness segment to scale up, while lendingto firms has grown at a less
impressive pace. The pace o f credit growth to firms is inpart limitedby banks' need to manage


                                                    33

their risks and increase their number o f staff with anunderstandingo f lending to SMEs and
associated risks. However, it i s also inpart limited by inadequate institutional underpinnings for
the credit market.

124.    The importance of finance for competitiveness is suggested by the positive linkbetween
access to finance and financial reporting on the one hand, and the propensity to export on the
other. Firmswith external finance inthe form o f bank loans had a 4.6 percent greater likelihood
o f being classified as exporters, and firms usingexternal audits hada 7.3 percent greater
likelihood o f beingexporters.

125.     A study of the capital structure o f firms inTurkey provides insight into the financial
sector's contributionto private sector performance. The study related the leverage o f thousands
o f firms to indicators such as profitability, liquidity, and tangibility (collateral value as a share o f
debt) and found that leverage, measured as external resources as a share o f total liabilities, has
the following relationshipwith other variables:

     0   Profitability has a negative relationship with leverage. This suggests that firms appear to
         turn to external borrowing when internal cash flow is insufficient to cover investment
         needs This negative relationship i s consistent with the possibility that the financial sector
         has not been efficient in allocating resources to the most productive issues in the
         economy.
         Tangibility (collateral value as a share o f debt) has a negative relationship with leverage,
         in contrast to expectations and to the results of most other empirical studies around the
         world.
         Firm size (measured by employment) has a positive relationship with leverage. Larger
         firms are easier for creditors to evaluate, as their corporate governance and financial
         disclosure are likely to be more transparent, and therefore have easier access to external
         finance.
         Growth inproduction i s positively related to leverage.
         Exports as a share of sales are positively related to leverage. The reason i s not obvious
         but it may be related to greater sophistication of exporting firms, location inmajor urban
         areas, and perhaps a better ability to leverage export receivables as collateral for
         borrowing.

 126.    Continued improvement inthe volume of credit to firms and the efficient allocation of
credit depends on the institutional underpinningso f credit markets. The financial sector reforms
pursued inthe post-crisis period focused on fostering economic and financial stability and
ensuringthe soundness o f financial institutions. This has greatly improvedthe funding
conditions o f financial institutions. Solidifying these achievements will require continued
enhancing o f supervision and sound economic policies but also focus inbuildingbetter
institutional underpinnings for credit generation.

127.     A related issue is that state owned Ziraat Bank and Halk Bank, and state-controlled Vakif
Bank represent about 30 percent share o ftotal bankingsystem assets. Inthe aftermath o f the
2001 financial crisis, Ziraat Bank, Halk Bank and Emlak Bank were recapitalizedand



                                                    34

operationally restructured. Today, Ziraat Bank, Halk Bank and Vakif Bank are all profitable
banks.

 128.   Turkey has goodprospects for a vibrant financial sector that will assist developingthe
private sector by allocating credit inan efficient manner which inturnwill foster
competitiveness, growth and employment. Accordingly, this Loan supports policy actions to
bringbetter accessto investmentcapital inanenvironment o f financial sector stability by (a)
reducing state ownership inthe bankingsector through and IPO for 25 percent o f the shares of
Halk Bank; (b) consolidating the soundness o f the financial sector through BRSA publishingand
implementing24 regulations requiredfor the effective implementation ofthe 2005 BankingLaw;
and (c) increasing access to housing, boosting investment inconstruction, helpingbanks manage
their risks, and improve creditor rightsthrough enacting a satisfactory law onresidential real
estate mortgages; (d) disclosing credit history and performance o f consumers (credit scoring or
reporting); and (e) preparinga diagnosis o fthe regime for usingmovable assets to secure
transactions.

130.    Strong corporate governance increases firms' accountability and transparency, inturn
helping firms obtain the capital necessary for investment.Weaknesses inthe corporate
governance framework include (a) lack o f reliable public information on corporate ownership
and financial statements, despite improved disclosure requirements; (b) insufficiently
independent and accountable boards o f directors, and unsupportive legal environment for
shareholder suits; and (c) some corporate governance practices inconsistent with international
best practices (Table 8).

131.     The key immediate step under the program inthis regard is to reviewthe Turkish
Commercial Code and to make the Code consistent withthe EUAcquis. Accordingly, a
satisfactory new Commercial Code was drafted and submitted to the Parliament. Additionally,
also aimed at improving shareholder rights as a necessary condition for further capital market
development, the authorities have conducted an assessment o fthe observance o f OECD
Corporate Governance Principles. These actions are supported by this Loan.

PROGRAM AREA       v:INNOVATION,      TECHNOLOGY,     QUALITY STANDARDS, AND LABOR          SKILLS
 132.    There is an emerging national consensusthat improving technological capacity-via
quality standards, technology absorption, or innovation-and       augmenting the skills o f the labor
force i s necessary for increasing Turkey's productivity and competitiveness. Accordingly, the
program supported by this Loan focuses on improvements inharnessingknowledge factors for
productivity and employment, including (a) innovation and technology adoption, (b) quality and
standards, and (c) labor force skills. Innovation, new technologies, quality standards and better
labor skills should lead to greater production efficiency, increased value-added o f exports and
making formal sector labor a more attractive factor o f production.

Innovation and TechnologyAdoption

 133.    The ICA found that innovation and adoption o fnewtechnologies such as equipment,
computers and the internet have a positive and significant effect on firm productivity. Although
individual innovations can eliminatejobs because, for instance, new machinery and equipment
andnew workforce management systems can be labor-savingfor firms; the net effect on
aggregate employment i s expected to be positive. One reason is that innovative firms are on
average more likely to survive and to grow rapidly than firms that do not innovate. Another
reason i s that the loss of jobs in some companies i s outweighed by the creation o fjobs innew
firms that enter the market to exploit the opportunities generated by technological progress.

134.     Investment inR&D - a key source o f innovation, has improved inTurkey, but private
sector R&D i s still low. Turkey has almost doubled its gross expenditures on R&D (GERD),
which reached 0.66 percent o f GDP at the end o f 2002-placing       Turkey inthe middle o fthe
GERDrankingcompared to OECD countries. However, despite an increase inoverall and
private R&D, firm-financed GERD inTurkey is still relatively low, at 41 percent o f the total in
2002. Additionally, R&D performedby enterprises affiliated with foreign firms remains low. The
existing low levels o f private R&D and R&D commercialization limit the productivity and
competitiveness.

135.     The low number o f patents filed by Turkish inventors nationally and internationally, the
incomplete alignment o f Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) legislation with Acquis requirements
and inadequate IPRenforcement-taken        together-limit   investments, innovation, and the
competitiveness o f Turkish firms. Despite recent progress to improve protectiono f IPR and
facilitate patent applications, more effort i s needed to ensure full compliance o f IPR legislation
withAcquis requirementsand for the creation of a comprehensive legal and implementationIPR
framework. This i s an important condition for fostering productive innovation inTurkey, because
patents are effective instruments to protect inventions with industrial applicability. The number
o f patents filed by Turkish innovators inthe US i s similar to those o f some comparators


                                                   36

(although it i s below those o f most OECD countries and several emerging markets). Patents
granted to Turkish inventors by the EUare limited, and the number o f patents registered locally
i s extremely low.

136.     The Government has taken steps to improve protectiono f IPRs and facilitate patent
applications. The Government has revised IPR legislation to improve alignment with EU
requirements. To ensure full consistency with EUregulation, an IPR Specialization Committee
has beenset up in2006 under the State Planning Organization's (SPO's) coordination. The
Government has also initiated a consultationprocess to modify the laws on trademarks, patents,
geographical indications and industrial designs. The institutional capacity o fthe Turkish Patent
Institute(TPE) has beenstrengthened to improve its efficiency. Pending issues include full
alignment o f IPR legislationwith that o f the EU-notwithstanding recent changes, Turkish IPR
laws are still not consistent with EUrequirements-improving        the enforcement o f the revised
IPR laws and increasing TPE's autonomy.

 137.    Accordingly, CEDPL supports improving innovation and technology adoption through
enacting a law on adoption o f the Agreement on Amendment to the European Patent Convention.
There is a large numbero f additional initiatives ongoing (Annex IX) which are expected as the
authorities continue implementing their programs inthe future.

QualityStandards

 138.    The I C A also found that use o f quality standards increases productivity and exports o f
firms. Quality standards also help diffuse technology. Quality standards increase productivity
through simplification andrationalization o f production and distribution processes. They also
increase the efficiency o fthe develapment, manufacturing and supply o fproducts and services
because they standardize processes and components, allow for flexibility through component
substitutionand bring about economies o f scale. Second, quality standards contribute to
increased exports because they lower transaction costs between suppliers and clients by
communicating reliable and consistent informationabout the characteristics and quality o f
products and services, facilitating exports to foreign firms (intermediate clients) and final
customers. Finally, standards usually embody technology and act as a channel for technology
transfer for the institutions and firms that adopt them, enhancing their productivity and
competitiveness.

139.     Turkey has a functioning National Quality System (NQS) inplace, comprising the
Turkish Standards Institute (TSE), the TURKAK, the National Metrology Institute (UME) and a
number o ftesting and calibration laboratories, as well as certification and inspectionentities in
both the private and public sectors.

140.     Outstanding issues inthe TurkishNQS include uneven use o f quality standards among
Turkish firms and labs; incomplete alignment o f quality standards legislationwithAcquis
requirements and needfor further institutionalreforms o fthe national standards, accreditation
and metrology institutions. These shortcomings limit exports, the potential for creation of supply
chains between foreign and local firms, competitiveness, growth andultimately the generation of
highqualityjobs inmodernsectors ofthe economy.

141.     Demand for quality certification among Turkish firms is improving, but Turkey still lags
behind other OECD countries. From 1993 to 2004, the number o f International Organization for
Standardization (ISO) 9000 certificates grew, on average, by 62 percent inTurkey, versus 22
percent inthe EU-25, However, I S 0 9000 diffusion i s much more prevalent inmanufacturing
than inother sectors, and i s still low relative to other OECD countries (Figure 17). Certification
i s also less common among SMEs than larger firms.

certification bodies, and inturn for private firms. InApril 2006, Turkey was accepted by the
Multilateral RecognitionArrangement for quality management systems, testing, calibration and
inspection o f the EA-MLA.'Turkey has yet not been accepted by EA-MLAfor product
certification and environmentalmanagement system certification.

 143.     European standards constitute a growing share o f Turkey's large and rapidly-growing
standardstock, butTurkey's participation indevelopment ofregional standardsremains limited.
The standards stock inTurkey has significantly grown inthe past few years, with European
standards accounting for more than 50 percent o f the stock. Turkey has now adopted more than
90 percent o f European Standards. One-third has been adopted inEnglish. Translation o fthe
required standards could assist firms inusingthese standards to export to the EU.Furthermore,
as a membero f the European regional standards institutions CEN and CENELEC (European
Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) Turkey would increase its ability to contribute
to the development o f European standards.

144.    TSE has been granted institutional autonomy from the government, but its structure i s yet
to filly conform to European and international norms and it faces restrictions v i s - h i s its
workforce. Areas where standardization could be improved include the role o f TSE's Technical
Board inmandatory standards, the openness o f the standards development process to private
stakeholders, and the separation betweenTSE's standardization and commercial services
activities. InJanuary 2006, a new law for public entities imposed restrictions on contracting
outside experts and purchasing equipment, affecting TSE's ability to deliver the services needed
to finance the standards development process, particularly inareas that require very specialized
technical skills.

145.     CEDPL recognizes and supports two actions aimed at improving quality standards,
namely (a) the acceptance o f TURKAK as a signatory member o f EA-MLA inthe areas of
calibration, testing, quality system certification and inspectionand a signatory o fthe ILAC-
M U 8inthe areas oftestingandcalibration, and (b)the drafting ofarevisedTURKAK law
consistent with EUAcquis and EA-MLA.There i s a number o f additional initiatives ongoing
(Annex IX)which are expected to be implemented inthe future.

Laborforce skills

 146.    Finally, the ICA also found that productivity andemployment are positively associated
with the availability of skilled labors, training providedto employees, andthe education of
managers. They are also related to FDI. On the one hand, availability o f advanced skills helps
attract FDI. On the other hand, foreign-owned firms help improve the skills o fthe labor force by
hiringforeign workers andtraining local employees. A workforce with advanced labor skills is
essential to ensure that firms can adopt and adapt new technologies and quality standards

147.     Education and skill levels inTurkey lag international standards, including the OECD and
the EU, andpresentamajor concern andbottleneck for Turkey injob creationand
competitiveness. Over the past few years, Turkey has made remarkable progress ineducation but
the country continues to face a significant challenge inimproving educational outcomes and
employment o f young people.

 148.    While enrollment inbasic education has increasedby over 1million since the 1997
reform; about ten percent o f school-age children are still not enrolled inprimary school. Many o f
themare girls, or live inrural areas, or are poor. Challenges also remain inimprovingthe quality
o f primary school education.

149.     Enrollment and completion o f secondary education, which have increased inthe past ten
years, are still low by international standards. In2005,40 percent of 20 to 24 year olds had a
secondary degree, one half o f the rate for the EU15 and well below the Lisbon target o f 85
percent (see Figure 18). The rates are lower for girls and for poorer regions.

150.     Inaddition, while the top students inTurkeyperform well, the vast majority ofTurkish
secondary school students perform at the lowest proficiency levels inbasic competencies and

better labor market outcomes overall; however, well-educated young people have problems
makingthe transition into the labor market.For the entire working-age population, participation
and employment are positively correlated with educational attainment. This correlation is
particularly strong for women. While education matters, data indicate that unemployment i s high
for the well-educated young. Unemployment rates for people with tertiary education decline
significantly at later ages, suggesting that the transition from school-to-work i s a protracted one
for those who have gone to postsecondary institutions.

153.    Low levels of education translate into a workforce with education and skill deficiencies.
According to the recent ICA, the Turkish workforce inthe manufacturing sector has lower levels
o f education than nearly all comparator countries. Almost 60 percent o fthe Turkish workforce in
the manufacturingsector has less thanten years of education, compared with 9 percent in
Bulgaria, 27 percent inVietnam, 33 percent inChile, and40 percent inPoland. At the present
time, the demand for a highly qualified workforce inTurkey outstrips the capacity o fthe
education system andthe labor supply.

 154.   Not surprisingly, Turkishfirms view the level o f education and skills inthe workforce as
a significant constraint on operations and growth. One third o f firms inthe Investment Climate
Surveys (ICs) rate education and skills as a major or very severe constraint, more than any of the
comparator countries except Brazil. Polandand Bulgaria were much lower, each below 20
percent (see Figure 19).

 155.   Turkey has the opportunity to gain better skills andbetterjobs bybringingthe educational
levels and qualifications o f its populationup to international norms. Increasing pre-school
enrollments, improving attendance of girls, bringingschool quality and teaching at all schools up
to international standards, raising participation insecondary schools, equipping vocational and
general secondary school graduates for a more competitive work environment, expandingand
diversifying higher education while improving the quality and relevance of the education to the
demands o fthe labor market are essential.

156.    The authorities have designed a program o f reform that i s expected to be implemented in
the medium term. This program, adopted as part o f the NDP, has two key pillars for education
modernization and reform: (a) increase the sensitivity o f education to the demand; and (b)
enhance the educational system.

157.    The NDP emphasizes the need for a lifelong education strategy to ensure individuals have
the skills needed for a changing and developing economy and labor market.Transformation to a
modular and flexible system invocational and technical education i s expected, with vocational
training at higher and secondary education levels transformed and integrated to ensure that all
students havethe needed skills and competencies. Students will be educated to have the skills
requiredby the labor market. Other issues, includingexpanding pre-school education, improving
teacher qualifications, reforming the entrance examination system for universityentrance and
restructuringuniversities, are also included inthe plan.

158.     To help implement the NDP, several reforms have already begunto be implemented,
including curricula reform and a newVocational Qualification Authority. These are the specific
reforms supported by this Loan, as follows.

         Curricula reform has begunat the secondary level buildingon comprehensive curricula
         reform inbasic education. Curricula for five programs - Turkishliterature, grammar,
         geography, mathematics, and ICT -have been reformed to reflect needed skills and
         competencies. The new curricula, implemented for all students inthe gth-lothgrade in
         the 2006-2007 school years, will help to support the skills andcompetencies neededby
         Turkishstudents.

    0   The Vocational Qualification Authority Law was approved inOctober 2006 to link
        education and qualifications intechnical andvocational fields with occupational needs
        andstandards. The new law will establishandcarry out the newnational qualifications
        systemto comply with the principles adoptedthe EU. Certificates of competency
        developedthrough this process will be recognized inthe EU.

159.    The longer-term reform strategyneeds to includefurther measures to strengthenTurkey's
educational system. Improvingthe skills ofthe labor force and ensuring that they matchthe
needs of the private sector requires reforms of the education system at all levels. Sucha strategy
needs to aim at improving the quality of education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels to
ensure that students acquire strong foundations for continued learning and key problem solving
skills relevant to all stages of their careers. Increasingpre-school enrollments, improving
attendanceof girls, bringing school quality and teaching at all schools up to international
standards, raising participation insecondary schools, equipping vocational and general secondary
school graduates for a more competitive work environment, expanding and diversifying higher
educationwhile improvingthe quality and relevance of the educationto the demandsof the labor
marketare essential.

PROGRAM GOALS        AND EXPECTED      OUTCOMES
160,    The program supportedby the CEDPL contributes to achieving the outcomes desired
under the 2003 CAS andthe 2005 ProgressReport including(a) making the economy more
resilient to crises that disproportionately affect the most vulnerable; (b) making the business
environment amore attractive with a increasedemphasis inthe knowledge economy, (c)
contributing to sustainable economic growth that is critical to pull many of the poor out of
poverty; (d) promoting humandevelopmentto create opportunities for the poor, including more
and betterjobs.

161.    An effort was made inidentifying short-term outcomes that couldbemeasuredshortly
after program implementation and which would be reasonableproxies for the longer-term
outcomes sought by the program. These indicators are presentedinAnnex 11.

                            VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
162.    Poverty. The CEDPL program i s expectedto contribute substantially to a long-term
reduction inpoverty inTurkey, as it is designedto contribute to virtuous cycle of growth,
employment generation, andproductivity. Turkey made little progressinreducing poverty over
the period 1994-2002,with overall poverty rates at about 27 percent, although extremepoverty is
very small at less than 1.4percent of the population as evidencedinthe Joint Poverty Assessment
Report (JPAR, FY06). Strong economic growth over the period 2002-2006 reducedoverall
poverty rates down to 20.5 percent as of 2005. The Bank is inthe process of analyzing the
recently available householdincome and expenditure survey data for 2006.

163.     A very low rate of extreme poverty inTurkeyreflects the importance of the social safety-
net, where neighborsandextendedfamily memberswill generally helpthose who may needit



                                                    42

andwhere reciprocity is expected andgranted-as        the case may be. However, withmigrationto
urban areas and reduced family sizes resulting from declining fertility rates, the traditional
informal social safety-net could be weakening. The formal social safety-net i s becoming
increasingly important to help families and individuals insocial risk management and the
prevention o f poverty. Unfortunately, the share o f the population covered by the formal social
security system has declined over time, asjob creationinthe informal sector i s large and
participationrates continue to stagger-partly     due to the highcosts o f compliance with formal
social security requirements inthe formal sector, rigidities inthe labor market, and broad
mismatch o fthe skills required by formal enterprises and those producedby the education
system. Over 50 percent o f the working population i s not coveredunder the social security
system, a proportion which i s bigger among the lower age cohorts.

164.    Reforms supported under the CEDPL and parallel PPDPL series aim at contributing to
address these issues. The CEDPL i s expected to contribute to virtuous cycle o f growth brought
by more investmentwithin a better climate for the private sector; more competitioninproduct
and service marketsaided by largeprivatizationwhich increase efficiency and reduce prices;
more flexibility o f labor markets where protection will be grantedto workers as opposed to jobs,
financial market reform which would increase the access o f the enterprise sector to funding-
enabling companies to expand; improving the attractiveness o f labor as a factor o fproduction by
bringingcloser together the average skillmix demanded by enterprises andthat produced by the
education system. While recognizing that such a program will take years to implement, the
authorities expect higher labor marketparticipation, lower unemployment, and proportionally
more formal sector employment. Inother words, the authorities expect more and better jobs in
Turkey-a key element for reducingpoverty and replacing the traditional safety net which is
weakening by the unavoidable (and desired) modernization o f the Turkisheconomy.

165.    At the same time the authorities are strengthening the social security system under the
PPDPL series also supported by the Bank. The PPDPL aims at ensuring the long-term fiscal
sustainability o fthe social security system, reducing the costs its compliance, extending its
coverage and guaranteeing that social assistance receives adequate financing and is targeted more
effectively.

166.    Gender. The reforms supported by the CEDPL will have a disproportionately positive
impact for women. Women's labor market participation rates are extremely low at about 24
percent of the working age female population. Among women who participate inlabor markets,
unemployment rates are also significantly higherthan those o f men. The same applies to the
incidence o f informality as a larger share o f female workers work ininformal activities thanmale
workers.

167.    Stakeholder analysis. With the exception of laid off employees o fthe SOEs privatized
in2005 and 2006, the policies supported bythe Loando not affect identifiable stakeholders
negatively. Infact, all other policies inthe matrix entail benefits for easily identifiable groups in
the country. Adoption o fthe mortgage law will benefitpotential and existinghome owners by
increasing access to housing, reducing financial costs, and makingresidential real estate a more
liquid asset. The banking community also benefits from the introduction o fthis law because it



                                                  43

allows for improved risk management. Virtually all policy actions inthe program will have
similar positive outcomes for stakeholders with the exception o fthe privatizationprogram.

168.    Consequently, the authorities focused on mitigating the short term negative impact o f
SOE privatization, The authorities ensured the provision ofneededassistanceto displaced
workers includingtemporary income support and labor redeployment services with the objectives
o f preventing them from falling into poverty while assisting them inrejoining the labor force.
The government and the Bank agreed under the Privatization Social Support Projects (PSSP I
and 11) on procedures to ensure that eligible displaced workers receivedjob loss compensation
and labor redeployment services.

 169.   Inaddition, the authorities undertook efforts-also   supported by the PSSP Iand 11-to
identify sectors and communities negatively affected by the privatization program, as well as
individual workers and families who may experience special problems causedby SOE
privatization. The PSSP and PSSP I1financed a series o f focused assessmentsinorder to
identify these particularly negative outcomes.

170.    As a result, the primarybeneficiaries ofthe mitigating measuresundertaken by the
authorities have been workers displaced from privatized SOEs and their families as well as
workers who were displaced collaterally infirms associated with SOEs and where downsizing
occurred.

171.    Participation. The government has beenparticularlyproactive inestablishing the
legitimacy of its broad reform program through wide participatory processes-as    the basis for
long term sustainability o f these reforms. More specifically to CEDPL, most o fthe reforms
supported under this Loan were envisaged inthe Government's NDP which was made public and
which was consulted widely. Inaddition, the passage o fthe laws supportedby the Loan entailed
significant consultation by the government and the Parliament with civil society groups and key
social partners-including    extensive hearingsat the level o f Parliamentary Committees.

172.    Intense stakeholder participation regardingthe privatization program took place inthe
context o f preparingthe PSSP loans. Representatives o f government, labor unions, and
employers were directly involved inproject design and implementation. Formal meetings were
held national unionleaders, multiple levels o f local government, local union representatives, and
representatives o f the Social Solidarity Fundwhich provides assistance to poor families. During
privatization, workers threatened and displaced were informed o fthe availability o f income
support and labor redeployment benefits and services through local and national publicity as well
as through in-plantbriefings prior to the sale o f SOEs and layoffs.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, EVALUATION
                                     AND

173,    All actions underthe Loanhave been completed. The Undersecretariat ofTreasury was
responsible for coordinating implementation o f the program among all concerned ministries and
agencies.

174.    As the CEDPL is a stand-alone operation insupport of completed policy actions withina
medium-term reform program, the attribution o f overall development results to specific reforms


                                                  44

supported by the loan i s intrinsically problematic. The outcomes o f the policies supported by
CEDPL will take time to be realized, There will be a lag betweenpolicy implementation and the
ability to monitor outcome-as     for example i s the case o f better IPRprotection and the number
o f patents grantedto Turkish researchers. The challenge for the design o f a results framework for
the CEDPL i s compounded because o f the links between the reforms supported by the CEDPL
and other elements o f the government's program, and because o fthe small size o f the loan
compared with Turkey's total external financing and public expenditures.

175.     Accordingly, the Treasury and the Bank agreed to monitor progress towards meetingthe
long term goals o f the program inthe context o f the ImplementationCompletion Report for this
Loan and under the FY08-FY11CPS for Turkey where an effort i s being made to develop
together with the authorities a results framework linkingthe Bank's contribution to the overall
results the government expects to achieve during the period-including       the issues o f
competitiveness and employment which are expected to be key components o f the CPS.

FIDUCIARY    ASPECTS
176.     Modernizationof Turkey's system o fpublic financial accountability inline with
international standards has been a priority. As detailed inthe August 2001 Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA), some o fthe basic buildingblocks are inplace: an
established legal framework; reliable, albeit fragmented, accounting processes; regular reporting
of financial results; an apparently independent Supreme Audit Institution (SAI), the TCA, which
reports to Parliament; a relatively open system o f accountability and plenty o f skilled personnel.
However, there are problems regarding systemic coherence. Complex institutional relationships,
multiple sources o f public funds, heavy emphasis on ex ante controls and inadequate reporting to
the legislature reduce transparency and weaken financial management. Similar to the budget, the
audit system i s fragmented with many bodies besides the TCA carrying out activities analogous
to external inspectionand audit

177.     Accounting. Efforts to upgrade the public accounting system are steadily gaining
momentum after years o f limitedprogress. The suy2000i automated accounting system is
operational invirtually all o fthe approximately 1,500 sites o fthe MOF's General Directorate o f
Public Accounting (GDPA) across Turkey. Under this internet based system, the MOF's central
accounting data base contains data on all individual transactions wherever they occur inthe
system. The initiative to introduce modified accrual accounting incompliance with GFS
requirementsis makingprogress. Turkey has consciously switched from cash-basedto an
accrual basis o f accounting. Since the annual budgets are cash-based, the GDPA inthe MOF has
devisedan intricatemethod for accounting entries that keeps track o f both the cash-basedand
accrual entries. Cash-based budget outturns are therefore easily distinguishedfrom accrual-based
expenditures. The PFMC has replaced the public accounting law (No. 1050) and provided MOF
with permanent authority to issue budget coding and accounting standards for all general
government agencies. The MOF has issued a new framework for the accrual-based chart o f
accounts. It i s harmonizedwith the economic classificationo f the newly adopted GFS budget
classificationsystem. A new chart o f accounts enabled the MOF to compile financial statements




                                                   45

consistent with the 2001-GFS budgetclassifi~ation.~Article 49 o f the PFMC law mandates that
accounting be harmonized with the international standards and standards be issuedby a Public
Accounting Standards Board (PASB), which is to be established as the general government's
sole standard-setting authority. The PASB will be under the MOF comprised o f representatives
from the TCA, SPO, MOF, Treasury, and other agencies.

 178.     Procurement. Turkey has moveddecisively to upgrade its public procurement
legislation and practices inline with international standards. The new public procurement law
was enacted inJanuary 2002. The new law i s based on the United Nations Commission on
InternationalTrade (UNCITRAL) model and moves Turkey inthe direction o f compliance with
EUstandards. The independent PPA establishedby law to oversee public procurement and
ensure enforcement o f the new procurement standards i s fully operational. The Government i s
working on new procurement legislation for SOEs inthe public utilities sectors consistent with
the relevant EUdirective.

 179.     Auditing. Effective financial accountability requires extensive modernizationo f
Turkey's public audit system. The objectives are two fold: (a) clarify institutional
responsibilities, promote improvements inaudit quality inline with international standards and
support the shift from ex-ante controls to ex-post monitoring inharmony with the efforts to
improve operational performance; and (b) expand the scope o f TCA audits to cover the entire
general government includinglocal administrations, autonomous agencies, social security
institutions, remaining extra-budgetary funds and revolving funds, with the overall objective o f
transforming the TCA into an effective state audit institution. These objectives have been
facilitated by enactment of the PFMC law and will further be supported through enactment o f a
new TCA law. With regard to audit quality, the law clarifies the roles and responsibilities ofthe
line agencies, the M O F andthe TCA.

180.      The PFMC law established a framework for decentralizinginternal audit to the line
agencies inline with EUrequirements. It discontinued the TCA's to discontinue involvement in
budgetexecution and focused on ex-post audits, including performance audits. With regard to
the transformation o f TCA, the new law will: (a) includeall general government agencies under
TCA's annual audit; (b) subject TCA's own accounts to external audit with reports submitted to
the Parliament; and(c) expand the scope ofTCA audits to cover the entire general government''.
As with any major institutional reform, the transformationof TCA into a modernstate audit
institution mustbe carefully designedto build consensuswith the public administration. The
TCA i s committedto undertake internal reforms to align its institutional structure with
international standards for state audit institutions, to upgrade its audit capabilities, and to reach
consensus with the other government audit bodies on implementationo f the reform. A draft
action plan for the TCA's internal reform has beenprepared and will be improved, including
through a peer review by auditors from other European state audit institutions. The action plani s
expected to be adopted by the Government and TCA after the enactment o f the TCA law.


  The GDPA will only be compilingthe financial statementsfor the generalgovernment.The Departmentof
Statistics is responsiblefor compilingGFS-compliantfinancial statistics.
I'The TCA audit mandatedoes not cover the auditof the Parliament. The Parliamentwill be auditedby an
independentaudit committee.

DISBURSEMENT       AND AUDITING
181.     Disbursementand ImplementationArrangements. The proposed loanwill follow the
Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy loans. The untiedBOP support will be
disbursedagainst satisfactory implementation of the program and not tiedto any specific
purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval of the loan and
notificationby the Bank o f Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal
application. The IBRDwill deposit the proceeds o f the loan with the CBRT, which will form
part o f the official FX reserves at the request o f the Undersecretariat o f Treasury. The
government will utilize the proceeds of the loan inforeign currency for either foreign debt
servicing or for crediting the local currency equivalent into the treasury single account for
financing budgetedexpenses. Prior to that, the borrower will pay the applicable front-end fee
(net of any waivers) from its own resources. If,after deposit inthis CBRT account, the proceeds
of the loan are used for ineligible purposes (for example, to finance items imported from
nonmember countries or goods or services on the IBRDstandardnegative list), the IBRDwill
require the borrower to either: (a) returnthat amount to the account for use for eligible purposes;
or (b) refund the amount directly to the IBRD, inwhich case the IBRDwill cancel an equivalent
un-disbursed amount o fthe loan.

182.     Accounts, Auditingand ClosingDate. The administration ofthis loanwill bethe
responsibility o f the Under-secretariat o f Treasury. The government will maintain accounts and
records, or ensure that such items are maintained, showing that loan disbursements were in
accordance with provision o fthe Loan Agreement. Such accounts and records will be
maintained ina form acceptable to the Bank. The IMFhad conducted a safeguards assessment
of the CBRT inApril 2002 and determined that, while number o f measures was taken to
strengthen the CBRT, such as the conduct of a quality external audit and the preparationo f
financial statements according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), there
remained a number o f vulnerabilities that needed to be addressed. The assessment recommended
reorganizationo f the internal audit function, expansion o f the role o f the audit committee,
publication o f IFRS financial statements, and reconciliation o f program monetary data with the
audited financial statements, including an audit of the treasury component. Since then CBRT has
taken a number measures including reconciliationo f monetary data with audited financial
statements and its audit by the independent auditor, publication o f annual audited financial
statements and the independent auditors report, reorganizationo f internal audit function,
including the adoption o f a new charter and the appointment o f the head ofthe internal audit
department. The audit reports by independent auditors on the financial statements o f the CBRT
for the year 2005,2004,2003 and 2002 provided a clean audit opinion. Past audits and generally
positive assessmentby the IMF indicate that there are no strong reasonsfor asking additional
safeguards such as audit o f deposit account. As a result o fthe above, no audit will be necessary
under this loan. The closing date o f the loan will be September 30, 2008.

ENVIRONMENTAL         ASPECTS
183.     With the exception ofthe privatization o f SOEs, the reforms supported by the Loan are
not expected to have an environmental impact. Accordingly, the Bank conducted a detailed
reviewofthe procedures followed bythe PA to address pollution bythe SOEs privatized in2005
and 2006 (see Annex VII). The reviewconcluded that these environmental procedures deserve

Bank support-although     it also established that they are subject to further improvement along
recommendations shared with the authorities.

184.    The review considered two types o f environmental pollution, namely (a) accumulated or
legacy pollution including waste disposal sites, hazardous waste piles, oil or chemical spills, and
water and soil pollution causedover time by waste and wastewater discharges and emissions to
the momentofprivatization; and (b) current or flow pollutionwhich refers to air, water and soil
pollution caused by an enterprise during its operations. With respect to these two the types o f
pollution, the review sought to answer three fundamental questions, as follows. (a) Were
environmental liabilities adequately assessedandthe information shared with potential investors?
(b) Were adequateplans madeto mitigate risksassociated with accumulated pollution? And (c)
were plans developedfor ensuring compliance including enforcement with regard to current
pollution?

185.    The review's approach is consistent with the Bank's understanding o f international good
practices to address environmental liabilities duringprivatization processes. Reputable investors
are generally sensitive to environmental issues and consider environmental costs and risks as key
elements indeciding whether to acquire an SOE under privatization. Investor risks could be
classified intwo broad categories, namely (a) uncertainty about regulatory standards for ongoing
operations and costs to meet the standards and (b) the potential liability for legacy pollution
possiblyinclean-up expenses and third-partycompensation as well as damagesto the investors'
reputation.

186.    Inthe Bank's experience, these riskscouldbe successfully mitigatedwhen(a) reliable
environmental audits o f the extent and nature o f current andpast environmental damage are
made available to potential investors; (b) environmentalrequirements for ongoing operations are
clearly stipulated; (c) the legal system clearly allocates liability for past damages, sometimes
through the privatization law; and (d) responsibility for remedyinglegacy pollution i s well
established inthe privatization agreement or similar documentation. Successful handling o f
environmental issues duringand after the privatization process also benefits from close
cooperation between government agencies in charge o f privatization and o f environmental
protection.

 187.   Accordingly, the review looked into the legal framework for pivatization, environmental
policy, application by line ministers and local governments of environmental law and regulations
and regulatory functions to understand the legal framework. Transposition o fEUEnvironmental
legislationhas gainedmomentum after the EC recommended opening accession talks with
Turkey. Progress intransposing the EUlegislation has been most prominent inthe waste
management. There has beenmaterial progress inadopting water pollution related directives and
the Environmental InvestigationAgency (EIA) Directive. The Integrated Pollution Prevention
and Control (IPPC) Directive and air pollution related directives are yet to be transposed. Gaps
remaining inthe environmental legislation relate to remediationo f accumulated pollution. EU
support to Turkey has also focused on improving institutional capacity for issuance o fpermits,
inspection and enforcement which will be key to implementingthe transposed legislation.




                                                   48

188.    The review analyzed indetail the processes of privatization of a sample of 22 out of the
58 companiesprivatized in2005 and 2006. This sample comprises (a) 98 percent of the monetary
value of the 58 privatizations inthe period, (b) all five environmentally high risk SOEs
privatized, and (c) three out of six mediumrisk SOEs. Annex VI1contains details includingthe
criteria usedto rate SOEs as high, mediumor low risk according to the environmental risk they
may pose, The review was basedon interviews with project managers at the PA, senior staff at
the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MEF)Directorate Generalfor Environmental
Management, andareview of the environmentally relevant documentation inthe privatization
process.

189.     The Bank review concluded that the systems for reducing potential environmental
adverse effects are broadly satisfactory. Environmental audits were carried out inthree of five
high-risk SOEs and the findings were shared with potential investors. Furthermore, there are
signs that privatized enterprises will achievebetter compliance with regardto ongoing pollution.
The review provided recommendationsto improve proceduresto reachinternational good
practice levels, including making audits a standardpart of procedures for high andmediumrisk
enterprises, better assessing and clarifying liabilitiesfor accumulatedpollution, incorporating
remediation plans inthe sales and purchaseagreementand improved cooperation with the MEF.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION
190.     Risksof Financialcrises. While risksremain, there has beensignificant improvement in
many vulnerability indicators since the 2001 crisis including for example that (a) the cost of
borrowing has beendeclining, (b) the composition of public debt has improved, (c) debt
managementpractices progressedconsiderably, and (d) debt-to-GNP ratios have declined
steadily and are expectedto decline further. Nevertheless, the still comparatively high debt stock
and relatively short maturitiesmeanthat the economy remainsvulnerable.

191.     The May-June 2006 turmoil ininternational financial marketsand its reflection in
domestic markets showedthat Turkey's resilience to shocks has improved considerably. Turkey
recoveredrelatively quickly from this turmoil but it also highlighted that Turkey is still
vulnerable to external and internal shocks as it was amongthe hardesthit countries during the
turmoil.

192.     OnApril 27, 2007, domestic political events caused another episode of volatility in
financial markets. Once again, the economy demonstratedresilience to shocks. By May 8,2007
international investors confirmed their appetite for Turkish assets by oversubscribing an IPO of
Halk Bank shares bymore than 10times andpayingthe top maximum price inthe IPOrange.
Domestic investors also oversubscribedthe IPO by almost three times. Since April 27,2007 the
major rating agencies reaffirmed their ratings and outlook for Turkish assets with the exception
of Fitchwhich changedthe outlook to "stable" from "positive." Finally, the IMFcompleted
successfullythe Sixth Review under its SBA with Turkey on May 18,2007.

193.     While the economy has demonstratedresilience, the shares of foreign currency debt and
floating rate debt as well as the averagematurity of fixed rate debt entail risks from potentially
sharpexchange andinterest ratefluctuations. The large CAD adds to financing needs. Despite
the improved structure ofcapital flows with longer term debt and FDI, short term private capital


                                                  49

flows and portfolio investments (excluding Treasury bond sales abroad) underscore the risks o f a
reversal inmarket sentiment.

194.    Mitigating these risks requires maintaining the confidence o f domestic and foreign
financial market participants. Sustained strong economic performance ina difficult international
environment will requirereinforcing confidence inmacroeconomic policies andbolstering
political commitment to structural reforms. Satisfactory progress with structural reform, EU
accession related reforms, and the economic program supported by IMF is likely to allow the
economy to better absorb external risks such as, for example, a tighteningo f global liquidity. As
the government's program has gained credibility, the link to these anchors are likely to become
less important and financial market participants will focus on the program itself.

195.    A much improvedmacroeconomic framework is inplace andmajor structural reforms
have been accomplished since after the crises in2000 and 2001. The floating exchange rate
regime introduced in2001 has increasedthe economy's ability to absorb shocks. Systemic risks
inthe banking sector havebeenaddressed,the state banks have beenre-capitalizedandare now
profitable, and the open FX position o f the bankingsector has moved close to balance. CBRT
independence and the regulatory bodies for banking, energy, telecommunications and public
procurement are helpingto improve economic management closer to international and EU
norms. Fiscal adjustment has shiftedthe overall balance from deficit to surplus and the legal
framework for better fiscal management i s being gradually put inplace.

196.    Finally, inflation reversedits trend in2006 increasing to about 10 percent-significantly
higherthanthe official target o f5 percent. The target for annual CPIinflation is likely to be
missedalso in2007. Market expectations-close to 8 percent for year-end inflation-are
considerably higher than the official target o f 4 percent. According to the CBRT, unprocessed
food and oil prices are major risks for the inflation trend incoming months. However, inflation
i s expected to ease inthe second half o f 2007 due to base effects and decreasing demand side
pressures.

197.    Externalfactors. Although the resilience o f the economy has greatly improved, a key
challenge will be coping with potentially volatile capital flows. Turkey remains vulnerable to a
sudden reversal incapital flows since, compared to other emerging economies, it has high
external debt with short maturity. Limitingthe negative by-products o f capital flows i s difficult
but a numberofpartially effective measuresare appropriate: (a) sterilized intervention
(appropriate incases of` an increase inmarket volatility); (b) tightening o f financial system
regulation, supervision and intervention-which      has improved but where challenges still remain;
and (c) defining fiscal targets to ensure that fiscal policy is not pro-cyclical. Overall, maintaining
credible policies, deeper and more robust financial markets, and a more stable and diversified
economy will help inthe long-run to address the challenges o f large and volatile capital flows.

198.    Over the medium term the policy actions supported by the CEDPL will assist in
preservingexternal debt sustainability which requires a reduction inthe CAD. The narrowing o f
the deficit would ideally stem from an increase inthe savings rate, which remains lower than in
other fast-growing emerging economies. Better mobilization o f domestic savings, increasing
competitiveness inthe tradable sectors, privatization, better labor skills and business climate and


                                                   50

 attractinghigher FDIwill helpreduce the C A D without decreasing investment. The FDI-friendly
policies and broad structural reforms supporting competitiveness supported by the Loan are
 important inachieving inmediumterm external sustainability.

 199.      BankingSector. Since 2002, there has been a major shift inbanking assets from
 government securities to private sector credit. The source of bank profits has shifted from
 trading andtreasury revenueto profits from net interest revenue inthe loan and deposit business.
 The tighter fiscal policy, as well as confidence inthe ongoing reform process, has madethe
 speculative trading business less attractive inboth currency and interest rate positioning.

 200.      The shift toward domestic credit would seem to have two positive benefits. The banking
 system has become less susceptible to marketrisks that accompany international debt crises-
 mainlyrapidly risingreal interest rates and falling exchange rates-and                        financial deepening
 improves the prospect for development. However, the change inbank portfolios has increased
 the relative importance of credit risk. The expansion ofthe credit portfolio leaves the banking
 system potentially vulnerable to a substantial increase indomestic interest rates because
 borrowers that are solvent at current interest rate levels may be unable to meet interest and
principal payments at substantially higher rates.

201,     Banks are using currency swaps to hedge any currency mismatchon their balance sheets
(Figure 20a) which means better management o f the associated risks. At the same time, these
hedges allow banksto create fixed interest rate local currency liabilities and thereby better
manage the interest rate risk from the growing mortgages inlocal currency". Non-performing
loans (NPL) have declined and loan provisions have grown leaving banks with very small net
NPL ratios (Figure 20b). This at a time when the loan portfolio grew rapidly from US$38
billion inMay 2003 (or 2.1 times equity) to US$158 billion inFebruary 2007 (3.5 times
equity)-which       would normally be associated with increasing credit risk. Since NPLs are lagged



  Mortgage loans are currently only in local currency and carry fixed interestrates. The recently passed mortgage
law will relax the legal obligation to lend only at fixed interestrates. This will helpbanksbetter managethe interest
rate and repaymentrisk associatedwith mortgage lending. The law also allows for securitization of mortgageloans,
which can relieve banks of not only interest rate riskbut also repaymentrisk and credit risk.


                                                              5 1

indicators, these figures confirm that the system coped well with the rapid growth o f credit in
recent past.

202.     The market turmoil inMay and June 2006 dampened credit growth and ledto larger
margins ultimately leaving the bankingsector more profitable. As the exchange rate depreciated
by as much as 25 percent and interest rates increasedby more than 5 percentage points duringthe
turmoil inMay and June o f 2006, there was some pressure on the money markets. Interest rates
inthe moneymarket at times exceededthe central bank's overnight bidratereflectingthat some
banks were short on overnight funds. Fixed interest securities andmortgage loans ledto net
income losses as their funding costs increased while the income on those assets remained
constant. The event led banksto expand credit more cautiously. Interestrates on new loans
increased more thanthe fundingcost as reflectedinhigher interest spreads between loans and
deposits. As shown inFigure20b, loan growth slowed. This helped return on equity to increase
to 20 percent (as o fNovember 2006) compared to just 12percent in2005.

203,     The regulatory and supervisory framework has been strengthened-although       some gaps
remain. The new banking law passed in2005 i s beingimplemented, general provisioning o f 1
percent o f loans has beenintroduced, and a capital adequacy ratio o f 12percent i s now required
for banksto open new branches. Weaknesses remain and include proper assessment o f large
exposures, inadequate consolidated supervision and assessment o frelated exposures, market and
liquidity risks, consolidated supervision, and capacity to assess banks' risk management
techniques and models. The entry o f foreign banks into the Turkishbankingsector over the past
few years has contributedimportantly to a more stable sector. Most private banks inTurkey have
gotten a foreign partner or have been acquired by foreign banks since the beginningo f 2005.
Foreignowned banks are more likely to sustain accessto international capital markets, and the
biggerinternationalbanks are more likely to be able to support the Turkishsubsidiaries incases
o f distress.

204.     Despite increased resilience, the bankingsector remains exposed to a reversal o f capital
flows. Nonetheless, several factors mitigate the probability o fa crisis. Turkey has experienced
the failure ofmajor individual banks without experiencing a systemic run. The inter-bank market
i s very small implying individual bank problems are unlikelyto be transmitted to the system as a
whole. For example, inMay and June 2006 Turkey, along with other major emerging markets
experienced turmoil inits FX market, with the lira declining some 25 percent at one point. The
Turkishfinancial system performedwell under stress because, among other things, the policies
instituted by the CBRT since the 2001 crisis and thoughtful management o f debt maturity
structure by the Treasury have provided financial marketparticipants with the incentives to make
prudentdecisions and giventhem the tools to execute these decisions.

205.     Politicaleconomy, legaland implementationrisks. Policy makers are aware ofthe
importance o fthe EUconvergence process and the IMFprogram. However, the broadprogram
faces legal, political and implementation risksthat can undermine the achievement o f its goals
without necessarily triggering a financial crisis. For instance, following the approval by the
Parliament o f the Social Security and UHILaw on May 31,2006, the President and an opposition
party challenged successfully the Law infront ofthe Constitutional Court. The government has




                                                  52

     reaffirmed its commitment to the reform and is working to address the concerns raised by the
     Court and make the necessary amendments.

     206.     With Turkey's parliamentary and presidentialelections in2007 comes a risk ofpopulist
     discourse, as i s the case before elections invirtually all countries. Undercertain outcomes, it i s
     possible that the priorities of future reform efforts may change and/or reforms may slow down.
     However, the government has targeted a headline 6.7 percent primary surplus in2007 and
     remains committed to the economic program as evidenced by the completion o f the sixth review
     of the IMF SBA.

Mr.PaulWolfowitz
President
The World Bank
Washington DC 20433
U.S.A.

Dear Mr.Wolfowitz,


1.      The commitment of our government to sound economic policies has produced an
impressive recovery after the 2001 crisis and people's lives have improved significantly.
During the past five years, economic growth reached 7.5 percent on average and inflation fell
from 70 percent in 2001 to single digits, for the first time in more than inthree decades. Net
public debt declined from over 90 percent of GNP in 2001 to about 45 percent in 2006.
Improved macroeconomic stability led to reduced spreads ininternational capital markets and
higher levels of FDI, especially inthe pasttwo years.

2.      This impressive economic performance is due first and foremost to our credible and
sustained stabilization program, with strong fiscal discipline at its core, combined with an
ongoing structural reform agenda. The Stand- By arrangement with the IMF, World Bank
support of the structural reform programs, andthe launching of the EUaccessionnegotiations
in2005, constitutedthe external anchors ofthe successfulprogram.

3.      We have implementedmajor reforms over the past five years. Inthe financial sector,
the Central Bank's independence was established and has beenmaintained, the banking sector
was restructured,and the banking supervision was strengthenedthrough the adoption of a new
banking law and implementing regulations. In the public sector, the public procurement
system was overhauled, and a new public finance management and control law was adopted
with a major impact on the transparency of public finances.         In the agricultural sector,
subsidies were drastically cut and replaced with direct income support.          Privatization,
especially in 2005 and 2006, picked up considerably. Privatization sales in these two years
(amounting to US$ 17.7 billion) yielded funds which were almost twice as high as those
collected inthe previous 18 years. An equally impressive performance took place interms of

                                                                                        Annex I
                                                                                      Page 2 of 9

attracting FDI; in 2006, FDI inflows amounted to US$ 20.1 billion. This i s an unprecedented
sum inTurkey's history where annual FDIflows often amountedto no more than amereUS$
1billion a year. Most recently, Turkey embarked on one of the most ambitious reforms of the
social security system in the world. This reform may, however, have to be adjusted due to a
recent rulingby the Constitutional Court.

4.      Having established macroeconomic stability and increased confidence that are critical
to sustaining high growth rates, we are in a better position to unlock Turkey's potential for
growth and facilitate faster convergence to EU. Our aim is to secure sustained high growth
while generating employment for Turkey's young population and ensuring social inclusion.
To consolidate the current macroeconomic stability by increasing competitiveness and
strengthening employment generation capacity of the economy, we are dedicated to
maintaining our strong macroeconomic policies, continuing and further expanding and
deepening our reform efforts in the areas of (a) investment climate, (b) labor markets, (c)
credit and capital markets,and (d) innovation, technology, quality standards and labor skills.

5.      In this context, we request World Bank support for our program by approving the
Competitiveness and Employment Development Policy Loan (CEDPL) and the disbursement
of the US$ 500 million equivalent. We are confident that the reforms detailed in this Letter
meritfull support from the World Bank andthe international community.

1.      Enabling Macroeconomic Framework

6.      Over the last few years, the Turkish economy has been among the fastest growing
economies in the world. Inflation has fallen to single digits for the first time in more than
three decades, and macroeconomic vulnerabilities have been significantly reduced. Elements
inthis performance include a tight fiscal and monetary policy, a flexible exchange rate, and
structural reforms including inthe financial sector.

7.      The economy grew by 6 percent in 2006, down from an average of 7.8 percent in the
period 2002-2005, as high interest rates and slowing credit growth dampened domestic
demand. We expect growth at 5 percent in 2007, supported by stable economic conditions,
gradually falling inflation, and a stronger contribution from the external sector. We are
committed to reducing inflation to the 4 percent target to provide a foundation for high and
stable growth. Commodity price and exchange rate shocks contributed to a significant
overshooting of inflation last year. As those effects fade and the impact of last year's
monetary policy tightening takes hold, we expect inflation to converge gradually toward the
target during 2007, with a noticeable fall in annual inflation rates starting in the second
quarter. The current account deficit reachedalmost 8 percent of GNP last year-higher    thanin
2005 but well below the level anticipated under the program. We expect the deficit to fall to
7% percent of GNP in 2007. The outlook for external financing remains favorable and the
continued high foreign direct investment, driven by strong private sector merger and
acquisition activity, is expectedto cover half of the current account gap.

8.      Disciplined fiscal policy has been the cornerstone of our program, allowing declining
debt ratios, facilitating disinflation, and reducing real interest rates. We remain comitted to
prudentbudgetary policies inthe period ahead. Inparticular, achieving a highprimary surplus

                                                                                          Annex I
                                                                                       Page3 of 9

target through tight spending control will help with disinflation and further ease the debt
burden, thereby creating the fiscal space necessary to implement future reforms. The fiscal
discipline facilitated an overall public sector balance within the Maastricht criteria in 2005
and we estimate the balance for the public sector to have been slightly positive in2006.

11.      InvestmentClimate

9.      Our government fully recognizes the importance o f a good investment climate for
sustaining high growth and facilitating income convergence with the EU countries. The
investment climate can encourage or discourage firms to invest productively, generate jobs,
and increase output, which have impacts on growth and welfare. We view structural reforms
to improve the investment climate a necessary condition for higher private investment, faster
growth,'and for attracting foreign direct investment.

10.     To this end, we are aiming at improving the investment climate through (a)
simplifying administrative barriers for firms' entry, operation and exit; (b) reducing and
simplifying the Personal and Corporate Income Taxes (PIT and CIT) and improving
effectiveness o f the tax administration; (c) monitoring and adjusting state aid as necessary, (d)
implementing a large program of privatization of state-owned enterprises; (e) increasing
foreign direct investmentinTurkey, and (f) improving corporate governance.

Firm entry, exit, and licensing

11.     Streamlined entry and exit procedures encourage entrepreneurs to open new firms and
favor a process where the least productive firms exit which increases average productivity
levels. Simplified licensing procedures, on the other hand, create incentives for entrepreneurs
to conduct business with all the permits required by law and operate inthe formal sector.

12.     We have designed short and medium term policy actions to bring about marked
improvements in entry, exit and licensing. Our policy measures include (a) pilot testing o f
electronic execution o f company registrations with the idea o f expanding electronic access to
all companies wishing to register inthe future, (b) unifying licensing procedures for the entire
country, and; (c) streamlining licenses.

Taxpolicies and tax collection

13.     Avoidance of VAT, corporate income tax, and other taxes was often found to be a key
element in the decision to remain in the informal sector by entrepreneurs. It i s also known
that firms operating inthe informal sector have lower productivity and employment than firms
operating inthe formal sector, pointing to the importance o f undertakingtax reforms aimed at
reducing tax rates and at facilitating tax payments to increase the tax base. CIT rates inTurkey
were comparatively high and complex, while past CIT investment allowances distorted
relative prices o f capital and labor. High and complex PIT also contributed to incentives for
self-employedentrepreneurs to remain inthe informal part of the economy.

                                                                                          Annex I
                                                                                       Page 4 of 9

 14.    The government's program has improved tax policy and tax administration as key
components o f the business environment. To this end, we have, among other: (a) reduced the
maximum corporate income tax from about 30 to 20 percent o f taxable profits and eliminated
capital investment CIT allowances; (b) reduced and simplified PIT as well as unified the
taxation o f wage and non-wage income, reduced the number o f brackets and harmonized the
treatment o f income from financial instruments; and (c) successfully restructured the tax
administration including (i)reform o f the local tax offices; (ii)establishment o f a revenue
administration responsible for tax collection and with direct authority over provincial and
local collection offices; and (iii)  reforms to the Large Tax Payer Unit aimed at improving
collection efficiency while reducing compliance costs for the firms targeted has been
completed.

State aid

 15.     We committed to reform the state aid regime in 1996, when the final phase o f the
Customs Union became effective. We are determined to comply with these commitments.
These reforms include making Turkish State Aid legislation compatible with the EUAcquis.
Accordingly, we are developing a state aid legislation in conformity with EU directives in
order to increase competition, level the playing field, and reduce distortions.

Privatization

 16.    Historically, state owned enterprises (SOEs) which grew innumbers dramatically over
the years have played a critical role inour economy. However, by and large SOEs performed
poorly on financial terms and the problems o f overstaffing, dependence on subsidies and
unilateral budget transfers became a significant burdenon the economy - giving rise to budget
deficits, inflation, uncompetitive markets, and highdomestic input costs.

17.     Therefore, in order to minimize state involvement in economic activities, relieve the
financial burden on the national budget, increase efficiency and competition as well as
develop domestic capital markets, our government reinitiated the privatization o f SOEs and
major state assets in2004.

18.     In2005 and 2006, we privatized 58 SOEs and major state-owned assets, which yielded
US$ 17.7 billion in sales. This accomplishment has no precedent in terms o f the number,
revenue collected by the Treasury and importance o f privatized SOEs.            Several factors
contributed to this positive result includingenhanced macroeconomic stability, a revised legal
and regulatory framework, and appropriate allocation o f financing for labor restructuring and
severance payments for displaced workers. During the process, we have followed the best
practices in terms o f procedures and environmental considerations were properly integrated
into the process. The sales process has been openand transparent.

19.     We expect increased efficiency and better product market competition in the medium           e
term as a result o f the privatization process, which has also contributed to positioning Turkey
as an attractive and investment-friendly location. The signaling impact of the privatization
process has been powerful. Additional benefits include developing domestic capital markets
and generating needed revenue for the Treasury at a time when reducingexcessive public debt
                                                     .

                                                                                           Annex I
                                                                                        Page 5 of 9

was imperative. Privatization has also been accompanied with enterprise reforms and labor
restructuring for the remaining SOEs. As a result, the performance o f the remaining SOEs has
improved. Dividends grew and budgetarytransfers from the Treasury declined.

Foreign Direct I nvestment (FDI)

20.     Turkey received very little FDI until very recently. Many factors, including legal and
bureaucratic barriers contributed to this result. To overcome these problems and increase FDI
inflows, we enacted a new FDI law which among other things streamlined investment
procedures, enhanced rights o f foreign investors in a way that domestic and foreign investors
are treated equally and eliminated minimum capital requirements. As a result o f our efforts
and improvements inmacroeconomic environment, FDIinflows surged to more than US$9.8
billion (2.7 percent o f GNP) in2005 and to about US$20.1 billion in2006 about twenty times
the average annual amount of inflows observed prior to 2003. FDIinthe first quarter of 2007
reached US$ 9.2 billion.

 21.     The service sector including banking and telecommunications have attracted the
 largest share o f foreign investment, closely followed by non-regulated services, such as trade
and hotels. While welcoming the recent increases in FDI, we also recognize that Turkey still
receives lower FDIrelative to the size o f the economy than other countries. Furtheractions to
improve our broad investment climate will have a positive impact on the amount and
composition o f FDI. Accordingly, we established an Investment Support and Promotion
Agency (ISPA) to make Turkey a more attractive FDIdestination. Our progress on this ground
includes (a) incorporation o f the agency, (b) issuance o f secondary legislation, (c) recruitment
of some staff, and (d) clear definition o f goals and businessmodel.

111.    Labor Market Reform

22.     We are fully aware that improving labor market conditions and enhancing the
employment generation capacity o f the economy are critical for providing more and better
jobs to people. In the past years, the employment performance has stayed moderate despite
high growth rates. The labor market participation ratio is low, especially among women,
unemployment rates are still high, particularly among the young; and incidence o f informality
inlabor markets is also high.

23.     The employment rate is low compared to EU average. The reason behind this low
participation i s that population growth has outpaced employment growth for many years in
Turkey. Unemployment rates are especially high for educated young people. Both demand
and supply factors are likely to matter in this outcome in that the economy may not be
generating jobs that can absorb educated young, but also the educated young may not be well-
suited to thejob market.

24.     We have already developed a comprehensive program outside the labor market in
order to increase competitiveness and enhance employment generation capacity in the
economy. For instance, a sustainable macroeconomic framework, improvements to the
investment climate, and investment in physical and human capital are all building blocks for

                                                                                          Annex I
                                                                                        Page 6 of 9

growth to generate more jobs. Rising labor productivity through competitiveness and
improving labor skills will provide a basis for betterjobs inthe formal sector.

25.      However, we also recognize that without a well functioning flexible labor market, the
policy measurestaken outside the labor marketcan not have their full impact on creating more
and better jobs. Therefore, we are also designing a comprehensive labor market reform
program which targets a more flexible labor market regulation. We will complement these
efforts with more effective social protection through retraining and active and passive labor
market programs. Bothelements are critical for creating more and betterjobs as our economy
continues to open up to the global economy. We have integrated these general principles into
the designo f our labor marketreforms.

IV.      Credit and CapitalMarkets

26.      We will improve firms'         access to finance in order to upgrade Turkey's
competitiveness. We have achieved significant improvements in financial intermediation
through better economic policies and enhanced regulation and supervision o f the banking
sector. These improvements have allowed banks to gain better access to international capital
markets thus lowering their cost o f financing, and thereby fostered a strategic shift infocus to
credit generation to the private sector. The banking sector is lendinglarger amounts to more
private sector firms.

27.      As a result, credit has grown from 12.3 percent of GDP in2002 to 30 percent in2006.
However, consumer lending has been an important driver o f the recent credit growth, because
it is a fairly straightforward business segment to scale up.Lendingto firms has grown at a less
impressive pace in part because of the inadequate institutional underpinnings for the credit
market.

28.      Continued improvement in both the volume o f credit to firms and the efficient
allocation o f those credits depends on the institutional underpinnings of credit markets. The
financial sector reforms pursued in the post-crisis period focused on fostering economic and
financial stability and ensuring the soundness of financial institutions. This has greatly
improved the funding conditions of financial institutions. Solidifying these achievements will
require a continued enhancing o f supervision and sound economic policies as well as a new
focus on building better institutional underpinnings for credit generation so that the banking
sector reaches its potential in servingbusinesses.

29.      A related issue is that state owned Ziraat Bank and Halk Bank, and state-controlled
Vakif Bank represent about 30 percent share of total bankingsystem assets. Inthe aftermath
o f the 2001 financial crisis, Ziraat Bank, Halk Bank and Emlak Bank were recapitalized and
operationally restructured. Today, Ziraat Bank, Halk Bank and Vakif Bank are all profitable
banks.

30.      We are aiming at (a) reducing state ownership inthe bankingsector through a recently
completed IPO for 25 percent o f the shares o f Halk Bank; (b) consolidating the soundness of
the financial sector through BRSA publishingand implementing the regulations required for
the effective implementation of the 2005 Banking Law; and (c) increasing access to housing,

                                                                                       Annex I
                                                                                     Page 7 of 9

boosting investmentinconstruction, helping banks manage their risks, and improving creditor
rightsthrough enacting a satisfactory law on residential real estatemortgages.

31.      An important related subject is the market for corporate capital.     This market is
underdeveloped but potentially very important. Weaknesses in the corporate governance
framework include (a) lack of reliable public information on corporate ownership and
financial statements, despite improved disclosure requirements; (b) insufficiently independent
and accountable boards o f directors, and unsupportive legal environment for shareholder suits;
and (c) some inconsistency with corporate governance international best practices.

32.     As a key immediate step to improve corporate governance, we drafted a new
Commercial Code and submitted it to the Parliament. Additionally, we have conducted an
assessment of the observance o f OECD Corporate Governance Principles for improving
shareholder rightsas a necessary condition for further capital market development.

V.      Innovation, Technology, Quality Standards, and Labor Skills

33.     We recognize the importance o f improving technological capacity. Accordingly, we
have focused on improvements in harnessing knowledge factors for productivity and
employment, including (a) innovation and technology adoption, (b) quality and standards, and
(c) labor force skills, which will improve production efficiency, value-added o f exports and
attractiveness of formal sector labor as a factor o f production.

Innovation and TechnologyAdoption

34.     Innovation and adoption o f new technologies will have positive and significant effect
on firm productivity. Although, investment in R&D - a key source o f innovation, has
improved, private sector R&D is still low. Turkey has almost doubled its gross expenditures
on R&D (GERD) placing Turkey in the middle o f the GERD ranking compared to OECD
countries. Nonetheless, we aim at increasing R&D further to improve our productivity and
competitiveness.

35.     The number o f patents filed by Turkish inventors nationally and internationally i s also
low and despite recent progress to improve protection o f Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)
and facilitate patent applications, more effort is needed to ensure full compliance of IPR
legislation with Acquis requirements and for the creation o f a comprehensive legal and
institutional IPR framework.

36.     Recognizing the importance of innovation and technology adoption, we have taken
steps to improve protection o f IPRs and facilitate patent applications. We have revised IPR
legislation to improve alignment with EUrequirementsand established an IPR Specialization
Committee to ensure full consistency with EU regulation. We have also initiated a
consultation process to modify the laws on trademarks, patents, geographical indications and
industrialdesigns. Also, we have enacted a law on adoption o fthe Agreement on Amendment
to the European Patent Convention.

                                                                                          Annex I
                                                                                       Page 8 of 9

Quality Standards

37.     We have a functioning National Quality System (NQS) in place, comprising the
Turkish Standard Institute (TSE), the TurkishAccreditation Agency (TURKAK), the National
Metrology Institute (UME) and a number o f testing and calibration laboratories, as well as
certification and inspection entities inboth the private and public sectors. However, the use of
quality standards among Turkish firms is uneven and the alignment o f quality standards
legislation with Acquis requirements needs to be further improved. Demand for quality
certification among Turkish firms i s improving, but Turkey still lags behind other OECD
countries.    Accreditation activities remain limited and until very recently, TURKAK's
accreditations were not internationally recognized due to technical             differences with
international norms. These shortcomings limit exports, the potential for creation o f supply
chains between foreign and local firms, competitiveness, growth and ultimately the generation
of highqualityjobs inmodern sectors o fthe economy.

38.     We have improved quality standards. These measures include (a) the acceptance of
TURKAK as a signatory member of EA-MLA in the areas o f calibration, testing, quality
system certification and inspection and a signatory o f the International Laboratory
Accreditation Cooperation -Mutual Agreement (ILAC-MRA) in the areas o f testing and
calibration, and (b) drafting o f a revised TURKAK law consistent with EUAcquis and EA-
MLA.

Laborforce skills

39.     We want a workforce with advanced labor skills to ensure that firms can adopt new
technologies and quality standards and to attract more FDI. However, education and skill
levels in Turkey still lag international standards and present concerns about job creation and
competitiveness.    We have made remarkable progress in education but still challenges in
improving educational outcomes and employment opportunities for our young people.

40.     Although, there have been significant increases in school enrolment rates, about ten
percent o f school-age children are not enrolled inprimary school. In2005,40 percent o f 20 to
24 year olds had a secondary degree and well below the Lisbon target o f 85 percent. Low
levels o f education translate into a workforce with education and skill deficiencies.

41.     To improve educational outcomes as well as employment opportunities for young
people, we will implement the Ninth Development Plan, which contains key actions to
improve education. We also give special emphasis to lifelong education to ensure our people
have the skills needed for a changing and developing economy.            To this end, we have
implemented several actions, including curricula reform and a new Vocational Qualification
Authority. Improving the skills of the labor force and ensuring that they match the needs o f
the private sector requires reforms in the education system at all levels. Our reform strategy
aims to improve the quality o f education at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels to ensure
that students acquire strong foundations for continued learningand key problem solving skills
relevant to all stages o f their careers.

                                                                                         Annex I
                                                                                      Page 9 of 9

42.    We are committed to maintaining the macroeconomic stability and fiscal discipline.
We also believe that the policies and actions described inthe letter are adequate to achieve the
objectives o f the competitiveness and employment generation program. We have met all
actions agreed with the Bank for disbursing the CEDPL. We also stand ready to take
additional measures, if necessary, to ensure the continuation and success of the reform
program supported by the CEDPL.

                         ANNEXIII:WORLD BANK-IMFRELATIONS

The World Bank and IMF teams have worked in close collaboration in Turkey, and standard
working arrangements broadly follow the guidelines for enhanced Bank-Fund collaboration.
The IMF has taken the lead inmacroeconomic stabilization and the World Bank in social and
structural areas, with close collaboration in structural areas that have a particular impact on
macroeconomic stability.

Background

After the collapse of the 2000 exchange rate-based disinflation program and the floating of
lira in February 2001,the banking system experienced heavy losses, inflation soared and the
economy contracted by nearly 10 percent. Public debt climbed to over 90 percent o f GNP in
2001,partly owing to the costs o f bankrestructuring. After the crisis, the Turkishgovernment
introduced a three-year economic program backed by a SBA with the IMF and series o f
programmatic loans from the Bank and since then, strong fiscal consolidation and disinflation
efforts have laid the basis for a rapid and powerful recovery.

Turkey concluded the last Fund-supported program covering the period of 2002-2004
successfully and the impressive outcome has laid solid foundations for the new program.
These reforms have delivered a decisive break with Turkey's history o f high and variable
inflation, and low and volatile growth.

Leaving the favorable developments aside, the Turkish economy faces a number o f risks as
well. The strong economic recovery, the appreciation o f YTL and rising oil prices have also
led to widening C A D which continue to remain a source o f concern. The high size o f the
government debt, its short maturity, and its currency composition i s also a major source o f
vulnerability. For the medium term, the authorities' main challenge i s to implement policies
that achieve the goals o f sustained growth and low inflation.       With the start o f the EU
accession negotiations, the alignment with the EU Acquis and rapid income convergence to
the EU averages now constitute further challenges.

The new SBAfor Turkey

The Executive Board o f the IMF approved a three-year, SDR6.66 billion (about US$ 10
billion) SBA in May 2005 to support Turkey's economic and financial program through May
2008. An amount equivalent to SDR 555.17 million (about US$ 837.5 million) made
available immediately. The Board also approved a one-year extension o f Turkey's repurchase
expectations totaling SDR 2.52 billion (about US$ 3.80 billion) arising in2006.

The overriding goals o f the new program are to create conditions for sustained growth that
will raise living standards and reduce unemployment; facilitate convergence towards the EU
economies; and bring about an orderly exit from Fund support. To achieve this, the program
aims to:

                                                                                       Annex I11
                                                                                       Page 2 of 5

              Deal effectively with short-term macroeconomic challenges and, in particular,
              reduce the C A D to more sustainable levels.

               Secure permanently lower inflation, by retaining the floating exchange rate,
              preservingcentral bank independence under formal inflation targeting.

               Further improve the government debt position more sustainable through
               continued sizable primary surpluses, shiftingtowards longer debt maturities, and
               underpinning the fiscal adjustment with structural fiscal reforms.

               Improve Turkey's net FX reserve position and strengthen its resilience to
               unexpected external developments.

               Maintain financial sector stability by further improving the supervisory and
               regulatory framework, accelerating asset recovery and privatization o f state
               banks.

               Implement a structural reform agenda that enhances Turkey's growth prospects,
               lowers unemployment, and improves the investment climate.

The program's macroeconomic framework i s centered on achieving highand sustained growth
of around 5 percent each year. Inflation was targeted at single digits for 2006, declining to the
low single digits by the end o f the program.

Growth has moderated in line with program assumptions, inflation i s in single digits, and the
public debt burden is being reduced steadily.           The authorities' adherence to prudent
macroeconomic policies has played a key role in supporting these developments. The main
challenge to the economic outlook i s the large CAD, which has been driven by increasing oil
prices and strengthening o f YTL.           The authorities' response to the current account
developments-strong        budgets, tight monetary policy with explicit inflation tar'geting, and
accelerated reserve accumulation-has       been appropriate. The CBRT's cautious approach to
interest rate cuts i s appropriate given a more challenging inflation outlook in2007.

Areas in which the WorldBank leads

The Bank has taken the lead in structural areas where both institutions have conditionality
including bankruptcy reform, corporate sector restructuring, social security reform, regulatory
and market reforms in telecommunications and energy, agriculture reform, and privatization.
The Bank is also inthe lead in areas such as health, education, infrastructure, governance and
environmentalmanagement.

Areas in which the Fund leads

The Fund takes the lead in macroeconomic stabilization including macro-fiscal policy,
monetary policy, exchange rate policy and financial stability and risk management.

                                                                                       Annex 111
                                                                                      Page 3 of 5

Areas of shared responsibility

The work on public sector management and governance has focused on strengtheningPEM
system while maintaining fiscal discipline. The Fund has taken the lead in the short-term
measures needed for the fiscal adjustment such as incomes policy, urgent revenue and
expenditure measures, and budget monitoring and reporting. The Bank has taken the lead in
assisting government on the medium-term PEM strategy, rationalization o f the PIP, public
procurement reform, accounting reform, and public liability management. Public employment
policy, medium-termtax strategy, anti-corruption strategy and civil service reform are further
areas o f Bank involvement.

The challenge facing Turkey inthe financial sector has been to address the bankingcrisis and
putting in place an appropriate legal and regulatory framework that would minimize the risk
o f future crises. The Bank has taken the lead inreform o f the legal framework and regulations
for bank supervision, the institutional development o f the BRSA and SDIF, and the structural
reforms required to guide the restructuring and improve the governance o f the state banks, as
well as work onNBFI. The Fundhas taken the lead inassessingthe soundness o fthe banking
system and where there was an immediate fiscal impact such as the re-capitalization o f the
state banks, the closing o f insolvent banks, and the private bank recapitalization scheme. On
the state banks agendaandresolutionofprivate banksthe FundandBankhaveworked closely
as a team. The Bank intends to continue its support for financial sector reform in Turkey
including the development o f the NBFI for which a major study has recently beenconcluded.

US$ 1.1BillionDisbursement
                                Press Release No. 07/103, M a y 18,2007

The ExecutiveBoardofthe International Monetary Fund(IMF) today completedthe sixth
review under the three-year SDR 6.66 billion (about US$10 billion) SBA for Turkey, which
was approved on May 11,2005 (see Press ReleaseNo. 05/104). The completion o f the sixth
review will enable Turkey to draw immediately an amount equivalent to SDR 749.5 million
(about US$1.1 billion).
The Boardalso approved Turkey's request for waivers o f nonobservance o fthe end-April
2007 quantitative performance criteria inthe fiscal area (primary balances o f the consolidated
government sector including and excluding state economic enterprises, overall balance of the
social security institutions, and consolidated primary spending o fthe central government and
social security institutions) and o fthe end-February 2007 structural performance criterion on
parliamentary approval o f personal income tax reform.
At the conclusion ofthe ExecutiveBoard's discussion, John Lipsky, FirstDeputy Managing
Director and Acting Chairman, stated:
"Turkey's macroeconomic performance has remained strong. Economic activity has been
resilient to increased financial market volatility and elevated interest rates. At the same time,
growth has become broader based, with reduced reliance on domestic demand. FDIhas
surged, allowing a further build-upo f reserves, and the net public debt ratio has continuedto
fall rapidly.
"However, inflation remains well above target, the C A D i s high, and elections are
approaching. Against this background, Turkey must continue anchoring investor sentiment.
"Inlight ofthis, perseveringwith disciplined macroeconomic policies will be essential to
preserve market confidence. Inthis regard, the authorities' commitment to a 6.7 percent o f
GNP primary surplus target for 2007 i s welcome. Substantial discipline will be requiredto
keepspendinginline with the programmedpath. At the same time, maintaining atight

"Inthe comingperiod, Turkey shouldpress aheadwith structural reform. Onthe fiscal side,
efforts to implement the revised social security reform, bolster efficiency inthe health and
energy sectors, and strengthen tax collections will be key to safeguard the medium-term fiscal
position and make room for tax cuts on labor and financial transactions. Inthe financial
sector, close supervisory oversight and further buildingo f cushions inbalance sheets will help
safeguard against risks inherent inrapid credit growth. Advancing privatization, especially in
the banking and energy sectors, will further improve the investment climate. Inthis regard, the
successful public offering of Halk Bank shares i s a welcome initial step.

   ANNEXV: GOVERNMENTPOLICY/OVERALLGOVERNMENTDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM

1.      Turkey's medium-term economic policy andreform program is articulated inthe gth
Development Plan (2007-2013) which was published inthe Official Gazette on July 1,2006.
Turkey also produces annual EUPre-Accession Economic Programs which detail short and
medium term policy actions and structural reform priorities related to EUaccession. The
2006 Pre-Accession Programwhich covers the period 2007-2009 was submittedto the EU
Commission inDecember 2006. Inaddition, the country i s implementingan economic
program supported by an IMF SBA which will be inplace until2008 and includes a
government Letter o f Intent. These policy documents are consistent among themselves.
Moreover, Turkey has movedto mediumterm budgeting since 2006 and the second medium
term budget covering the periodo f 2007-2009 was approved by Parliament inDecember
2006.

2.       Turkey's development agenda i s centered on four major themes: (a) sound
macroeconomics and governance; (b) equitable humanand social development; (c) attractive
business climate and knowledge; and (d) strong environmental management and disaster
mitigation. Turkey sees the EUaccession process as an important reform anchor and
opportdnity for harmonization with international norms and standards.

3.       Sound MacroeconomicsandGovernance: The government recognizes that
consolidatingthe current macroeconomic stability and strengthening public sector governance
requires action on: (a) continued effective implementation o f structural fiscal policies to
ensure permanent fiscal adjustment; (b) carrying out the recently adopted medium-term
program to improve the transparency and efficiency o f PEM; (c) furtheringbroad-based
institutional reforms to improve the quality o f public sector governance; (d) embarking on a
judicial reform program based on a comprehensive judicial sector assessment; and (e)
improving the mechanisms for service delivery including through a process o f
decentralization.

4.       EquitableHumanand Social Development:Raisingthe educational qualifications
of the population i s a crucial requirementfor improvedlabor productivity and employment
growth inTurkey. It i s also critical for making the country more competitive inthe global
economy and to meet the goal of EUaccession. The following activities emerge as priorities:
(a) continuing the reform o f the education sector by strengtheningthe curriculum o f secondary
and tertiary education with the objective of linkingthe curricula to labor market requirements
and expanding and upgradingthe skills base o f the country; (b) advancing the reform o fthe
health sector to makeit more equitable and efficient; (c) continuing the reform o fthe social
security system as a natural complement to the broader public sector reform program; (d)
monitoring and assessingpoverty and vulnerability for effective poverty reduction; (e)
promoting the social inclusion o f disadvantaged groups such as women, youth and the elderly;
and (0removing the constraints currently affecting the Turkish labor market (formal and
informal sector).

5.       AttractiveBusiness Climateand Knowledge: A degree of short-term stability has
been achieved inthe banking sector, and the emphasis i s now on consolidation and
sustainability o f the remaining reforms. Key focus areas include institutional strengthening

                                                                                          Annex V
                                                                                        Page2 of 7
and independence o f the BRSA and the SDIF, privatization ofthe state banks, reform of the
deposit insurance regime, and sales o f nonperforming assets held by the SDIF. On a more
strategic level, however, diversifying the financial system beyond banking, along with a
balanced set of incentives for complementary development o f bankingand non-bank financial
institutions (NBFI) and markets will be essential for sustained financial stability andgrowth.
The critical medium-termpriorities for promoting private sector development include: (a)
completing the process o f reforming the bankingand financial sector; (b) addressing
constraints to SME growth; (c) accelerating privatization and removing barriers to FDI; (d)
improvingthe governance o fthe transport sector to reduce its fiscal burdenand improve its
competitiveness; (e) continuing the restructuring andprivatization o f public utilities coupled
with sector reform; (0following upon the agricultural sector reform implementedunder the
previous CAS; and (g) implementingthe reform process inherent inthe EUAcquis
Communautaire.

6.       Strong Environmental Management and Disaster Prevention: Because Turkey i s
highly vulnerable to natural disasters, especially earthquakes and floods, highpriority needsto
be givento mitigating the impact o f future earthquakes and strengthening the especially the
Marmararegion's emergency management capabilities, including planning,public education,
and conductingregion-wide emergency exercises. More broadly, Turkey needsa coherent
approach to environment protection, otherwise and like other developing countries, it faces
the risk of allowing its economic growthto result inunacceptable depletion ofwater, forestry,
bio-diversity and air quality with adverse effects on poverty reduction. Complying with the
EUenvironmentaldirectives is a major parallel challenge for Turkey, andrequires significant
increases in environmental investments over a long period o f time.

7.      The government has further articulated its vision inthe gthDevelopment Plan covering
2007-2013 andhave identifiedthe following strategic objectives as development axes towards
realizing the vision o f the Plan:

          0   Increasing competitiveness,
          0   Increasing employment,
          0   Strengthening human development and social solidarity,
          0   Ensuringregional development,
          0   Increasing quality and efficiency inpublic services.
8.      Sectoral and thematic policies and priorities have been taken up under these axes and
the gthDevelopment Planwas designed as the basic strategy document that would contribute
to the EUaccession process.

                            ANNEXVI: INVESTMENT          CLIMATEPILLAR


Introduction

9.     The investment climate is the host o f institutional factors, policies andregulations that
influence private sector development. The first component o f the reform program supported by
the loan focuses on addressing issues with Turkey's investment climate, including: (a) the
complexity o f administrative barriers to firms' entry, operation and exit; (b) the size and
complexity of the PIT and CIT and the effectiveness of the tax administration; (c) competition in
the private sector, as related to state aid and SOEs, and; (d) the level o fFDIinTurkey.

10.     A sound investmentclimate increases firms' productivity and employment. Qualitative
and quantitative evidence indicates that improving the investment climate -particularly the
factors listed above  - has apositive effect on productivity and, inthe longer term, on
employment. Links between each investment climate variable, productivity and employment are
summarized below.

    0  Administrative barriers toJirms ' entry, operation and exit. Entrepreneurs needto register
        when starting a business. In order to become fully operational and continue to operate,
        firms also need to obtain licenses and deal with inspectors for health, safety and
        environmental standards. To exit the market, firms needto de-register and may have to go
        through insolvency procedures. International evidence and the results o f econometric
        analysis based on a survey o f Turkish firms indicate that administrative barriers have a
        negative effect on firms' productivity and employment.12Streamlined entry procedures
        encourage entrepreneurs to open new firms, which in turn increases productivity and
        employment and helpsto reduce informality. Time managers spend on bureaucratic issues
        (e.g., to obtain licenses and permits after a firm has been created) significantly decrease
       productivity. Because barriers to exit artificially keep the least productive firms in the
       market, facilitating exit raises averageproductivity.I3Efficient insolvency procedures also
       help efficiently allocate resources by ensuring that creditors can recover some or all o f
       their claims ina reasonable time.
        Tax rates and tax administration. Hightax rates and inefficient tax administration are the
       main reasons that firms remain informal or declare only portions o f their sales and labor
       costs for tax purposes. Firms that do not fully declare their sales (and labor costs) for tax
       purposes are significantly less productive (have fewer employees) than firms that declare
       their full sales (and labor COS~S).'~Reducing tax rates and improving tax administration
       will increase formalization, improve productivity, raise employment and enhance the
       quality o f thejobs created.
       State aid and SOEs. High levels o f state aid and concentration of SOEs decrease market
       competition and productivity while increasing prices. Although privatization and

        reduction o f state aid may have a negative short-term effect on employment, the
        efficiency and productivity gains lead to improved competitiveness and creation of new
        jobs in the longer term. In addition to the productivity gains and reduced fiscal burden,
        privatization and reduction o f state aid could contribute to increasing FDI. Foreign
         investors often take a direct strategic interest in privatized entities, to which they may
         contribute advanced technology and fresh capital. In addition investors, domestic and
         foreign alike, may be reluctant to enter a sector in which they have to compete with
         SOEs, which may be perceived as having preferential state treatment.
         FDI. Foreign ownership is positively associated with higher productivity, mostly through
         firms' better use o f technology and quality standards, greater innovation, more advanced
         labor skills, and fiscal transparency1'. Increasing FDIattraction increases employment and
         the quality o f jobs created. It i s also essential to reduce Turkey's account deficit and
         maintain macroeconomic stability.

12.      Althoughprocedures and times to register a business have beenreduced, registration
costs are still high.Turkey has streamlined the business registrationprocess since 2003. As a
result, it takes only 9 days to open a business inIstanbul, one o f the shortest times inthe world.
However, the registrationcosts (27.7 percent o f income per capita, US$ 1,255)16 are significantly
above those of comparator countries, far behindthe regional average (13.5 percent o f income per
capita) and the OECD average (6.8 percent o f income per capita) (Table 1).

 13.     Notarizationfees and fees for registration with the Chambers are highandthe calculation
 process usedto set most registration fees is not transparent.

 0   The cost ofpublication of the registration inthe Gazette (US$ 15) is reasonable. However,
     fees paid to the notary public are high(e.g., US$250 for notarizing the articles o f a limited
     liability company inIstanbul),The fees for registrationwith the Chambers (between US$500
     and US$ 761 depending onthe source) are also high(Table 2).

 0   Guidelinesdeterminingthe rangeo f fees appliedbythe notary, the Chamber or the
     municipality are unclear. The relationship between the fees charged and the actual cost to
     administer the company registry ineach o fthe Provincial Chambers i s also opaque. This
     makesit impossible to know whether the fees paidby firms reflect only administrative costs
     or also finance other activities o f the Chambers. A reasonable registration fee would cover
     only the actual costs o f runningthe registry, not cross-subsidizing other tasks.

 14.      Despite recent reforms to streamline licensing, obtaining a license to start and operate a
 business inTurkey i s still time consuming and expensive. Firmsneed licenses to become fully
 operational and remain inbusinessafter registering. Inefficient licensingremains a major
 bottleneck for doing business inTurkey. Many businessesneed several, often redundant, licenses
 before starting operation. First, every business must obtain a business license from the
 municipality. Applicants are divided into sanitary and non-sanitary businesses.Non-sanitary
 businessesare those with an impact on health or the environment; all other businesses are
 sanitary. Sanitary businessesmust obtain a report from the fire department and clearance from
 the tax authorities to apply for abusiness license. Non-sanitary business must also obtain
 clearance from the MEF.A sector operating license i s also often needed. Procedures,
 requirements and fees depend on the type o f business. On average, it takes 66 days to get a
 license inTurkey, much longer than incomparator countries (Figure 1). A business has to pay
 two fees to obtain a general business license: the fire report fee and the actual license fee. Both
 fees depend on the size o f the premise. For example, a 200m2office/store has to pay a total fee o f
 US$ 319 (Table 3). This i s expensive compared to other countries. For example, EUMember

                                                                                                  Annex VI
                                                                                               Page 4 of 13

States like the U.K., Germanyor France require municipal business licenses only for selected
activities and charge less than US$50 for them. The Czech Republic charges a business license
fee o f US$36. Inall o f these countries, clearance from the fire department is part o f the license
and does not requirepayment of an additional fee.

15.      Too manyinstitutions are involved inthe licensingprocess, excessive documents are
required and inspections are not efficiently usedto simplify licensing.


    0    The "clearinghouse" function o f the municipality makes the licensingprocess
         cumbersome. Ifthe special authorities themselves can issue and monitor all o f the
         requested approvals and permits, then the additional stop at the municipality would only
         be necessary to ensure compliance with the core responsibilities o f local governments:
         fire safety and urbanplanning. The specific approving authorities could fulfill all other
         functions.
         Certain documents that are currently requiredbear no obvious relationship to assessing
         the business interms o f urbanplanning, health, safety, or environmental protection.
         Documentsthat could be reconsidered include: clearance for municipality tax, deed or
         lease for business site, andproof o f membership inchamber.
         Because licenses are issued indefinitely, it i s important that each municipality have a
         well-functioning inspection service to ensure that businesses do not violate laws and
         regulations on health, safety, and environmental protection. Adopting risk-based
         inspectionplans at the municipal level would result infewer and better focused
         inspections and ina more streamlined licensing system.

16.      The Government has made efforts to improve firms' entry and operation by reducing the
time o f registration and by implementing initial reforms to streamline licensing. InJune 2003, a
moderninvestment law replaced the obsolete Law for Encouragement of ForeignCapital,
facilitating opening a foreign firm inTurkey." At the same time, Turkey adopted legislationto

"LawNo.6225 of1953.

   establishnew registrationproceduresfor local businesses.18The reform abolishedmany of the 17
    steps that hadpreviously beenrequired to register a business, and combined others. The 2005
   Regulation on Opening a Business Place and Work license^'^ has also simplifiedthe licensing
   regime by considerablyreducing the documentsrequiredfor licensing sanitary businesses (from
    52 to 6) and non-sanitary business(from 43 to 7). Also, atime limit of 30 days with a consent-
   by-silence rule was introduced. The MEFreportsthat the procedureto obtain its approval has
   beenreducedfrom 6 months to 32 days. Initialsteps have also been undertakento facilitate
    business on a regional level. The Law on Regional Development Agencies, which establishes
    one-stop unitsat the regional level, was adopted inJanuary 2006 to help firms deal with the
    authorities.

    17.     The short-term reform strategy to further facilitate firms' entry and operation supported
   under CEDPL includes measuresto facilitate company registration and simplifythe licensing
   regime. Policy actions under CEDPL include: (a) drafting a Commercial Code broadly
   compliant with the provisions ofthe EUAcquis Communautuire on commercial matters and
    submitting it to the Parliament for approval; (b) reviewing registration and licensing regulations
   to (i)unifying licensing procedures for the entire country, ensuring consistency amongregions;
   (ii) andstreamlinetheprocessforfirms;and(c)pilotingelectroniclinkageof

    Government agencies involved with company registrations inAnkara to improve efficiency of
   registration.

    18.     The longer-term reform strategy for facilitating firms' entry and operation includes
   reducing firms' registration costs and further streamlining licensing procedures. Futurepolicy
   actions could include: (a) enactingand implementing the new Commercial Code drafted under
   CEDPL; (b) implementing recommendations adoptedby the authorities as a result of activities

1  under CEDPL; (c) broadeningthe pilot electronic registration test to additional municipalities;
   (d) reducingregistration costs; and (e) installing trade registries andoffering amajority oftheir
   services to firms online.

   19.     Bankruptcy proceduresare cumbersomeand have low recovery rates inTurkey. Ifa
  businessbecomes insolvent, the company may needto go through a bankruptcy procedure. To
  complete a proceduretakes an average of 5.9 years inTurkey, versus 3.9 years inthe region and
   1.4years inthe OECD (Table 4). Furthermore, the recovery rate (how many cents on the dollar
  claimants recover from an insolvent firm) inTurkey is among the lowest inthe world (7 percent
  of GNI). Recent insolvency reform has mainly focused on debt recovery.

21.      Insolvency reform inTurkey has so far mainly focused on debt recovery. Duringthe last
three years, three amendments were made to reform the Turkish Execution and Bankruptcy Act2'
The main reform took place in2003. The amendments were intendedto provide new and more
sophisticated instruments to ensure continuation o f an insolvent commercial enterprise by
improving its financial situation and avoiding bankruptcy procedures.2' Although necessary,
these changes are not designed to reduce delays ininsolvency cases or improverecovery rates.22

22.      The short-term reform strategyto improve the bankruptcy regime is to reviewthe
bankruptcy code. The longer-term strategy i s to approve the new code and ensure its successful
implementation. First, the bankruptcy code needs to be reviewedto identify the delays. It would
be prudentto examine the effect that each right of the parties to object and launchmotions has on
the length o fthe procedures. Documentingthe process to investigate, list and verify the debtor's
assets would also help identify bottlenecks. Outlining the liquidation procedure would allow an
examination of the causes for delays. The longer-term policy actions envision,reformingthe code
and ensuringits successful implementation.

22The recent changes to the EBA may have a counterproductiveeffect on the time and recovery rate. Practitioners
and banks fear that the recent changes may hrther slow the collection of receivables and give debtors time and
opportunity to diminish their assets. At the same time, the goal of avoiding bankruptcy ofthe debtor by givinghim or
her time to recoverhas not beenreached.

labor)23for low-income earners is 42 percent (Figure 2). When comparing an average income
earner with a non-working spouse andtwo children, Turkey has the highest labor taxation of any
OECD country (Figure 2). Turkey's strict labor regulations and high levels of taxation increase
unemployment, lower labor force participation and cultivate a large informal sector with low
productivity. The CIT and PIT rates inTurkey have also beenrelatively high and complex, while
CIT investmentallowances have distorted incentives to adopt capital intensive and labor saving
technologies. Becauseof extensivetax evasionand anarrow tax base, hightax rates have not
translated into hightax revenues (Figure 3).

convoluted organizational structure, with many ambiguous andoverlapping responsibilities,
precludes efficient execution o f core compliance management functions.

25.     Turkishfirms reportthat hightaxes are akeyreasonto remaininformal. Avoiding taxes
(including VAT, CIT and other taxes) i s the most important reason to remain informal (Figure
4).25Many Turkish firms do not officially register inorder to avoid taxes and regulations.
Moreover, many registered firms are only semi-formal, because they underreport their sales and
employment. As mentioned inthe Introduction, informal and semi-formal firms are less
productive than firms that register and fully declare their revenues and labor costs. Reducingtax
rates and facilitating tax payments to increase the tax base would help reduce informality and
increase productivity and employment.

26.     Informality i s widespread inTurkey, especially among small businesses andthe self-
employed. The informal sector is estimated to be about one-third o f the Turkisheconomy, based
on studies that examine variables such as currency demand. Only halfo f all employed persons
are registered with the social security system. Although the overall rate o f informal employment
stayed flat inrecent years, informal employment i s rising inthe non-agricultural sector.
Informality precludes economies o f scale, because informal firms must remain small to avoid
detection. Informal firms also have limited access to capital, suppliers and foreign investors,
becausebanks and reputable businesses are reluctant to do business with them. Because
informality i s higher among micro- and small- businesses, the self employed and unpaid family
workers, facilitating tax payment among these business segments i s particularly important.

27.     The Government has a strategy inplace for improving the tax system. A medium-term
strategy for improving the tax system inTurkey has been inplace since 2000, based on a review
carried out jointly with the World Bank. The strategy is to improve the stability, transparency and
equity o fthe tax system throughmeasures to minimize tax distortions, broaden the tax base and
improve the efficiency o ftax administration.

28.      The short term reform strategy supported by CEDPL includes specific actions to reform
CITYPIT and improve tax administration. Specific actions supported by CEDPL include:

     0   CIT: In 2005, the CIT rate was reduced from 33 percent to 30 percent with a
         competitiveness consideration, Inthe short term, the loan supports reduction o f CIT from
         30 to 20 percent and elimination o f capital investment CIT allowances.

     0   PIT: The PIT reforms were designed to be implemented in two stages. CEDPL supports
         completion o f both stages. The first stage envisioned reduction o f the top PIT rate from
         40 to 35 percent, accompanied by a reduction from 5 tax brackets to 4, and by a
         unification o f the tax regimes for wage and non-wage income. The second stage o f PIT
         reforms aim to broaden the tax base and simplify the related code. The new legislation
         would introduce a standardtax credit instead o f consumption credits, broaden real estate
         capital gains taxation, and give the Revenue Administration more authority for auditing.

     0   Tax administration: The Government's tax administration reform strategy encompasses
         institutional improvements, automation, transparency, compliance, taxpayer services and
         tax audit. The strategy aims at aligning Turkey progressively with OECD best practices.
         Key elements o f the strategy are reorganization o f the tax administration along functional
         lines and improvement o f the audit function as a main requirement for effective
         compliance management. The specific actions supported by CEDPL are: (a) reform o f the
         local tax offices; (b) establishment o f a revenue administration responsible for tax
        collection, with direct authority over provincial and local collection offices; and (c)
        reforms to the Large Tax Payer Unit to improve collection efficiency while reducing
        compliance costs for the firms targeted.

29.     The longer-term strategy includes
implementation of the actions started underthe          Figure 5: Employment in State Enterprises in the
                                                            Treasury Portfolio and in the PA Portfolio

include:

        further reduction and simplification of
        both CIT and PIT and reform o f both
        taxes basedon the results o f the analysis.

        enforcement        o f   social    security
        contributions to the MOF. As part o f the
        medium-term strategy, the Government
        adopted in May 2005 a law on the
        establishment o f the Revenue Administration (RA). This law restructured the General
        Directorate o f Revenues into the Presidency o f Revenue Administration, established as a
        semiautonomous entity under the MOF. RA i s structured functionally, with local tax
        offices directly under its control. The function o f collecting revenues performed by the
        fiscal offices inthe provinces was transferred directly to the RA.

34.      The SOE presence suggests different policies inthe manufacturing sector and in
infrastructure services such as telecom, transportation, and utilities. Manufacturing sector firms
are mostly subject to both domestic and foreign competition and are not important input
providersfor other businesses.Infrastructureservices, incontrast, are often critical to the
business environment. For instance, they provide transportation and energy services to the
majority o f domestic businesses.Inaddition, they may be prone to natural monopolization.
Privatization o f business services is therefore a more risky endeavor that must be pursuedwith
attentionto appropriate market structures and insome cases proper sector-specific regulation.

Increase FDI

35.      Despite a recent increase, FDIinto Turkey is limitedand concentrated on the acquisition
o f existing businesses inthe services sector. Yearly FDIinflows inTurkey surged to more than
US$9.8 billion (2.7 percent of GDP) in2005 and to about US$20.1 billion in2006, more than
twenty times the lackluster levels observed until2003 (Figure 10). Nonetheless, Turkey's
FDVGNP ratio i s still significantly lower than incomparator countries. Service sectors, such as
bankingandtelecommunications,29have attracted the largest share of foreign investment, closely
followed by non-regulated services, such as trade and hotels (Figure 11). Most o fthe investment
inflows have beenusedto acquire existingbusinesses, as opposed to 'green field' projects. While

36.         Turkey has already enacted measuresto significantly increase FDI. The 2003 FDILaw
established a liberal FDIregime in line with international best practice andhelped increase FDI
by streamlininginvestment procedures, enhancing rightso f foreign investors inorder to treat
them equally to their domestic counterparts and eliminating minimumcapital requirements.
Restrictions on foreign ownership inthe telecommunications and miningsectors were also
removed in2004. The General Directorate o f ForeignInvestment within the Undersecretariat o f
Treasury i s currently the main Turkish authority responsible for FDIpromotion. Before the 2003
reform, the Undersecretariat's main task was to approve and administer FDIinflow. Since FDI
approval was abolished in2003, the responsibilitieso f the Undersecretary have shifted to
coordinating the private sector development reform program to improve the country's investment
climate and increase FDIattraction. For this purpose, the Treasury created an ISPA.

 37.        The short-term reform strategy includes completion o f all steps neededto establish the
ISPA. Specific actions envisioned under CEDPL include: (a) incorporation o fthe ISPA, (b)
issuance o f secondary legislation, and (c) recruitment o f staff and an evaluation of the objectives,
plansandbusiness model o fthe ISPA.

38.         The longer-term reform strategy includes an evaluation ofISPA and introduction of
changes as needed. Specific actions would include an assessment o f the plans, activities and
outcomes of the ISPA and changes to its structure, organization and business model as needed.
As part of apublic body, the ISPA currently lacks funds of its own, has little experience with the
core functions o f investmentpromotion, and i s not exclusively dedicated to promoting FDI.
Internationalexperience indicates several requirements for an ISPA to operate effectively.
General reference criteria which will be used to evaluate the TurkishISPA include:30

   0   Staff with advanced skills and staffing policies, One o f the most important elements of a
       successful ISPA i s hiring skilled marketing professionals who understand how business
       people think. Given the private sector demand for these professionals, regular civil
       service salaries are not sufficiently competitive to attract such skilled people to
       government service.

   0   Private sector involvement in key decisions. Working closely with the private sector

       Mandate to provide the Government with continuous and reliable feedback about
       potential difficulties or shortcomings in the policy, legal and administrative framework
       related to FDI.


39.    The measures supported by the CEDPL will likely leadto a sustained increase o fFDI.
The policy actions supported bythe CEDPL, including broad actions to improve the investment
climate and specific actions to promote FDIattraction, will contribute to increase FDIlevels to
sustained higher levels.

              ANNEX VII: THEPROCESSESFORPRIVATIZATIONUSEDIN2005-2006


The Sales Processes

1,      Following the government's economic policy o f moving state enterprises to the private
sector where possible k dappropriate, the government rapidly increased the pace o f privatization
inthe years 2005 and2006. Fifty-eight state enterprises were privatizedwith sales receipts
totaling US$ 17.7 billion. The CEDPL loan has as one o f its prior actions as the following:

        Turkeyprivatized 58state owned companies and state-owned assets with total
       privatization sales amounting to US$17.7billion in theyears 2005 and 2006
        and under a broadly transparent process which was consistent with
        acceptablecompetitivepractice and environmentally responsible.
2.      To conclude whether this condition was met ina satisfactory way, expostfacto, the Bank
reviewedthe parameters o fthe above condition and analysed these privatizations inconsultation
with the PA. The purpose ofthe Bankreviewwas to establish that the 2005 and 2006
privatizations were carried out ina manner consistent with acceptable practices, openly,
transparently and competitively, and inan environmentally responsible manner.

The Data Set of the 2005-2006 Privatizations

3.      The PA provided statistics on completedprivatizations andthese include data for 2005
and 2006. They indicatethat there were 58 privatizations with sales receipts amounting to US$
17.7 billion inthese two years and this is the data set that the Bank used. The figures include
privatizations undertaken inthe two years where the tender had been completed and the winning
bidder chosen. Several o f the privatizations were not closed in2006 and their closings are
underwayin2007. However, it is

6.      As the participation and successof foreign buyers ina privatizationprogram is a measure
of success inpreservingopenness and transparency inthe process (foreign buyersare more
reluctant to participate innon-transparent privatizations), this is an important variable to
measure. To confirm that the sample is consistent with the data set interms o f domestic vs.
foreign components, the Bank analyzed these data. Table 2, below, shows that there i s little
difference betweenthe sample and the data set interms o f the foreign ownership component o f
the 2005 and2006 privatizations.

7.      Finally, the Bank tested the proposed sample against its data set to see ifthe industry
structure o f the data set was represented inthe sample. The results inTable 3 show that the
industrial structure o fthe data set is closely represented inthe proposed sample.

6. Following the analyses above, the Bank concluded that the results o f studying this sample
would closely represent the characteristics o f the data set. Accordingly, the sample o f the 20
largest transactions from the 2005-2006 privatizationprogram was analyzed indetail.


Best PracticesinPrivatization

8.      Usingthe proposed sampledescribedabove, the Bank analyzed and understood the
program o f privatizations carried out by the PA and the government by establishing (a) what was
sold, e.g., assets, shares, parts of shareholdings, (b) how these holdings were sold, e.g., block

                                                                                           Annex VI1
                                                                                          Page 3 of 15

sales, IPOs, asset sales; (c) what processeswere usedto undertake the sales, e.g., public tenders,
negotiated sales; (d) the transparency, competitiveness and efficiency o f such sales; (e) whether
best practices were used; and (f) the efficiency and fairness of the results.

9.      To clarify what particular standards were used, the Bank studied with particular interest
the following:

        0   The type o f sale: IPO, block sale, asset sale, and concession. It is important that such
            sales are undertaken usingopen, transparent, competitive processes;

        0   Whether reputed financial advisors were used. This is a best practice for larger,
            complex sales;


        0   How the sales were announced and the scope o f participation sought, e.g., public
            announcements, foreign and domestic buyers' participation;

        0   The openness o f the process, e.g., balanced and fair pre-qualification criteria,
            openness o f the sales process, transparency in price and in choosing the winning
            bidder;

        0   The fairness and economic efficiency o f any unusual terms and conditions to be
            assumed by buyers, e.g., golden shares, investment commitments; and

            Other observations that might indicate the openness, transparency, competitiveness or
            lack of best practice inthe privatization process o f the PA and the Government o f
            Turkey.

10.     Table 4 lays out the results o fthe analysis o ftype o f sale.

11.     By far the most common type of sale, by value, was the block sale. These are sales to
thirdparties were it is necessaryto offer a large block o f shares, usually over 50 percent, to give
control to the buyer. As will be seen below, all o f these sales have beenby open public tender
(public auction) where the final bidsare openedand improved inpublic, onpublic television, and
are quite appropriate, good practice, and transparent and competitive. Concessions are fairly new
to Turkishprivatization and are quite appropriate and good practice whenprivatizing assets that
the government considers public and wishesto keepinstate hands. Inthe caseo fconcessions,
the government privatizesthe operation andthe use ofthe assets for longperiods oftime, e.g., 20
years, by public tender @ublic auction). Assets sales are where the assets o f a company are sold
rather than the shares. These sales have certainadvantages and have been used appropriately in

                                                                                            Annex VI1
                                                                                           Page 4 of 15

hotel and real estate privatizations where sale has been by public tender (public auction). Lastly,
IPOs have beenused the least often, but appropriately, where the government has wanted to
provide widespreadpublic ownership o f a firm or wished to take the firm public before selling
control ina block share.

12.     Table 5, below, lays out the use of financial advisors inthe privatizations. As Turkey has
experienced and competent investment bankers, no attempt i s made to distinguishbetween
foreign or domestic investmentbanks. The use o f investmentbanks inlarge, important sales i s a
best practice.

                                  Table 5: The Use of Financial Advisors
                           Use of Advisor

 13.    Inmost privatizations, by value, the PA useda financial advisor (inall cases an
investment bank, which i s most appropriate) inits privatization. Where an advisor was not used,
andthe PA provided its own financial advice, the privatizations were real estate, including some
o f the hotel sales. Inthe case o f the concessions, other expert advice was hired, but not financial
advisors. The PA has considerable experience invaluation and the runningo f tenders and, inthe
case o f smaller privatizations, where there were commonly available market price data available,
Le., real estate and hotels. Outside financial advice was not requiredinthese cases. Inthe case o f
the concessions, the PA felt that outside financial advice was needed either.

 14.    The Bank acceptedthat the PA has appropriately usedexpert financial advisors inthe
majority o f its privatizations, by value, and accepts its explanation for the other cases. Overall,
the PA's performance on usingfinancial advisors rates highly which helpedleadto an open,
transparent and competitive privatization process.

 15.    Inthe case ofhowthe sales were announced andthe scope ofparticipationsought, e.g.,
public announcements, foreign and domestic buyers participation, the privatization sales were
adequately announced by the P A and the government and the law requires that there be no
discrimination between foreign and domestic buyers.

 16.     One o f the key parameters inbest practice privatization i s the process for runningthe
tender for sale. Tenders are normally required for an open, transparent, and competitive sale-as
the alternatives, negotiations or a fixed price with negotiatedextras, e.g., promisedcapital
investments, labor retention, may lead to poor results or corruption. As Table 6, below, shows,
the PA undertook all ofthe privatizations inthe sample by public tender (public auction). These
tenders inTurkey have beenopen andtransparent and frequently the final bids were opened on
public television programs. The PA deserves highmarksfor its tender process.

 17.     Inwell-runprivatizationprograms, itisnormalpractice to subject interested biddersina
tender to pre-qualification. This process requires the potential biddersto provideproofthat they
meet some basic qualifications to participate inthe tender and will exclude biddersthat are too
small or inexperienced inthe industryfrom which the firm to be privatizedcomes. Some

                                                                                               Annex VI1
                                                                                             Page 5 of 15

examples are that the bidder has extensive experience inor are members o fthe industry of the
firms being privatized and that the bidder i s a firm o f a certain size, with some minimumlevel of
sales. These are reasonable qualifications and the sort that the PA has used in its privatizations.
Table 6 shows that the PA used pre-qualifications inthe great majority o f its sales, by value.
Most o f the cases where such pre-qualifications were not usedwere real estate or hotel sales
where the basis criterion is ability to pay.

18.     Another common factor inprivatizations i s the requirement that the bidder meets certain
conditions, such as, investment targets or the conditions that the government puts on the buyer
through the use o f a golden share. The use of investment requirements has been relatively rare in
the cases we studied,there beingone major exceptionof ERDEMIR, a steel producer. This firm
fell under the Turkish government's planfor the development o f the steel industry inTurkey and
was required, as a condition o f sale, to undertake certain investments for the production of flat
rolled steel and to keep certain labor
levels.                                            Table 6: Public Tenders and Fair Pre-Qualifications
                                                  Public Tender and Pre-      INumber      Percentageof

                      ;see iaue I,            Pre-qualification for Tender           11 1             93.7

share i s common, 85.4 percent. The
sales where there were no golden shares were largely real estate and hotels and concessions
where no golden share was considered necessary. While golden shares, which give government
powersbeyondnormal shareholders over the operations o fthe company, are not normally best
practice, the use the golden share inthe privatizations inthe sample was reasonable. The golden
shares were usually limitedto giving government a super vote on such major issues as sale, the
changing o fthe articles o f incorporation or wind-up o f the privatized company. Such modest
powers are acceptable inbest practice and objections are only warranted incases where the

interfere inoperations o f the company,                       Table 7: Use of Golden Shares
                                                                       I  Number   I Percentage of Total
purchasing and other market activities.
Inthe case ofconcessions, the                 Golden Share

required government supervision, as i s       Concession                                               8.0

20.     With the exceptionthat the PA could consider usingreputed financial advisors in
assisting inthe valuations inthe sales o f large hotels or real estate properties, where such
advisors can bring special knowledge o f financial markets and the knowledge o f creative
financing for such purchases, which can add to the quality ofvaluations, no informationwas
found that had a negative effect on the process o f privatization inTurkey.

Conclusions

21.     The PA showed professionalismand goodpractices inits 58 privatizations undertaken in
the years 2005 and 2006, as determined inthe sample of 20 privatizationsthat were studiedin
detail and discussed with the PA (Table 8). It shouldalso be notedthat a large number of
privatizations, fifty-eight, were done inthis two year period. Many countries have not been able

                                                                                                Annex VI1
                                                                                               Page 6 of 15

to achieve such a rapid pace o f privatization and are only privatized a handful of significant firms

22.     The P A has used appropriate sales methodsinits privatizations inthe two year period:
block sales where strategic buyers were needed, IPOswhere broad public participationwas the
aim, asset sales where appropriate and concessions where public assets (infrastructure) was
deemedbest to be keptunder government control butwhere private operators were requiredto
bringmarket driven, efficient operations to the assets. Outside financial advisors have been used
appropriately, inline with best practices, on the bigprivatizations, where reputed outside
financial advice is key to success. Privatizations have been adequately announced and publicized
by government and the PA andboth foreign and domestic buyershave been encouraged. The
tender process has been open, transparent and competitive andtender pre-conditions appropriate.
Post privatization conditions have not beenonerous and golden shares, while common, have not
involved excessive government interference inthe private market.

23.     Lastly, the efficiency o f the process and the fairness of the results seem clear.
Considerable speed and highadherence to best practices indicate considerable efficiency. The
use o f best practices and openness and transparency seems to have leadto fair results, as well.

24.     Itwas concluded that the government, throughthe work ofthe PA, met the privatization
condition o f this loan as presented inparagraph 1regardingthe transparency o fthe process.

     Review of the EnvironmentalAspects of the PrivatizationsSupportedby the Loan

Introduction

26.     Inthis review, two types ofenvironmentalpollutionwere considered, as follows.

        0    Accumulated pollution (also referred to as `past pollution', `legacy', or `stock
             pollution'), such as abandoned waste disposal sites, hazardous wastes piles or oil or
             chemical spills, and water and soil pollution caused over time by waste and
             wastewater discharges and emissions to air to the point o fprivatization; and
             Ongoingpollution(also referred to as `current pollution' or `flow pollution') which
             refers to air, water and soil pollution caused by an enterprise duringits operations.

27.     The following were the key questions considered inthe review.

        0    Were environmental liabilities adequately assessed and information shared with
             potential investors?
             Were adequate plans made to mitigate risks associated with accumulated pollution?
             Were plans developed and is adequate enforcement capacity in place for ensuring
             compliance with regard to current pollution?


InternationalGood Practicesto Address EnvironmentalLiabilitiesduringPrivatization

28.     Experience has shown that serious international investors are sensitive to environmental
issues and consider risks as a much more important deterrent to invest inan SOE offered for
privatization than known costs. Risksare o f two types: (a) lack of clarity on legal requirements
inrelationto a company's ongoingoperations andcosts to meet the standards, particularly
because SOEs often tendto be inpersistent non-compliance with environmental requirements;
and (b) the risk to beheld liable for hazardous waste accumulation and soil and groundwater
contamination inand around the facility, resultingpossibly inexorbitant expenses for clean-up
and third-party compensation, and damage on the company's reputation.

29.     The internationalexperience i s these riskswere successfully mitigated where (a) good
baseline information i s ascertained thorough environmental audits about the extent and nature of
current and past environmental damage and made available to potential investors; (ii)
environmental requirements for ongoing operations are clearly stipulated; (iii) country's legal
                                                                                  the

                                                                                           Annex VI1
                                                                                         Page 8 of 15

system clearly allocates liability for past damages, such as through the privatization law; and (iv)
expectations about remediation o f past damage, the actions to be taken, the responsible parties,
andthe costs and financing of such actions are clearly set out inthe privatization agreement.

30.     Who shouldbe liable for paying for mitigation o f ongoing pollution and for the
remediation o f past damage, and when should these actions be taken? With regardto current
pollution, by the "polluter pays" principle and on economic efficiency grounds (the new investor
has better informationthanthe state on future production plans and technology), inmost cases,
such investmentsshouldbe carried out by the new owner after the privatization transaction
according to a phased plan included inthe privatization agreement.

31.     Inthe case ofpast damages, the "polluter pays" principle dictates that the state, as the
owner o f the enterprises at the time when the damage was caused, should fund its remediation.
Stating this clearly inthe privatization law reduces the risk premiumby which investors discount
their bids. Actual remediation works are best carried out by the new owner after the transaction
according to a remediation planincluded inthe privatization agreement. The state can use one o f
several financial instruments to pay for the remediation. Other key concerns to settle by means
of the privatization agreement are the extent ofremediation ("how clean is clean enough?") and
how to handle residual risks (Le. past damage unknown at the time o f privatization and third
party claims).

32.     Finally, successful handlingo f environmental issues during and after the privatization
process requires close cooperation betweengovernment agencies incharge o f privatization and
o f environmentalprotection.

Institutional and Legal Framework

33.     InTurkey, the responsibility to privatize SOEs rests withthe PA o fthe Prime Ministry.
PA activities are regulated by the Law on Privatizationand overseen by the HighCouncil o f
Privatization(HCP).

34.     The MEFhas responsibility for overall environmentalpolicy making. At the Central
Government, functional ministries, such the Ministries o f Industry and Trade and o f Energyand
Natural Resources, are responsible for ensuringthat activities under their mandate are carried out
incompliance with environmentallegislation. Regulatory functions (environmental impact
assessment, permitting, monitoring and inspection, and enforcement) are shared between Central
MEF, the Governorships with technical support from MEF's Provincial Directorates o f
Environment and Forestry (PDEF), and metropolitan municipalities. Inspection and enforcement
are the weakest links inthe Turkish environmental policy which relies mainly on command-and-
control for industrial pollution control.

35.     MEFhasno explicit role inthe privatizationprocess. Under the Law on Public
Informationit i s requiredto share with potential investors and their advisors information on legal
requirements and compliance status o f SOEs slated for privatization.

36.     Inaddition to the framework Law on Environment, other laws and by-laws regulate
industrial enterprises' (as well as municipalities') obligations and sanctions. Transposition with

                                                                                          Annex VI1
                                                                                         Page 9 of 15

the EUEnvironmentallegislation gained momentum after the EC recommended opening
accession talks with Turkey in2004. Progress intransposing the EUlegislation has been most
prominent inthe waste management, where all relevant legislationwith the exception o f a few on
special waste streams has beentransposed. Key water pollution related directives except for the
Water Framework Directive have beentransposed. The EIA Directive has also beenpartially
transposed. The transposition of the IPPC Directive which will replace the currently media-
based approach to permitting, inspection and enforcement with an integrated approach based on
best available techniques is inthe works. With regard to air pollution, none o f the relevant
Directives have as yet been transposed.

37.     Legislation relevant to SOEs slated for privatization are By-laws on the control o f air,
water and soil pollution, and hazardous waste management, as well the Amended Law on
Environment apply to. Key relevant provisions and issues are summarized below:

        0  The Amended Law on Environment (May 2006) and the by-law on the Control o f Air
           Pollution from Industrial Sources (July 2006) provide grace periods of 4 and 2 years
           from the date o f approval o f work plans by MEF, respectively, to achieve compliance
           with regard to emissions to air and wastewater discharges to water bodies. In each
           case, non-compliant enterprises had one year from the effectiveness o f the laws to
           submittheir work plansto MEF.
        0  The status of non-compliant SOEs that are privatized past the deadlines for the
           submission o f the above-mentioned work plans i s not clear. In such cases MEF will
           likely evoke the "fairness" principle in Turkish Legislation, which allows it to
           negotiate new deadlines with the new owners o f such enterprises.              Similarly,
           enterprises that are under the jurisdiction o f metropolitan municipalities or
           municipalities for wastewater discharges into receiving water bodies or the municipal
           sewer will either face non-compliance charges immediately or seek a negotiated grace
           period.
           With regard to soil pollution, according to the By-law on Soil Pollution Control (May
           2005), enterprises causing soil pollution are responsible for remediating the pollution
           to a level that satisfy limit values prescribed in the By-law. However, a regulation
           specifying the principles and procedures for identifying and remediatingcontaminated
           soils has as yet not beenput inplace.
           The By-law on Hazardous Wastes (March 2005) defines how such wastes are to be
           stored, transported and disposed off, and lays out respective licensing requirements.
           However, there is a legislative gap with regardto hazardous waste accumulations that
           have emerged over many years, such as ash dumps on the premises of thermal power
           plants, mine tailings, and sludge lagoons near steel mills. Two key issues are (i)
           procedures according to which such large accumulations are to be safely cleaned-up;
           and (ii) assessment of liabilities for soil or water contamination, or public health or
           economic damage caused by such waste through air, soil or water pollution in past
           years.

Methodology of the Environmental Review

Enterprises Reviewed

38.     A total of 58 privatizationtransactions were carried out in2005 and 2006 at total sales
value o f US$ 17.69billion. A sample o f 22 transactions was reviewed. This sample comprises
98 percent of the sales invalue terms (Table 9) and all five o f high-risk enterprises. It also
includes three medium-risk enterprises and six low risk enterprises (Table 10).

Classification of Enterprises

39.     The enterprises reviewedwere categorized as high, mediumand low risk according to the
environmental damage they could likely cause.

Information collection

40.     The review was based on in-depthinterviewswith project managers at the PA, the
DeputyDirector ofthe MEFDirectorateGeneral for Environmental Management, and a review
o f environment related documents generated duringthe privatization process.

Findings

         0   Environmental information collection by PA prior to privatization: EitherPA or
             its privatization advisor collected from MEFPDEFcompliance information on the
             SOE and documented it. Inthree cases, audits were carried out.

         0   Environmental audits: Environmental audits were, inthe cases o f the PETKIM
             petro-chemical plant, the ERDEMIR Group o f iron and steel works, and the TUPRAS
             Petroleum Refinery, all large, high-value strategic enterprises for which there were
             significant international interest. The audits were motivated mainly by questions and
             concerns expressed by international investors inexploratory meetings organized by
             P A and its privatization advisors before the privatization process commenced. The
             three companies were genuinely committedto reaching European environmental
             standards and had startedefforts to this end even before they were slated for
             privatization. The cost of audits was covered from the PA Privatization Fund.

41.     Audits were not carried out for smaller, butpolluting enterprises, such as the ET1
Aluminum complex which consists ofan aluminum smelter, a bauxite mine and a hydro-electric
power plant, and the TUGSAS Samsun Fertilizer Factory. Similarly, medium-risk polluters,
such as the Adapazari Sugar Factory and the TEKEL Kayacik Salt Mine were not audited. Inthe
case o f TUGSAS, it may be argued that the two main issues o f air pollution andthe accumulation

                                                                                      Page 12 of 15

on phospho-gypsum on the premiseso f plant had previously beenstudiedat lengthinyears
leading up to privatization, inpart due to popular complaints about damage to crops by emissions
fromthe fertilizer factory andthe neighboring cupper smelter which became a court case. Inthe
case o f Adapazari Sugar Factory, PA explainedthat the factory had beendamaged duringthe
1999 earthquake and had hence not been inoperation. Furthermorethe investmentneedsto
achieve compliance with air pollution and wastewater discharge regulations were well known.

42.     The P A did not carry out an audit o f ET1because it deemed that the aluminum plant was
inneedofa complete technologicaloverhaul andthat, therefore, anauditwould have been
superfluous inthese circumstances. Furthermore, there was an investment condition which was
believedto help install a cleaner technology. This approach did not take into account possible
accumulated pollution both at the aluminum works and the bauxite mine.

         0   Environmental compliance status of SOEs slated for privatization: Based on
             information obtained from PA, the compliance status o f SOEs at the time o f
             privatization varied. Among the high-riskcompanies, ET1 Aluminum was operating
             without environmental permits for emissions to air or wastewater discharges. Inthe
             Erdemir Group, Isdemirhadnon-compliance problems, prompting PA to carry out an
             audit. However, PA stated that the Erdemir Group strove to abide by European
             standards and aimed to bring the then newly acquired Isdemir to the same level.
             According to PA, TUPRAS too aimed to achieve EU standards in terms o f
             environmental management as evidenced by its 1986 Investment Master Plan.
             Specific permit information could not be obtained;              however,   significant
             environmental abatement and remediation investments were carried out prior to
             privatization in TUPRAS's Izmit facility, suggesting that all permit conditions were
             fulfilled. On the other hand, the Batman facility was non-compliant. PETKIM had a
             wastewater discharge permit but did not fulfill conditions for a permit for emissions
             to air.

43.     The TUGSAS Samsun Fertilizer Factory did not have a permit for emissions to air, but
was inpossession o f a permit to discharge its wastewater to sea. The Samsun PDEF reportedly
considered that its storage o f its phospho-gypsum on its premises did not violate any
environmental regulation. Among the medium-risk enterprises, the Adapazari Sugar Factory also
hadno permits, but it had also not beenoperational since the August 1999 earthquake. The
TEKEL Kayacik Salt Minewas the only enterprise inthe highand medium-riskgroup that
fulfilled all environmentalpermit conditions it was subject to.

44.     With regardto low-risk enterprises PA concluded that the Efes, Hiltonand Tarabya
Hotels did not have any compliance issues giventheir 5-star status. A similar conclusion was
reached with regardto the Atakoy Hotel due to its `Blue Flag' status.

            Type of Audits Carried Out: The audits commissioned for TUPRAS, the Erdemir
            Group and PETKIM prior to their privatization were compliance audits aiming at
            presenting a "portrait o f the enterprise in terms o f compliance with the Turkish
            legislation".  Auditors were also requested to recommend mitigation measures and
            corresponding cost estimates.

                                                                                                                  Annex VI1
                                                                                                              Page 13 of 15

45.     PhaseI1audits which involve sampling from soil and groundwater were not carried
The nature ofthe industriesandknowledge of existing accumulated pollution, such as a lagoon
filled with wastewater containing possibly toxic materials at Isdemir o fthe Erdemir Group and
the Kizilcamur lake at ETI, would have required Phase 11audits on all four plants inaddition to
Phase Iaudits. This would have allowed an assessment of risks to public health and the
environment posed by such accumulated pollution. The risk assessment would have allowed the
preparation o f a clean-up plan based on acceptable risk levels together with cost estimates.

        0    Environmental information shared with bidders: Information on the status of
             environmental compliance by the enterprise was provided to pre-qualified bidders in
             nearly all cases.         The P A requested from MEF that PDEFs share compliance
             information with pre-qualified bidders and their environmental consultants.
             Furthermore, inall cases but one, access to the company premises was grantedto pre-
             qualified bidders.

46.     Where an audit was carried out, pre-qualified bidders were given access to its findings in
the data room. However, the level / amount o f information sharedvaried. Insome cases, such as
TUPRAS,information on the nature o f non-compliance, recommended mitigation measures as
well as cost estimates was made available. Inother cases, such as Erdemir, and inthe case o fthe
Adapazari Sugar Factory where PA's financial consultants made a cost estimatefor the necessary
emission and wastewater abatement investments,P A did not share these estimates with the
justification that "the cost o f specified mitigation measures i s standard' and they `did not want to
seem to indicate a specific amount."

        0    Pre-privatizationInvestmentsFundedby PA or the Enterprise: Inall three major
             companies, Erdemir, TUPRAS and PETKIM, significant investments were carried out
             for technological environmental upgrades in the years leading up to their
             privatization. The costs were funded from the companies' own earnings.

47.     On the other hand inother cases, such as the TUGSAS Samsun Fertilizer Factory, funds
for environmental upgrades were not authorized in annual national budgetary investment plans.
The result was that as a result o f delays inthe privatization process, the factory continued to
operate without an emission permit and to pollute the air.

48.     As explained above, unless there are significant costs interms o f damage to public health,
eco-system or economic resources necessitating urgent action, investment actions could be
carried out after the privatization under the management of the new owner and not necessarily
always prior to the privatization. This i s especially true for abatement technology for ongoing
pollution, since pre-privatization investments may not be inline with the new owner's production
strategy.

        0    Inclusion of environment in the sales and purchase agreement (SPA): SPASfor
            the Erdemir Group and the TCDD Mersin Port contained specific provisions


31Inthe case ofPETKIM,PA informedthe team that in 1994a Phase I1was carried out with 21 sampling points;
however clearly the significant time lag since then rendered the results o f that audit of little value for the transaction
in2005.

                                                                                           Annex VI1
                                                                                         Page 14 of 15

            regarding environment. In the cases o f the PETKIM, TUGSAS Samsun Fertilizer
            Factory, and the Efes, Tarabya and Hilton Hotels the SPA included a condition that
            the buyer is responsible for obtaining all relevant licenses and permits for the
            operation o f the enterprise. This was understood to cover environmental permits. The
            other SPAs didnot cover environmental provisions.

49.     Inthe case ofthe Erdemir Group, the SPA includeda conditionthat the investor accepts
to makeall necessary environmental investments to reach compliance with environmental
regulations. Furthermore, the SPA specified that the applications for the required environmental
permits had to be made inthe shortest possible time and the obtaining o f such permits hadto be
tiedto a certaintime schedule. Underthese conditions, the temporary lack o fenvironmental
permits was not to be considered a breach o f the SPA. However, the SPA did not specify what
constituted an acceptable schedule and what role, ifany, MEFwas to play indeterminingthis.
More importantly, unlike the condition requiringthat the buyer invest inflat steel production, no
 sanctions were specified for the case ifthe new owner did not abide by these conditions.

 50.    The SPA for the TCDD Mersin Port statedthat the operator carries out environmental
measuresas requiredby MEF.

5 1.    Other SPAs did not have any provisions related to the environment-including       ET1
Aluminum. The SPA o fET1Aluminumcontained investmentconditions butno environmental
conditions despite the existence o f envirowental pollution. P A assumed that the new
technology will automatically be cleaner. However, there i s no guarantee that this assumption
will be realized.

        0   Post-privatization Monitoring: The PA does not monitor environmental compliance
            after the transfer o f the enterprise.   The PA holds the view that environmental
           monitoring and enforcement i s beyond their institutional mandate and should be
            carried out by the responsible ministry.

           Uncertainty regarding environmental liabilities and consequences: Several
           sources o f environmental related uncertainty remained inthe sample reviewed:
            o The Law on Privatization does not specify who is liable for pollution caused by
               the SOE prior to the privatization transaction. PA officials generally refer to the
                standard SPA clause that "all rights and obligations associated with the enterprise
               are transferred to the new owner." Given limited assessment o f past damages and
               legal vacuum in regulations concerning the assessment and limitations on
               liabilities from accumulated pollution, this may cause uncertainty to potential
               investors.

           o Regarding liabilities for ongoing air and water pollution to receivingwater bodies
               there i s a grace period for achieving compliance. However, for enterprises under
               thejurisdiction of municipalities, there is significant uncertainty as to whether and
               how long a grace period they would be granted.
52.     A consequence o fa clear allocation ofliability is that investors could discount their bids
to account for possible risks. P A has adopted "price adjustments" as policy to deal with this

                                                                                         Annex VI1
                                                                                      Page 15 of 15

issue. Inthe absence o f agreed upon remediation and mitigation plans, the investments might not
take place, especially with respect to accumulated pollution.

         0   EnvironmentalProtectionFollowingPrivatization:Itis too early to assess whether
             SOEs privatized in 2005 - 2006 have become compliant with regard to current
             pollution.    As the discussion on applicable legislation indicates, enterprises have
             benefited from grace periods o f 2-4 years with regards to emissions to air and
             wastewater discharges to receiving water bodies.

53.      Ingeneral, MEFis satisfied withthe efforts to reachcompliance bythe large industrial
enterprises privatized in2005-2006. This i s consistent with the Bank's observation made as part
o f a recent Economic Sector Work (ESW) on industrial pollution control that large foreign
owned/part-owned enterprises go to great lengthto meet Turkish and often higher environmental
standards as part o f their corporate and reputationstrategies. Incase o fmedium size enterprises,
environmental investments are often the first investmentsprivate owners undertake to comply
withregulations.

    0   Finally, it is likely that Turkey will privatize a number o fhighand mediumrisk
        enterprises. Accordingly, the Bank presenteda number o f recommendations to the PA for
        its consideration. These recommendations relate to environmental issues o f such
        privatizations.

Conclusions

54.      Overall, the process o fprivatization followed in2005 and 2006 deserves Bank support-
although part of the procedures were not international bestpractices.

55.      The PA should be praised for its growing attentionto environmental issues instrategic
SOEs as well as these SOEs' for their efforts to,upgrade their operations to European standards.
Financingcompliance audits and sharing their findings with pre-qualifies biddersare
commendable actions, especially since there i s no legal requirement for it inTurkey.
Furthermore, the PA and its advisors collected compliance informationon most other enterprises
and made this available to potential investors.

56.      There is roomfor improving PA procedures to makethem internationalbest practice in
the field o fenvironmentaldue diligence. Opportunities relate to the approach for conducting
audits, includingall highlypolluting enterprises and increasing attentionto legacy pollution;
cooperation with MEF whose expertise can contribute to the process; clarifying regardinglegacy
issues; and explicit mention o f environmental conditions inthe SPA.

                           ANNEXVIII: CREDITAND CAPITALMARKETS


The Importanceof Access to InvestmentCapital

1.       Turkey's financial sector has efficiently mobilized savings, buthistorically banks have
not been supportive o fprivate sector investments,preferring instead to invest in a few large firms
and Government securities. Turkey's banks have neither allocated capital to the private sector
efficiently nor diversified risks for shareholders. Increasingly however, the banking sector i s
repositioning itself to better facilitate growth o f the private sector through transforming its
business model to better assess credit risk opportunities and provide value added services for
clients.

2.       The banking sector remains the largest andmost important part o fthe Turkishfinancial
system, though the public equity market has grown to a substantial size, the non-bank financial
institutions (NBFI) sectoP2remains small. By international comparison, the bankingsystem
performs well against other non-Asian emerging markets interms o f mobilizing deposits, but
credit generation to the private sector remains constrained.

3.       A near term challenge for the banking sector is to prudentlyexpand credit and services to
customers inthe face o f increased competition. Similarly, the TurkishBank Regulatory and
Supervisory Authority (BRSA) must put inplace an effective regime to advance the 2008
introduction o f Base1I.Concurrently, both banks and the BRSA alike will be challenged to
mitigate against the credit risks arising from rapid nominal credit growth inthe last four years,

BRSARegulatoryand SupervisoryReforms

4.       Turkey has made substantial progress inupdating its regulatory and supervisory
framework to bring it further inline with international practice. However, there are still a
numberofimportant impediments, includingthe lack of consolidated supervision, the assessment
o f related and/or large exposures, the capacity o f the authority to address market and liquidity
risks, banks' IT systems, and risk management techniques. Additionally, supervisors are
reportedly still reluctant to take forceful action because o fpast weaknesses inlegal protection
and official investigations.

5.       The BRSA capacity to effectively carry out its mandate o f ongoing supervision i s
constrained. The agency lacks operational independence inbudgetary and regulatory issues since
the government can set limits on the Agency's budgetand mustclear the issuance o fthe BRSA
sub-regulations. Resources have been strained further by the extension o f the prudential
supervision mandate (leasing, factoring, consumer financing companies) under the new Banking
Law.

6.       The BRSA supervisory work is also challenged by gaps inprudential supervisiontools.
The BRSA does not have the power to stop an acquisitionby a bankeven where it considers that
the acquisitioncould impede effective supervision. Supervisory gaps inmonitoring connected
lending also pose problems. Going forward, the consistent and full implementation o f sub-


32The sector includes mutual finds, pension finds, and insurance, leasing, factoring, asset management and
consumer finance firms.

                                                                                             Annex VI11
                                                                                             Page 2 of 8
regulations underlying the 2005 BankingLaw will improve the BRSA's capacity to monitor
banks' market activities andrisk management systems.

State Bank Privatization

7.       State-owned Ziraat Bank and Halk Bank, and state-controlled Vakif Bank represent about
30 percent share o f total bankingsystem assets. Inthe aftermath o f the 2001 financial crisis,
Ziraat Bank, Halk Bank and Emlak Bank were recapitalizedand operationally restructured.
Today, Ziraat Bank, Halk Bank and Vakif Bank are all profitable banks.

8.       Fiscal restructuring cost o f the state banksafter 2001 was US$ 22 billion (equivalent to
 15 percent o f 2001 GDP). The banks underwent governance and operational restructuringand
are now more efficient and transparent. Shouldthe authorities decided, prospects for a
successful privatization have improved with the stabilization o fthe economic environment and
increasing interest inTurkish banks among strategic investors.

9.       Vakif Bank successfully launched an IPO o f inNovember 2005 and Halk Bank
completed an IPO o f 25 percent o f equity. Vakif Bank issued D-shares and had strong demand
for the issue. Although more thantwenty percent o f equity i s now owned by the private sector,
control remains firmly inthe hands of Government. Halk Bank completed an IPO for 25 percent
o f its equity. The privatization process for Ziraat Bank,the largest o fthe three, i s envisaged to
occur only after concluding the Halk Bank privatization.

Insurance Regulatory and Supervisory Reforms

10.      The insurance sector inTurkey is insufficiently developed, and insurance premiums in
2005 amounted to just 1.3 percent of GDP for the non-life segment and 0.25 percent for the life
segment-low      figures by international comparisons. The also insufficiently developed non-life
insurance industry i s partlyrelated to the lagging development o f the credit market. For instance,
as the mortgage market develops, the demand for housing insurance will grow. Equally, a
number offoreign insurers have enteredthe marketinthe last year or so. The enforcement of
mandatory coverage for Motor Third Party Liability (MTPL) will increase demand for insurance
products. The insurance companies are mostly affiliated with major banks.

11.      Dueto the small size ofthe sector, the supervisory andregulatoryregimefor insurance
has received insufficient attention and needs substantial revision inorder to meet EU
requirements. Regulation i s done by the General Directorate o f Insurance (GDI), and supervision
i s done by the Insurance Audit Board (IAB). Both are hosted inthe Turkish Treasury, and are
thus less independent thanthe BRSA, the Capital MarketsBoard(CMB) or the CBRT.

12.      Supervisionand regulation o f the insurance industry needs significant improvement.
Important issues include, inter alia:

     0   A new framework law for insurance aiming to modernize the regulatory and supervisory
         framework and to bring it in line with EU and international standards has been under
         preparation for more than a decade.

                                                                                                 Annex VI11
                                                                                                  Page3 of 8

     0    Upon passage o f the insurance framework law, the supervisory authority will be
          challenged with producing the supporting regulations necessary to ensure effective
          implementationof the law.

ImprovingFinancialReportingto Support Credit to Firms

13.       Credible information on firms' financial condition and their ability to pay i s important to
expand access to credit, but few firms inTurkey, particularly SMEs, use external auditors.
Reliable financial reports are critical to help providers o f credit assess the firms' ability to meet
their obligations. Duringthe long inflationary period, even a well preparedfinancial report was
of limitedvalue, but the importance goodreporting standards has increased significantly over the
past few years as inflation has beenbrought down to moderate levels. Inthe Turkey ICs
conducted in2005, only 42 percent of firms report that they hadtheir financial accounts audited
by an external auditor, which is below most comparator countries

14.       Widespread informality exacerbates        Figure 3: Firms havingfinancial accountsexternally
financial reportingproblems, because                                 audited, by country

Codes by the World Bank hasjust beenpublishedand will support future reform efforts. The
report outlines several needs as well as guidance on how to addressthem. The national steering
committee could leverage this report to develop a strategy and action planfor strengthening the
framework for accounting and auditing inTurkey.

ImprovingCredit Informationon Firmsto Support Creditto Firms

16.       Developing better credit information on firms will help banks, leasing firms, and
factoring firms expand credit to SMEs. Credit bureaus not only provide lenders with information
on borrowers' ability to pay, but they also improve borrowers' willingness to pay becausea bad
credit history will restrict access to credit or at least raise the cost o f credit inthe future. Efficient
access to credit history on smaller firms inparticular i s a cost efficient way for financial
institutions to assess whether or not to extend credit and at what price.

17.       Turkey has two important credit information sources, the Credit Bureauof Turkey (KKB)
andthe Credit Registry at the CBRT, supplying credit history information. The KKB only
disseminates information from banks on individuals for consumer credit purposes, but eventhat
information i s o f value to small businesses, because such payment information i s closely
associated with the credit quality o f small business owners. The information i s efficiently
delivered on-line and includes both positive and negative i n f ~ r m a t i o n . ~ ~

18.       The Credit Registryat the central bank covers both individuals and firms above a low
threshold, and information i s collected from both bank and non-bank credit institutions, such as
leasing and factoring firms. The information covers both credits and off-balance sheet items such
as guaranteesand commitments, as well as information on delinquencies. However, borrower
data i s provided only periodically for a point intime, so for the users to have a time perspective,
they must maintaintheir own database basedon information received from the Credit Registry.

19.       Inadditionto the credit registry and credit bureau, the Ministry ofJustice maintains
records on civil cases for breach o f contract, non-payment andbankruptcies, and this information
i s reportedly cumbersome to obtain. Reforms are underway to enable access to records o f the
Ministry of Justice. Once effectively implemented,these reforms will strengthen lenders' ability
to assess firms' credit risks.

20.       KKBis piloting a firm level databasecovering bothpositive and negative information.
The operational infrastructure for this initiative, referred to as the commercial bureau, has been in
place since the summer o f 2005, but the databases are only populated for four banks.The
database is currently being tested as a precursor to a formal launch late in2007. KKBplans to
include other NBFIs such as leasing and factoring firms, which also serve SMEs. Makingthe
commercial credit bureau operational will enable financial institutions to better serve SMEs
through the better assessment o f borrowers' payment history.




33Negative information refers to defaults, late payments, etc., while positive information refers to past payment
patterns in general.

The Use of Collateral to Support Credit to the Private Sector: Mortgage and Movable

21.      Improvingthe use of collateral has a
substantialpotential to improve access to               Figure 4: Share of Firms for which Collateral is

23.       The recently passed mortgage law will facilitate the introduction of mortgagebonds and
mortgage backedsecurities, which will help banks manage their risks and lower the mediumterm
interest rates offered. Interest rate risk has beenparticularly important because formerly
mortgage loans inTurkey were required to be offered at a fixed interest rate (as opposedto a
variable interest rate). Bankshavebeenusing an international FX swap market to hedge the
interestrate risk arising from giving mediumand longterm loans inYTL. This market, however,
i s an imperfect hedge, because it covers neither credit risk nor pre-payment risk.

                                Box 1: Reforms of Housing Finance Underway

Effortsto modernizethe legal framework for housingfinance were initially championedby the CMB of Turkey. The
reforms aim at strengtheningthe primarymarketby:

0        Shorteningtime neededto foreclosemortgages


0        Regulatingthe appraisalprofessionto ensure reliable andconsistentappraisals

e        Addressing consumer protection, including relaxing the requirement that housing loans must be fixed
interestloans.

The reformsalso aim at establishinga secondarymarket for mortgages by:

0        Regulating mortgage capital market instruments, including definition of mortgage cover bonds and
mortgagebackedsecurities.


0        Regulatingof secondary market institutions, the so-called"Mortgage Finance Corporations" (MFC). The
MFCs will be allowedto issuethe above mentionedsecuritiesandeither purchase loans from primary lendersor give
loans to primary lendersbackedby housingloans as collateral.

24.      The pre-payment riskrefers to the situation when interest rates decline and borrowers pre-
pay or re-finance their loans at lower interest rates. Ifthat happens, then banks earn less interest
on their mortgage loans, but they must still pay the higher interest rate on the FX swap agreement
and thus may incur a loss. While interest rates in Turkey remain highand volatile, pre-payment
risk is important.The secondary mortgage marketcan potentially addressthisproblembypassing
the pre-payment risk to the holder ofthe securities.

25.      Firmshave more movable than immovable assets, andthe former could be important
sources o f collateral for firms inTurkey. Immovable such as land and buildings are often used as
collateral because their values are highand maintained over time, ownership i s clear, and such
assets are easier to seize inthe event o f default. Movable assets, however, make up a much
larger part o f firms' assets. Inthe Turkey ICs, landand buildingsmake up4 and 6.3 percent o f
firms' assets, respectively, other assets such as machinery, vehicles, and equipment account for
20.3 percent and accounts receivable account for 24.6 percent. Evidence suggests that such assets
are under-utilized for collateral.

26.      The effective use ofmovable collateral is impededby legal and institutional
inadeq~acies.~~Problems inthe legal regime and an inefficient systemfor registeringclaims
against collateral are the mainimpedimentsto the exploitation of movable collateral for
accessing finance. Impediments to the effective usage of movable collateral pertain to different
stages inthe process o f usingcollateral including creation, priority, publicity, and enforcement.

27.      A newcomprehensivelaw to address impedimentsto the movable collateral regime, and
amend conflicting current laws i s the best way to address these legal impediments. Introducing a
new law is preferable to amendingcurrent laws, which would likely not address all the issues
raised above. The law on secured transactions would govern creation, priority, publicity, and

enforcement o f security interests inmovable collateral, while it would not cover landand
buildings, which are being addressed separately.

28.     The law would also support the establishment o f a national Internet-based filing archive
o f security interests inmovable collateral. The system would replace the current registry system.
The new systemwould separatetitle registrationfrom filing notice of security interests. The
system could be operated either by the government or by private operators.

Microfinance

29.     Microfinance has proveninthe international context to be a very effective tool to assist
the poor self-employed, specially, inrural areas, to increase productivity and achieve higher
levels o f income. InTurkey, the incidence o f microfinance i s negligible, due inlarge part to the
absence of a legal framework. Developing micro-finance as an important instrument for self -
employment by drafting satisfactory legislation, including a regulatory framework, for the
provision of microfinance services is a priority.

Corporate Governance

30.     Strongcorporate governance helps firms efficiently attract investment and thus obtain the
capital necessary for sustained long-term growth. Market capitalization at the ISE i s relatively
highinTurkey despite weaknesses inits corporate governance framework. The prospect ofEU
accession i s likely to sustain strong investor interest, and addressing corporate governance
weaknesses therefore presents an opportunity for Turkishfirms to take advantage of favorable
market conditions.

3 1.    The governance of Turkishcompanies is characterized by conglomerate structures,
concentrated ownership, and insider-dominated boards. This combination raises concerns about
insiders usingintra-group transactions to exploit minority shareholders. Such insider transactions
may be misusedfor asset stripping, transfer pricing, and other corporate governance abuses.
Most analysts agree that intra-group transactions remain a major corporate governance weakness
inTurkey. Weak public disclosure ofintra-grouptransactions is common inemerging markets,
butthe issue is exacerbated inTurkey, where conglomerates are dominant and ownership is
concentrated. An estimated 40 percent o f the market capitalization o f the ISE i s accounted for by
13 holding companies and their 8 affiliated banks. O fthis, 11holding companies are controlled
by 11 leading families. Contributing to opaqueness i s the fact that holding companies o f firms
listed on the stock exchange are often not listed and thus not subject to the same disclosure
standards.

32.     A recent         bythe OECD provides an assessmentofthe implementationofthe
OECD Principles o f Corporate Governance inTurkey. Corporate Governance inTurkey relies
mostly on enforcement o f goodpractices by the CMB,as substantial presence o f institutional
investorshas only emergedwithinthe last few years. Despite successful reform efforts by the
CMB inrecent years, inadequacies remain with regard to disclosure o f related party transactions
and self-dealing, protection o f minority shareholders, and the role o f the boardinoverseeing

                ANNEX   Ix:INNOVATION,      TECHNOLOGY,      QUALITY AND SKILLS


Introduction

1.      Improvingtechnological capacity-via        quality standards, technology absorption, or
innovation-and     augmenting the skills o f the labor force contribute to increasing firms'
productivity and, inthe longer term, employment. The fourth component o fthe reform
program supported by the CEDPL focuses on improvements inharnessing knowledge factors
for productivity and employment, including (a) innovation and technology adoption, (b)
quality and standards, and (c) labor force skills. Introducing innovation, new technologies,
quality standards and better labor skills leads to greater production efficiency. Ifmarket
characteristics are conducive to competition, these productivity gains translate into lower
prices and increased demand, andtherefore contribute to employment generation. Links
between each o f the knowledge-based variables, productivity and employment are
summarized below.

a. Innovation and technology adoption. Firms' innovation and adoption o f new technologies
    (e.g., equipment, computers and the internet) have a positive and significant effect on their
    produ~tivity.~~   Although individual innovations can eliminate jobs (because the
    introduction of new machinery and equipment, new product lines, and new workforce
    management systems can be labor-saving for firms) the net effect on aggregate
    employment is positive. One reason is that innovative firms are on average more likely to
    survive and to grow rapidly than firms that do not innovate. Another reason is that the loss
    of jobs in some companies i s outweighed by the creation o fjobs in new firms that enter
    the market to exploit the opportunities generated by technological progress. The dynamic
    process of firm entry and growth requires certain preconditions, including a favorable
    business climate for investment, access to finance, and well-functioning channels for
    international and domestic absorption o ftechnology.

b. Quality standards. Firms' use o f quality standards increases their productivity and
    exportsY3'in turn contributing to increased employment. Quality standards also help
    diffuse technology. First, quality standards increase productivity through simplification
    and rationalization of production and distribution processes. They also increase the
    efficiency o f the development, manufacturing and supply o f products and services because
    they facilitate standardized processes and components, allow for flexibility through
    component substitution and bring about economies o f scale. Second, quality standards
    contribute to increased exports becausethey lower transaction costs between suppliers and
    clients by communicating reliable and consistent information about the characteristics and
    quality o f products and services, facilitating exports to foreign firms (intermediate clients)
    and final customers. Finally, standards usually embody technology and act as a channel for
    technology transfer for the institutions and firms that adopt them, enhancing their
    productivity and competitiveness.

c. Labor skills. Firms' productivity         and employment are positively associated with the
       availability o f skilled labors,
      training provided to employees,              Figure 1: GERD, trends and composition: Turkey

IPR andfacilitate patent applications, more effort i s neededto ensure full compliance o f IPR
legislation withAcquis requirements and for the creation o f a comprehensive legal and
implementation IPR framework. This i s an important condition for fostering productive
innovation inTurkey, because patents are effective instruments to protect inventions with
industrial applicability. The number o f patents filed by Turkish innovators inthe US i s similar
to those o f some comparators (although it i s below those o f most OECD countries and several
emergingmarkets). Patents granted to Turkishinventorsby the EUare limited, andthe
number ofpatents registered locally is extremelylow (Table 1).

4.       The current structure o fTurkey's NIS is not conduciveto public-private sector
collaboration on innovation. One of the symptoms o f this i s that collaboration between the
private and public sectors inTurkey i s limitedwhen compared to EUand other East Asian
countries. Public-private sector collaboration inTurkey is hampered by insufficient
intermediaries, such as technology transfer offices and commercialization agents; the ban
preventing academics from establishing start-upfirms; the obligation on academics to transfer
70 percent o f income earned through private consulting back to host universities; the
perceptioninindustrythat public research institutes cannot provide highquality applied
research; and distinct businessand academic cultures.

5.       The outcomes o f existing public instrumentsto foster innovation andtechnology
adoption have not been systematically assessed. Several institutions (including The Scientific
and Technological Research Council o f Turkey (TUBITAK), KOSGEB (Small and Medium
IndustryDevelopment Organization), Technology Development FoundationofTurkey
(TTGV), TPE, the Ministryo f Trade and Industry, universities andresearchcenters) are
promoting innovation and technology adoption. The mainprograms to promote innovation

                                                                                         Annex IX
                                                                                      Page 4 of 13

andtechnology adoption include techno-parks, tax incentives, matching grants, and
reimbursable loan schemes. An evaluation i s necessaryto systematically assess the objectives,
benefits, impacts and fiscal costs o f all existing programs and rationalize and scalethem up as
needed. Available evidence indicates that Turkish firms do not find tax postponement or
support for R&D investment beneficial, and so do not use these schemes. On the other hand,
the incentives providedbythe Technology DevelopmentZone and R&D Tax Exemption
Laws are very generous and should be reviewedto assess their effectiveness, fiscal impact and
consistency with the Acquis. Existingfiscal incentives often do not benefit SMEs, which have
insufficient profits to use the tax benefits and do not record R&D expenses separately, making
them ineligible.

6.      V C and other private sources o f finance for innovation are almost non-existent. There
are only four V C funds inTurkey, and the percentage o f V C investmentto GDP is close to nil.
Despite newV C legislation in2004, both supply and demand factors still limit the V C
industryinTurkey. Key supply side factors hinderingVC development include immature
pensionfunds and insurance markets, the small size and limitedliquidity o f the capital
market, insufficient exit mechanisms, and lack of limited rightsfor-and      protection of-
minority shareholders. Key factors hindering V C development on the demand side are certain
cultural and managerial practices, including traditional family ownership and management,
weak corporate structures, confidentiality concerns o f entrepreneurs, ownership and control,
and firms' accounting practices, which make company valuation difficult. Altogether, lack o f
access to finance for innovation constrains the creation of new firms andjobs.

7.       The Government has taken steps to improveinnovation and technology adoption.
Government efforts have focused on improving capacity o f and increasing resources for the
TUBITAK, whichreceived a budgetallocationofUS$ 1.1 billion in2005-7, fostering public-
private collaboration by creating the Turkish Research Area (TARAL) and creating an overall
strategic framework for R&D and innovation-for         example, the Supreme Council of Science
and Technology's (BTYK) strategic documents, "Vision 2023," and SPO's "Knowledge
Society Strategy 2006-2010."

8.      The Governmenthas also taken steps to improveprotection o fIPRsandfacilitate
patent applications. The Government has revised IPR legislation to improve alignment with
EUrequirements. To ensure full consistency withEUregulation, anIPR Specialization
Committee has been set up in2006 under SPO's coordination. The Government has also
initiated a consultation process to modify the laws on trademarks, patents, geographical
indications and industrial designs. The institutional capacity o f the TPE has been strengthened
to improve its efficiency. Pending issues includefull alignment o f IPR legislationwith that o f
the EU-notwithstanding recent changes, TurkishIPRlaws are still not consistent with EU
requirements-improving       the enforcement o fthe revisedIPR laws and increasing TPE's
autonomy.

9.      The Government provides different fiscal incentives for private sector investmentin
R&D andhas recently encouraged development of VC. The laws on Technology
Development Zones (2001) and R&DExemption (2005) as well as the Decree on Tax
Postponement to Support R&D (1986) and Supportfor R&DInvestment(1986) provide
incentives for private sector investmentinR&D.TUBITAK-TIDEM, TTGV and KOSGEB

                                                                                          Page 5 of 13

offer matching grants and reimbursable loans to support innovation at the firm level. To
increase access to VC, C M B regulations were also modified in2004 and2006, and a new
stock exchange, the "Growing Enterprises Market" (GIP), has been createdjointly by
KOSGEB, Union o f Chambers and Commodity Exchanges o f Turkey (TOBB) and the
Association o f Capital Market Intermediary Institutions o f Turkey (TSPAKB).

10.     Several measures are neededto further promote productive innovation andtechnology
adoption inTurkey, The short-term reform strategy supported by CEDPL includes adoption o f
the European Patent Convention. The only condition includedunder CEDPL to improve
innovation and technology adoption i s enacting a law on adoption o f the Agreement on
Amendment to the European Patent Convention.

11,     A longer-termreform strategy could include an evaluation o fkey institutions,
programs, and policies o f the TurkishNIS, andfurther progress to align IPR legislation with
EUrequirements,Inthe medium-term, there could be a number ofpolicy actions to further
strengtheningTurkey's NIS,including: (a) an assessmento fthe overall structure and strategy
o f the NIS; (b) a review ofthe objectives, roles, functions, governance and institutional
structure and capacity o f key N I S institutions; (c) an evaluation o f the objectives, benefits,
impacts and fiscal costs of existing programs to promote innovation, andtechhology
absorption, This assessment could cover: (a) innovation infrastructure, including technoparks,
incubators and technology transfer offices, and a study on possible mechanisms to improve
patent commercialization; (b) access to finance for innovation, including R&Dfiscal
incentives, R&D matching grants, reimbursableloan schemes and V C legislation and funds;
(c) capacity to innovate at the university and firm level, including competitive R&D grants for
researchers, extension o f benefits providedto researchers working intechno-parks to all
researchers, expansion o f graduate scholarships, post-doctoral research fellowships and
research chairs inscience and engineering; and (d) regional utilization and impact of existing
innovation programs; (e) submissionto Parliament o f a comprehensive package o f revised
IPR legislation alignedwith the EUAcquis, including: (i) and Intellectual Property
                                                              Patent
Law, (ii) Geographical indications Law, (iii)    IndustrialDesignLaw, and (iv) Trade Marks; (0
granting o f autonomy to the TPE by enacting a revisedTPE law and strengtheningo fthe
capacity o f TPE and other institutions working on IPR, \such as the Ministryo f Industry,
Education, Culture and Tourism; and (8) implementation of the recommendations made by the
evaluation o f key institutions, R&D support programs and access to finance for innovation
schemes conducted under (a), (b) and (c) above.

12.     These measures could leadto increasedinnovation, technology adoption and improved
collaboration between firms, universities and research centers. The outcome o f increasing
innovation and use o ftechnology by firms will be monitored by variables such as: (a)
increased industry-fundedR&D, (b) increased VC funds flows, (c) increasedjoint projects
between universities and private firms; (d) increased numberso f science & engineering
graduates and post doctoral research fellows, (e) increasednumber o fpatents issued.

Quality Standards

13.     Turkey must increasingly rely on a strong NQS to remain competitive inthe global
economy. Turkey has a functioning NQS inplace, comprising the Turkish Standard Institute

                                                                                                       Page6 of 13

(TSE), TURKAK, the UMEand a number o f testing and calibration laboratories, as well as
certification and inspection entities inboththe private and public sectors.

14.'      Outstanding issues inthe TurkishNQS include unevenuse o f quality standards among
Turkishfirms and labs; incomplete alignment o fquality standards legislation withAcquis
requirementsandneedfor further institutional reforms of the national standards, accreditation
and metrology institutions. These shortcomings limit exports, the potential for creation o f
supply chains between foreign and local firms, competitiveness, growth and ultimately the

3). Certification i s also less common among SMEs than larger firms.

16.       Accreditation activities inTurkey remain limited-especiallyfor product certification
bodies-and     demand for TURKAK's accreditation services has been low due to lack o f
international recognition and highcosts. Despite its large size, Turkey has accredited fewer
conformity assessment bodies, except for system certification bodies, than many other
European countries (Figure 4). UntilApril 2006, TURKAK's accreditations were not
internationally recognized due to technical differences with international norms, and many
certification bodies preferredto seek accreditation from foreign bodies recognized both in
Turkey and abroad. This increasedthe cost o f doing business for certification bodies, and in
turnfor private firms. InApril 2006, Turkey was accepted bythe Multilateral Recognition
Arrangement for quality management systems, testing, calibration and inspectiono f the EA-
MLA.39    Turkey has yet not been accepted by EA-MLA for product certification and
environmental management system certification.

laboratories inthe primary market, which inturn provide calibration services to the productive
sector inthe secondary market.Only 9 percent o f UME's calibrations were performed for
commercial calibration laboratories (primary calibrations) in2005, the rest beingperformed
for final industrial users (secondary calibrations), mainly due to the absence o f high-quality
calibration laboratories inthe Turkishmarket. This highshare o f secondary calibrations i s in
stark contrast with what i s seen inmost other industrialized countries, where commercial
calibrations laboratories account for the vast majority o fNational Measurement Institute
(NMI)clients.

18.       European standards constitute a growing share o f Turkey's large and rapidly-growing
standard stock, but Turkey's participation indevelopment of regional standards remains
limited. The standards stock inTurkey has significantly grown inthe past few years, with
European standards accounting for more than 50 percent o f the stock. Turkey has now adopted
more than 90 percent o f European Standards. One-third has been adopted inEnglish.
Translation o f the required standards could assist firms inusingthese standards to export to
the EU.Furthermore, as a membero fthe Europeanregional standards institutions CEN and
CENELEC, Turkey would increase its ability to contribute to the development o f European
standards.

19.       TSE has been granted institutional autonomy from the government, but its structure i s
yet to fully conform to European and international norms and it faces restrictions vis-a-vis its
workforce. Areas where standardization could be improved include the role o f TSE's
Technical Board inmandatory standards, the openness o f the standards development process
to private stakeholders, and the separation between TSE's standardization and commercial
services activities. InJanuary 2006, a new law for public entities imposed restrictions on
contracting outside experts and purchasing equipment, affecting TSE's ability to deliver the
services neededto finance the standards development process, particularly in areas that
require very specialized technical skills.

20.       Turkey has made significant progress towards establishing a modern, market-based
quality standards regime that will facilitate its accession to the EUand other international
markets, but further changes are needed to improve operation o fthe TurkishNQS and to
foster adoption o f quality standards at the firm level. Turkey has a functioning NQS inplace,
andKOSGEB currently offers technical assistanceprogramsto support quality certification

                                                                                             Annex IX
                                                                                           Page8 of 13

among SMEs. Turkey has already replaced almost all nationaltechnical standards with EU
and international standards and significantly reduced the number o f mandatory standards.
UMEiswell equipped, hashighly qualified staff, andalready offers reliable measurement
traceability essential for the proper functioning o f the Turkish quality infrastructure.

21.     The short-term reform strategy supported under CEDPL includes several measuresto
further improve standardization andaccreditation activities. There are two conditions
supportedunder CEDPL. The first is acceptance o f TURKAK as a signatory membero f EA-
MLA inthe areas of calibration, testing, quality system certification and inspectionand a
signatory o f the ILAC-MRA4' inthe areas o f testing and calibration. This will allow the
quality management certification bodies and testing and calibration laboratories accredited in
Turkeyto be recognized internationally, and improve the quality and opportunities for trade of
private sector firms who use their services. The second condition i s submission to Parliament
of a revised TURKAK law consistent with EUAcquis and EA-MLA.This should improve the
effectiveness of accreditation, lower its cost, allow Turkey to remain inthe EA-MLA and
ultimately promotethe adoption o f quality and standards inTurkish firms.

22.     The longer-term reform strategy could includes further measures to strengthen
Turkey's NQS and promote adoption o f quality standards by firms-including:            (a) acceptance
o f TURKAK as a signatory o f the EA-MLA inthe areas o f product certification and

Education,Skills and Employment

and the EU, and present a major concern and bottleneck for Turkey injob creation and
competitiveness. Over the past 10years, Turkeyhas made remarkable progress ineducation

but the country continues to face a significant challenge inimproving educational outcomes
and employment o f young people.

    0   While enrollment in basic education has increased by over 1 million since the 1997
        reform; about ten percent o f school-age children are still not enrolled in primary
         school. Many o f them are girls, or live in rural areas, or are poor. Challenges also
        remain inimproving the quality o f primary school education.

         olds had a secondary degree, one half o f the rate for the EU15 and well below the
         Lisbon target o f 85 percent (see Figure 5). The rates are lower for girls and for poorer
         regions.

         Inaddition, while the top students inTurkey performwell, the vast majority o fTurkish
         secondary school students perform at the lowest proficiency levels in basic
         competencies and problem solving (see Figure 6). The distribution o f Turkish scores i s
         highly skewed toward the lower levels o f proficiency incomparison to EU and OECD
         countries, which have a normal distribution o f scores. Continuous learning, better jobs,
         andproductivity gains require these kinds of skills.

    0    Participation in higher education i s also low relative to international standards-the
         gross higher education enrollment rate in Turkey was 30 percent in 2004, compared
         with 70 percent inWestern Europe andNorthAmerica.
25.      Education is associated with better labor market outcomes overall; however, well-
educated young people have problems making the transition into the labor market. For the
entire working-age population, participation and employment are positively correlated with
educational attainment. This correlation i s particularly strong for women. While education
matters, data indicate that unemployment i s highfor the well-educated young. Unemployment
rates for people with tertiary education decline significantly at later ages, suggestingthat the
transition from school-to-work i s a protracted one for those who have gone to postsecondary
institutions.

26.     Low levels o f education translate into a workforce with education and skill
deficiencies. According to the recent I C A for Turkey, the Turkish workforce inthe
manufacturing sector has lower levels of education than nearly all comparator countries.
Almost 60 percent of the Turkish workforce inthe manufacturing sector has less thanten
years o f education, compared with 9 percent inBulgaria, 27 percent inVietnam, 33 percent in
Chile, and 40 percent inPoland (see Figure 7). At the present time, the demand for a highly
qualified workforce inTurkey outstrips the capacity o f the education system andthe labor
supply.

27.     Not surprisingly, Turkishfirms view the level o f education and skills inthe workforce
as a significant constraint on operations and growth. One third o f firms inthe ICs rate
education and skills as a major or very severe constraint, more than any o f the comparator
countries except Brazil. Poland and Bulgaria were much lower, each below 20 percent (see
Figure 8).

28.     Turkish firms say they need additional skills from new graduates o f higher education,
showing a mismatch o f skills between those obtained by many students inthe education
systemand those needed inthe private sector. Generic skills, practical experience, language
skills, and computer skills are most often cited. Managers o f firms consistently emphasize the
need for generic skills-social    and communication skills, behavioral skills, and analytical
skills. The lack o f training to acquire practical experience inuniversities and vocational
schools (MYOs), as well as productive internships,i s also a constraint for some firms.
Language skills matter to firms, students, employees and the unemployed, with Englishbeing
the language o f choice for most firms. Computer skills are also critical to firms.

29.     Turkey has the opportunity to gain better skills and better jobs by bringingthe
educational levels and qualifications o f its population up to international norms. Increasing
pre-school enrollments, improving attendance of girls, bringingschool quality and teaching at
all schools up to international standards, raisingparticipationinsecondary schools, equipping
vocational and general secondary school graduates for a more competitive work environment,
expanding and diversifying higher education while improving the quality and relevance o f the
education to the demands o fthe labor market are essential.

30.     The short-term reform strategy supported under CEDPL includes several measuresto
further improve education and skills. Turkishauthorities, basedon detailed studies
explaining the causes behindthe performance o fthe education system, have designed a
program o f reform that i s expected to be implemented inthe medium term. This program,
adopted as part o f the NDP, has two key pillars for education modernization and reform:

                                                                                      Annex IX
                                                                                   Page 12 of 13


    0  Increase the sensitivity o f education to the demand; and


    0   Enhance the educational system.

31,     The NDP emphasizes the need for a lifelong education strategy to ensure individuals
have the skills needed for a changing and developing economy and labor market.
Transformation to a modular and flexible system invocational and technical education is
expected, with vocational training at higher and secondary education levels transformed and
integrated to ensure that all students have the needed skills and competencies. Students will
be educated to have the skills requiredby the labor market. Other issues, including expanding
pre-school education, improving teacher qualifications, reforming the entrance examination
system for university entrance and restructuring universities, are also includedinthe plan.

32.     To help implementthe NDP, several reforms have already begunto be implemented,
including curricula reform and a new Vocational Qualification Authority:

    0   Curricula reform has begunat the secondary level buildingon comprehensive curricula
        reform in basic education. Curricula for five programs -Turkish literature, grammar,

        competencies. The new curricula, implemented for all students inthe gth-lothgrade in
        geography, mathematics, and ICT - have been reformed to reflect needed skills and

        the 2006-2007 school year, will help to support the skills and competencies needed by
        Turkishstudents.

    0   The Vocational Qualification Authority Law was approved in October 2006 to link
        education and qualifications intechnical and vocational fields with occupational needs
        and standards.     The new law will establish and carry out the new national
        qualifications system to comply with the principles adopted the EU. Certificates o f
        competency developedthroughthis process will be recognized inthe EU.


33.     A longer-termreform strategy could include further measuresto strengthen Turkey's
educational system. The expectation i s that reforms laid out inthe NDP will be further
developed and implementedbuilding on the specific actions implemented so far.

34.     Regarding specific actions, continuation and expansion o f curricula reform and
implementationo f the new Vocational Qualification Authority will be underwayand will
continue. At the end o f the process the following actions could have beentaken-laying    a
strong foundation for improvingthe quality o f secondary and vocational education and
training:

    0   Revisedcurricula for the five programscould have been implemented for all students
        ingrades 9 through 12inthe 2008-2009 school year.
        Curricula will have been revised in a number o f additional secondary and vocational
       areas. Revisedcurricula in five programs for general secondary education and 18 areas
       for vocational secondary education will have been developed and im lemented in the
       pilot schools under the Secondary Education Project inthe gthand lot grades. Efforts
                                                                               R
       to assess the effects o f revisedcurricula will be underway.

                                                                                     Annex IX
                                                                                  Page 13 of 13


   0   The Vocational Qualification Authority will be up and running. Regulations will have
       been issued and the institutional structures will have been established along with a
       satisfactory staff structure and staff training. The Vocational Qualification Authority
       will have reviewed and approved standards for 300 occupations developed under
       previous projects and will have developed certification requirements for these
       occupations. The content of the programs and vocational technical modules will have
       been revised as needed.


35.    These measures inthe education area will lead to improved education and improved
learningoutcomes, with better links to needs o f the private sector.
