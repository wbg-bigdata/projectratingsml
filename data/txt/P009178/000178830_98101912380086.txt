CHAPTER I
THE POWER AND ENERGY SECTOR
A. Yugoslavia's Energy Sector
Energy Resources
1.01      Yugoslavia's primary energy resources consist of large coal and
lignite deposits, a substantial hydropower potential and some liquid hydro-
carbons. Most of these resources are located in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia,
Kosovo and Serbia. In addition, there are uranium deposits currently being
developed and oil bearing shales that could be developed for future use.
Indications of geothermal sources of energy exist also, but their potential
has not yet been determined.
1.02      The coal reserves (approximately 22 billion tons) are equivalent
to several hundred years supply at present consumption rates (35-40 million
tons/a). However coal export is uneconomical because most of it is of
inferior quality. Its worth to the economy would be reflected in the value
of future electricity it could generate. Although the hydropower potential
remaining to be developed is substantial (35,000 GWh/a), only part of it
(20,000-25,000 GWh/a) represents a viable alternative for generating elec-
tricity. The rest is unsuitable for development because the sites are either
located in densely populated valleys or in small catchment areas.
1.03      Yugoslavia's proven oil reserves (45 Mt by present estimates) repre-
sent 11 years of supply at the current level of production (4.0 Mt) while
proven reserves of natural gas (47 Gm3) are sufficient to meet the demand
for about 30 years at the current consumption rate (1.7 Gm3Ia). In addition,
uranium reserves (9,000-20,000 t) could fuel between 1,500-3,300 MW of new
generating capacity for 30 years in the future.
Organization of the Energy Sector
1.04      The energy sector, similar to other sectors, follows the Yugoslav
principle of workers' management of independent enterprises. Each enterprise
is responsible for its development and theoretically its own financial viabil-
ity. However, because of the particular importance of the energy sector, the
Federal and regional goverrnments control fuel and electricity prices while
providing general guidelines for the future development of the sector.
1.05      The main Federal Government agency dealing with energy is the Federal
Committee for Energy and Industry (FCEI).  FCEI is a branch of the Federal
Executive Council and is responsible for the formulation of the overall policy
of the sector. FCEI is not: responsible for detailed implementation policies,
(these are covered by self--management agreements). It has two principal
roles: (a) to ensure cooperation between the various organizations of asso-
ciated labor involved in the formulation of self-management agreements, and



-2-
(b) to ensure that social agreements are formulated and are applied satis-
factorily. FCEI is not the sole Federal agency dealing with eAergy, the
Federal Secretariat for Markets and Prices (FSMP) is involved in the
monitoring of energy prices and the Federal Trade Committee is concerned
with international trade in energy.
Past Growth of Energy Consumption
1.06      Since 1966 demand for primary energy grew at an average annual rate
of 8% as compared to the GNP's annual rate of growth of 6.6% over the same
period. Of all the energy resources, hydrocarbons experienced the highest
rates of growth (oil 16%/a and gas 18%/a). In addition, hydropower production
has increased over the same period at an annual average rate of 7%; its growth
having been hampered by a shortage of funds for new investment. Coal produc-
tion experienced the lowest rate of growth (1.3%/a) mainly because of its poor
quality.
Future Growth of Energy Production
1.07      The 1976-1980 national economic plan forecasts the demand for pri-
mary energy to grow at an average annual rate of 9%. This is despite the con-
servation ethic currently being pursued by the Government at both the republic
and the federal levels. Since Yugoslavia is dependent on imports for 72% of
its petroleum supplies, it was severely hit by the increase in the price of
oil during 1973 and 1974. The imports of petroleum products accounted for 6%
of total imports of goods in 1972 and increased to 12% in 1976. In order to
decrease the impact of oil imports on its economy, the current energy develop-
ment plan calls for substantial increases in coal production (30 to 40 Mt/a)
mostly for use in power generation. More rapid development of hydropower
potential is also planned. Both options represent more viable economic
alternatives to importing oil because of the prevailing price level of petro-
leum products. In addition, by 1980 the Federal Government intends gradually
to re-structure the prices of all domestic energy resources to reflect their
respective international prices. The domestic energy development plan aims at
reducing the impact on the economy of future increases in oil prices, while
the energy pricing policy is aimed at more efficient use and allocation of
energy resources in the economy.
B. Yugoslavia's Power Sub-sector
Organization
1.08      Within each of the six republics, power stations, transmission and
distribution organizations are operated by basic organizations of associated
labor (BOALs) which follow the Yugoslav principle of workers' self management.
BOALs with common interest within a geographic area, have become associated in
work organizations which in turn have formed a single composite organization
for the power sub-sector in most of the republics. All these organizations
are members of JUGEL, the Union of the Yugoslav Electric Power Industry. The
organization of the power industry is more fully described in the June 1977



-3-
appraisal report for the Second Power Transmission loan (No. 1472b-YU). How-
ever, changes are continuing and are intended further to strengthen the coor-
dination of the sector in each republic, especially between the generation/
transmission organizations and those concerned with distribution. In addition,
the communities of interesl (see para 1.21) in the power sector are now exer-
cising their regulatory functions with producers and consumers of electricity
while the respective repub:Lican government authorities decrease their role.
Generation and Transmission Facilities
1O9      The present power system is the result of the post 1945 development
efforts. In 1939, the installed generating capacity was 500 MW and power
production was 1,200 GWh. By 1976, installed capacity and production were
approximately 10,600 MW and 48,000 GWh respectively. For the past twenty
years, the contribution to the total output from hydro and thermal sources
has been approximately equal. However, in the future, as coal resources are
developed, thermal energy will progressively predominate. The historical
growth of the system has been uneven among republics, where of the total
installed capacity 43% is in Serbia, 20% in Croatia, 17% in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
12%/ in Slovenia, 5% in Macedonia and 3% in Montenegro. The difference in the
growth rates reflects the different primary resource endowments of each
republic.
1.10      The transmission system has expanded parallel to the expansion of
generating capacity from about 2,900 km of 110-kV lines in 1955 to about
16,847 km of combined 110-lcV, 220-kV and 380-kV lines in 1976. However, at
present, the network's technical performance (reliability, stability and volt-
age conditions) is strained because several essential lines have reached uC
are rapidly reaching their capacity limitation. In addition, the dispatch
facilities of individual republics are inadequate for the overall efficient
operation of the networks, especially under emergency conditions. System
dispatching is being addressed under the Second Power Transmission loan (No.
1469-YU) as also the extension and strengthening of the 380-kV system.
1.11      The performance of the Yugoslavia power system has been steadily
improving over the years. JUGEL's compiled data demonstrates that in thermal
generation the fuel consumption per kWh has decreased from 4,120 kcal/kWh in
1960 to 2,720 kcal/kWh in 1975. The improved efficiency is principally attri-
buted to installation of successively larger units. Manpower efficiency has
been maintained at 2.0 men/MW for thermal plants and 0.9 men/MW for hydro
facilities which is in the range of efficient power utility norms. The system
load factor improved from 51% in 1965 to 69% in 1977.
1.12      Because of the decentralized socio-economic system in Yugoslavia,
the power sub-sector grew on the basis of development plans prepared for each
republic; the objective of these plans being the satisfaction of the power
demand of the republic at the least cost. However, because of the accelerated
rate of growth of demand for electricity and the concentration of primary
energy endowment in a few republics (Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovenia),
cooperation and exchange of power between republics is increasing. This is
substantiated by the participation of all the republics in the construction of



-4-
both phases of the 380-kV transmission network which will be used to transmit
power from power surplus to the power deficit republics. The Bank has partic-
ipated in the financing of both phases I and II of this network (loans 836 and
1469-YU).
1.13      In attempting to adhere to the least-cost alternatives in developing
the system while maintaining their independence, republics with scarce primary
energy resources have participated in co-financing large generating facilities
in those republics with abundant energy resources. The nuclear plant at Krsko
is an example of shared generating plants between Croatia and Slovenia. The
joint ownership of generating facilities is a way of achieving cost minimiza-
tion through economies of scale and reduction in primary energy transportation
costs while at the same time preserving the sovereignty of each republic over
its system.
1.14      As a result of the inter-republic ownership of facilities and the
growth of the high tension (380-kV) transmission network, the pursuit by each
republic of a separate least-cost power system development program should not
be significantly different from a similar program carried out for all of
Yugoslavia. The difference would arise from the postponement or the advance-
ment of marginal plants whose impact on system costs will tend to cancel out
over a long-term planning period. However, although the Bank has accepted the
unique setting of the Yugoslav power system, it has insisted (loan 1469-YU)
that a least-cost development study, currently being conducted, produce an
investment program for the whole system. This would be in addition to the
individual republican programs. A national program it was felt, would at
least give JUGEL a measure of the additional cost of following a development
program at the republic rather than the national level.
Tariff Structure
1.15      The present bulk tariff structure (Table 1.1, page 1) which applies
throughout the country was introduced in 1965. Periodically new maximum per-
mitted levels, reached through agreement between the Republics, are published
in the Federal Gazette. Any republic may apply lower rates through its com-
munities of interest but in practice the maximum rates are usually sought.
The rates are differentiated with respect to voltage levels, season and time
of day and allow two options (step 1 and 2) for selection by the consumer.
The differences between them is that the second step has a lower kW rate than
the first, but a higher kWh rate; they were introduced to allow for differences
in the pattern of consumer usage. Recently a consensus was reached between
the power producers to remove the second step at the bulk level. This change
has been made in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The structure of the distribution tariff
(Table 1.1, page 2) is similar to that of the bulk tariffs with the exception
that the second step is still being applied. The tariffs do not reflect the
pattern of consumer demand nor the current costs of supply. A tariff study
which includes, at the Bank's request an analysis of the divergence of the
existing rate structure from marginal costs, is being conducted for all
republics by the Croatian Electricity Institute in Zagreb under JUGEL's
supervision. The results of this study are expected to be submitted by JUGEL
to the Bank for comment by June 30, 1978 (para 1.20).



-5-
Bank's Role in the Power Sub-sector
1.16      The Bank's role and past experience can be divided into two stages
separated by Yugoslavia's progression to the present system of decentralization
and self-management.  The fi.rst, comprising loan 277-YU (US$30 million) for
the 266-MW SENJ hydro plant made in 1961 and loan 318-YU (US$30 million) for
the 3604MW Bajina Basta hydro plant made in 1962, served to help finance the
foreign exchange cost of projects planned to meet the rapid growth of indus-
trial consumption. The second comprised loan 836-YU (US$70 million) for the
development of the first phase of the 380-kV transmission grid and its suc-
cessor loan 1469-YU (US$80 million) for the second phase. Both have a strong
institution-building objectiLve whereby the study, recommendation and imple-
mentation of institutional methods and practices are being undertaken by all
the republics and autonomous provinces with the assistance of consultants.
The two hydro plants were completed in 1969 and are operating satisfactorily.
The transmission system Stage I development and management studies which were
the subjects of loan 836-YU were delayed in starting due in large measure to
the difficulties of getting agreement between the 12 constituent borrowing
organizations existing at that time. Project costs rose some 84% above
estimates due to the rapid escalation of prices over the period of delay and
subsequent project execution. Long delays in the appointment of management
consultants set back the Bank's institution-building objectives, but support
for these studies and their aims has grown progressively and will be tested
during the implementation st:ages which commenced late in 1977. Coordination
problems experienced under t:he First Power Transmission Project between JUGEL
and the republics and poor reporting on project progress are expected to be
reduced by the recent strengthening of the Project unit staff and the adoption
of detailed coordination guiLdelines for the Second Power Transmission Projzzit.
However, dates for appointment of consultants for dispatch and for additional
management studies are likely to be postponed due to time taken to review
results under Phase I.
117      In addition to the four loans for power, the Bank conducted a review
of energy sector planning and policies in November 1975. Recommendations were
made for strengthening sector coordination particularly with respect to plan-
ning of sector development and the dispatch facilities. The need for a least-
cost development study, national tariff review were reiterated and an energy
bank was proposed. The two studies are already well advanced and a proposed
bank may be established in a different form through cooperation between
republican internal banks which are being established in the power sector of
each republic. In October 1974 the Bank appraised the Buk Bijela hydropower
project located on the Drina river in BiH and although a loan was approved, it
failed to become effective (lue to an inter-republican riparian dispute over
the use of the Drina river basin waters which arose subsequent to the Bank's
appraisal and consideration of the loan by the Board. This dispute is still
not settled and the Buk Bijela project has for the time being been deleted
from the BiH investment plan.
1.18      So far no operations evaluation reports have been prepared for Bank
operations in the power secl:or in Yugoslavia. The first evaluation report
would be due for the First Power Transmission loan late in 1979.

1.19      In the frame of the loans for the first and second stages of the
transmission grid development, loans 836 and 1469-YU, comprehensive studies
have been prompted and financed by the Bank. The terms of reference for the
studies covered the following aspects:
(i) Interconnected system planning and operation.
(ii) Investigation of transient over-voltages on the 380-kV
transmission network.
(iii)  Interconnection of the Yugoslav electric power system with
the power systems of the neighboring countries and possi-
bilities of parallel operation.
(iv) Technical studies regarding the progressive establishment
of the power network and operation instructions.
(v) Organization of the electric power sector.
(vi) Management information systems comprising financial
planning and control, cost accounting, decision-making
machinery, commercial and tariff policies.
1.20      Although the consultants for this work were appointed very late in
the first transmission project implementation period, they have completed
their studies and recommendations and these have been reviewed by JUGEL
through workshops organized by the consultants. Plans for implementation are
in the course of development and these will span in some cases at least five
years of work. For example, recommendations for management information sys-
tems involve the introduction of uniform accounting and reporting systems
in all power sector organizations using computers; clearly a long-range task.
Training of key personnel in Yugoslavia and abroad is being given due atten-
tion by the consultants. In order to avoid disorganization during the imple-
mentation of the far reaching changes recommended by the consultants, a longer
than normal period would be required. Independent of the Bank financed
studies, JUGEL with Bank encouragement has commissioned Yugoslav consultants
to prepare a least-cost development program for the country (para. 1.14) and
proposals for tariffs based on marginal cost pricing principles (para. 1.15)
using terms of reference made available by the Bank. Recommendations aris-
ing from these studies are to be discussed with the Bank after June 30,
1978.
C. The Power Sub-sector in Bosnia-Herzegovina
Organization of the Borrower
1.21      The Borrower for the proposed Project would be the composite orga-
nization Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine (EBH), Sarajevo. At the time of



_ 7-
the Buk Bijela appraisal (Report No. 650a-YU) the Bosnia-Herzegovina power
sector had just been re-organized into 17 basic organizations of associated
labor (BOALs) associated in Elektroprivreda as a work organization. The
changes, aimed at strengthening the self-management system in Yugoslavia
under the 1974 constitution, are continuing. Communities of interest have
been established to coordinate the interests of producers and consumers of
electricity and to resolve issues relating to coordination of development
plans, conditions of supply and electricity rates at the levels of the basic
organizations and the republic.
1.22      Further changes evolved in 1977 when the BOALs for generation,
transmission and distribution became associated into 13 new work organiza-
tions. These work organizations are coordinating their activities through
the composite organization EBH which assumed the obligations and functions of
the former work organization. EBH had previously been concerned only with the
generation and transmission. BOALs while Elektrodistribucija had been created
for similar reasons by the distribution BOALs. The present organization
structure of the Bosnia-Herzegovina power sector is shown in Fig. 1.1. No
major changes in the staffing or management of EBH have taken place under
the latest re-organization. As of mid-1977 total staff numbered about 9,800.
1.23      EBH was re-established effective April 1, 1977 as a composite
organization under a new self-management agreement dated March 29, 1977.
A new statute has been enacted also. EBH's main functions are:
(i) production, transmission and distribution of electric power;
(ii)  purchasing and selling of electric power;
(iii) study, research, design and construction of electric power
plants and facilities for transmission and distribution.
1h24      Under the new int:ernal organization, EBH is expected to establish
rn internal bank and an institute for studies and research in addition to the
existing work unit providing services to its member organizations. The former
are in the course of formation. The purpose of the internal bank is to keep
account of the free funds (business funds and depreciation) of its member
organizations which will be pooled with EBH and subsequently made available
for new construction in the power sector. Presently all the work organiza-
tions (WOALs) are utilizing their free funds for their own construction needs
but this position will change as the plants are commissioned and begin to
produce revenues. The internal bank will also manage the pooled funds arising
from surcharges on consumers and taxes on industry which are distributed to
investor organizations in the sector either as contributions or loans.
1.25      The latest organizational changes are expected further to strengthen
the planning and coordination of the power sub-sector of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Once the current changes are completed, the processes of adapting the sector
in Bosnia-Herzegovina to meet the provisions of the 1974 constitution will
largely have been completed.



-8-
Management
1.26      Responsibility for the work of the composite organization is in the
hands of a business board comprising a chairman, a deputy chairman and three
members all appointed for a four-year term. This board in effect carries
out the functions of the general manager. A general manager is no longer
appointed. The business board reports to an executive board of the worker's
council, and the worker's council to the community of interest. Although the
republic's highest governmental institutions, the executive council and the
assembly of the republic, continue to play a role in the formulation of eco-
nomic and development policy, much of their powers and functions have been
assumed by the communities of interest and the organizations of associated
labor. These changes pose no special problems to the Bank.
Training
1.27      EBH is required under its self-management agreement to prepare a
long-term training and manpower planning program. At present, most training
is undertaken by the BOALs. In the future, training is expected to be coor-
dinated through the business and executive boards of EBH. EBH has agreed to
submit by December 31, 1978 its proposed training and manpower development
program to the Bank for review and comment before implementation. The purpose
of the Bank's review would be to ensure that the program would provide a
sufficient number of adequately trained staff for the new power plants and
facilities being constructed under the current 5-year plan.
Existing Systems and Development in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH)
1.28      The installed plant in BiH in 1977 was 1,618 MW which represents 15%
of Yugoslavia's total installed capacity in that year. This plant contributed
8,263 GWh or 20% of all Yugoslav generation. Of this contribution, 23% was
exported to Slovenia and Croatia from jointly owned plants (see Table 1.2).
The growth of BiH's internal power consumption is strongly influenced by the
prospect of establishing an aluminum smelter at Mostar, which was to have com-
menced production in 1979 reaching full output by the end 1980. However, one
year's slippage has been assumed for the purpose of this appraisal since nego-
tiations of an acceptable tariff for the sale of power to the smelter are not
likely to be concluded in the near future. The industry is looking for an
average electricity price of some Din 0.23/kWh whereas the incremental cost of
supply is in excess of Din 0.60/kWh if the exacting conditions for security of
supply required for such plants 1/ are taken into account. The decision to
establish an aluminum smelter is, however, a governmental one. The load
growth of BiH's consumers has been assumed to follow a mean trend of 10% per
annum which is conservative considering that in recent years a 12% growth has
been experienced.
1/   An aluminum smelter's load is so steady and continuous that supply plant
cannot be shared with other consumers through diversity. It can tolerate
only very brief power supply interruptions. Duplicate power supply instal-
lations are therefore needed to ensure an acceptably low risk of supply
failure relative to the smelter damage which would otherwise be sustained.



- 9 -
1.29      The 1977-83 development program of EBH is shown in Table 1.3.  Its
cost will be about Din 39 billion (US$2.2 billion). About 60% of the program
is for the construction of generation plant while about 40% is for transmission
and distribution expansion. The generation program comprises eleven projects
of which six are thermal plants and five are hydro. Construction has commenced
on all projects except for the thermal plants known as Tuzla V and Tuzla B,
the Mostar hydro and an unidentified hydro project which would be constructed
beginning in 1983. All the thermal plants will use coal or lignite as fuel.
1.30      Because EBH has been established as a composite organization only
recently, operational statistical data have not yet been consolidated and are
scant. As the preparation of meaningful operational data would be desirable,
EBH has agreed to furnish statistical data and monitoring information annually
in progress reports for the Project in accordance with the list in Table 1.4.
In view of the lack of historical data, no meaningful monitoring targets can
be set. However, during supervision the matter would be reviewed regularly in
order to establish targets in cooperation with EBH.
Tariff Levels
1.31      There were no changes in the level of tariff rates between 1965 and
1970. Since then, bulk and distribution rates have been increased annually.
In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the increases have gradually been reduced each year
as the impact of inflation following the energy crisis in 1973-74 subsided.
Thus tariffs were increased 30% in 1974, 20% in 1975, 18% in 1976 and 12%
in 1977. Generally, these increases have been in line with increases in the
cost of living index. In addition, surcharges are being collected by distri-
bution organizations from consumers to assist financing of investments in the
power sector during the period 1976 through 1980. Future increases in rates
are expected to be sufficient to cover increases in operating costs. Moreover,
the surcharges are being increased by about 50% to help finance the current
investment program. The increased surcharges are expected to become effective
by about mid-1978, and provide an additional Din 400 million through 1980.
The ProjectEtity
1.32      Responsibility for constructing the Project belongs to the Neretva
work organization created under the re-organization of EBH for the coordina-
tion of the BOALs for operation and maintenance of hydro-plants Rama and
Jablanica which were built about 1948. Neretva also has a BOAL responsible
for providing maintenance services to its hydro plants. It has a staff of
about 440 and its management and staff are experienced and well qualified.
Neretva is in the process of establishing its offices in Mostar. Site offices
for construction staff of Salakovac and Grabovica were completed about 2 years
ago.
1.33      Neretva has its own self-management agreement and statutes.  The
output from its two existing plants, Rama and Jablanica, with installed plant
of 160 MW and 144 MW delivering 730 GWh and 790 GWh respectively in an average



- 10 -
year, is sold through EBH at the agreed prices established in the self-
management agreement between the BOALs within EBH. It has its own funds
(secured through its BOALs), some of which have been earmarked for the Proj-
ect. The external funds required for Neretva's investment program will be
arranged by EBH, with the assistance of Privredna Bank of Sarajevo.
1.34      The Bank loan would be made available by EBH to Neretva.  Neretva
would be responsible for debt service and the foreign exchange risk. The Bank
would sign a Project agreement with Neretva.

CHAPTER II
THE PROJECT
2.01      The Project was i-irst studied in 1974 in the context of 12 projects
submitted to the Bank by the various republics for financing and from which
four were selected for a project identification mission, including the Middle
Neretva Hydro Project. In May 1977, a mission visited Yugoslavia to identify
a suitable project in one of the less developed regions.
2.02      Because of the considerable investment in thermal plant for which
financing has been relatively easy to obtain, the development of Yugoslavia's
second largest indigenous energy source, hydro, has been lagging.  In view
of the difficulties of obtaining financing for hydro plant (due to the prepon-
derance of the local cost component of civil works for which financing is more
difficult to obtain) and in. order to assist in improving the plant mix, a
hydropower project is appropriate for Bank financing.
2.03      Detailed information was provided by the "Financial and Technical
Report on Salakovac and Grabovica Hydroelectric Power Stations" dated February
1977 prepared by Elektroprivreda, Sarajevo, with the assistance of their con-
sultants, Energoinvest, Sarajevo.    A report entitled "Economic and Energy
Feasibility of the Realization of the Project - Sredjna Neretva" dated August
1977 was presented by EBH for the Bank's consideration as a basis for appraisal.
A mission to appraise the project visited Bosnia-Herzegovina during October
1977 and at that time received a further document entitled "Engineering and
Technical Parameters" dated September 1977.  In addition, in response to the
appraisal mission's request, a study was undertaken confirming the correctness
of the decision to instal the third unit at the Salakovac station and the
Mostar re-regulating power station required to smooth the high and intermit-
tent water discharges occasioned during peaking operation of the upstream
plants. This study was completed and received by the Bank in November 1977.
There are also other studies notably those concerning the geology of the area
and dam sites, and the ecology and human environment likely to be disturbed or
enhanced by the Project works.
Description of the Project
2.04      The Neretva River lies wholly within the boundaries of the republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina except for the last 20 km before it discharges into the
Adriatic (Map No. IBRD-13296). Nine power plants are expected to be developed
ultimately. Of these, two already exist in the upper reaches, namely, Rama
and Jablanica, utilizing 40% of the river's hydro potential. The project
works, more specifically described in para 2.09, would develop that part of the
river immediately downstreamn of Jablanica and above the town of Mostar. The
development studies of the river have been evolved over a period of some 24
years and by 1976 had reached a stage at which they were ready for the imple-
mentation of the Grabovica ind Salakovac schemes, the proposed Project, which
will utilize a further 23.5% of the river's hydro potential. The Project is
designed to contribute to the system peaking capacity and in order to gain the



- X8 -
optimum output from the plant. it is necessary to re-regulate the river flow
vaich will be achi eved by the 65-MW4 IIostar scheme, downstream of Salakovac.
Thus, the Project comprises the station Grabovica, the station Salakovac
downstream of Grabovica, and the Mostar plant.  Allthough the Mostar plant is
part of the project description because it provides for essential re-regula-
tion of the river, it is not proposed to be financed by the Bank since its
construction will not be started until i979.  However, in the economic justi-
ficat!ron of the Project, the cost and benefits associated withk Mostar are
included in the calcuLation of the return on 4nvestment (para 4.05).  The
completsionr of firm engineering plans supported by geological studies and
capital estimates for the Mostar station zonfirming its feasibility is a
coadition of effectiveness of the loan.
Ecological and Environmental Aspects
2L05      A study of the ecological and environmental aspects of the region
has been undertaken by a team of Yugoslav experts over a period of two years.
Tkie terms of reference for this study embraced town planning, resource utili-
zation including water and land  cultural and historic sites and their preser-
vation, improvements to the communications system in the area, influences on
the flora, fauna and fish life of the Project area, population movement,
recreational facilities and possibilities for the tourist industry. The study
has made positive recommendations on all these aspects and the recommendations
have been incorporated into the plans for the region. Thus, cultural monu-
ments were categorized as either endangered by the Project or partially
endangered: those to be flooded comprising such things as an old Turkish
bridge, an old water mill, archeological sites, a Catholic cemetery, other
medieval cemeteries and an old house being an example of village architecture,
will be aesthetically relocated whilst the partially endangered will be so
treated as to reduce the danger to acceptable levels at least no worse than
prior to Project development. Regarding the Neretva river's fish population,
there has been a long-standing association with experts from the Colorado
State University at Fort Collins, USA, and this is continuing through the
preparation of plans to preserve fishing resources. The experience gained
over 25 years since the immediately upstream hydro plant Jablanica has been
in service, has shown that the trout and salmonite fish which need highly
oxygenated water and a clean river bed, have successfully migrated to the
tributaries of the storage lake whilst new species including introduced
Californian trout have established themselves in the still, low oxygen,
storage waters. Since Jablanica has not been provided with fish ladders for
migratory fish, it is not proposed to provide these in the downstream power
developments. This is an acceptable situation.
2.06      Arising out of the ecological studies it was recognized that agri-
cultural productivity could be improved and a scheme has been developed for
abstracting water from the Salakovac reservoir at a maximum rate of 4 m3/sec
for both irrigation and municipal water supplies as required. Such a rate
even if applied constantly would reduce the average annual river flow at this
point by 2% and is not a significant factor from a power generation stand-
point.



- 19 -
2.07      The concept of the hydro development of the Neretva river has been
evolving over the last 24 years and the hazards of the geological conditions
associated with karstic formations are well known.  Geological investigations
have been extensive, but uncertainties are more difficult to reduce in karstic
conditions than in others and are never completely eliminated. The Borrower
and the executing agency have agreed to establish a panel of experts indepen-
dent of the designers of the proJect to familiarize themselves with the design
and to advise in the event of unforeseen problems arising during construction.
The panel may consist only of two individuals: a civil engineer having expe-
rience with similar dams and an engineering geologist experienced in karstic
rocks. The establishment of such a panel of experts whose qualifications,
experience and terms and ccnditions of employment are to be acceptable to the
Bank, is a condition of loan effectiveness. Apart from the investigation of
numerous alternative dam sites, each chosen site has been carefully investi-
gated by adits, drilling, seismic, geoelectric, permeability and other methods
by the consultants, Energoinvest. Underground water flow paths were investi-
gated by dye and radioactive tracers. It can be said that the site investig-
ations have been thorough although in karstic conditions such as are found at
the site, some degree of uncertainty always remains.
2.08      The hydraulic designs of the Grabovica and Salakovac stations have
been subjected to model tests in the laboratory of the Jaroslav Cerni Institute
in Belgrade, and are based on stream flow records extending over 40 years. An
estimate of the 10,000 year flood 1/ flow has been derived from these records
and is acceptable in view of the storage already existing at the upstream
stations of Rama and Jablanica.
Technical Characteristics
2.09      The Project comprises three hydro power stations in cascade having
the following characteristics. The Grabovica scheme has a concrete gravity
dam 60 m high from its foundation, impounding 19.77 Mm3 of which 5.43 Mm3 is
useful storage derived from a mean river flow (40 year record) of 136 m3/s.
The spill capacity is 2 x 1,080 m3/s in addition to the available full load
discharge of 190 m3/s for each of two Kaplan turbines rated at 58 MW. The
10,000 year flood is estimated to be of the order of 2,440 m3/s. The mean
annual energy generated will be 346 GWh in 3,020 hrs of operation. The
Salakovac scheme comprises a concrete gravity dam 70 m high from its founda-
tion, impounding 68.0 Mm3 cof which 15.6 Mm3 is useful storage derived from a
mean river flow (40 year record) of 182.7 m3/s.  The spill capacity is 2,450
m3/s in addition to the available full load discharge of 180 m3/s for each of
three Kaplan turbines rated at 68.5 MW.  The 10,000 year flood is estimated to
be of the order of 2,900 m3/s. The mean annual energy generated will be 580
GWh in 2,890 hrs of operation.  The Mostar scheme comprises a concrete gravity
dam impounding about 11 Mm3 with a regulating discharge through three 21.5-MW
1/   The statistically derived estimate of the flood flow having a probability
of occurrence once in 10,000 years.



- 20 -
turbines each having a full load discharge capacity of 120 m3/s. The mean
annual river flow (40 year record) is 195 m3/s. In an average water year, the
station is expected to produce 293 GWh. All three stations will be connected
to the existing transmission system by short interconnecting lines at 220 kV
and associated substations.
Project Costs
2.10      The cost of development of the Grabovica and Salakovac stations
(para. 2.12) estimated by Elektroprivreda's consultants is based on September
1976 unit prices adjusted during appraisal to reflect price levels in mid-
1978. Expenditures to mid-1978 are considered as sunk costs and do not
require provision of contingency allowances either as to price or physical.
Thereafter rates to cover price contingencies have been allowed as follows:
1978     1979      1980     1981      1982
Civil works                           9%      8-1/2%       8%      8%         8%
Equipment, erection                  11%    10-1/2%       10%     10%        10%
and supervision
2.11      These escalation rates are considered to reflect the conditions in
Yugoslavia over the period concerned and are based on historical cost trends
which distinguish between civil construction trends and other industry. In
view of the relatively short and easy excavation work for river diversion
tunnels and the well defined and simple dam structures, physical contingencies
for local costs of civil works have been allowed at 10% of base line cost and
are considered adequate. Uncertainties as to the amount of grouting that will
be needed have been provided for by assuming that all sections of the grouting
work will need grout quantities equivalent to the highest grout demands
indicated by the exploratory tests carried out (see also para 2.22). By
making this assumption, recognition is given to the possibility that the tests
may not in fact have revealed the worst conditions. An element of physical
contingency is therefore included in the base cost which cannot be isolated,
and a further contingency on this, to the extent of the 10% base line figure
previously mentioned, is included. Equipment, including erection and other
costs (compensation, site supervision and engineering), has been given a
5% physical contingency on local expenditures. The local cost estimate
includes the 60% local cost component of such plant and equipment for which
the foreign cost component has been assessed at 40% of its ex-factory value.
The cost of installing the equipment has a 5% physical contingency. The
foreign cost component of the estimate consists principally of the value of
the turbines which have been assumed to be of foreign supply and which, by
virtue of their very precise definition of scope from draft tube to generator
coupling, should not be liable to further physical contingency allowance.
The other foreign costs comprise civil contracting machines, reinforcing steel
and the estimated. 40% foreign cost component of equipment made in Yugoslavia.
Since these items are themselves estimates, which already contain an
element of contingency, it is not realistic to allow a further physical



- 21 -
contingency. Nonetheless, a small physical contingency has been allowed
for minor items, such as erection tools and the like which may be needed.

/2   Sunk costs to mid-1978 are Dinars 886.4 millions (US$49.2 million).
2.13      The foreign cost estimate for Phase I has been based on the follow-
ing assumptions:
(i) US$4.5 million will be spent on direct importation of civil
construction equipment by the civil contractors,



- 22 -
(ii)  a further US$4.5 million representing the foreign exchange cost
of imported reinforcing steel will be required principally for
the dam structures,
(iii)  equipment manufactured in Yugoslavia will have an average
foreign cost content of about 40%, and
(iv)  with the exception of the supply of the Kaplan turbines, all
bids put to international competition will most likely be won
by Yugoslav suppliers. This gives rise to an estimated foreign
cost content of about US$73 million which is 25% of the total
cost of US$290.4 million of the works being supported by the
proposed loan.
2.14      The cost of the works for the Mostar power station (Phase II) is
estimated to be US$112.2 million.  The foreign cost component of US$10.5
million is calculated on the same basis as for Salakovac/Grabovica.
Project Financing Plan
2.15      The Project cost excluding interest during construction is expected
to be financed as follows:

2.16      The plan is presented in two phases, phase I - Salakovac/Grabovica -
and phase II - Mostar.  At negotiations, the financing plan for phase I was
confirmed by EBH and Neretva.  Copies of relevant decisions of the workers'



- 23
council and loan agreements were furnished to the Bank.  Own sources of funds
as shown in the table in para. 2.15 would be contributed by the basic organiza-
tions of Neretva from their internally generated funds.  The surcharges have
been allocated by EBH from its pooled funds obtained through the special
measures introduced in 1976 to provide additional funds for financing the
5-year investment plan for the power sector through 1980 (para. 1.31 and
3.08).  Both the previouslLy mentioned Funds take the form of interest-free
contributions and are therefore non-repayable.
2.17      The foreign cred:its and other local bank loans for phase I amounting
to Din 1,284 million (about: US$71 million equivalent) are being sought by EBH
and the Privredna Bank of Sarajevo, the principal bank in BilH which is well
known to the Bank having been the recipient of four previous Bank loans. The
Privredna Bank will furnish its guarantee as a condition of loan effectiveness
(similar to one provided under the Second Power Transmission loan) by which it
will undertake to provide EBH with the balance of funds needed by Neretva to
complete the Salakovac and Grabovica power stations (phase I). This guarantee
would also cover possible cost overruns and the provision of foreign exchange
to meet interest charges on the Bank loan during the construction period
(estimated to be about US$8 million).
2.18      For phase II, EBH and Neretva have undertaken to confirm their inten-
tion to provide Din 900 mi:Llion from Neretva's own sources and EBH's pooled
sources through resolutions of their workers' councils. The Privredna Bank
will guarantee to provide such funds as EBH is unable to secure and are needed
by Neretva to complete phase II of the Project. These assurances are to be
provided as a condition of loan effectiveness and the relevant agreements for
phase II are to be completed by June 30, 1979.
2.19      The proposed Bank loan of US$73 million would cover the estimated
foreign costs of the Salakovac/Grabovica plants. No Bank financing is
presumed for Mostar. It has been assumed that the Bank loan would be made
in accordance with terms cuirrently being applied to other Bank loans in
Yugoslavia, i.e. 15 years :including a 3-year period of grace. Since project
construction is estimated to be completed within 3 years of loan signing,
these terms are suitable. The Bank loan would be signed by EBH who would make
the proceeds available to the Work Organization Neretva on the same terms.
2.20      Own sources of funds which represent the unused business funds and
depreciation provisions of the BOALs, Rama and Jablanica, are expected to
provide 22% of the total Project cost. Although BOALs generating electric
power receive an agreed internal price for power supplied to the system and
are permitted a 4-6% return on revalued net fixed assets (i.e. net income
after appropriations to reserves and the collective consumption funds 1/), the
accumulation of own sources of funds from hydro plants can be influenced by
hydrological conditions. Internal prices may be sufficient to cover costs in
1/   Principally workers' laousing and accommodations.



- 24
poor water years, but may not contribute to the accumulation of unused business
funds. Of course the situation could be reversed in years of plentiful water.
On the other hand, depreciation funds can only be accumulated for financing
new construction after meeting debt service and capital replacement costs.
During the construction period of the Project, the Neretva Work Organization
is projecting to spend Din 262 million of its own sources on replacement of
plant at Jablanica and Din 90 million for a regional dispatch center. These
funds requirements are of course in addition to those required for the Project.
To this extent Neretva would not commit all its own sources of funds exclu-
sively to the Project. These revenue and depreciation fluctuations are no
greater than are encountered by utilities elsewhere when they are dependent
solely on hydro-generation. On the contrary in this case, the internal price
agreement in EBH assures coverage of fixed costs and basic payments to the
workers. With respect to the loans to be arranged which represent about 1/3
of the total funds required for the Project, EBH and the Privredna Bank are
expected to be able to obtain the amounts needed progressively in accordance
with the rate of construction. EBH has already signed foreign loans for Din
653 million (equivalent to about US$36 million). Not all the loans to be
arranged will be obtained from foreign sources, since by law, foreign borrow-
ing by Yugoslav organizations can only be undertaken after lodging a deposit
in local currency with the National Bank. An exception to this provision is
permitted where loans have been obtained from multilateral financial institu-
tions. In this case assuming a Bank loan of $73 million is approved, an
additional amount equivalent to the Bank loan could be borrowed without
lodgment of a dinar deposit with the National Bank. This should be sufficient
to cover necessary foreign borrowings.
Procurement
2.21      Contracts for the civil works which are not being financed by the
Bank, have been let to Yugoslav contractors on the basis of local competitive
bidding and in view of the existing skill and competitiveness of the local
contracting industry demonstrated in international competition elsewhere, this
is an effective and acceptable method of project execution. Work has commenced
and is progressing satisfactorily. The electro-mechanical equipment, including
water control gates, etc., are to be put to international competitive bidding
under the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement in 13 lots valued in aggregate at
about Din 1,575 million equivalent to US$87.5 million. Of these lots, with
minor exceptions, it is expected that due to the competitiveness of the
Yugoslav manufacturing industry, only the supply contract for Kaplan turbines
will be awarded to a non-Yugoslav contractor. The turbines are valued at
about US$35.5 million. Bidding documents for the earlier lots have already
been reviewed by the Bank and bidding is in progress. No advance contracting
or retroactive finance is proposed. An appropriate general advertisement has
appeared in Development Forum, published by the United Nation Organization.

Im lementat ion
2,22      The civil construction works, started in March 1977, have already
progressed to the extent thLat necessary road and rail realignments, access
roads, construction camps as well as river diversion tunnels are mostly com-
plete. Construction supervision for the two sites Grabovica and Salakovac
is by separate site staff coordinated and employed by the Work Organization,
Neretva. This arrangement is proving effective and is acceptable to the Bank.
The consultants for the Project are Energoinvest of Sarajevo who have a
continuing responsibility f'or advice and engineering design through Project
execution and are regularly employed by the Work Organization Neretva.
Neretva would continue to employ consultants satisfactory to the Bank for
the execution of the Project. The fact that the valley of the Neretva has
been formed in karstic formations presents a risk that the dam may be bypassed
and therefore extensive exploratory drilling has been undertaken (para. 2.07).
The design provides for the establishment through grouting procedures of a
barrier against such leakage. A grout curtain was constructed in 1965 in a
trial section of the left bank of the Salakovac dam site and its effectiveness
was checked including driving an adit through the fault zone which gave evi-
dence of the effectiveness of the procedure. It is fortunate that the level
of the Neretva and the proposed storage basins in the relevant reach of the
river are lower than adjoining valleys and leakage to other drainage basins is
therefore most unlikely. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the grout curtain
remains to some degree an element of uncertainty. In these circumstances,
Neretva has agreed to appoint and retain a panel of independent consultants
as mentioned in para. 2.07.. A bar chart showing the proposed timing of the
construction work is shown at Table 2.1 and is realistic. Although the
decision has been taken to construct the Mostar scheme and so provide re-
regulation of the river to enable the Salakovac and other upstream installa-
tions to operate as peaking plants, site investigations are still to be
completed and designs finalized (para. 2.04).
Disbursement
2.23      Disbursement from the proceeds of the loan would be for 100% of the
local and foreign expenditures for items which have been purchased under
international competitive conditions in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement. The expected disbursement schedule is shown in Table 2.2.
The closing date would be June 30, 1982.

CHAPTER II
FINANCE
Introduction
3.01      Since EBH only became a composite organization responsible for
generation, transmission and distribution on April 1, 1977, it has not yet
been required to produce any consolidated financial statements. Thherefore the
Bank, for the purpose of this appraisal, prepared pro-forma statements (Tables
3.1 to 3.2) for the years 1974 through 1976, by consolidating the income
statements and balance sheets for the work organization - EBE which was
responsible for generation and transmission activities with those of the
distribution work organization - Elektrodistribucija. The accounts for both
work organizations have been prepared by consolidating those for each of their
respective associated basic organizations and thus it is probable that some
inter-organization transactions have not been eliminated, especially under
some headings for current and other assets and liabilities. This is not
considered to be a problem because all accounts are normally paid promptly
through the Social Accounting Service (SAS) which processes payments on behalf
of all organizations in Yugoslavia. As can be seen from EBH's balance sheet,
accounts receivable are low; unpaid electricity accounts at the end of 1976
represent less than 20 days' sales. The problem of consolidating accounts has
already been addressed in thne Second Power Transmission loan where provision
has been made for consultants to recommend modified procedures including
elimination of distortions arising from EBH inter-organization transactions
as part of the proposed extension of the management studies to be undertaken
commencing 1978.
Past Performance and Present Position
3.02      In Yugoslavia, electricity prices are not set to provide surplus
funds but principally to cover operating costs including depreciation and
interest on debt. Allocations of funds are also made to reserves and the fund
for provision of workers' accommodation where net income is sufficient. Any
unallocated income is retained in the business fund and may be used for meeting
working capital or new investment needs. Special measures introduced recently,
such as the surcharges (para 1.31) on the sale of electricity, and taxes on
industry help provide the necessary additional funds for financing investments.
3.03      During 1975 and 1976, EBH's operating income (Table 3.1) (not includ-
ing surcharges) has been sufficient to achieve about 4% return on average net
fixed assets in service after revaluation. Each year since 1974, fixed assets
and depreciation have been revalued using coefficients established by the
federal government from its statistics. Rate increases have just been suffi-
cient to meet cost increases. However, the magnitude of the increases has
been declining progressively each year from 30% in 1974 to 12% in 1977, and
the growth of electricity sales including exports to other republics has
fallen from an annual rate of 17% in 1974 to almost zero in 1976.  The main
reason for this trend is that installed generating capacity has not increased

since 1974 and is now fully absorbed. Nevertheless sales to distribution
organizations within the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina have continued a
steady 13% growth since 1973 and as the available capacity has been utilized
exports sales have been reduced correspondingly.  On the other hand, sales to
large industrial consumers have been almost unchanged since 1974.  No new
major industrial loads have been connected to the system in the period 1974-
76, probably due to the depressed state of world markets and the shortage of
funds for constructing new industrial plants, There are at presenit only 3
industrial customers who aria billed directly by EBH namely; Ilijas (iron
works), Gorazde (chemical plant) and Elektrobosna (ferro-silicon), Sales
growth by categories over the last 10 years shows a large increase in sales
to domestic users while the share of exports to other republics has declined.
This trend is illustrated in the following table:

GWh    %      GWh    %
Exports to Other Republics                       1,272   40   2,214   30

32179   00   7,32   100
3.04      EBH's balance sheet shows a sound financial picture.  Following
revaluation of fixed assets and depreciation in 1975 and 1976, the ratio of
debt to equity improved from 38.62 in 1974 to 33:67 in 1976. Gross debt
service at the end of 1976 was covered more than 3 times by internal cash
generation. These statistics suggest that EBH can readily absorb additional
long-term debt for the purposes of financing future expansion. About 30% of
existing long-term debt is repayable over terms ranging from 15-50 years much
of which is at low rates of interest (below 4%). Since 1974 when special
legislation was introduced in BiH to facilitate financing of new investments
in the power sector through 1980, debt service payments on many of the older,
local loans have been deferred and are not expected to be resumed at least
before 1981.
3.05      Gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation have more than
doubled in value since 1973 largely as a result of the revaluations in 1975
and 1976.  The 1975 revaluation was the first since 1971.  In future years,
the law provides for annual revaluation of gross fixed assets and depreciation
whenever there is an increase in prices of at least 10%. Gross fixed assets
now comprise about 70% generation and transmission assets and 30% distribution.
Since 1974, there has been a sharp increase in work in progress reflecting the
construction of new generation plants and of course the 380-kV transmission
system; the latter being partly financed by the Bank under Loans 836 and
1469-YU. The recently commenced generation projects are being financed mostly
on more conventional terms over about 8-15 years with interest rates ranging
from 6-8%.

3.07      The investment program (1977-82) will require about $2.2 billion of
which about one-fifth will go towards construction of the Middle Neretva
Project. About 36% of the funds required for the program will come from
internal sources of the organizations associated in EBH and the balance of 64%
will be borrowed.
3.08      The financing plan for the program is being firmed up.  When the
re-organization of the power sector and the framing of a development program
to 1980 were first initiated in 1974, provision of adequate funds became a key
objective of republican authorities. Special measures have been taken aimed
at increasing sources of funds for the power sector development among which
are:
(a)  temporary measures in effect to end of 1980 to exempt power
sector organizations from income tax and defer debt service
on most local loans;
(b) increased depreciation allowances dependent on usage of
assets; and
(c) surcharges on electricity consumption and loans from indus-
try which are being increased under legislation to be intro-
duced in mid 1978.
3.09      These measures have all contributed to increasing the internal
sources of funds available for financing new investments in the power sector.
However, there is an imbalance in the financing of generation and transmission
investments on the one hand and distribution on the other. EBH's plans show
the distribution program would be financed 66% from internal sources while
only 20% of the generation and transmission program would be financed this
way. This aspect is expected to be addressed by EBH which has agreed in its
initial self-management agreement to study the internal financial relationship,
especially internal prices and costs, between the various generation, trans-
mission and distribution organizations. EBH has agreed to furnish the results
of this study to the Bank on its completion.
3.10      The various borrowings both local and foreign are being arranged
progressively to meet the construction needs of each project. Debt service
payments on local loans arranged within Yugoslavia are normally deferred
until after the project is commissioned which helps to reduce local financing
needs during construction. There is, nevertheless, a shortage of local funds
and for this reason the Republican banks normally either arrange loans or
give guarantees to the investors that a specific amount will be provided for
a project.
3.11      The suppliers' credits for thermal plants in the program have already
been arranged. However, with respect to other foreign loans, EBH has yet to
arrange about $150 million o:E planned foreign borrowing, most of which is
required for the proposed project and the EBH portion of the Second Power
Transmission Project. The power development program has been adopted by the
republic.Officials of the Secretariat for Finance, the Privredna Bank, and the



- 34 
Community of Interest for power have given this commitment the highest priority
and have accepted responsibility for meeting any financing gap. On a project-
by-project basis, the Social Accounting Service (SAS) is required by law to
ensure that no project is commenced within the country without assurances
being furnished to it to establish that sufficient funds have been arranged or
will be forthcoming to complete the project. The commitment of the republic
and the surveillance of the SAS over planned investment in the manner described
is considered to represent adequate assurance that the funds for completion of
the program will be found. There is still the possibility that completion of
certain projects may be delayed because of a shortage of funds.  In fact most
of the projects in the plan are behind the schedule foreseen when the plan was
presented to the Bank during the October 1974 Appraisal of the Buk Bijela
Hydropower Project. With the exception of Mostar and Buk Bijela, all projects
in the original program are now under construction.
Financial Forecasts
3.12      EBH's financial forecasts for the period 1977-83 are included in
Tables 3.1 to 3.3. The assumptions used are shown in Annex 3.1. They show
that EBH would improve its financial performance. Rates of return on revalued
fixed assets are likely to increase from 3.2% in 1978 to 7.4% in 1981 if based
on operating incomes. If these are recalculated after including customer
surcharges and contributions, and depreciation is applied at normal rates
(i.e. at minimum rates averaging 3.7%) as compared with higher rates allowed
(averaging 4.25%) where electricity production assets are used daily for two
or more shifts, the resulting rates of return range from 7% to 10%. These
revised rates of return represent acceptable levels of performance and reflect
more realistically the rates of return likely to be achieved.
3.13      The forecasts assume electricity rate increases of 15% in 1979 and
1980 and 12% thereafter. An increase of 12% has been approved effective April
1, 1978. It is expected that rates will continue to be adjusted annually to
reflect the general level of cost increases in all republics, and Bosnia-
Herzegovina will apply the maximum increases agreed between republics. The
forecasts also assume that any new bulk consumer would not be supplied at
rates below the cost of supply. At negotiations EBH agreed that it will, when
making special supply agreements, charge prices adequately reflecting the
estimated costs of supply and ensure that provision is made for future price
adjustments reflecting any increases in the costs of supply.
3.14      Despite its planned high level of borrowing through 1983, EBH's
ratio of debt to equity would be 36:64 by the end of 1983 compared with 33:67
in 1976. A 36% level of debt to total capitalization would normally be an
indication of financial strength. However, because much of EBH's new debt is
expected to be repayable over terms of 10 years or less, the debt service
coverage is expected to decline sharply from 3.3 in 1977 to 1.5 by 1981. This
suggests that EBH should seek longer-term borrowings. The percentage contribu-
tion to investment expected in the forecast period varies from 30% in 1977 to
33% in 1978 down to 29% in 1979 and then rapidly improves to average 42% for



- 35 _
the 1977-83 period. The improvement may not be sustained as EBH develops its
future program. New project construction, in addition to that already fore-
seen, will probably be commenced in 1982 and 1983 to meet the load growth
after 1983. This would be expected to lower the portion of investment financed
from internal sources in 1982 and 1983. It is recognized, however, that in
keeping with most public utilities which face variable levels of investment,
there will be year-to-year fluctuations in cash generation coverage, and in
those years where a shortfall occurs due to lumpy investment expenditures, the
Bank and EBH could agree to carry any shortfall in one year forward to be
covered by a subsequent year's cash generation.
3.15      Under the existing financial covenant in the Second Power Transmis-
sion loan, agreement was reached with the composite organizations that they
would achieve at least a 30% 1/ level of self-financing of their generation
and transmisson facilities and that they would endeavor to reach a 35% level
as quickly as possible and in any case within a period of five years beginning
with 1978. However, since EBH's functions now include distribution it was
agreed that it would be more appropriate to replace the old covenant by a new
covenant which would adequa:ely cover generation, transmission and distribu-
tion investment and be based on EBH's consolidated accounts. As an adequate
level of performance and to ensure a satisfactory financial position it was
agreed EBH would need revenues sufficient to provide a 35% contribution to
investment after covering operating expenses, taxes and other contributions
provided by law, and debt service. This level of contribution would require
additional revenues of Din 1.6 billion over the period 1978 through 1981 above
that previously assumed by EBH. Therefore, additional revenues are planned
by EBH to be provided by increasing tariffs 15% instead of 12% in 1979 and
1980 as previously planned and through increased surcharges. As under loan
1469-YU EBH would be required to furnish to the Bank, by January 31 of each
year beginning with 1979, a forecast of the investment plan and the operating
statement for the year, setting out the various sources of financing for the
planned investment during that year and the measures, if any, to be taken to
achieve the financial target. The plan would be supported to the extent
applicable by the agreement of the community of interest which has an important
voice in the formulation of the investment plan and its financing. In addi-
tion, it was agreed that EBB. and the Bank would exchange views before making
any modification to the investment program which would result in a cost varia-
tion in excess of Din 1 billion (about $55 million equivalent).
Audit
3.16      Under the Second Power Transmission loan, it was agreed that EBH
would have its consolidated accounts audited by the SAS or other competent
auditors acceptable to the Bank until the composite organizations had arranged
1/   The 30% level of self-financing was considered to include all measures
related to the sales of electricity such as special taxes, connection
charges, customer contributions, surcharges and other levies on customers
which are not repayable.

with the SAS a program for audit of their annual financial statements by the
SAS's special audit group. The special audit group which has been developed
at the Bank's instigation is an expanding section of the staff of the SAS
who have received training in the use of internationally accepted auditing
practices. The program for the conduct of audits by the group was to be for-
mulated by the end of 1977. Accordingly during the appraisal, the Bank dis-
cussed the timing of the introduction of audits by the special audit group of
all composite organizations in the Yugoslav power sector. The SAS undertook
to complete a pilot audit by the special audit group, of a power sector
organization in 1978. It was agreed that it could be for the proposed exe-
cuting agency, the Neretva Work Organization. The pilot audit would consist
of a balance sheet audit for 1977 and a review of accounting policies. In
the following year a full audit would be conducted and extension of these
audits to other power sector organizations would then gradually commence.
The Bank confirmed these arrangements with EBH who agreed to submit audited,
consolidated accounts to the Bank within six months of the end of the year for
1977 and 1978 and within four months of the end of each future year commencing
with 1979. These arrangements are in accord with those foreseen in the Second
Power Transmission loan.
Insurance
3.17      Insurance arrangements within the power sector were reviewed exten-
sively under the Second Power Transmission loan. The types of coverage were
considered appropriate to the risks involved. Recently, a committee repre-
sentative of all power entities throughout Yugoslavia re-negotiated premiums
with the union of republican insurance companies on the basis of past claims
experience which is appropriate.
3.18      The safety and inspection of dams and associated works in BiH is
monitored by the Republican Water Management Authority and the Republican
Secretariat for Housing and Communal Affairs who apply the recommendations of
the International Conference on Large Dams and are responsible to the Execu-
tive Council of the republic. At community level, an additional inspectorate
operates in close association with projects in the region of Mostar, both
during and after construction. Neretva has agreed to arrange periodic inspec-
tions of the Project hydro works, including the dams in accordance with
appropriate engineering practice.

Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
The forecasts have been prepared to include the activities of all
power generation, transmission and distribution organizations in the electric
power sector within Bosnia-Herzegovina. The following assumptions were made:
1.        Electricity Sales
Forecast electricity sales in GWh were obtained from the power
balance table in Table 1.1. Tariff rates were assumed to increase 12% in 1978,
15% in 1979 and 1980, and 12% thereafter thru 1983.
2.        Other Revenues
Other Revenues were forecast to increase 12% each year.
3.        Operating Costs
Operating Costs were based on the average cost per unit sold in
1976 which were:
Salaries and Wages                        9.78 paras/kWh
Other Operating and Maintenance          28.0  paras/kWh
Statutory and Legal Obligations           3.44 paras/kWh
Escalation was then applied at the following rates:  10% in 1977 and 1978, 9%
1979-1981 and 8% for 1982 and 1983.
4.        Interest
Interest on foreign loans and credits was calculated using the
following assumed rates of interest:
IBRD/EIB   8%
USSR Credits   2%
Foreign Suppliers' Credits   7%
Other Foreign Loans   8-1/2%

ANNEX 3.1

5.        For local loans the following rates of interest were assumed:
Federal Fund for IJnderdeveloped Regions   6%
Local Banks   9%
Local Suppliers' Credits   10%
Civil Contractors   6%
Loans from Other Republics   7%
Loans from Industry   6%
6.        Interest was charged to construction at an average rate of 7% up to
the end of the year in which the respective plant was commissioned. No
interest was charged to construction on distribution or transmission works
except for the 380-kV transmission project. On all local loans, it was
assumed that interest would be deferred and accumulated until the end of the
year the plant was commissioned. Thereafter it would be amortized with the
loan.
7.        Gross Fixed Assets
Gross fixed assets were revalued each year at 10%. Plant was assumed
to be commissioned in the year shown in the development program (Table 1.2).
8.        Depreciation
Depreciation provisions were revalued each year at 10%. Annual
allowances for depreciation expenses were calculated at the rate of 4.25%.
This rate assumed continuation of the practice which is provided for under the
depreciation law of accelerating depreciation allocations on assets dependent
on usage, i.e. where fixed assets are used in two or more shifts existing rates
are increased 50%.
9.        Existing rates of depreciation actually being used include:
Dams                               3%     (minimum legal rate 1%)
Other Civil Works                  2.25%  (minimum legal rate 1.5%)
Mechanical Equipment               3.75%  (minimum legal rate 2.5%)
Hydro Turbines and Generators    6.75%  (minimum legal rate 4.5%)
Transmission Lines                 3.0%
Distribution Assets                6.0%
Office Machinery                  10%
Office Furniture                   8%
Automobiles                       15%
10.       Current Assets and Liabilities/Other Assets and Liabilities were
assumed to increase at the rate of 12% each year (except cash).

11.       Business and Other Reserve Funds include net income, revaluation of
fixed assets and depreciation.
12.       Capital Contributions from Consumers include surcharges paid by
distribution consumers and direct contributions expected to be obtained from
consumers for distribution construction works. Surcharges were assumed to be
eliminated after 1980 in accordance with the republic's plans.

CHAPTER IV
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND JUSTIFICATION
Least-Cost Development Program and the Project
4.01      Since the least-cost power system development study (LCD) for
Yugoslavia is currently in progress, the Project cannot be identified as a
component of a national LCD program. Because of the unique setting of
Yugoslavia's socio-economic system, a LCD program will be formulated for each
republic. This approach to system planning was accepted by the Bank; however,
the consultants (Energoprojekt) were requested (loan 1469-YU) to produce a
program that treats the Yugoslav power system as a single entity. The overall
plan would serve as a yardstick for measuring the penalty (if any) of inde-
pendent power planning by the republics.
4.02      The cost of republican sovereignty in pursuing their respective
power development plans should not be significant principally for two reasons:
(a) the geographical concentration of primary energy resources in a few
republics; and (b) increased exchange of power between republics in their
effort to minimize their respective cost of supplying electricity. For
example, the 380-kV transmission network which involves all the republics was
envisaged as a means of reducing the cost of electricity by transporting power
across republican boundaries. Therefore, the potential for significant
departures from an overall least-cost development program is fairly small,
since cost minimization would lead each republic voluntarily to compare the
cost of importing power through the 380-kV system with the cost of generating
it locally.
4.03      In addition, since BiH is one of the energy rich republics and the
Project provides peaking capacity, the possible predominance of sovereignty
rather than cost minimization motives in undertaking the Project is highly
unlikely, especially since BiH is a net exporter of power. That is, it could
reduce exports of power to meet its own needs rather than continue to export
and increase the cost of electricity to its customers.
Comparison of Alternatives
4.04      To determine whether the Project, including Mostar, constitutes the
least-cost alternative for meeting the forecast demand, requires that: (a)
all feasible alternatives valued at their cost to the economy be considered;
and (b) the appropriate discount rate (opportunity cost of capital) be used
in the comparison. The consultants for the Project studied the effects on
the Bosnia-Herzegovina system over a period of time 1985-1995 in which avail-
able alternative power plants suitable to satisfy the system power and energy
needs and equivalent to the capability of the Project, were compared. The
alternatives considered were coal-fired plant, combustion-turbine plant,
and a combination of these (coal-fired plant and combustion-turbine plant).
These alternatives were selected such that each would generate energy equiv-
alent to that supplied by the Project and take their place as part of a
least-cost system development and operating program. It was shown that the



- 44 -
configuration of plant which included the Project had the lowest present value
of all the alternatives considered at interest rates ranging from 10 to 18%.
The Project therefore constitutes the least-cost alternative in BiH for meeting
the incremental forecast demand.
Return on Investment
4.05      The rate of return on investment for the Project is the discount
rate which equates the present value of the stream of net benefits (measurable
benefits less measurable costs) over the expected life of the Project.  The
capital and operating costs associated with the Mostar segment of the hydro
development program of the Neretva river were included in the calculation
because the re-regulating reservoir at Mostar would make possible the utili-
zation of a third unit at Salakovac. Similarly, the contribution of the
three units, instead of two, at Salakovac are included in the benefits. There
are significant benefits to the agriculture sector that can be attributed to
the Project, however, these were not quantified at appraisal. Consequently,
the analysis includes only the measurable segment of the total benefits. Both
costs and benefits are expressed in their equivalent border values using the
appropriate conversion factors (construction, equipment and consumption, etc.).
Measurable Costs
4.06      These are defined as follows.
(i) Project Costs. These include the construction, development
and operating costs of the plant at Grabovica, Salakovac
and Mostar including the regulating reservoir. The yearly
operating costs are assumed to be 1% of the capital cost of
the Project. The local cost of construction is converted to
its border value by using a conversion factor of 0.86, while
the rest of the local costs are expressed in their equivalent
border values by using the conversion factor of 0.93 adopted
by the Bank for use in Yugoslav conditions.
(ii)  System Costs.  These include a tariff for transmission and
another for distribution to cover the cost of each kWh delivered
to the various customer classes. These tariffs are based on
the 1977-1983 power system development program of BiH's power
sub-sector (marginal cost-based). The tariffs are not intended
as an actual price for transmission and distribution but
instead each reflects the cost or value to the economy of the
resources used delivering each kWh generated by the Project to
the end users. Each kWh delivered to the transmission network
is charged at the average transmission tariff. The power
delivered to the distribution network is charged an additional
tariff for distribution.

Measurable BenefLts
4.07      The measurable ben,efits are the revenues collected from the sale of
power and the customer contributions to the system expansion costs which are
incurred by all customer classes. These are as follows.
(i) Revenue from Sale of Output. Since the Project is being
developed principally in order to serve as a peaking plant and
given the fact tha,t in Yugoslavia tariffs are charged on the
basis of seasons (high and low demand seasons) and time of day
in each season, the revenues are divided accordingly in order
to accommodate the wide differences existing between peak and
off-peak rates (seasonal and daily within them).  These
revenues are each converted to their respective border values
by using a conversion factor of 0.93.
(ii) Customer Contributions. The customer contributions towards
the cost of expancding the power system of BiH is in essence a
tariff for the use of the facilities. It has a fixed component
and a variable component, both set at different levels depend-
ing on the customer class. For example, the domestic consumer
pays a fixed charge and a variable charge that is different
from the rate paid by the direct high tension customers. The
variable charge is based on the kWh consumed, while the fixed
charge is a flat rate levied on each connection. The number
of connections is assumed to grow at an average annual rate of
4% for the first ten years and at 3% for the rest of the
period of analysis. The proportion of the fixed contributions
attributed to the Project is equal to 9% of the total customer
contribution for the first ten years, 5% of the contributions
for the next ten years and 2% for the last ten years. This is
in order to accounit for the decline in the proportion that the
Project's output contributes to the total future output of the
power system. A summary of the measurable benefits and costs
are presented in Table 4.1.
Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
4.08      The rate of return on the Project is equal to 11.2% if benefits are
measured by incremental revenues attributable to the Project and costs are
adjusted for taxes, internal transfers, etc. (If sunk costs to the middle of
1978 are omitted from the calculation, the rate of return on expenditures
after this date would be 12.6%). However, the incremental revenue is under-
stated because the benefits derived from water drawn from the Salakovac
storage have not been taken into account in respect of additional agricultural
production. This has been estimated by experts involved in the ecological
study described in para. 2.05, as yielding by 1986 some Din 1.1 million
(US$61,000 p/a) and rising progressively until some 2,000 ha are under
irrigation by the year 2000 and thereafter to Din 11.4 million (US$630,000).
These were not included in the analysis of the return on investment because it
could not be shown that the benefits were derived from an optimum investment



- 46 -
plan. Other minor benefits from tourism, rural electrification, road improve-
ments and flood control are likely to be obtained, but have not been quantified.
4.09      The rate of return increases to 12.2% when the rates for electricity
sold are increased by 15% while it decreases to 9.2% if the cost of the proj-
ect increases by 25%. The rate of return on the project decreases to 10.3% if
the economic cost per kWh charged for transmission is increased by 20% and it
decreases to 10.1% if the cost per kWh charged for distribution is increased
by 25%.
