BURUNDI
POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                The Government of the Republic of Burundi
Amount:                  IDA  Credit  SDR  12.9  milllon  (US$12.3  million
equivalent)
Beneficiary:             R6gie  de  distribution  d'eau  et  d'Electricitd
(REGIDESO)
Terms:                   Standard
Relending Terms:         The Government will relend US$12.0 equivalent of
the Credit proceeds to REGIDESO at an interest
rate of 9.29 percent, with a 20 years repayment
period, including five years' grace. REGIDESO will
bear the foreign exchange risk.
Cofinanciers:            Belgian Government (US$1.5 million)
Caisse   Centrale   de   Cooperation   Economique
(US$5 million)
Federal Republic of Germany (US$0.8 million)
Cofinanciers' on-lending terms have not yet been
decided but are assumed to be for 20 years
including 5 years grace at an interest rate of 8X.
Project Description:    The project would augment and improve reliability
of  electricIty  supply  to  Bujumbura  and  its
environs, providing transmission and distribution
facilitites to receive additional power from Ruzizi
II, serving additional consumers in the general
context of sustaining and improving growth in the
industrial, commercial and domestic sectors of the
country. In addition, the provision of management
assistance to REGIDESO, establishment of a trainiag
center and the training of REGIDESO staff, would
result   in   improved   service   and   financial
performance   by   the   company   through   better
operating, financial and maintenance practices and
strengthening  of investment planning capability.
The service of experts provided to the Government
would serve to import petroleum products at least
cost and to sustain through 1987 and 1988 the
dissemination of improved charcoal cooking stoves
and related energy-saving techniques.



(ii)
The   project  would  include:   (a)  a   110  kV
transmission  line  (83  km)  from  Ruzizi  II  to
Bubanza; (b) construction of 110/30 kV substations
in Bubanza and Cibitoke, two 30 kV subtransmission
lines (42 km) to supply four regional towns, a 15
or 30 kV feeder to Katumba and distribution
networks  in  these towns;  (c)  construction    of
distribution   networks   to   consumers   to   six
low-income   districts   of  Bujumbura;   and   (d)
consulting   engineering   services,   management
assistance to REGIDESO, establishment of a training
center and technical assistance for the training of
REGIDESO  staff;  and  (e)  continuation  of  the
dissemination program of improved charcoal stoves
in Bujumbura and funding for the services of an
advisor on petroleum matters.
Benefits and Risks:      The  principal  benefits  of  the proposed project
would be Burundi's access to the least-cost source
of electricity and extension of the electricity
supply to the hitherto unserved population.   The
project faces no special risk.

BURUNDI
POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
I. TIE ENERGY SECMDR
Background
1.01       Burundi is a small, landlocked country lying just south of the
equator in Eastern Central Africa. It is bordered on the north by Iwanda,
on the west by Zaire, and on the east and south by Tanzania (Map IBRD
18517). It has an area of 27,820 ku2 I/ and the 1984 estimated population
of about 4.5   million  results  in a population  density  of about 160
inhabitants per ks2, but reaches over 350 ln some prLiarily agricultural
areas, high in comparison to other African countries.  Between 1978 and
1983 the estimated annual rate of growth of the populatLon was 2.2Z, and
this ls the country's most pressing problem. About ninety-five percent of
the population lives in isolated farms in rural areas, engaged in
subsistence agriculture and all-scale coffee cultivation.  About 200,000
people (93Z of the urban population) live in Bujumbura, the capital city,
located on Lake Tanganyika. The GNP in Burundi was about US$240 per capita
in 1983.
1.02            Burundi's principal energy resource Is its forest, which is
being  rapidly  depleted  for  agricultural  clearing,  firewood  and  its
by-product, charcoal.   Peat is available in relative abundance and is a
potential substitute for fuelwood but is not traditionally used and is at
present difficult and costly both to exploit and us. The potential for
development of hydroelectrLc power exists but development is costly due to
the sites having low capacity and being widely scattered. The beat hydro
sources  are  on  the  Ruzizi  and  1i tege  rlvers; two schemaes are being
developed: one project on the river Razlzi  (para. 2.10) to meet  the
regional demand (Burundi, Rwnda and livu, Zaire) and one project
(Rwegura-para. 2.09) is  under construcLLon for BurundLan demand.   The
gravity and aeromagnetic surveys and ieisuic progras carried out to date
suggest that oil may have accumulated in exploltable quantities under Lake
Tanganyika and the Ruzizi plain, and the Government has signed in October
1984 an exploration agreement with a multinational oil company (para.
1.23). In the renewable energy subsector, reconnaissance work carried out
in 1982 on 14 geothermal sites indicated that the potential is limlted.
Some research work has been done on solar and wind energy, and biogas, but
these energy sources are unlikely to make a significant contribution in the
short to medium term.
1.03      As part of the Bank's increased activities in the energy sector
of developing countries, in April and May 1981, the Bank conducted an
energy assessment under the joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment

(c) to develop peat reserves and a peat market, maiLly among
potential industrial customers; and
(d) to reiuforce energy planning capability at sub-sector level.
1.04         The Goverument has been generally responsive to the Bank's
recommendations.   A UNDP Round Table discussion on energy issues and
projects, establishment of a hydrocarbon unit at the Ministry of Public
Works, Entergy and Mines (tPWLM), and an active interest in charcoal
production have followed. A status report on energy sector activities was
prepared in January 1984 following a UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector
Management Assistance Program  (ESMAP) missiou to Burundi in August 1983.
Technical assistance under ESMAP was provided to help the Government
prepare documentation for the Round Table meeting held in February 1984, to
review the urban stove improvement program; and, in the petroleum
subsector, for the interpretation of gravity and aeromagnetic surveys made
in northern Burutndi; for assessmet of the economics and reliability of the
alternative route via Tanzania for the importation of petroleum products;
and to help the Government in Its negotiations with an international
company for exploration licensilig.
1.05       A table showitg the demand for electrical and petroleum energy
for the period 1976-1983 may be found in Annex 1. Apart from biomass fuels
(fuelwood, charcoal, peat, agricultural residues), which account for about
95% of total energy needs, 752 of Burundi's remainiug energy needs are met
by petroleum products, while electricity accounts for about 23 percent and
industrially used peat about 2 percent.   The overall growth in energy
consumption (excluding wood and charcoal) duriug the 1973-1980 pariod
averaged  about  9Z  per  year.    Consumption  of  petroleum  fuels  and
electricity is equivalent to 15 kgoe/year per capita and per unit GNP Is
very low and is only about one-third of the average for other countries in
size aid income level. This reflects, inter alia, the extremely high cost
of petroleum in land-locked Burundi, aid the very low level of industrial
and tran.s"ort development.
Energy Sector Orgauization
1.06        The MPWEt  has overall responsibility for policy formulation in
the energy sector.  The main parastatal organization in the sector under
the MPWEJ4 is Regie de distributiot d'eau et d'electricit& (REGIDESO). The
Natioual Peat Organization (ONATOUR) and the D&partemeut Urbai de
Bujumbura (DUB) are also parastatals under MPWEM. An organization chart of
the Ministry given is given in Annex 2.   The  itinistry of Commerce and
Transportatiotn supervises petroleum imports and Socit& d'Entreposage de
Pitrole (SEP). which is owned jointly by five foreign companies, operates



petroleum handling  and storage facilities at Bujumbura's  port.   Rural
electrification ts the responsibility of the DNpartement de l'hydraulique
et  de  l'electrification  rurale  (DUER)  under  the  Ministry  of  Rural
Development.
1.07       The international institutions in the sector are mainly related
to the electricity subsector and detailed descriptions may be fouud in
para. 2.04 and Annex 3.
Energy Resources
Woodfuel
1.08      Burundi's forest resources are estimated at about 200,000 ha, and
cover nearly 7Z of the total land area.   About 140,000 ha are planted,
while 60,000 ha are natural forests.  Wood production from natural forest
and plantationt growth is estimated to be below the conservative consumption
estimate of 1 millioLL .3 annually. Bionmass fuels (fuelwood, charcoal, crop
and antimal residues) account for about 952 of the total energy cousumed.
Accurate data on firewood use in rural areas, where 902 of the population
resides, are unavailable.   The estimated average annual wood consumption
per capita is 0.25 m3/year, low by iuternational standards.  Most of the
firewood is collected from   plantations,  farmers' holdings and natural
forests and the volume traded is estimated at about 160,000 m3/year (solid
measurement at 600 kg/m3). Marketed firewood supplies the principal towns
and rural institutions, such as missions and hospitals, and rural
industries, such as tea factories.   Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, with a
population of about 200,000, consumes almost all marketed wood in the form
of charcoal as the principal cooking fuel.
1.09       The fuelwood scarcity has direct impacL on food crop production,
since the rural population is increasingly using agricultural residues to
meet their fuel needs. In some areas, agricultural wastes are the primary
fuel. This reduces soil fertility and crop yields, which in turn increases
pressure on land, and leads to shortened fallow periods, creatiing a cycle
of  soil  degradation  and  falling  production.    The wood  shortage  and
accompanying high prices affect the urban populatiou in that up to 25% of a
typical Bujumbura family's  income is spent ot charcoal.   Prices  have
iniereased dramatically as a consequence of demand pressure on the declining
resource and higher transport costs for charcoal, as trees have been
stripped further and further afield from Bujumbura.   For instance,  the
price increased from BuF 150/bag (US$1.28/bag) of 35 kg in 1970 to
BuF 750/bag (USS6.41/bag) in 1984, i.e. the equivalent of US$180 per toni
atd US$250 per ton of oil equivalent, an itcrease of about 400% compared
with an increase of about 250% in the coLnsumer price iLndex for that period.
1.10            The  possible  substitutes  for charcoal  and  firewood  are
electricity, kerosene and peat.  Electricity for cooking at present tariff
levels costs roughly the same as charcoal (equivalent energy value,
excluding cost of appliance) at present market prices and a few higher
income families are using it, but the high cost of electric stoves and the
conuections are beyond the reach of most of the urban population. The cost
of  imported  petroleum  products  alone   (US$85/bbl  c.i.f  Bujumbura,
(para. 1.18) even excluding the cost of stoves, prohibits using kerosene
for cooklug except for the affluent.   Efforts have been made to supply



-4-
peat as a cooking fuel. but to date it has no advantages over charcoal in
cost or acceptability.   It is clear that woodfuel will remain the main
source of energy for household purposes in the foreseeable future, and
efforts to deal with the wood shortage must focus on increasing the supply
and    the  efficiency  of  use,  given  the  rather  limited  substitution
potential.  However, in the medium and longer term an analysis of the roles
of cooking with electricity, kerosene or charcoal is needed.
1.11        The Forestry Department is under the Ministry of Agriculture.
The Director of Forestry also deals with fisheries and wildlife. Forestry
development has had low priority in budget allocation; protection programs
have until recently been small and ineffective. There is a critical lack
of well-trained extension workers and foresters in Burundi. There is no
trained national forester working in the Forestry Department. The forest
law of Burundi (Code Forestier) has recently been approved and
promulgated. A draft Forestry Policy Review is being prepared, funded by
Fonds European de developpement (FED), for the purpose of defining further
Government forestry objectives and providing a rational framework for
future projects including ones to be financed by external donors.  It is
the first comprehensive document on the subsector.
1.12      Increasing the efficiency of fuelwood utilization in households
is as important an energy issue as increasing fuelwood supplies, given the
inefficient cooking devices and methods which prevail.   Xore efficient
charcoal production methods have been tested and promoted under the IDA
First Forestry Project (CR 918-BU).  Under the Urban Development Project
(CR 1049-BU) an improved charcoal stove was designed which provides fuel
savings of 30Z compared to the traditional stov'. A consultant funded by
ESMAP, has modified the design of the improved stove to make it cheaper for
artisans to produce, and under a two year extension of CR 1049-BU funding
will be provided for a program to promote sales, and to disseminate stoves
(para. 4.15). In contrast to the work on urban charcoal stoves, there has
been little progress on improved woodstoves for rural areas in Burundi.
The rural population accounts for most of the woodfuel consumption, and the
search for methods of increasing the efficiency of utilization must
continue (para. 1.24).
1.13         Various countries and organizations are providing forestry
assistance, including Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, France, the African
Development Bank (AfDB), FED and UNDP. IDA's involvement in the sector is
decribed in para. 1.24.   Technical assistance still falls short of the
need; and better coordination and greater effort are required to decrease
the increasingly serious problems brought about by fuelwood shortages and
deforestation.
Hydroelectricity
1.14      Burundi's mountainous terrain and abundant rainfall result in a
significant potential for the generation of electricity by small
hydroelectric generating stations in the numerous, steep, fast-flowing
rivers and streams. The total usable hydroelectric potential was found by
Lahmeyer International (Federal Republic of Germany) to be 285 MW 3/.
This is about 26 times Burundi's current electricity demand and its
3/ Study of the Development of Hydroelectric Resources in Burundi (Lahmeyer
International), August 1983.



-5-
exploitation is likely to be gradual.   By etd-1984,  ouly 11.7 MW of
installed hydro capacity was developed (para. 2.05).
Peat
1.15       Peat is a potential substitute for firewood for some industries
and for rural institutions. However production problems keep the greater
part of the known resources unavailable or prohibitively expensive. In the
highland peat bogs, about one million tonues of peat are estimated to
exist; a recent report 4/ concludes that this source can meet iudustrial
demand on a competitive basis for a significant period of time and a
strategy for development of the use of peat in under review. About four
million tonnes were recently located at Nyamuswaga; a hydrological survey
is required to determine if and how the bog, which is disadvantageously
distant  from  Bujumbura,  can  be  exploited.    Burundi  has  major  peat
resources, estimated at over 52 million tonnes, in an area on the border
with Rwaanda known as the Akanyaru Basin. The Akanyaru peat is colloidal
and the area is flooded or very swampy throughout the year, making manual
extraction not feasible.   The other available method is hydraulic peat
mining which requires operations on a large scale and thus a substantial
market.  Furthermore, unanswered questions remain about the environmental
effects of large-scale exploitation of these peat resources.   Tt is uot
known whether the bogs can be drained without causing serious damage to the
densely populated farmland downstream, and in parts of R.wanda.
1,16        Consumption of peat to date has been very limited due to the
small amount produced. The Burundi army purchases about 802 of all pear
sold, and the remainder is sold to brlckmaking operations, tea plantations,
bakeries, hospitals, and to missions located near the bog sites. About
10,900 tonnes of peat were produced in 1982, about 13,300 tonues in 1983,
and production is expected to reach 15,000 tonnes ia 1984. However actual
production capability is about 50,000 tonnes annually.
1,17       Peat is currently an unknown as a household fuel.  In spite of
ONATOUR's marketing efforts in Bujumbura, including the free distribution
of a peat cooking stove with the purchose of peat, peat has not gaited
acceptance as a substitute to charcoal -'or household cooking. People are
accustomed to cooking with charcoal and there is no foreseeable
justification for a price incentive to use peat.
Imported Energy: Petroleum
1.18       Burundi is entirely dependent on foreign sources for its supply
of petroleum products and its landlocked location puts it at a particular
disadvantage, with trausport costs of about US$38 per barrel added to the
landed Mombasa cost of petroleum products. The major issues are related to
the very high cost of imported oil and the vulnerability of the supply
routes to interruption. Until 1977, almost all of the oil imports crossed
Tanzania by rail from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma, and were barged up Lake
Tanganyika to Bujumbura. However, rail transportation has been abaudonned
due to floods and tank car shortages resulting from the lack of
4/ Burundi-Peat Utilization Projects - Activity Completion Report - ESMAP;
December 1984.



-6-
maintetiace.   As a result, all of the imported oil is transported from
Mombasa by pipeliae to Nairobi, aLnd by tank truck for a 1,800 kilometer
journey via Uganda and Rwanda. Currently about half of Burundi's petroleum
products are purchased from the Mombasa refinery, and the remainder (since
March  1983)  from  the Middle East  open market.   The price structure
established by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in May 1983, of about
US$85 per barrel is based on the price of products from the Mombasa
refinery, (i.e. including freight but exclusive of taxes). Total transport
costs i.e. including freight, insurance, and Rwandan fees but excluding any
Burundian duties or taxes from Nombassa to Bujumbura come to about US$242
per tonne of gas oil (18.55 BuFfliter).  Price levels were last adjusted in
December 1983.

1.19          Following a recommendationi by the Energy Assessment mission
(para. 1.03) and at the request of the Government, a consultant, funded by
ESMAP, visited Burundi in August 1983 to assist the Government in reviewing
and evaluating alternative schemes for the importation and distribution of
petroleum products  imi order to devise methods of reducing cost.   The
consultant's review of the possible sources and supply routes confirmed
that, the least-cost alteruative would be to purchase finished products
directly on the Middle East open market, unload them at Dar es Salaam, and
transport them on the Tanzanian railroad to Kigoma and from there by barge
to Bujumbura.   For gasoil, which now accounts for the largest share of
Burundi's petroleum market, this alternative would be about 11 percent less
costly than purchase on. the Middle East open market amd transport via
Kenya Uganda Rwanda. Rowever, the unreliability of the Tanzanian railroad
poses a major  constraint to this option.   For security  reasons,  the
Government is continuing to import petroleum products via Kenya Uganda
Rwanda, while the Tanzanian route is being tested by the oil-importing
companies. A component of the proposed project would be the provision of
technical expertise in the petroleum marketing field, to advise Government
on the least cost method of purchase its petroleum needs, and on the
pricing structure (para. 4.16).
1.20       Burundi imported 38,736 tons of petroleum products in 1982 and
40,489 tons in 1983, an annual increase of about 4.5%. The costs of these
imports accounted for about 16 % of total merchandise imports and 37% of
merchandise exports on a c.i.f. basis in those years.   Following is a
tabulation showing each products's share of the domestic market in 1982 and
1983.

1.21      The product mix of Burundi's oil consumption is heavily weighted
toward vehicle fuels as gasoline and gasoil account for over 90% of the
total.  Stationary engines and small boilers account for a small part of
the demand. The two largest oil consumers are the brewery and the textile
plant, in Bujumbura, where fuel oil is used primarily for process steam.
This is one area where either electricity or peat could be used in place of
oil.
1.22      Burundi's vulnerability to interruptions in delivery via the two
surface routes was demonstrated in the first half of 1979, when the war in
Uganda led to both routes being closed simultaneously.   The possibility
that this situation may recur has led the Government to build additional
storage tanks at Gitega. However, these tanks are empty as the Government
has not completed its studies on the problems of financing and managing
the stocks.  The NPWEM is in the process of drawing up an emergency plan as
was recommended in the Energy Assessment Report.
1.23        The Government received technical assistance, funded through
ES!AP and the IDA Third Technical Assistance Project (CR 917-BU), in
negotiating a petroleum exploration contract with AMOCO (para. 1.02). The
contract was signed in October 1984, is due to be submitted to the National
Assembly and on approval will be promulgated.   Fieldwork will then start
under the direction of AMOCO's local representative.
IDA's Role in the Energy Sector
1.24      The energy assessment of 1981 and the subsequent follow up by the
Government under ESMAP (paras. 1.03 and 1.04) particularly in the petroleum
subsector, have supplied the framework for IDA's proposed or active role in
addressing key energy issues under various projects:
(a) Woodfuel issues: The IDA First Forestry Project (CR 918-BU) is
providing funds for the study of woodfuel consumption, the
introduction on ar operational basis of metal kilns to improve
the efficiency of charcoal production, and the design of
improved woodstoves for rural areas. The project was conceived
as the first stage of a long-term program to develop basic



-8-
poles and timber.  By the tLie of its completion in 1985, it is
expected that the project will have established about 2,000 ha
of eucalyptus (100% of target), 4,000 ha of pine (80X) and 60
rural  nurseries.      Under  the  Urban  Development  Project
(CR 1049-BU), a more efficient-model of the traditional charcoal
stove has been produced (para. 1.12) and continuation of the
program is envisaged under the proposed project (para. 4.15).
The Second Forestry Project, which was appraised in July 1984,
would cover rural nurseries and agroforestry, afforestation
(1,500 ha pine and 5,500 ha eucalyptus), forestry training,
support to agriculture and livestock, and technical assistance
f-r project management and institution building.  The project
would also provide for the training of about 20 charcoal burners
in improved charcoal making. Estimated cost of the project is
about US$17.2 million of which about US$7.5 million is the
portion for foreign currency expenses.
(b) Peat: The Nickel Exploration/Engineering Project (CR 1154-BU)
is helping to finance the Akanyaru Basin trial peat production
(para. 1.15).
Cc) Petroleum: A component of the proposed project is the provision
of funds to cover the cost of a petroleum expert who would
advise on the purchase of petroleum products and a pricing
strategy (para. 4.16).
Cd) Power subsector issues: The Ruzizi II project (CR 1419-BU;
1420-RW; 1421-ZR) is the least-cost option for providing
additional   electricity   to   the   region  and  to   Burundi
(pars. 2.10).   The proposed project is a logical follow-up to
the Ruzizi II project, by financing the needed transmission
facilities to connect the generating plant to the market. The
project also will address improvement of reliability and
efficiency and extension of the transmission and distribution
system-to serve more consumers.
A project preparation advance (PPF P245) for the proposed project
(para. 4.01) has provided funding for feasibility studies of transmission
lines, the electrification of six low-income suburbs of the capital, and an
electricity tariff study.  REGIDESO's training and management needs have
also been studied and will be addressed under the proposed project.
II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
2.01        The power subsector is controlled by MPWEM (para. 1.06) and the
only utility  is REGIDESO  (para. 2.03).   Rural electrification is the
responsibility of the Departement de l'hydraulique et de l'lelectrification
rurale (DEER) under the Ministry of Rural Development (para. 2.13).
Furthermore, Burundi is a member of two international organizations,
Energie des pays des grands lacs (EGL) and Kagera River Basin Organization
(KBO), which coordinate energy matters on a regional basis (para. 2.04)
and it is a shareholder of the Socieft internationale d'electricite des



-9-
pays des grands lacs (SINELAC) which is constructing the Ruzizi II Regional
Hydroelectric Project (para. 2.10).
Access to Service
2.02        The availability of electric power in Burundi has been, in
general, limited to Bujumbura (95.5% of the sales in 1983), and the
isolated towns of Gitega, Muramvya and Bururi which represented 3.5X; 0.8Z
and 0.2% of the sales, respectively. Only 2% of the population has access
to electricity (among the lowest in Africa), and the average estimated per
capita annual consumption of electricity was about 14 kWh in 1983.
The Power Supply Company
2.03       REGIDESO, an entirely Government-owned organization, was formed
in 1968 to generate, transmit and distribute electricity, and to treat,
pump, and distribute water in Burundi. Responsibility for sanitation was
added in 1979 but was later given to the municipalities. Although it has a
monopoly for the supply of electricity, REGIDESO operates only in the major
centers of the country,  and needs to receive management assistance to
expand and to improve its operations (para. 4.12).  Issues to be addressed
by  this assistance  are mentioned under the appropriate headings.    A
complete description of the organization may be foand beginning in
para. 3.02.
International Institutions
2.04           EGL, formed in 1974 by Burundi,  Rwanda and Zaire, with
responsibility for planning the least-cost method of providing electricity
to the Great Lakes Region, was instrumental in the preparation of the
Ruzizi II project.  EGL reports to the Com-inaute economique des pays des
grands lacs (CEPGL) formed by the three countries.  Since the creation of
SINELAC in February 1984, EGL transferred its responsibilities for
Ruzizi II to this company and is presently charged with identifying and
studying other energy resources.   KBO, which represents Burundi, Rwanda,
Tanzania and Uganda, has had several reports prepared by consultants on the
development of the Kagera river, which has its source in Burundi, and forms
the border between Rwanda and Tanzania.   A description of these three
organizations may be found in Annex 3.
Existing Generating Facilities
2.05         The t-otal installed capacity in Burundi is 19.8 MW of which
11.7 MW (60%) is hydro anD the remaining 8.1 MW (40Z) is diesel.  In 1983
supply from diesels was less than 1% of the total output. REGIDESO has a
total installed generating capacity of 16.8 MW, of which 10.7 MW (64%) is
hydro and the remainder diesel. The Mugere generating station (4 x 2 MW),
funded and constructed by the Chinese Government, provides electric power
to Bujuubura, the main demand center.  This is a run-of-river plant with a
maximum available capacity of 7.5 MW, but because of the lack of a storage
reservoir, its output during the dry season (July, August and September)
may be reduced to about 2 MW; the annual generation capability of the plant
is 41 GWh.   The diesel generating station in Bujumbura has an installed
capacity of 5.5 MW but due to age and lack of maintenance its maxifum



- 10 -
output cannot exceed about 2.0 MW, and it is kept only as a standby. There
are also many small hydro and diesel plants installed at isolated missions,
farms, hospitals and tea estates.  A list of all generating facilities in
the country, summarized below, may be found in Annex 4, and those owned by
REGIDESO are shown on IBRD Hap 18517.

Imported Power and Energy
2.06         Until the Mugere generating station was commissioned in 1982,
the main source of electricity for Bujumbura was the Ruzizi generating



- I1 -
station located at the outlet of Lake Kivu on the border between Rwanda and
Zaire. This generating station (two 6.3 MW units commissioned in 1958 and
two 7.8 MW units in 1972) supplies electric power to the interconnected
system of Kivu/Zaire-Rwanda-Burundi.   It was built by the Belgian Societe
des forces hydroelectriques de l'est du Congo, and is owned by Societe
nationale  d'6lectricite (S.N.EL.) of Zaire.   As part of  the terms  of
settlement when Burundi became independent in 1962, S.N.EL. provides the
Government with 33 GWh annually of electrical energy, at no cost, until
2005, and sells the energy demand above this amount to REGIDESO on an
interruptible basis.   The source for the supply of electrical energy to
Burundi since 1981 is sumarized in the following table.

Transmission and Distribution
2.07       Electric power from the Buzizi generating station is supplied to
Bujuinbura via a 70 kV transmission line 115 km long, (owned and operated by
S.N.EL.)  and  from the Mugere  generating station via a  25 km,  35 kV
transmission line.   There  is no interconnection  between  the receiving
substations, and, because of the different voltage levels, the output of
the two plants cannot be synchronized.   As a result, the Mugere plant
operates in isolation, and since commissioning supplies only a section of
Bujumbura, previously supplied from the Ruzizi I station.   This lack of
operating flexibility will be corrected upon completion of part of a 30 kV
ring around Bujumbura now under construction (Map IBRD 18516).   Most of
Bujumbura is supplied Arom the S.N.EL.substation located at the termination
of the 70 kV Ruzizi I Bujumbura line, where two transformers of 5.25 MVA
each are installed and third similar transformer is available as a reserve
but not connected.  The capacity of the line is about 9.5 KW and it was
reached in 1981. The substation, which has been surrounded by residential
districts,  is also owned and operated by S.N.EL.   The energy from the
Ruzizi I power plant is metered at this substation.   The line and the
substation were inspected by consultants to S.N.EL. within the feasibility
studies of the proposed Zaire Power II Project (para. 2.30).  The 70 kV
transmission line does not require extensive rehabilitation and equipment
and works needed for the rehabilitation of the Bujumbura substation have
been estimated about US$0.3 million (para. 4.07).  The highest voltage at



- 12 -
which electricity is transmitted by REGIDESO is 30 kV, and there are only
about 36 km of line at this voltage.  A 15 kV transmission line, owned by
S.N.EL., supplies power to Uvira in Zaire from the Bujumbura substation
(IBRD Map 18517).   Gitega, Bururi and Muramvya are supplied from small
hydro stations built in the vicinity of these towns. The total length of
the transmission and distribution lines which, at the end of 1983, was
423.3 km was made up as follows:

Electricity is distributed to domestic and commercial consumers within
Bujumbura primarily by underground cables at 6.6 kV, dropping to 380/220
for individual consumers, while in the interior of the country, aerial
lines at an intermediate voltage of 10 kV are used with transformation to
the  consumer  at  400/230  V.    Distribution  by  underground  cables  is
expensive, and aerial lines are now used in the new areas.
Connections, Sales and Losses
2.08       The total number of connections at the end of 1983 on REGIDESO's
billing  records  was  about  6,933.    Out  of  this  total  connections  to
consumers supplied from the medium voltage were 108 and low voltage
consumers were 6,825.   The 1983 sales to various categories of consumers

Average annual consumption of the medium and low voltage consumers in 1983
were 300,000 kWh and 4,157 kWh respectively. 5/ In 1983, losses were only
2.5% of the total supply. This i8 due to the fact that energy supplied to
Bujumbura (95% of the total) is metered at the S.N.EL. substation iii
Bujumbura and the distribution in the capital is concentrated to the port,
new industrial and high-income residential areas. In the other areas with
electricity service, the hydro stations are in the vicinity of the towns
and distribution networks are limited. However, with the expansion of the
transmission and distribution networks, losses are expected to increase to
attain levels of about 12 to 15%.   Therefore ant item in the terms of
reference for the management consultants, would be to develop a program of
loss reduction on technical as well as on administrative (i.e. unbilled and
unmetered connecetions) basis (paras. 4.12 and 4.26).
Works in Progress
2.09       Until 1982 (para. 2.06) Burundi imported almost all its electric
power from Ruzizi I, located in Zaire. To ensure that at least a strategic
portiom of its weeds are under its coutrol, in 1981 the Government embarked
on the construction of the Rwegura dam and hydroelectric generating station
(3x6 KW) in the northern part of the country, on the Kitenge River 6/
including a 110 kV transmission line to transmit power to Bujumbura.  Th'e
,l;.e will end at the RN1 station in the northeast of Bujumbura. A system
control center for Burundi is also being constructed at this substation and
communication  equipment  is  provided  within  the  project.    ELngineering
services for the projects are carried out by Lahmeyer International.  IDA
was requested to consider providing part of the funds required for the
financing of the Rwegura hydroelectric project, and a mission visited
Burudi in May 1981 to appraise the project. Following appraisal, it was
fouud that the Ruzizi II hydroelectric power geceration project, just
downstream from the existing plant, would be the least cost solution for
the provision of electrical energy to Burundi aud to the region, and IDA
therefore withdrew its interest in Rwegura. Nevertheless, the Government
obtained the aecessary financing from other lending agencies and donors and
REGIDESO is constructing this project finauced by Kreditanstalt fur
Wiederaufbau (KfW), Caisse centrale de cooperation &conomique (CCCE), Fonds
europeen de developpement (FED), African Development Bank (AfDB) and the
Kuwait Fund, with commissioning scheduled for the end of 1986.
2.10        Although Burundi lacks a comprehensive power development plan,
the Government and REGIDESO concluded that it would not be capable of
meeting the electricity demand by 1989, and joiued with Rwanda and Zaire to
develop Ruzizi II on the Rwanda-Zaire border.   In December 1983,  IDA
approved Credit 1419-BU in the amount of US$15 million to Burundi, and
similar amounts to Rwanda (CR 1420-RW) and Zaire (CR 1421-ZR) totaling
US$45 million, to provide part of the financing for the construction of the
Ruzizi II dam (a concrete gravity dam 11 a high) and generating station
(two 13.3 MW units, with provision for a third similar unit) and related
facilities.   Construction activities are now underway with commissioning
expected in mid-1988.  A new international company, Socitre internationale

- in Bujumbura: 4,170 kWh;
- in other centers: 4,050 kWh.
6/ Therefore Rwegura is considered as Kitenge I.

d'6lectricite des pays des grands lacs (SINELAC) owned in equal shares by
the three cou.tries, was formed in February 1984 to construct, operate and
maintain Ruzizi II, and sell power to the utilities in the three
countries. The total project cost is estimated to be US$74.1 million, with
cofinanciag  from  Fonds  europEen  de  dtveloppement  (FED),  Banque  de
developpement des etats des grands lacs (BDGEL), and the Government of
Italy.   The Governments of Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire are financing an
amount equivalent to US$3 million each for the local currency expenses.
The Credits were declared effective on August 30, 1984.
2.11       FED is financing the construction of a wood-pole 30 kV tratLmis-
sion line, from the site of the Rwegura generating station, to the village
of Rwegura, then to Kayauza, and onwards to Ngozi, estimated at US$1.3
million; a 30 kV line from Bujumbura to Jenda, Tora, Mwaro and Kibumbu at a
cost of US$2.0 million; both are scheduled to be completed in 1985; and the
Bururi-Rumonge hydro facility scheduled to be completed in 1988.
2.12          In addition, DER lis constructing two mini-hydro stations,
totalling only 165 kW and expected to be put into operation by 1986.
Rural Electrification
2.13        Rural electrification is the responsibility of DHER which was
created in 1979. Since then, it has successfully brought into operation 5
mini-hydro generating stations (0.05 to 0.24 MW), two diesel geuerating
stations (both 0.09 MW), and about 27 km of subtransmission and
distribution lines. Two uew generating stations are under construction as
well as about 16 km of transmission lines.  The construction of three more
mini-hydro generating stations which studies indicate to be feasible, are
planned for the immediate future.  Details of the foregoing projects may be
found in Annex 5.
2.14        There is little coordiruation betweenL DRER and REGIDESO.  The
selection of rural  sites,  and the order of  priority  is, in general,
determiued by the lending agency involved.   Also, upon completion,  the
operation, maintenance, and financial obligations are left to the
tec.'pient, i.e., hospital, school, or local government agency with the
result  that  the  maintenance  is  sometimes  inadequate,  and  funds  for
replacement parts are not available.   More appropriately, responsibility
for these projects should rest with REGIDESO, which has the technical
cuapetence to ensure successful operation, and the mnmagerial and financial
capability to integrate these uew projects into the broad, least-cost
development platning of the electrification of the country as a whole. One
of the responsibilities of the management assistance team funded by this
project, would be to determine the best course of action to be taken for
these rural developments (para. 4.12).
Historical Demand for Electric Power
2.15       Demand for electrical energy in Burundi increased by 9% per year
between 1974 aud 1983, from 23.6 GWh to 57.8 GWh, despite the fact that in
1979 the growth in demaud for electrical energy was only 5% over the
previous year, due to the hostilities between Tanzania and Uganda which
interrupted transportation facilities, and significantly reduced commercial



- 15 -
activities.  Since then, however, the average annual growth in demand has
been about 13%.  The greatest itcrease in demand has been from industry
which reached 172 annually in 1980 aud 1981, and 43% in 1983. This latest
increase was due primarily to the commissioning of a glass bottle
manufacturing plant in September 1983, which alone is expected to use about
15 GWh annually.   Growth in the domestic sector has averaged about 11X
annually since 1979, and the demand by public buildings, street lighting
and REGIDESO's owt needs for pumpitng water has averaged about 4X annually.

Load Forecasts
2.17       Two forecasts of the demand for electrical energy have been made
recently.   The first in August 1983, by Lahmeyer (para.  1.14) where in
their average estimate indicated that the demand in Bujumbura would rise
from 58 GWh in 1983 to 102 GWh in 1990, an average annual growth rate of



- 16 -
about 8.4%.   Proposed extensions to the interconnected grid would add
another 27 GWh making a total interconnected system demand of 129 GWh, in
1990 (average annual rate, 12%). The most recent forecast September 1984,
by EdF (para. 2.21) was much more optimistic, and forecast that industry
requiring significant amounts of electrical energy would be constructed in
Burundi, raising the demand for electrical energy In the interconnected
system to 122 GWh in 1990.  EdF also estimated that an additional 50 GWh
from  isolated areas woull be connected  to  the grid during  the period
bringing the total demand to 172 GWh in 1990 (average annual rate, 16.8%).
IDA believes that EdF is too optimistic, particularly forecasting future
industrial loads. Following review of both forecasts, REGIDESO's transmis-
sion and distribution expansion program, and further analysis, IDA prepared
its own forecast, which is about the same order with the Lahmeyer fore-
cast. Thus IDA believes that a demand Zor electrical energy of 98 GWh for
Bujumbura and additional connected load of 25 GWh from extension of the
grid to the outlying areas resulting in a total interconnected load of
123 GWh in 1990 is a more reasonable assumption, resulting in an average
annual rate of 11.3%.  Results are sumnarized in the following table and
details are shown in Annex 8.

Total sales of REGIDESO, including isolated areas, would increase from
74 GWh in 1985 to 129 GCh in 1990 at an average annual rate of 11.7%.
Regional Interconnected System
2.18       In examining the electric energy needs of Burundi, it is neces-
sary to take the demand for Rwanda and the Kivu province of Zaire into con-
sideration as well, because all three countries are interconnected and
depend on the original Ruzizi I generating station at the outlets of Lwake
Kivu for part of their supply.  This interdependence is being strengthened
with the construction of Rauzizi II.   A forecast of the availability of
supply and demand for electrical energy in the regional interconnected
system is given in Annex 9 and summarized in the table on the following
page.
2.19       The demand forecast for the interconnected system is equivalent
to an average  annual  increase  in demand of  10% during   he  1984-1995
period. Review of these supply and demand forecasts leads to the following
conclusions:
A. From the regional (Burundi-Rwanda-Zaire/Kivu) point of view:
(a) Energy from the Ruzizi II project would be required beginning in
1989 to supply the regional needs; as the present commissioning

date is mid-1988, this means that the costruction of  Raizi II
could be delayed by about 6 moths; however, IDA is of the
opinion that the period is too short to justlfy such an action,
which would risk further delays and would not lead to any
savings.
(b) The third unit (13.8 NW) 6f the Ruzizl II should be cosmd isioned
by end-1992.
(c) A new regional project is needed to be commissloned by aid-1995.
B. From the point of view of Burundi power subsector:
(a) Following  commissioning  of  the  Rwegura  and  Ruzizi  II  power
stations, Burundi is expected to bave an oversupply of electric
power from the interconnected system unti;. end-1993; however
without Rwegura, it would not have been possible to meet daily
peak demands and the energy requirements from 1987 onwards,
until the Ruzizi II Project is coumissioned; and,
(b) Burundi will start using its share of Ruzizi II in 1988
(para. 2.21); and will need to use more than lts share in 1994.



- 18 -
2.20       The ability of REGIDESO to absorb this surplus by extending the
interconnected grid to other regional towns is limited by the availability
of capital, bo h in foreign and local currency, and the viability of the
demand.   The proposed project would provide funds  to construct 30 kV
subtransmission   lines   and   distribution   networks   to   extend   the
interconnected grid.
Need for the Project
2.21       Based on the mission's forecast of demand, which is the lowest
of the three forecasts (para. 2.17), it would be necessary to provide
Burundi with power from the Ruzizi II project in 1988, in order to prevent
any possible shortfall, which could arise over demand higher than forecast
or adverse hydrologic conditions which could limit the generation from
Mugere and Ruegura power stations, particularly in the dry months of July,
August and September.  Costs expected to be incurred (fuel and shortage
costs) in 1989 in case the Ruzizi II Burundi transmission link is delayed,
demand is higher than forecast and/or hydrogeneration is lower than
expected, were found to exceed the benefits to be gained by delaying the
line by one year. Therefore, it is justified to have the transmission link
in operation in 1989.  Early in 1984, REGIDESO retained the services of
consultants to carry out a detailed study to determine the least-cost
method of transmitting the Ruzizi II energy to Burundi. The consultants
(EdF) have found that the least costly method of bringing this energy to
Bujumbura was to construct a 110 kV transmission line (83 km) from
Ruzizi II to Bubanza, where it would be joined to the 110 kV Rwegura
Bujumbura line now under construction.  The commissioning of the Rwegura
generating station and its transmission line is scheduled before the end of
1986.
2.22      The foregoing concerns the requirements to meet the energy needs,
but REGIDESO will have difficulty meeting the daily peak demand in 1986.
The capacity of the existing 70 kV line from Ruzizi is about 9.5 MW and
about 2.5 MW could be generated in the diesel station. Thus, with about a
maximum of 2 MW out of Mugere during the dry season, after 1985 when the
peak is expected to exceed i4 MW, it will be necessary for REGIDESO to
institute a load shedding program. This will no longer be a problem after
the Rwegura generating station (18 MW) is commissioned in late 1986.
2.23        In accordance with the Government's strategy (para. 2.28) to
extend the availability of electricity to as yet unserved markets, the
consultants also studied the possibility of extending the system to provide
service to potential new consumers in the areas and small towns surrounding
Cibitoke and Bubanza and found that these extensions would be justified
(para. 6.07).   The provision of electrical services to six low-income
districts of the capital was also studied and found justified (para. 6.10).
Long-Term Power Development Plan
2.24         In the past, Burundi did not have a plan which ranked the
various alternative sources of its potential hydro sites in order of
priority.   As a result of the anticipated growth  in  the demand  for
electrical energy, the Guvernment engaged Lahmeyer International of
Frankfurt, Germany (funded by FED in 1983) to carry out a comprehensive
study of the hydroelectric resources of Burundi.   Lahmeyer identified



- 19 -
94 potential sites, and after prellminaty investigation, reduced the number
which could be considered as potential sources of power to 41, with a total
output of 285 KW, capable of generating about 1,130 GWh annually.
2.25      Lahmeyer, studied the demand for electrical energy until the year
2005, and prepared three forecasts of load growth (para. 2.17): optimistic,
pessimistic and average.   The recommended development schedule for all
three cases was as following:

The Government is reviewing the report and has not started work on the
planned projects.
2.26       However, the Lahmeyer study was limited to Burundi, and did not
take into consideration the possibility of further regional development
which may be more attractive when the needs of Rwanda and the Kivu region
of Zaire are also considered. IDA drew the Government's attention to this
omission and subsequently discussed this subject with EGL  (para.  2.04)
during the appraisal and as a result EGL requested appropriate funds from
FED and the Governments of Italy and Federal Republic of Germany to carry
out further studies covering the total needs of the Great Lakes Region.
FED funded the studies leading to the Ruzizi II proiect and, in order to
ensure that the development of electric power facilities in the area is
carried out in accordance with a least-cost development plan, has indicated
that it is interested in funding another study covering regional needs.
IDA is of the opinion that power supply should be considered on a regional
basis and therefore, if FED or the Governments of Italy or Federal Republic
of Germany are unable to allocate funds, EGL should try other international
resources, such as UNDP, or IDA would give consideration to the possibility
of an engineering credit to EGL with the guarantee of the three Governments
for this study to be carried out during 1986. The proposed timetable for
the studies and implementation of the regional project is given in
Annex 9.  IDA would be given the opportunity to comment on the terms of
reference, review and comment on the recommendations, and seek an agreement
with the governments on a long-term power generation plan, based on the
findings of the study.

Governmeent Strategy in the Power Sector
2.28      The strategy of the Government has been to reduce its dependeucy
on foreign sources for the supply of electrical energy, -which it regards as
being vital to the economy and the security of Burundi.  Thus it has given
top priGrity to the development of the Rwegura hydroelectric project which
in IDA's opinion was not the least cost solution, when the electricity
needs are considered on a regional basis.   However, it later recogLized
the advantages of the development of Ruzizi II and joined in its
construction in order to meet an anticipated growth in demand. With the
construction of both of these hydroelectric projects, Burundi is expected



- 21 -
to have an oversupply of electric power from the interconnected system
until end 1993 (para. 2.19). Therefore, the Government recognizes that the
next major task to be addressed would be the supply of electric power to
potential new consumers by extending the existing grid. Part of the funds
provided under the proposed project would be used to help achieve this
objective by the construction of 30 kV lines to supply the small towns
around the Bujumbura area.
IDA Strategy in the Power Sector
2.29      The Association's objectives in the power sector are:
(a)   to help create a soand and efficient power supply organization
through training and substantial upgrading of its managerial,
financial and technical performance;
(b)   to  support  the  least-cost expansion  of  electric  generating
capacity and the supply of electricity to unserved areas of the
country in order to foster greater economic development and
growth, to improve the quality of life and to keep down costs of
energy to householders; and
Cc)   to assure sound financial and economic policies in the power
sector including tariff structure and levels.
Objective (b) includes the sub-objective of fostering future cooperation of
the Governments to develop additional regional projects if they represent
the least-cost development options.
IDA's Participation in the Power Sector
2.30       In support of these objectives, in 1983 IDA participated in the
financing of the regional Ruzizi II Hydroelectric Project (Credits 1419-BU,
1420-Rw, 1421-ZR). The proposed project would be the second credit for the
power sector of Burundi. It is a complement to the first, and would allow
the Burundian share of the power from Ruzizi II to be available to
Burundian consumers. It would also improve the sector performance in terms
of quality and reliability of supply, and expand the existing distribution
network.    The project would  also  support  staff  training needs,  and
fiuancial and management capabilities. Funds for complementary works for
the rehabilitation and expansion of the Rwandan electricity network were
approved in June 1984 (CR 1495-RW), and Zaire has requested funds for
similar work in the Kivu province of Zaire; the latter project was
appraised in November 1984.
III. THE BORROWER AND THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
The Borrower
3.01       The Borrower would be the Government of the Republic of Burundi
who would relend US$12.0 million equivalent to REGIDESO, the power project
implementing agency, on terms detailed in para. 5.05.   USS0.15 million



- 22 -
would be provided to DUB through the MPWEM, for the follow up in 1987 and
1988 of the dissemination program of cooking stoves (para. 4.15), and
US$0.15 million to MPWEM for the services of a petroleum adviser
(para. 4.16).
REGIDESO
3.02       REGIDESO is a Government-owned enterprise created and organized
by the Decree 1/196 dated October 2, 1968. The objective of REGIDESO is to
generate,  transmit  and  distribute  electricity;  to  pump,  treat  and
distribute water; and to execute or supervise studies and works for new
electricity and water facilities. These duties are being carried out in a
satisfactory manner, limited to some extent by a scarcity of foreign funds
for maintenance expenses and scarcity of trained operators and qualified
management.   Therefore REGIDESO needs technical assistance in management
and training, which the proposed project addresses (paras. 4.12 and 4.14).
According to the Decree, its electricity and water tariffs would be
periodically adjusted to obtain a 'reasonable' rate of return on the net
revalued assets in operation. REGIDESO has a monopoly on the distribution
of electricity throughout the country and supply of water in urban centers,
but in fact it only operates in the urban centres of Bujumbura, Gitega,
Iuramvya and Bururi for electricity and in Bujumbura and 25 secondary
centers for water.   The electricity and water operations were organized
jointly  originally,  because  of  the  scarcity  of  qualified  management
personnel.   Now that the organization has grown,  the advisability of
separating electricity and water operations might be raised.   However,
strengthening of the existing organization has been considered to be the
first priority and management assistance has been included as a component
of the project. Electricity and water accounts and operations are already
separated and distinct, and the possibility of a formal division with a
joint administrative department would be the subject of discussion with
REGIDESO and management consultants upon completion of the management study
(para. 3.05). REGIDESO will also be the executing agency of a water supply
sector institutional and water tariffs study which is scheduled to begin
before mid 1985 with financing provided under an existing loan from the
African Development Fund (Bujumbura Water Supply Project - Phase 11). This
study is intended to clarify the respective responsabilities in the water
supply sector of REGIDESO and DHER, the latter being also responsible for
water supply in rural areas. Management assistance to be provided within
the proposed project would closely coordinate with the consultants carrying
out the water supply sector institutional and tariff study.
3.03        REGIDESO operates under the supervision of MPWEM through a six
member Board of Directors.   The Director-General of Energy, a statutory
member of the Board,  is appointed chairman by MPWEM.   Other statutory
members are the Directors-General of the Ministries of Public Health,
Planning, and the Director of Taxation. One of the two remaining members
is appointed by the Chamber of Commerce to represent high-volume industrial
consumers and, the other by the Municipality of Bujumbura to represent
small consumers. These latter appointments require the approval of MPWEM.
The Board is responsible for all decisions necessary and useful to the
accomplishment of REGIDESO's objectives, and it is solely empowered to make
decisions   regarding   REGIDESO's   assets;   to   establish   REGIDESO's
administrative and financial rules; to regulate personnel organization; to



- 23 -
propose tariff changes to Government through the MPWEM; and to prepare the
annual budget.   The Board has carried out these responsibilities  in a
reasonably satisfactory manner without excessive Government interference.
However, major investment decisions are made by the MPWEM.   The General
Manager, who is responsible for REGIDESO's day-to-day operations, is
appointed by the President of the Republic on the recommendation of the
Minister of MPWEM and the approval of the Board of Directors. Two account
controllers (Commissaires aux comptes) are appointed by the Minister of
Finance with wide powers to verify the company accounts, and to check the
accounting  systems  and  procedures.    They  submit  a yearly  report  of
verification to the Ministry of Finance and to MPWEM.
3.04          REGIDESO's organization chart is shown in Annex 11.   Two
managers, who are also appointed by the President of the Republic according
to the same procedure as for the General Manager, report to the General
Manager.   The present General Manager was appointed to his position in
March 1985. Previously, he was the Technical Manager for eleven years, in
which capacity he has proved to be competent and efficient. The Technical
Manager supervises the electricity, water, garage, and maintenance
divisions.   The electricity department is sub-divided into five units:
project studies and planning, generation, transmission and distribution,
construction, and Bujumbura operations.  The Administrative and Financial
Manager supervises four units:   personnel,  accounting, purchasing,  and
billing and  collection.   Both  managers, including  the new  Technical
Manager, are competent and efficient. In general, the responsibilities of
the senior staff members are carried out in a satisfactory manner but their
support  staff  lack  appropriate  skill,   particularly  in  marketing,
accounting, budgeting and forecasting.
Management and Personnel
3.05          REGIDESO employs a total staff of 636 which is about average
for its size as an electricity and water utility in Africa. As shown in
Annex 12, there are 39 cadres (managers and university graduates), or 6
percent of the total staff, and 597 skilled and unskilled workers. Staff
is allocated as follows: 345 for electricity, 186 for water, 105 for
administration.  Between 1979 and 1981, the number of REGIDESO staff rose
by 37% while the number of consumers rose 14%.  The ratio of consumers to
staff is now 18. 7/ One of the tasks of the management assistance team
would be to improve this ratio (para. 4.12).  Future increases of skilled
and unskilled workers should be monitored carefully to be kept within the
limits of the increase in customer base as the present ratio appears low.
The management is generally weak because of a general lack of trained
personnel both administrative and   technical, and a component of this
project would address tnis important inadequacy (para. 4.14).  Currently
four expatriates, funded by the Federal Republic of Germany, work for the
electricity and water divisions; two senior advisors and two technicians.
Furthermore, in July 1984 REGIDESO retained the services of P.A. Conseil of
France, to carry out a management diagnosis and define methods to improve
accounting and financial procedures, using funds   provided by PPF P245
7/ Botswana 9, Malawi 12, Zaire 21, Swaziland 23, Sudan 24, Madgascar 38,
Kenya 40, Ethiopia 60, Mauritius 74.



- 24 -
(para. 4.01).   The draft report was completed in March 1985; follow-up
action is recommended as in paras. 4.12 and 5.08.
Accounting and Audit
3.06      REGIDESO's accounting department is under the supervision of the
Administrative and Financial Manager. It is obliged by statute to produce
separate financial statements for its branches in the country.   The 1983
balance sheets, income statements, funds flow statements, and value added
statements were issued in April 1984, in the the Government's standard
accounts format.
3.07          Aware of weaknesses in its accounting operations, REGIDESO
requested IDA in 1979 to provide it with funds for consultants in
accounting and auditing.   REGIDESO received for this purpose US$100,000
under Technical Assistance Credit 917-BU, which was later increased to
US$125,000. In May 1981 the Ministry of Planning and REGIDESO entered into
a contract with Touche Ross of U.K. to review the accounting procedures and
revalue assets. The August 1981 report contained separate accounts for the
electricity and water departments, and a revaluation of the fixed assets
held by REGIDESO at the end of 1980.   Touche Ross also carried out a
revaluation of the 1981 assets.   In July 1984, REGIDESO entered into a
contract with Treuarbeit, of Frankfurt Germany, to audit the 1982 accounts;
the interim report was completed in October 1984.   However, because of
shortage of funds, REGIDESO did not contract the auditing of the 1983
accounts.   This exercise is being financed from funds made available
through the extension of the PPF P245 (para. 4.03).  During negotiations
agreement was reached with REGIDESO to complete the 1983 audit, and
thereafter to have its accounts audited annually by an independent auditor
acceptable to IDA, and to submit to IDA the audited financial statements
and auditor's report as soon as available but beginning with 1986 no later
than six months after the end of the fiscal year.
3.08        During negotiations it was agreed that REGIDESO would maintain
separate accounts for its electricity and water operations and would
incorporate therein an annual revaluation of its fixed assets in
operation.
3.09           Budgeting is dealt with by an assistant to the Chief of
Accounting and by a unit reporting to the Chief of Purchasing. Clear lines
of responsibility are lacking and the mission found it necessary to develop
organization charts based on discussions with the various division chiefs.
These organizational weaknesses will be reviewed and remedial action
incorporated within the management assistance program prescribed in
para. 4.12.
Data Processing
3.10             Several departments  (purchasing,  billing and collection
accounting and personnel) rely on a centralized electronic data processing
(EDP) facility of the Government.   Because none of these departments has
personnel familiar with EDP systems, the potential of such systems has not
yet been realized. The need for training in this area was noted by each of
these departments and one of the tasks of the management team (para. 4.12)



- 25 -
and training (para. 4.14) would be to ensure the efficient use of this
management tool. If, during supervision, training on this matter is found
to  proceed  satisfactorily,   REGIDESO  will  seek  financing  for  a
micro-computer.
Insurance
3.11       An earlier mission in May 1981 found that REGIDESO's assets were
not insured through commercial organizations against the usual risks of
fire, explosion, third party, etc. This inadequacy has now been corrected
and all REGIDESO assets are commercially insured through the Soci&tE
d'Assurance du Burundi.
IV. THE PROJECT
Preparation of the Project
4.01       Following the approval of the Ruzizi II Project, and with the
prospect of a significant increase in the amount of electrical power
available to Burundi (paras. 2.09 and 2.10), the Government proceeded with
the next obvious step, i.e. study of a least-cost solution to bring the
power from Ruzizi II to the center of demand in Bujumbura, and to extend
the availability of electricity service to unserved markets.  As a result,
IDA received and subsequently approved on March 28, 1983 a request from the
Government for a PPF (No. P245) in the amount of US$400.000 to carry out
the following studies in preparation for the proposed project:
(a)   feasibility of a transmission line connecting the Ruzizi II
hydro plant to the Burundian network;
(b)   feasibility of supplying with electricity the provincial
cities of Cibitoke, Rugombo, Mparambo, Bubanza, Mpanda,
Muzinda, and Katumba;
(c)   feasibility of extension of the distribution network of
Bujumbura  to   six   low-income   districts   where   urban
infrastructure was developed through IDA Urban Development
Project and an UNDP project;
(d)   a new tariff structure for REGIDESO; and
Ce)   management  consultant's  services  to  REGIDESO  to  define
methods to improve REGIDESO's management practices.
4.02      REGIDESO retained the services of Electricite de France (EdF) who
have completed their reports on the first four items covering the expansion
of the transmission and distribution networks.   P.A. Conseil (France),
consultants for the fifth item, began their services in July 1984, and
their draft report on management was completed in March 1985.
4.03      On the basis of the foregoing, t'.e Government requested that IDA
provide part of the funds needed to expand the transmission and



- 26 -
distribution facilities.   As a result, a mission visited Burundi in the
later part of June and early July 1984, to appraise the proposed project.
During appraisal, additional components, were added to the project.   In
addition, in order to expedite the project, the Government requested that
the PPF advance be raised to US$900,000 so that it could retain consultants
for the design, call for, and analysis of tenders for the power project.
Objectives
4.04        The main objective of the proposed project is to augment and
improve the reliability of supply of electricity to Bujumbura and it.
environs, by providing transmission and distribution facilities to receive
an additional source of power (Ruzizi II), to serve additional consumers,
with aview towards sustaining and improving the economic growth of the
industrial, commercial and domestic sectors of the country.  Extension of
the distribution network to low income districts of Bujumbura would
substitute electricity for kerosene for lighting, thus contributing to the
reduction of the petroleum import bill while improving the lives of those
people  served.      Extension  of  the  subtransmission  and  distribution
facilities to the seven regional towns in the north west of the capital,
would in addition to substituting electricity for kerosene for lighting,
also substitute hydro-based electricity to diesel generation in the small
private diesel plants which are operated in the coffee drying factory,
farms and missions. In addition, the provision of management assistance to
REGIDESO, establishment of a training center and the training of REGIDESO
staff, would result in improved service and financial performance through
better operating, financial and maintenance practices and strengthening of
investment planning capability. Two technical assistance programs to MPWEM
would help the Government: (i) to devise strategies to obtain imported
petroleum products at least cost (para. 4.16); and (ii) to follow up in
1987 and 1988 the dissemination of improved charcoal cooking stoves and
associated energy-saving techniques (para. 4.15).
Project Description
4.05      The main features of the project are summarized as follows:
(a) Extension of the Power Transmission and Distribution System
(i)  a  110 kV  transmission  line  (83 km) from  Ruzizi  II to
Bubanza;
(ii)  construction  of  110/30  kV  substations  in  Bubanza  and
Cibitoke, two 30 kV subtransmission lines (42 kn) to supply
the regional towns of Rugombo, Mparambo, Mpanda and Muzinda,
a 15 or 30 kV feeder to Katumba and distribution networks in
these towns;
(iii)  construction of distribution networks to consumers in six
low-income   districts   of   Bujumbura:   Bwiza,   Buyenzi,
Cibitoke 8/, Kamenge, Kinama and Musaga; and,
8/ The town of Cibitoke is situated 61 km north of Bujumbura on the road to
the Rwanda border; the Cibitoke district of Bujumbura is a new district
developed in the northeast of the capital.



- 27 -
(iv) rehabilitation of the Ruzizi I Bujumbura 70 kV line and
Bujumbura substation.
(b) Consultancy; Technical Assistance and Training to REGIDESO
(i) consulting engineering services;
(ii)  management assistance to REGIDESO; and,
(ili) construction and equipping of a training center and
technical assistance for the training of REGIDES0 staff;
(c) Technical Assistance to MPWSM
(i) follow up of the dissemination program of improved charcoal
stoves in Bujumbura (which is being carried out under the
Urban Development Project, CR 1409-BU); and,
(ii)  technical assistance to MPWEM for the services of an advisor
on petroleum matters.
Rzuzizi II/Bubanza 110 kV Transmission Line
4 06f       The single-circuit 110 kV transiission line (Map IBRD 18517)
would extend in a generally south-easterly direction from Ruzizi II
paralleling the existing 70 kV line until about the Kagunzi River, where it
would turn eastward to Bubanza.  Studies, funded by PPF P245, showed this
as the least-cost solution. Two other solutions were considered, but were
rejected because of cost: a transmission line direct to Bujumbura and a
transmission line to Rwegura, with the power transmitted from Rwegura over
the  110 kV  line now under  construction.   A fourth alternative,  the
upgrading of the existing 70 kV line to 110 kV, was studied, but this was
found to be impracticable because Bujumbura could not accept the long
shut-down needed to improve this line.   In the proposed alternative, a
single line carries power from both Rwegura and Ruzizi II, from Bubanza to
Bujumbura.   This was considered to be acceptable because the expected
outages would deprive the city of electricity for only a few hours each
year and a second line would be constructed when justified by the increase
in demand.  Bubanza, located 40 km north of Bujumbura, is well placed to
become a major dispatching point for the future development of the Burundi
transmission network. The caprscity of the transmission line would be about
40 MW, sufficient to supply the interconnected system in the event of
failure of the Rwegura Bubanza line.    The aluminum conductors with a
cross-section of 181 mm2 would be carried on galvanized steel towers, which
would also support a ground wire (94.1 mm2 of cross-section) for lightning
protection.   The line would cross Zairian and Rwandan territory, and a
condition of effectiveness is evidence satisfactory to the IDA, that REwanda
and Zaire would provide the right-of-way for the line, and would allow free
access to REGIDESO for all materials, equipment, and personnel necessary
for the construction, and continued operation and maintenance of the
transmission line outside of Burundian territory.  No problem is expected
in discussions with Rwandan and Zairian Governments because of the
precedent of the present 70 kV transmission line linking Mururu (Ruzizi I)
and Bujumbura and because Ruzizi II is being built w'-th the understanding



- 28 -
that the facility will be connected with the networks of the three
countries involved.
Cibitoke and Bubanza Substations
4.07        Additional switching and control equipment would be provided
under the proposed project at Ruzizi II to permit power to be transmitted
directly to Burundi. An intermediate substation at Cibitoke would contain
a 110/30 kV transformer (5 MVA) with the necessary switching and protective
equipment with provision for a 30 kV line towards Mparambo and Rugombo in
the north.  The major switching station at Bubanza would provide for the
incoming 110 kV lines from Rwegura and Ruzizi II and one outgoing line to
Bujumbura.   Space would be provided for a second line to Bujumbura, for
extension of 110 kV to Matongo (a potential mining center), and to Gitega,
at some time in the future. Two 110/30 kV transformers (each 5 NVA) would
be provided, one for local supply and the other as a stand-by.   The
rehabilitation needs of the Razizi I Bujumbura 70 kV line and the Bujumbura
substation (US$0.3 million; para. 2.07) would also be financed from the
proposed project. The substation and the 70 kV line connecting Ruzizi I to
Bujumbura are presently owned and operated by tha Zairian national
electricity company S.N.EL..   S.N.EL. and REGIDESO have discussed the
transfer of rights for the line and substation to REGIDESO which has the
greater interest in their effective operatikon and maintenance. A condition
of disbursement for this component would therefore be that REGIDESO has
obtained legal rights for the substation and line adequate to protect the
interests of Burundi and   A.
30 kV Subtransmission Lines
4.08      The 30 kV subtransaission lines, single circuits on wood poles,
would supply Rugumbo and Mparambo from Cibitoke (21 km), and Mpanda and
Mhuzinda from Bubanza (21 km).   IDA reviewed and is satisfied with the
designs proposed by the consultants for the transmission lines and
substations.
Distribution Extensions
4.09          The feasibility of extending electrical services into six
low-income  districts  in  Bujuabura, Cibitoke, Kinaia, Kamenge, Musaga,
Bwiza and Buyenzi (Map IBRD 18516) was studied by EdF. In 1983, the total
population of these districts was 127,000. About 13,600 a of 10 kV, and
106,430 a of 400 kV distribution lines, and 30 transformers of various
cspacit!es (50 kVA to 630 kVA) totalling a capacity of 7,550 kVA would be
installed to connect 3,300 new consumers in 1986 and 1987.   Details are
given in Annex 13.  The infrastructure work in the district of Musaga was
constructed with funds of an UNDP project; those of the other five
districts  were   financed  from  the  IDA  Urban  Development  Project
(CR  1049-BU).   The urban infrastructure provided within IDA and UNDP
credits included street improvements, drainage canals, additional water
distribution standpipes and construction of public lighting and electricity
networks along main streets. Interest from households for electrification
in the Kamenge, Bwiza and Buyenzi has been relatively high although no
special effort was made by REGIDESO to promote house electrification at
that early stage. There were 724 consumers in June 1984 and this



- 29 -
represented about 4% of the estimated number of households in these
districts.   The consultants evaluated the potential demand taking into
account past trends, analysis of expected number of connections with
respect to household incomes and actions proposed by EdF to be taken by
REGIDESO to provide better terms for connection charges.  To develop the
distribution networks in the regional towns of north of Bujumbura, about
20,500 m of 400 V lines and 21 transformers of various capacities totalling
2,000 kVA would be installed to connect about 360 consumers, a few of which
will be supplied directly from the 30 kV lines, e.g. the military camps,
flour mill, tobacco drying factory, hospitals, missions, farms.   Details
are given in Annex 14.  The town of Katumba, about 15 km from Bujumbura
would be provided with electricity from Bujumbura-Uvira line, owned by
S.N.EL., by a short feeder line; the voltage of the feeder line will be
determined following review of the feasibility studies being carried out by
the Consultants to S.N.EL. within the proposed Zaire Power II Project.
Four pole mounted transformers of a total capacity of 200 kVA and about
1,000 m of 400 V distribution lines would be constructed to connect about
60 consumers. The proposed design is acceptable.
4.10        REGIDESO requires the new consumers to pay a connectlon charge
of about BuF 60,000 (US$512) which is about the cost of the connection
material and equipment, including meters. REGIDESO is reluctant to delete
meters on the grounds that, in general, consumption increases quite
rapidly.  9/   EdF estimated  that households with incomes greater  than
BuF 26,00O7month would be able and willing to finance house wiring and the
actual  connection  charges.    This  would  represent  about  29%  of  the
households  in  Bwiza and  10% in the other districts.   The number of
additional consumers is estimated to be around 1,100. The consultants also
estimated that reducing the bulk payment of connection charges to about BuF
30,000 (US$256) would lower to BuF 20,000/month the threshold at which a
household income easily affords the wiring and connection expenses,
allowing  2,200  additional  families  to  afford  these  expenses.    The
management of REGIDESO recently decided to collect the connection charges
in monthly installments over six months in Bujumbura and twelve months
outside the capital. The Development Bank of Burundi provides loans for 1
to ljyears for connection charges and house wiring; employees of the
private companies are given salary advances for such expenses.  Therefore
it is expected that in the implementation period of the proposed project
about 3,720 new consumers in total will be connected; this means about 7
connections per day, which is within the implementation capability of
REGIDESO (paras. 3.05 and 4.22). About 25% of the households would thus be
electrified by the end of the project. The actual average consumption for
the whole of Bujumbura which is about 4,157 kWh/year per c-)nnection, shows
the tendency in the past to restrict electrification to the larger
consumers.   A study for defining optimal standards for connections,  a
connection charges policy and amount of consumption to be charged at the
lifeline tariff rate is included in che proposed project.   The terms of
reference  and  the  consultants  would  be  acceptable  to  IDA.    During
negotiations agreement was reached that this study would be completed by
June 30, 1986 and that the Government and REGIDESO would implement promptly
9/ Random checks among existing consumers show that many of them consume
around 2500-5800 kWh per year; the average consumption for all Bujumbura
is about 4,157 kWh/year.



- 30 -
thereafter and following an exchange or u!ews with IDA, a new connections
policy based on the recommendations of the study. The objective of the
policy should be that, where additional connections are economically
justified, demand is not deterred by unnecessarily high capital charges
that could be spread over time through the tariffs.
Consulting Engineering Services
4.11        Consulting engineering services would cover the preparation of
bid documents, evaluation of bids and construction supervision for the
power transmission and distribution components.  The cost of engineering
services is estimated to be US$0.95 million of which US$0.8 million would
be in foreign exchange.
Management Assistance
4.12           The draft  report  of  the  study  financed under  PPF  P245
(para. 4.01) to improve management, accounting and financial planning was
completed in March 1985 and discussed during negotiations. A condition of
Credit Effectiveness would be that REGIDESO and IDA would agree on an
action program, based on the recommaendations of the management diagnosis
study,  to  strengthen  REGIDESO's  management  performance,  to  improve
administratLve and financial operations and to implement corrective
measures. The action program would be implemented with the assistance of a
management team. During negotiations agreement was reached that, REGIDESO
would retain the services of a management assistance team at the latest by
December  31,  1985.   The terms of reference and qualifications of the
personnel would  be acceptable to  IDA.   IDA has estimated  that  these
services would cost about US$1.15 million of which US$1.0 million would be
in foreign exchange. The main emphasis of this component would be in the
areas of accounting, finance, and investment planning, although other
activities such as procurement and marketing would be given appropriate
attenticn.
Studies
4.13         With the assistance of the management team, and possibly an
engineering  consultant,  a  ten-year  least-cost  development  plan  for
investments  in  the electricity    sector,  taking into account  regional
potential projects and demand would be prepared for review by IDA by June
30,  1986.   This plan, would be updated and discussed annually with IDA.
Close cooperation would be required with EGL (para. 2.04) DHER (para.
2.13),  and  the  training consultants  (para.  4.14).    Need  for  such  a
long-term development plan derives from the presence of the electrical
energy surplus (para. 2.19) which poin.s to the fact that Burundi
over-invested in generation facilities, and under-invested in transmission
and distribution. A study of the long-run marginal cost of electricity and
tariff structure is being carried out financed by PPF 245 and will be
completed in mid-1985.   An update of the study will be carried out 1"
19871198P in parallel with the tariff study to determine the level of the
tariffs for the sale of electricity by SINELAC to the three national
utilities. Funds provided under this component would also be utilised for
the distribution connections policy study (para. 4.10), a revaluation of
REGIDESO'S assets at the end of 1984, its subsequent revisions and audit of



- 31 -
Its 1984 accounts.   IDA has estimated that these studies would cost about
US$0.175 million.
Training
4.14       REGIDESO does not carry out organized training programs for its
staff. Training under the proposed project would be both for the Technical
and the Administrative and Financial Departments. The former would Include
vocational orientation and advanced vocational training for operators,
foreimu and professional staff, applicable to thelr current jobs and for
future responsibilities, with an emphasis on the introduction of new
technologles such as data processing.   The AdministratLve and Financial
Department's training would include a comprehensive orientation for newly
recrulted staff and advanced traLnitg both for current jobs and for new
responsibilities for existing staff.   During negotiations, agreement was
reached with REGIDESO that by October 1, 1985 a Training ffauager and
Burundian trainers satisfactory to IDA, would be appointed to act as
counterparts to three training consultants to be financed as part of this
project and to be appointed by the same date. The Training Manager would
report directly to the General Manager. Description of the proposed action
plan and of the requlred qualiflcations for holders of these posts ls given
in Annex 15. One firm would supply the three tralners, the senior of whom
should have responsibllity for the design and construction of the proposed
training center (physLcal facilities), and the preparation and issue of bid
documents for the equipment, also to be financed as part of the proposed
project.   The senior consuLtant would have a broad knowledge  of  the
organization of training activities in a power utillity, including
on-the-job and in-center training with speclfic reference to the operation
and maintenance of hydroelectrlc facilities, the second would have training
expertise in construction, operations and maintenance of transuission and
distribution systems, while the tbird would be competent in teaching
current utility financial and accounting practices. The terms of reference
and the qualifications of the consultants, which were discussed during
negotiations and which will be further discussed with GTZ (Annex 15), would
be subject to IDA's approval.   With an allowance of .oout US$0.3 million
for equipment and facilities, the total cost of this component is estimated
to  be  US$1.5  million.    Agreement  was  reached  with  REGIDESO  during
negotiations:
(a) that the training consultants and their counterparts would
prepare a detailed plan, acceptable  to IDA. for training of
technical, financial and administrative personnel and manpower
projections for the next five years; and,
(b) to initiate a training program by September 1, 1986.
Follow-up of DisseminatLon Program of I!proved Charcoal Stoves in Bujumbura
4.15          This component would be a continuation of the current stove
dissemination program which is part of IDA's Urban Development Project
(CR 1049-BU), and would be carried out by DUB, the project unit which has
been responsible for the work to date. The closing date of Credit 1049-WU
is presently December 31, 1985; but it is expected that the date will be
extended by at least one year, to December 31, 1986.  The funds of the



- 32 -
proposed project would be used to sustain the dissemination program in 1987
and 1988. The technical objective of the stove program has been achieved;
with assistance to modify the design by an ESMAP mission, the Urban
Development Project has produced an improved stove which, at a slightly
higher production cost than a traditional stove, consumes about 30% less
charcoal. The problem now is one of how to market this modified stove. A
marketing rather than educationally-oriented. promotion campaign is being
set up within the Urban Development Project, aiming at the training of
artisans in production of the new stove, and of about 20 "animatrices' in
methods of disseminating the stoves and associated energy-saving techniques
of cooking to Bujumbura householders.   This campaign would start by mid
1985 and should be sustained at least four years in order to facilitate
gradual behavior changes from traditional cooking practices.   It is also
considered essential that such a promotion program should be applied
without interruption; and therefore the proposed component would provide
for continuity when CR 1049-BU is closed.   The total base cost of the
component is estimated as US$135,000 of which US$100,000 is foreign
currency cost. It is intended that the proposed Forestry II Project, now
being appraised, would contain a provision for training in charcoal
production and close cooperation would be maintained between the Urban
Development Project and the two proposed projects.  The Government will
continue the dissemination program beyond the closing date of C% 1049-BU,
within the same institutional framework as agreed or reviewed within the
Urban Development Project and it will submit a separate completion report
when the program is terminated in end-1988.
Technical Assistance to the MPWEM
4.16         This component of the project would cover the services of an
adviser to MPEWN who would assist in devising strategies which may be
employed to obtain imported petroleum products at least cost, and to
develop pricing policies for the sale of these products within Burundi and
to train two Burundian couaterparts. The mission has included an allowance
of US$100,000 to cover the cost of services, travel and subsistence of the
advisor. Services would be spread over a period of two years, with short
visits to Burundi. Travel to potential vendors and distributors would also
be required. Travel expenses in foreign currency of the adviser will also
be financed from the credit.   Agreement was reached with the Government
during negotiations that an adviser acceptable to IDA would be appointed by
December 31, 1985 and that his terms of reference, based on those prepared
by an ESMAP mission would be agreed with IDA.
Cost Estimates
4.17        The total project cost is estimated to be BuF 2,961 million
(US$2'.8 million equivalent) not including duties and taxes which the
Government has agreed would not be levied on the project, and excluding
interest during construction. The foreign exchange component is estimated
to be BuF 2,320 million (US$17.05 million equivalent), about 78% of the
total project cost.   The total finaicing requirement, including interest
during construction (BuF 377 million; US$2.7 million equivalent), is
estimated to be BuF 3,338 million (US$24.5 million). The estimated cost of
the principal components of the project are shown on che following page.

Basis for Estimates
4.18          The cost estimates for the consulting services, management
assistance, training, petroleum adviser and cooking stoves foLlow up
program have been prepared by IDA, (paras. 4.11-4.16) while the costs of
the other components have been estimated by RECIDESO's consultants, EdF
International. These cost estimates were reviewed by IDA and were found to
be reasonable. Physical contingencies of 10% were added to each component
to provide an allowance for unforeseen increases in the volume of work.
Price contingencies  for the project cost presented in BuF are based on
domestic inflation estimated as follows: 18% in 1985, 12% in 1986, and 10%
from 1987 onward; price contingencies for the project cost expressed in
USDollars are based on an international inflation rate as follows: 5Z in
1985, 7.5% in 1986 and 8% in 1987 and 1988. The price contingencies were
considered on the basis of the BuF exchange rate being adjusted to
compensate for the difference between domestic and international inflation.
Financing Plan
4.19       The proposed IDA credit of US$12.3 million would finance about
56% of the estimated project cost of BuF 2,961 million (US$21.8 million
equivalent) and about 72% of the estimated foreign currency expenses of the
project of BuF 2,320 million (US$17.05 million), in both cases excluding
interest during construction. It would be used to finance:
(a) repayment of the PPF (US$0.9 million) for the preliminary
engineering study and detailed design and preparation of
contract documents;
(b) 100% of the foreign cost of the engineering services,
management assistance, and studies;
(c)  90% of  the totai cost of the  110 kV  transmission line;
Bubanza and Cibitoke substations and training center; and,
(d) 100% of the foreign cost of the petroleum adviser and follow-
up of the cooking stoves dissemination program.
4.20       Colenders would finance US$7.3 million.  The Government informed
IDA that funds would be providad by the Belgian Government, CCCE of France
and Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) of Germany.
CCE would finance the expansion of the distribution network in the low-
income districts of Bujumbura and the distribution networks in the regional
towns north of Bujumbura (para. 4.08 and 4.09).   The project has been
accepted by the common French Burundese economic commission in May 1984.
The Belgian Governament would finance the 30 kV subtransmission lines. GTZ
would finance the technical assistance part (US$0.8 million) of the
training component (para. 4.14). A condition of effectiveness of the IDA
credit would be the receipt of evidence satisfactory to IDA, that the
effectiveness conditions of the other external sources of funds have been
met.
4.21            REGIDESO  would  finance  local  currency  costs  of  about
US$2.15 million equivalent (10% of the project total cost, excluding IDC).
A summary of the detailed financing plan shown in Annex 16 is as follows:

Status of Engineering and Implementation
4.22          REGIDES0 would be responsible for the implementation of the
power transmission and distribution components of the project and would be
assisted  by engineering  consultants.    REGIDESO  signed an engineering
contract with EdF of Franc.2 (the consultants for the initial study). This
consultant is acceptable to IDA, and during negotiations, agreement was
reached that REGIDESO would continue to employ consultants satisfactory to
IDA.  The construction of the 110 kV and 30 kV transmission lines and
substations would be carried out by contractors. REGIDESO has experience
in building 30 kV, 10 kV and 400 V distribution lines and substations, and
would be competent to carry out similar work for this project. Bowever,
the volume of work would be too great, and REGIDESO intends to concentrate
its work crews on the distribution extensions, for which they are well
qualified, and call tenders for the the 30 kV lines. The preparation of
preliminary designs, and tender documents for the transmission lines are
scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1985 and construction work completed
by mid-1988 as shown on the implementation schedule (Annex 17).  Tenders
for the electrification of the peripheral districts of Bujumbura would be
issued by June 30, 1985 with a view to completion by December 31, 1987.
These schedules appear reasonable in view of the fact that the work to be
performed does not require major structures. As the contracts will include
commonly purchased material and equipment, and erection services would be
routine in nature, risks of cost overruns are estimated to be small.
Procuremnnt
4.23       The materials and equipment including erection services, to be
financed by the proposed IDA Credit would be purchased in accordance with
IDA's guidelines for international competitive bidding.   Procurement for
cofinanced items of the project would be in accordance with the funding
agency's normal practices. Services to be provided by consultants and to
be financed by IDA would be awarded according to IDA guidelines on the
appointment  of consultants.   On  the  following  page  is  a  tabulation
indicating the method of procurement of the various components.

Disbursements
4.24      The proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed over 5 years on the
basis given in para. 4.19.  The remaining funds would be disbursed from
other colenders and from LtEGIDESO.  The closing date for the Credit would
be December 31, 1989. The disbursement schedule (Annex 18) differs from
the average power project and from Burundi project profiles because IDA
would be providing funds for a limited portion (i.e. only the transmission
line and substations) of a complete power project (i.e. including
generation).    The  schedule  is  consistent with  the  transmission  and
distribution project profile for the Eastern Africa Region. A condition of
disbursement for the expenses for the rehabilitation of the Bujumbura
substation now owned by S.N.EL. (Zaire) would be that REGIDESO obtain legal
rights adequate to protect the interests of Burundi and IDA (para. 4.07).
4.25       A special account (revolving fund) of US$0.5 million, financed
under the Project, would be established in an account to be opened in the
Bank of the Republic of Burundi for the purpose of alleviating Government's
difficulty in pre-financing expenditures to be reimbursed under the IDA
Credit, and operated under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.  The
special account would be replenished on a semi-annual basis upon receipt of
docmentary evidence to be provided by REGIDESO. Should any disbursements
be made from the special account which are not-acceptable to IDA, the



- 37 -
Government would deposit the corresponding amount into the Special
Account. Agreements on terms and conditions for using the Special Account
were reached at negotiations.
Project Monitoring
4.26        The records and reports necessary to monitor progress of the
project and its evaluation were agreed upon during negotiations.   The
proposed detailed guidelines for a project monitoring system are given in
Annex 19.   The project is expected to be completed by June 30,  1989.
Preparation of a project completion report not later than six months after
project completion was agreed during negotiations.   Some key performance
indicators for REGIDESO during the project implementation period follow:

Environiental Considerations
4.27       The construction of the transmission and distribution facilities
would use commonly known and well-tried practices.   The effect on  the
environment would be as minimal as in other areas of the country.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Present Financial Position
5.01           REGIDESO's financial performance has been constrained  by
inadequate electricity tariffs and high operating expenses for both
electricity and water.   This is evidenced by its 1983 results which show
financial rates of return on revalued assets for electricity and water
operations of 2.1% and 5.8Z, respectively, resulting in a financial rate of
return of 2.8Z for REGIDESO overall.  The operating ratios in 1983 were,
88%, 86% and 87% for electricity operations, water operations and overall
REGIDESO, respectively.   The current ratio of 2.6 reflects the excessive
level of receivables for sales of electricity and water, which were
equivalent to eleven months of billing as of December 31, 1983; reduction
of receivables through more effective billing and persistent collection is
an objective of REGIDESO (para. 5.03). The debt/equity ratio at 61:39 was
high reflecting large borrowings undertaken for expansion of generating
capacity and transmission (para.  2.09).   The financial statements  for
REGIDESO for the year 1983 are summarized in kanex 20. The principal items
are as follows:

---BuF million       ---
Water
Electricity   Supply       Total
Revenues                                  621.5       330.4      951.9
Operating Expenses                       545.7        282.5      828.2
Operating Income                          75.8         47.9      123.7
Net Revalued Assets in Operation
(including allocation of common
service assets)                       3,533,3        832.8    4,366.1
Rate of Return on Revalued Assets        2.1%         5.8%       2.8%
The Decree establishing REGIDESO requires that tariffs should produce a
reasonable' rate of return on net revalued assets in operation. The 1983
returns are considered to be below a reasonable level, and could be
improved progressively primarily through more frequent tariff adjustments
and  attainment  of  cost  reflective  pricing.    For  its  water  supply
operations, revenues should be at least sufficient to cover operating
expenses and debt service and to provide a reasonable contribution to the
investment  program.   During  negotiations, agreement was reached that
REGIDESO would apply this principle and reach agreement with the Government
and IDA on an acceptable level of contribution to its investment program.
For its electricity operations, REGIDESO has agreed to take all measures
necessary including adjustment of its tariff level, to meet rates of return
on its net assets as shown in para.  5.14.   Financial projections for
electricity operations are at Annex 21 (pages 1-4) and for water supply
operations at Annex 21, page 5.
5.02      REGIDESO's capital structure as at 31 December 1983 consists of:
BuF million      BuF million 
Equity
Paid-in Capital                      257.1
Retained Earnings                    388.3
Grants                               820.0
Revaluation Reserve                  976.2
2,441.6       39
Long-Term Debt
Government loans                   2,015.5
Loan from the PR
of China (re. Mugere Project)    1,788.0
Miscellaneous                         78.6
3,882.1       61
6,323.7      100
The long-term debt proportion of 61X is marginally high and should not be
allowed to increase. The policy of the Government of Burundi requires that



- 39 -
REGIDESO pay all financing charges and principal on on-lent funds without
capitalizing interest during construction. Based on its recent performance
experience, REGIDESO may have difficulty for the next two or three years in
generating adequate funds to meet its cash requirements and finance its
investment program, and may be forced to undertake short-term borrowing
from the Government or other sources to ensure coverage of all operating
and capital investment needs. REGIDESO's total indebtness should therefore
be monitored carefully.  During negotiations, it was agreed that REGIDESO
would not incur debt unless internal cash generated for the twelve months
preceding incurrence of the debt is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt
service requirements for any succeeding years.
Receivables
5.03          As of December 31,  1983, total receivables amounted to the
equivalent of 11 months billing for electricity and water.  Of the amount
outstanding, approximately 62% was due from Government and municipalities.
During 1984 these arrears have been reduced by 30% but further improvement
is  required.   During negotiations  it was agreed that the amounts of
receivables for electricity and water consumption: (i) for Government and
municipalities would be reduced to 6 months of billings by December 1986
and 4 months of billings by December 1987 and thereafter; and, (ii) for
other consumers would be reduced to 4 months of billings by December 1985
and 3 months of billings for those consumers billed on a monthly basis and
4 months of billings for consumers billed every two months by December 1986
and thereafter. Preparation of an action plan acceptable to IDA to reduce
Government's and municipalities arrears to 6 months of electricity and
water billings by December 1986, would be a condition of effectiveness.
Financing Plan
5.04       The financing plan for the years 1985 through 1989 is set out in

5.05           The proposed IDA credit of US$12.3 million would be made
available to the Government of Burundi and US$12 million onlent to REGIDESO
for 20 years, including a 5 year grace period, at 9.29%.  The onlending

works program for electricity over the five year period 1985-1989, as
follows: 1985 - 3.9%, 1986 - 16.7%, 1987 - 37.8Z, 1988 - 70.0%, and
1989 - 36.7% with an average of 33% over the period which is satisfactory.



- 41 -
CCCE and the Federal Republic of Germany and Belgium would fund the
remaining components (para. 4.20).
5.07           In addition to the proposed project,  the main investment
expenditures over the period are detailed in paragraph 2.27 (Annex 10).
5.08            REGIDESO has no systematic investment planning and only
rudimentary project accounting and budgeting systems, and requires
extensive assistance to attain acceptable standards in both areas (para.
4.12). The management diagnosis financed under PPF P245,completed in March
1985, offers recommendations which will form the basis of an action program
to improve sales management, accounting and budgeting, investment planning,
marketing and procurement. The action program will be submitted to IDA as
a condition of Credit Effectiveness (para. 4.12) and its implementation
monitored during the life of the project, after approval by IDA.
Tariffs
5.09         Details of Burundi's tariff structure are given in Annex 22.
Electricity tariffs are approved by the Government on the basis of proposal
from the National Price Commission which reviews proposals by MPWEM.
Tariffs were last increased on January 1, 1985 by about 20Z, five years
after the previous increase.  Present tariffs are 10.6 BuF/kWh (US9.2/kWh)
for low voltage service and a demand charge plus energy charge combination
for medium voltage service which currently averages approximately 8.0
BuF/kWh  (US6.8/kWh).    The  1985  increase  would  be  adequate  to meet
projected operating and investment requirements and yield a rate of return
on net fixed assets of 3.8X, an improvement over 1984 performance.   The
1985 increase affected only low voltage tariffs which were increased by
42Z.  The present low voltage tariff level is only 60% of the estimated
LRMC for this voltage (BuF 18.8/kWh - US416.1/kWh) and medium voltage
ariffs are abo   65Z of the LKMC for this voltage level (BuF 12.1/kWh -
USOl. 3/kwh) (para. 6.13).  The LRMC study by EdF International, as revised
by IDA (para. 6.13), shows that the ratio of the low voltage tariffs to the
medium voltage tariffs should be about 1.5 since low voltage power has a
higher cost/kWh than medium voltage power.   Therefore, future increases
should continue to concentrate on low voltage tariffs.
5.10        In addition to cost factors, consideration should also be given
to tariff structure adjustments which will encourage extension of service
to  lower  income  groups.    These  considerations  will  include  cross-
subsidization between and within consumer categories, use of 'inverted'
block rates or 'lifeline' rate structures, and modifications of the
connection charge policy (para. 4.10).  This extension of service policy
has been discussed with REGID6SO and Government both of which suppor   he
concepto
5.11            It was agreed during  negotiations  that a new structure
consistent with the findings of the tariff study (para. 4.01) would be
implemented in 1985 and would be fully effective at the beginning of 1986
and that REGIDESO and Government would review the tariff structure
annually, noting:



- 42 -
(a) the desirability of moving towards marginal costs,
(b) the means by which electricity service can be extended to lower
income groups including
(i)   acceptable levele of cross-subsidization between categories
of consumers,
(ii)  acceptable  levels of cross-subsidization within the low
voltage domestic category by use of 'linverted' block rates
or 'lifeline' rate structures,
(iii) modification of connection charge requirements.
5.12          It was further agreed during negotiations that REGIDES0 and
Government would implement and approve annually tariffs developed in
accordance with the objectives outlined in paragraph 5.11 which in total
would produce revenues sufficient to earn agreed rates of return
(para. 5.14).
5.13      Tariff levels and increases included in the financial projections
are as follows:
1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991 1992
Average Tariffs in:
- current BuF/kWh             9.3  12.4  15.2  17.5  20.1  21.8  25.0 30.0
- real terms (end-84 BuF/kWh)  8.6  10.0  11.0  11.4  12.0  11.8  12.3 12.7
Z Increase projected         20    33    23    15    15        9    15   13
% Estimated inflation        18    12    10    10    10    10    10   10
Resulting rate of return
on revalued assets           3.8   4.5   4.0   4.8   6.6   8.0   8.3  8.9
These tariffs equate to 80% of the weighted average long-run
marginal  costs  (BuF  16.1/kWh-US13.8/kWh)  by  1992  (para.  6.13  and
Annex 23).
Other Fiuancial Covenants
5.14        It was agreed during negotiations with REGIDESO and Government
that tariff adjustments would be made to produce a rate of return on net
revalued assets of not less than 4.0% in 1985, 1986 and 1987; 4.5% in 1988;
6.5 in 1989 and 8.0% in 1990 and thereafter.   The lower returns in the
earlier years are reasonable as higher rates of return would require
unrealistically large tariff increases, increasing the difficulty of
expanding service to low income consumers.

5.15         On the basis of financial projections (Annex 21) short-term
Government funding is required over the period 1985-86 in the amount of BuF
1075.8 million which can be repaid fully by REGIDESO over the 1987-91.
During  negotiations  agreement  was  obtained  that  the  Government  would
provide  short-term  funds  as  necessary  to  ensure  that  REGIDESO  has
sufficient monies on an annual basis to meet project construction costs,
and requiring REGIDESO to repay such funds within four years of their
provision.
REGIDESO's Future Finances
5.16          Financial projections for  1984 through  1993 are given in
Annex 21.  Assumptions used in preparing the projections are at Annex 22.
Salient features of REGIDESO's future finances for the project period 1985
through 1989 are summarized below:
1985     1986     1987      1988     1989
Operating Revenues (BuF million)  833.1   1386.6   1787.3   2264.1   3006.9
Rate of Return (on annually
revalued assets)  Z                3.8       4.5      4.0       4.8      6.6

5. 17          Until a detailed long-term  investment program  is prepared
(para. 4.13), major unprogrammed capital expenditures could have a
significant effect upon the future financial position of REGIDESO and could
distort least-cost development.   It was therefore agreed at negotiations
that REGIDESO would not commit itself without prior consultation with
IDA to any capital investment in excess of US$5 million and would ensure
that every investment in the electricity sector would be economically and
financially justified.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
The 110 kV Transmission Line
6.01           Construction of the Ruzizi II generating station is now
underway, and Burundi is committed to provide 1/3 of the cost of the
project (para. 2.10). It has also entered into a contract with SINELAC to
purchase sufficient power to cover 1/3 of the cost of operation,
maintenance and debt service, and without the 110 kV line connecting Ruzizi
II to Burundi, Burundi could not receive power from the generating station.
Least Cost Solution
6.02       The mission has reviewed the EdF report (paras. 2.17 and 4.02)
and is in agreement with the recommendation that the least-cost method of



- 44 -
bringing electric power from the Ruzizi II generating station to Burundi,
is via a 110 kV transmission line joining the Rwegura Bujumbura line, now
under construction at Bubanza.   The selection of alternative operating
voltages would be inappropriate in the long term, and the route selected,
with termination at Bubaaza, is the least costly of the several routes
investigated. The mission also agrees that the schedule for commissioning
the line by 1988 is also justified, as costs of possible use of diesel
units and shortages are greater than those associated to building the
transmission line with the commissioning date of 1988 rather than 1989.
Regional Investment Program
6.03        Return on Investment.  The economic rate of return on a power
program is normally calculated as the discount rate at which the present
value of the capital and operating costs of the program equals the present
value of the incremental benefits, as measured by the va'ue of energy
production using existing and projected future tariffs and the assumed load
growth.   This project is an important component of a regional program
designed to provide electrical energy to the Great Lakes Region of Burundi,
Rwanda,  and Zaire.   Thus,  because  it is not possible  to compute  the
economic rate of return on only a part of a program, the economic rate of
return on the total investments for electrical energy in the Region was
computed.
6.04        The sale of energy from Rwegura and Ruzizi II is expected to
begin in l988, and for the purposes of computation of benefits, only the
demand above the capability of the existing system has been considered.
Thus, total sales from Rwegura and Ruzizi II were assumed o be 26 GWh in
1988 and would rise to 224 GWh in 1995, equivalent to the stations' maximum
capacity of 264 GWh, in accordance with the forecast demand which is
eStLmated to increase at 10% annually in the 1984-1995 period (Annex 9).
The sales were determined  by reducing  the rated output of generating
stations by 15% to cover estimated losses in the transmission and
distribution system, and revenues were computed by mltiplying the
resulting sales in Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire (Kivu) by the respective
forecast tariffs (Annex 24).
6.05        The total cost of the program was based on constant end-1984
estimates of costs for the Rwegura and Ruzizi II projects, and the
complementary works in Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire. An allowance of US$1.0
million in 1988 and 1989, decreasing to US$0.4 million in 1994, was added
to the cost of the complementary works in each country to cover local
distribution extensions.  The cost of operation and maintenance was based
on annual charges of 1% of the capital cost of generation, and 3% and 7% of
the   capital   costs   of   transmission   and   distribution   facilities,
respectively.   The life of the project was assumed to be 30 years.   A
salvage value allowance of 40Z was included for the generation facilities
only.   Price escalation and interest during construction (IDC) were not
included in the computations.
6.06      Based on the foregoing assumptions the economic rate of return on
the regional investment program was computed to be 8%.   By taking into
account the economic benefit (consumers' surplus) deriving from the
availability of hydropower rather than high cost diesel-generated power



- 45 -
which it is estimated fifteen percent of consumers consumers would be ready
to buy, the economic rate of return was determined to be 13x.   In this
case, benefits for this portion of sales were based on alternative costs of
diesel generation.  The rates of return have been found to be comparable to
those given ia the staff appraisal report for the Razizi 11 Regional
Hydroelectric Power Project (4303 EAP; May 1982) The economic rates of
return are sensitive to changes in costs and revenues.  If the capital cost
of the project increase by 102, the rates of return on the project reduce
to 7Z and 122, respectively, excluding and including consumers' surplus.
Also, if the growth of demand for energy is 9X p.a., which results in a
delay of one year in the use of RuzzitL II and Rwegura, the rates of return
would  be  72 and  12Z,  respectively.    If  both  events  were  to  occur
simultaneously the rates of return would be 6.5X and 112, respectively.
Annex 24 contains details on the foregoing computations and assumptions.
In all cases, the economic rates of return are acceptable.
110/30 kV Substations at Bubanza and Cibitoke, 30 kV Lines to the Regional
Towns  and  Distribution  Development at  the  Regional Towns,  including
Katumba
6.07          Return on Investment.  EdF recomended the construction of
110/30 kV substations supplied from the proposed 110 kV transmission line
and 30 kV lines to supply the towns of Cibitoke and Bubanza and other small
towns in the ares (Rugombo,  4parambo, "4xinda, Mpanda).  There are small
diesel units in the farms and missions in the area and a tobacco drying
factory is being constructed in Cibitoke. The consultants concluded that
the potential loads are sufficiently large and the economic activity levels
of these towns sufficiently high to expand the units and install new ones.
Therefore the consultants determined the economic rates of return for the
Investments comparing the proposed project components with their diesel
alternatives.  IDA preferred a more conservative approach and limited the
saving in substituting dlesel-generated electricity by hydro-based
electricity only for existing diesel plants. According to IDA's estimates,
it is expected that about 1.5 GWh/year of diesel generation will be
substituted by hydro based electricity supplied from the interconnected
system.  With the actual cost of diesel oil, the annual savings of fuel
costs would amount to about BuF 48.6 (US$0.4) million. Revenues from the
forecast sales on top of the 1.5 GWh were determined using projected
tariffs. Economic analysis was carried out for three project components:
(1) Cibitoke, Rugombo and Mparambo which will be supplied from the
Cibitoke substatlon; (2) Bubanza, Mpands and Muzinda, which will be
supplied from the Bubanza substation; and (3) Katumbs, which will be
supplied from the Bujunbura-Uvirs line and where IOZ of the fore^st sales
is expected  to substitute generation from  very  small diesel units  by
individuals.  In the case of Cibitoke, the capital costs for the 30 kV
lines include the cost of the substation, while for the Bubanza case, only
a portion of the estimated substation cost was included, because the main
expenditures would be required in any event, for connecting the incoming
110 kV lines from Rwegura and Ruzizi II and the outgoing line to
Bujumbura. For Katumba, only a feeder was considered because the Bujumbura
Uvira line crosses the town. Price escalation and IDC were not included in
the computatLons. The cost of operation and maintenance was assumed to be
2% and 7X of the capital costs of the subtransmission and distribution
facilities, respectively, and the life of the projects was assumed to be 30
years.



- 46 -
6.08         The economic rate of return for each project group has b-een
computed as the discount rate at which the present value of the carital,
energy and operation and maintenance costs equal the present value of the
incremental benefits, which in theFa cases were measured by the value of
savings  by  substituting  diesel  generated  electricity  by  hydro  based
electricity and the value of sales (on top of the portion saved) using
projected tariffs (Annex 25).   Energy costs were based on thle LR!C as
determined in Annex 23.  Based on the foregoing assumptions the rates of
return would be as follows:
- Cibitoke group: 17%
- Bubanza group: 11%
- Katumba: 11%
No benefit was taken into account for the likely greater availability of
the transmission and distribution facilities versus diesel plants
(maintenance and fuel supply problems and foreign exchange need for diesel
oil).   Therefore the economic rates of return are stated conservatively.
The economic rates of return, excluding consumers' surplus were calc lated
as follows:
- Cibitoke group: 11%
- Bubanza group: 10%
- Katumba: 9Z
6.09       The economic rates of return are sensitive to the capital costs
and demand forecasts. Results are summarized as follows:
Economic Rate of Return (Z)
Cibitoke    Bubanza    Katumba
Group       Group       Group
- Capital costs increased by 10%             16          11         10
- Demand for energy is not so
great as to delay estimated
sales by one year                          15          11         10
- Both events occur                          14          10          9
The economic rates of return are acceptable.
Distribution Extensions of Low Income Districts of Bujumbura
6.10        Return on Investment.  EdF has also completed their studies on
the electrification of six low-income districts on the periphery of
Bujumbura and calculated ar economic rate of return for the whole
development. However, IDA preferred to view each district which could be
electrified as an individual project and calculated separate rates of
return as the discount rate at which the present value of he capi al,
energy and operating costs equal the present value of the incremental
benefits, (in this case measured by the value of sales) using projected
tariffs and savings from the small diesel units to be used by entrepreneurs
and savings from the kerosene wick lamps; particular attention was not paid
to double-count the benefits.  Energy costs were based on the LRMC (Annex
23); annual operation and maintenance costs were assumed to be 7Z of the



- 47 -
capital costs. Demand forecasts taken into account as the base case were
those projected by EdF  (about 2,000 kWh/annum per consumer), lO/ and
sensitivity studie3 were carried out with    00, 1,500 and 1,000 kMT/aimum
per consumer. Taking into account past trends in the already electrified
medium to low-income districts such as Ngagara and Nyakabiga, access to
electricity service stimulates commercial activity such as service
stations, garages, small workshops; therefore it is estimated that the
value of 2,000 kWh/annum per consumer is reasonable and 1,000 kWh/annum per
consumer (without Increase over the life of the project) is a conservative
minimum.  Furthermore, it is also estitbated that about 10% of the sales
would substitute for generation from small diesel units used in service
stations, garages and workshops and the total demand would be inelastic to
tariff increases within any reasonable range.  For each new consumer 100
kWh/year was assumed to be used to substitute for the kerosene wick lamps.
The value of sP2.es (ca top of the portion substituted) was determined using
tariffs (para. 5S.13). Annex 26 contains details of the computations based
on the above assumptions.
6.11       Based on the foregoing assumptions, the economic rates of return
for the base case on the distribution extensions were found to be as
follows:
Cibitoke       10%   Kamenge       15%     Bwiza        20%
Kinaia         10%   Musaga        13%     Buyenzi      14%
The economic rate-of-return for  the whole component was calculated as
14%. No benefit was ascribed to the better quality of life provided by
electric lighting; therefore, the economic rates of return are also stated
conservatively.
6.12          The rates of return are sensitive to the demand forecast
(para.  6.10).    Sensitivity  studies  were  carried  out using  different
percentages of the expected sales and a cost increase of 10%. Results are
given in Annex 26 and summarized in the following table for the whole
component:
Summary of the ERR Calculations

Calculation of the economic rate of return, excluding consumers' surplus
and based exclusively on sales revenue was calculated for the base case
(with 2,000 kWh/a per consumer) as 6%.  This shows that the electricity
tariffs are too low to provide an acceptable rate of return for this part
10/ Average annual consumption of the existing low voltage consumers in
Bujumbura was 4,170 kWh in 1983.



- 48 -
of the project; however, the additional savings in imported diesel oil and
kerosene which are included in the tabulated ERR results shown above, are
large enough and to produce acceptable economic rates of return.
Long-Run Marginal Cost
6.13       Consultants (EdF International) determined a long run marginal
cost (LRMC) for electricity in their tariff study (para. 4.02). However,
as IDA, believes that the load forecast and the investment program
considered  in  the  study  were  too  optimistic,  the  LRMC  for  the
interconnected system in Burundi was recalculated as given in Annex 23.
The LRMC at the medium voltage level is estimated as BuF 12.1/kWh
(US010.3/kWh) and that at the low voltage (distribution) level is estimated
to be BuF 18.6/kWh (USt15.9/kWh).  The weighted average LRMC is estimated
at BuF 16.1/kWh (US13.8/kWh).  The projected tariffs adjustments (para.
5.13) would increase the average level to 80% of to the weighted average
LRMC by 1992. The differences in rates between consumer categories would
be reviewed during the implementation of the findings of the tariff study
(paras. 4.01 and 5.11) to ensure that they reflect correctly the
differences in supply costs.
Project Risks
6.14           The physical  risk  associated with  the  transmission  and
distribution components of this project is small because the work to be
completed is routine and only proven elements would be included. Risks of
higher costs due to receiving bids after presentation to the Board are also
small (para. 4.22).  The main risk would be institutional in nature, as
REGIDESO is generally weak in administration and management. However, this
risk would be minimized because (a) competent consultants would assist
REGIDESO in completing the project (para. 4.22), Cb) management assistance
team would be assisting REGIDESO in its day-to-day activities (para. 4.12),
and lc) the training component is expected to improve staff competency
particularly during the later stages of the project (para. 4.14). The risk
associated with the follow up,   in 1987 and 1988, of the dissemination
program of improved charcoal stoves in Bujumbura, is also small as
competent consultauts will continue to be employed to assist DUB (para.
4.15), and the first phase of the program in 1985 and 1986 will help to
minimize the risk for the follow-up phase.
VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMNEINDATIONS
7.01       During negot Ltions, agreements were reached with the Government
and REGIDESO on the following:
(a) REGIDESO would arrange for prompt completion of the 1983 audit
and thereafter to have its accounts audited each year by an
independent auditor acceptable to IDA, and would submit audited
financial statements and auditor's reports to IDA no later than
six months after the end of the fiscal year (para. 3.07);



- 49 -
(b) REGIDESO would maintain separate accounts for its electricity
and water operations and would incorporate therein an annual
revaluation of its fixed assets in operation (para. 3.08);
(c) REGIDESO would apply a connections policy following consultation
with IDA, based on the recommendations of a study (para. 4.10);
(d) REGIDESO would retain the services of a management assistance
team by December 31, 1985 and implement during the life of the
project a progran of action satisfactory to IDA, based on the
conclusions of the management diagnosis (paras. 4.12 and 5.08);
(e) REGIDESO would prepare a detailed ten-year investment program,
for review with IDA, by June 30, 1986; and REGIDESO would update
the plan and eschange views with IDA annually (para. 4.13);
(f) REGIDESO would appoint a Manager of Training and three Burundese
trainers, and retain the services of three training specialists,
by October 1, 1985; these trainers would prepare and initiate a
training program acceptable to IDA, for the electricity and
related financial and administrative personnel of REGIDESO on or
before September 1, 1986 (para. 4.14);
(g) the Government would appoint by December 31, 1985 an expert to
provide advice on the purchase and sale of petroleum products
(para. 4.16);
'h) REGIDESO would continue to employ engineering consultants
acceptable to TDA (para. 4.22);
(i) REGIDESO would adjust its water tariffs to ensure that revenues
from water supply operations are at least sufficient to cover
operating expenses and debt service and provide a reasonable
contribution  to  the  water  supply  investment  program;  a
reasonable level of contribution would be agreed with IDA
(para. 5.01)
(i) REGIDESO would not incur debt unless internal cash generated for
the twelve months preceding incurrence of the debt is at least
1.5 times the maximam debt service requirement for any
succeeding year (para. 5.02).
(k) REGIDESO's outstanding receivable accounts for electricity and
water would not exceed: for Government and municipalities the
equivalent of six months billing at the end of 1986 and four
months billings at the end of 1987 and thereafter; and, for
other consumers, four months of billing at the end of 1985 and
four months billing for consumers billed every two months and
three months billing for consumers billed monthly at the end of
1986 and thereafter (para. 5.03);
(1) REGIDESO and the Government would implement a new tariff
structure consistent with the recomendations of the tariff
study, following consultation with IDA, and the new structure
would be fully effective by January 1, 1986 (para. 5.11);

(m) REGIDESO and the Government would review the electricity tariff
structure annually with regard to' marginal COB t pricing
principles, cross-subsidization and extension of service to
lower income groups, and implement and approve tariffs so
developed which in total would produce revenues sufficient to
earn a rate of return on revalued net assets of not less than
4.0% in 1986 and 1987; 4.5% in 1988; 6.5Z in 1989, and 8% in
1990 and thereafter (paras. 5.11, 5.12 and 5.14);
(n) Government would agree to provide short-term funds as necessary
to ensure that REGIDESO has sufficient monies on an annual basis
to meet project construction costs, and REGIDESO would agree to
repay such funds within four years (para. 5.15); and
(o) REGIDESO would not commit itself, without prior consultation
with IDA, to any capital investment in excess of US$5 million
and would ensure that every investment in the electricity sector
would be economically and financially justified (para. 5.17).
7.02       Special conditions of effectiveness would be:
Ca) the agreement between IDA and REGIDESO on an action plan to
strengthen REGIDESO's manageaent (para. 4.12);
Cb) the agreement between IDA, the Government and REGIDESO on an
action plan to reduce Government's and municipalities' arrears
to six months of electricity and water billings by December 1986
(para. 5.03);
cc) the execution of the subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government of Burundi and REGIDESO (para. 5.05);
(d) the fulfillment of conditions precedent to disbursement of
cofinanciers' funde (para. 5.05); and,
(e) the agreement with Rwanda and Zaire that these countries
would provide a right-of-way and allow free access for the
construction, operation, and maintenance of the transmission
line from Ruzizi II to Bubanza (para. 4.06).
7.03           A condition of disbursement for the rehabilitation of the
Bujumbura substation would be that REGIDESO obtain legal rights adequate to
protect the interest of Burundi and IDA (paras. 4.07 and 4.24).
7.04        With the above agreements, the project is suitable for an IDA
Credit of SDR 12.9 million (USS12.3 million).

POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
International Organizations
Coumunautg geouomiue des pas des grnds lacs (CEPGL)
1.        The Communautg economique des pays des grands lacs (CEPGL), is an
organization which was established in September 1976 by Burundi, Rwanda and
Zaire to revive the former cooperation among the three countries which
existed under the Belgian administration prior to independence. CEPGL was
formed to promote free movement of persons and goods within the area, and
to cooperate politically and economically within the region as it relates
to other countries in Africa.   The entity is made up of a council of
ministers, one from each of the countries, which meets twice a year and
reports to an annual meeting of the presidents of the three countries - the
highest authority of the organization. The day-to-day activities including
the preparation and execution of programs and coordination within the
administration of the three countries is handled by a Secretariat located
in Gisenyi, Rwanda. CEPGL receives assistance from USAID, France, Belgium
and FED for the preparation of feasibility studies.
2.           CEPGL bats sponsored a glass bottle manufacturing factory in
Burundi, and in June 1981, the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
approved a loan of USS4.0 million and an equity investment of US$0.75
million for its construction. The factory was placed in service in 1983.
Another activity is exploring the potential for the production of methane
from the deep waters of Lake Kivue    Several issues need to be resolved
before an investment program for gas development can be defined; for
example, the legal and institutional framework for gas extraction by Rwanda
and Zaire; the safety limitation and the establishment of the rate at which
the gas can be extracted; and the nature and the extent of the market and
the derivative products. The potential coutribution of the development of
gas to this area is still in the distant future.
Energie des pays des grands lacs (EGL)
3.         EGL was set up to ensure the availability of electric power in
the region, and as a result has promoted the construction of the Ruzizi It
hydroelectric power project on the Ruzizi River downstream from the
existing Ruzizi generating station on the border between Zaire and Rwanda
(Map LBRD 18517).   This organization, located in Bujumbura, Burundi, is
staffed with three technical directors - one each seconded from REGIDESO,
Burundi; ELECTROGAZ, Rwanda, and SNEL, Zaire; together with a small support
staff.
Kagera Basin Organization (KBO)
4.         This organization has its headquarters in Kigali, Rwanda, and as
in the case of EGL, is made up of a small staff seconded from each
country. At the request of KBO, several reports have been prepared on the

development  of the Kagera River -  1967, Lahmeyer Internationsal  1976,
Norconsult and Electrowatt; 1979, Tractionel and Electrobel.
5.          Little action was taken ou the fiual report until 1981 when,
during meetings held by KB0 in Bujumbura in May, which were headed by the
Presidents of Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania, a decision was made to proceed
with further study of the low-head i.e. a run-of-river scheme, at the
Rusumo Falls site on the Kagera River. However, a source of funds for the
study has not yet been found.   Because of its magnitude and cost, it is
likely that construction on this project may not begin until near the end
of the 1980s.  Nevertheless, Tanzania is interested in the development of
this project because, of the three countries, it has the least potential
for hydro generated power in this region.
SINELAC - The Regional Implementing Agency
6.          The three Governents of Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire in February
1984 ratified their agreement to form the international company, SINELAC,
to be the regional implementing agency of the Ruzizi II project.
7.         SINELAC, with its head office temporarily in Bujumbura, Burundi,
but to be moved to Bukavu, Zaire, by 1987, is an international public
company established for a 50-year renewable period, and the three
Governments of Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire contribute equally to its
capital.   Although SINELAC has been formed initially for the Ruzizi II
project, it could acquire and manage other electric power installations.
SINELAC is governed by the rules of the agreement and its own by-laws, and
for cases that are not covered by these rules and regulations by the
Investment Code of the Communautf &eonoaique des pays des grands lacs
(CEPGL), and by the laws of the country of its headquarters, Zaire.
SINELAC would operate as a commercial entity with financial objectives
defined initially in relation to the project and its electricity tariffs
would be established at a level which would produce a satisfactory rate of
return for the project.
8.        SINELAC is governed by a General Assembly consisting of the three
Mini3ters of Energy.   This General Assembly meets once a year and its
responsibilities are to appoint or dismiss the directors, the general
manager, the account controllers (coumissaires aux comptes) and the
auditors, and to discuss the financial statements of each previous year.
The Board of Directors consists of six members, two from each country. A
three member management committee is in charge of SINELAC's day-to-day
operations. SINELAC's General Manager is appointed by the General Assembly
and the Board of Directors has the responsibility of appointing and
removing the other two members of the management committee.   The three
members of the committee would be from different countries.   SINELAC
consults with IDA before appointing a new general manager.

e/ A new generation project should be commissioned In April 1995.  A tentative timetable for the
consideration of the need for further regional power development, including the possibility of a
Ruzizi III Project, would be as follows:
-  Review of existing demand projections and prefeasibility study (including definition of
the least-cost program for the system)                1986 (6 months)
-  Feasibility                                           1987 (I year)
-  Preparation/Co-financing/Tendering/Awards             Jan 88 - Dec 89
-  Works start                                           Jan 1990
-  Commissioning                                         April 1995
ft Shows that construction of Ruzizi II was justified for comissioning end-1988 (current estimated
commissioning date is mld-1988).

POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Summary Data on the Proposed Distribution Expansion
Bulumbura Districts
The number of new consumers to be connected in 1986 ard 1987 was
determined by consultants (EdY) based on their detailed study of the
districts based on past trends (including the districts of Ngagara and
Nyakabiga, medium and low-income districts already electrified), analysis
of household incomes. Consultants then determined the Installations to be
built within the proposed project and assessed REGIDESO's implementation
capacity. Cost estimates were based on recent prices and costs in Burundi
and in the region. REGIDESO would procure the equipment for connections to
be made in 1986 and 1987 and would make the connections; consumers would
pay half of the costs when the connection is made and would pay the other
half over twelve months in monthly installments. Cost of a connection is
estimated to be about BuF 60,000 (US$512). The penetration rate of
electrification by 1997 was assumed by IDA.

POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Summary Data on the Proposed Subtransmission and Distribution Development
in Regional Towns
Cibitoke Town, Mparamnbo and Rugombo
Cibitoke town is situated 61 km northwest of Bujumbura.  There
are few small diesel generators totalling about 80 kVA. A coffee drying
factory with a load of about 550 kW will start operations by end-1985. A
550 KW diesel unit will be installed in the factory. A military camp, an
administrative center and 200-bed hospital, a mission, a mill a market
center, a school are other principal potential consumers. The first houses
to be electrified will be the lodgings of the Government employees. The
load was forecast to be about 750 kW; 1.6 GWh in 1988. Overall utilization
rate is low because of the low rate of the coffee factory.  In Rugombo,
which is situated north of the Cibitoke town, the potential consumers are a
market center, an administrative center and a large farm. In Mparambo, a
large farm with an existing 55 kW diesel unit is the largest potential
consumer.  Administrative and market centers are the other consumers.  For
the area it is estimated that the consumption would be 2.4 GUh in 1988 and
would Increase with an anmual growth rate of about 13.6% which is quite
reasonable compared to the potential of the area.
A 30 kV subtransmission line of about 21 km would go from
Cibitoke town to Rugombo via Mparambo.   Eignt 30/0.4 kV pole mounted
transformers of various capacities would be installed and about 4.0 km of
low voltage distribution lines would be constructed.  About 70 consumes,
commercial and domestic, would be connected in 1988.
Bubanza, Mpanda, Muzinda
Administrative, market and community centers, schools, cinemas,
post office, some workshops, garages, hospitals, missions, military camps,
and some small industries are the potential consumers in the is area north
of the capital. A mission operates a 60 kW diesel unit in Mpanda. It is
forecasted that the demand for electricity would be about 2.1 GWh in 1988;
the  growth  rate  is  expected  as  12%  per  annum.    21  km  of  30 kV
subtransoission line would be constructed from Bubanza to Mpanda and
Muzinda. Nine 30/0.4 kV pole mounted transformers of various capabilities
would be installed and 12.0 km of low voltage distribution lines would be
constructed. It is forecasted that in these localities, a total of about
290 consumers will be served by 1988.
Katumba
This small town situated next to the airport between Bujumbura
and the border with Zaire has virtually become a district of the capital.
Trade with Zaire is the main activity in the town and a large experimental
farm is located on the fields between the town and Lake Tanganyika.  The
customs post at the border will also be electrified. It is forecasted that



71
ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 2
the dernand for electricity would be 0.15 GWh in 1988 and that the growth
rate would be about 20X p.a. which is reasonable with respect to potential
commercial activity.   The 15 kV Bujumbura-Uvira (Zaire) line, owned and
operated hy S.N.EL. crosses the town but does not serve it.  S.N.EL. is
studying, within the proposed Zaire-Power II project (appraised in November
1984), the rehabilitation of the supply of Uvira and Kilimbe where a sugar
mill has been operating recently. This could include upgrading of the line
to 30 kV. Katumba would be supplied from the line by short feeder lines
with four 30 or 15/0.4 kV pole mounted transformers and about 4.0 km of
distribution lines.   It is expected that about 60 consuTers w-ould be
connected by 1988.

4.    Technical Department: Electricity Division
A. List of Courses to be Organized
Vocaetinal  orie S tlom   for  operators  ad  foremen.           This
orientatlon will consist of courses intended for new staff already trained
In a glven field (electrical or mechanical) and designed to equip then
quickly with the kind of technical knw ledge and hands-on experience tbey
need to be able to work on REGIDESO installations.
The following orientation courses are recommended:



74
ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 6
For Operators:
-  orientation in technical aspects of distribution networks;
- orientation in operation and day-to-day maintenance of generating
plant;
-  orientation in major maintenance of generating plant.
For Foremen:
-  orientation iu technical aspects of distribution networks;
- orientation in operation and day-to-lay maintenance of generating
plant;
-  orientation in larger-scale maintenance of generating plant.
For Professional Staff:
- briefing on REGIDESO;
-  technical   aspects   of   electric   power   transmission   and
distribution;
- technical aspects of electric power generation;
- introduction to educational techniques.
Avaced Traiiug.    Limited to staff already experienced in
their jobs. Two types of activity are envisaged: advanced training for
current Job (acquiring know- how that will lead to better performance) and
advanced training for new responsibilities.
IniLially, ouly training for the current job should be
introduced:
.For Skilled Workers and Foremen:
-  construction and operation of distribution networks;
- subscriber connections;
- public lighting (installation, maintenance);
-  operation of hydro power stations;
- maintenance (electrical, mechanical) of hydro power stations.
In addition, the qualifications of semi-ski'led and skilled
workers (the lowest grade levels) who have no training other than tha.
acquired on the job could be improved hy making introductory technical
courses available to them, to be followed up later with more advanced
instruction.
For Professional Staff
The professional staff are for the most part young and
inexperienced.   The course listed below are essential in the current
situation and shauld be aecorded priority.
study of distribution networks;
-  protection of transmission and distribution networks;



75
ANNEX 15
Page 4 of 6
- organization of maintenance in hydro power stat;ons;
operatiou of hydro power st&tions under normal  and abnormal
conditions;
- protection of generating plant, etc..
It should be understood that the above list of courses is merely indicative
and could be changed to accomodate other needs or expressed wishes.
Iaformatlon Courses.    Courses given under this heading would
focus on a specific topic and be designed to acquaint professional staff
with new technologies affecting their particular fields of concern.
One of the first efforts here should be devoted to demystifying
data processing and allied matters.
B. Administrative aad Financial Department
Skilled personnel and their supervisors
The level of instruction available through the national education
system means that REGIDESO can simply provide orientation directly in the
various divisions that make up this Department.
Newly recruited staff would require no more than an introduction
to the Corporation itself.
Professionals
It wo-uld be advisable to arrange for specific courses on the
cechaical procedures they are expected to follow. Most of them have only
their on-the-job experience, and  they  should be kept abreast of new
'evelopments that might affect their particular fields of responsibility.
Lthocse courses should be arranged for them at the proposed REGIDESO
training center.   Desirably internships should be organized in similar
organizations.
5.        Curriculum
If technical staff are to be competent to carry out operating
procedures (power stations or networks) or maintenance work on the circ;v'its
and actuators which make up the Corporation's facilities (power stations or
networks), they must pc3sess:
- the basic scientific knowledge required for an understanding of
the physical laws specific to a given trade or field of skill
(electrical, mecahnical, etc.);
- knowledge of the physical laws and related phenomena that enter
singly or simultaneously into the functioning of the circuits and
equipment on which they will be required to work (operating and
maintenauce procedures);



76
ANNEK 15
Page 5 of 6
- the know-how and skills specific to their function:
-  ability to analyze events or incidents that occur in the course
of operations and, if necessary, determine what action to take;
- familiarity with circuits and actuators:
- principle of operation;
- location in the installation;
- circuits that include or end in an actuator;
- procedures to be used, depending on the type of equipment or
circuit:
- tools required;
-- industrial safety measures to be taken;
- initiating technique;
- saquence of steps to be followed;
- evaluation of work carried out:
- tests and controls to use before resumption of service.
Depending  on actual employee  skill  levels  (known where new
recuits are concerned, to be ascertained in the case of existing staff),
formulation of the curricula sad course sequences to be adopted will
involve application of the pritciples set out above. There now follows, as
an example for other courses, an orientation course for operators due to be
assigned to jobs on the power distribution uetworks:

POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Notes on Financial Projections
Sales
1.         Sales for the period 1983-1991 were calculated on the basis of
the mission's demand estimates, which were sub-divided into domestic,
public agencies', commercial and industrial categories.   The resulting
average annual rates of growth are  11.4Z from 1983 to 1990 and 10%
thereafter.
Tariffs
2.         Average electricity tariffs have been calculated to produce an
increasing rate of return on rate base and an increasing internil cash
generatioa adequate to support financing for REGIDESO's investment
program.   Annual rate increases are projected at a level approximately
double the rate of internal inflation in the years 1985 tbrough 1987 and
50% greater than the estimated inflation until 1991.  For 1992 and 1993
rate increases are limited to 13% p.a.(para. 5.12).
Revenues
3.         Electricity revenues are developed from the sales estimates and
average tariffs as above. Other revenues are developed from present levels
adjusted for estimated new colnections.
Operating Expenses
4.         The cost of imported electricity has been calculated by taking
into consideration the price presently paid to S.N.EL. for the supply of
electricity from the Ruzizi I plant. Forecast prices were estimated on the
basis of calculations made in the Ruzizi II Project SAR.
5.         REGIDESO is presently overstaffed and an increase in number of
connections per employee is sought as a performnce target. This factor
has been taken into consideration in projecting the increase in the cost of
salaries at approximately 80% of the estimated inflation rate.
6.         The cost of materials, including costs applicable to expanded
service, is estimated to increase at approximately 16% p.a..
Depreciation
7.        Annmual rates of depreciation used by REGIDESO include:
Buildings 2.5%;
Generation facilities 5.0%;
Transmission and Distribution 4.0Z;
Vehicles 25%;
Office equipment, furniture and fittings 101



90
ANNEX 22
page 2 of 3
The resulting-composite rate, approximately 4.8%, is considered to be
higher than-appropriate for a system which is substantianly hydro-electric,
and a rate of 3.3Z has therefore been used in the projections.
Construction Expenditures
8.          The cost estimates for construction of the project components
have been estimated by REGIDESO's consultants, EdF (France), reviewed by
the mission and are considered reasonable. Costs for consulting services,
training, and for the management team and petroleum advisor, were prepareci
by the mission.  Details are given in paragraph 4.23.
Financing of the Project
9.         Terms of borrowing of the onlent IDA Credit are assumed to be a
repayment period of twenty years, including a five-year grace period and a
9.292 rate of interest. Current borrowings are at concessional financing
rates, with interest ranging from 2% to 5.5%.  Financing arranged for the
Rwegura project is also largely concessional, except for some 20Z of the
cost which is at 11.5% interest. For the project co-financing it has been
assumed that the repayment period will be twenty years including a five-
year grace period and an 8% rate of interest, reflecting the Government's
willingness to consider re-lending funds to REGIDESO at commercial rates;
as a first step the Governemnt would onlend to REGIDESO at the rate at
which the Government borrows plus 3 percent. REGIDESO's borrowing in the
past has beeen at an average interest rate of 5%.
Revaluation of Assets
10.       Assets are revalued with an average of international and domestic
i-ndices and incorporate Touche Ross' new evaluation for the 1980 assets.
Working Capital
11.         Accounts receivable are assumed to be in accordance with the
suggested covenant (para. 5.03). Accounts payable and Inventories increase
at approximately 11Z per annum, with cash balances being kept at a minimtm
level until repayment of the Government short-term advances. While large
cash surpluses are generated in 1991 and 1992, it is expected that these
will be used to .inance additional investments which would appear in the
least cost investment program to be finalized by June 30, 1986.
Long-Term Debt
11.          The sum of BuF 1,788 million is included as the amount out-
standing in respect of the Mugere project, financed by the People's Repu-
blic of China. Final disposition of this amount is yet to be determined as
between the Republic, the Government of Burundi and REGIDESO.   For the

purpose of the financial projections repayment has been assumed over a 20
year period commencing 1990. Tnterest at IOZ has been charged as-from this
date. Earlier payments are considered inappropriate in View of the excess
capacity which exists and the use of other than least-cost selections.
Government Funding
13.         Short-term financing is required in 1985 and 1986 and can be
repaid  over  the  1987-1990  period.    This: funding  is  treated  as
interest-free.   Previously, longer term financing has been supplied by
Government, described as tGrants,' and shown as Equity in the Balance
Sheet.

Long-Run1Marginal Cost (LRMC) of Electricity for the
Interconnected System in Bururdi
1.        Consultgnts (EdF International) determined the long run marginal
cost (LRMC) in their tariff study. However, as the load forecast and the
investment program considered in the study were too optimistic, the LRMC
for the interconnected system in Burundi was recalculated as given in this
Annex (all costs based on January 1985 prices).
Marginal generation cost
2.            The marginal power plant being Ruzizi II station, marginal
generation cost was calculated with respect to this plant:

created by consumers supplied directly from medium voltage and 62% of the
peak demand will be created by consumers supplied from low voltage.
Annual utilization of the medium voltage facilities is expected to be
4820 h and that of the low voltage facilities 4000 h. 1/

POWER TRANSNISSIOU AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return Calculations for the Resionl Investunt Program
Assumptions: Project life 30 years
Demand forecasts: - Burundi (par&. 2.17); - Rwanda: SAR for Power
Project; - Zaire: latest estimte; giving for the region an anual
increase of 10X over the 1984-1995 period.
Sales of energy from Rwegura and Ruzim  II begin In 1988 and rech
US$224 GWh corresponding to full utilization of the facillties in
1995 (see page 5 of this annex).
1.  Calculation of Benefits
A. Without taking into account consumers' surplus:
Resulting sales in Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire (Kivu) multiplled by
the respective forecast retail tariffs,
B. Taking Into account consumers, surpluo:
The conosumers in the region whose consumption represents about
151 of the total demand from Ruizi II and Rwegura would be ready In
case the Rwegura and Ruzizi II projects were not built, to buy their
electrllty from a diesel-fueled generating statlon, at a cost of at
least US425/kWh. 1/ Either these consumers would have an urgent need
for electricity (Rospital, water pumping, Governoent agencles) or
their demand li very lnelastic (industries for which electricity is a
small part of their cost and which can pass the increase in
electricity cost to their customers, expatriates whose living expenses
are paid for, *tc)
Specific consumption of diesel oll:  0.3 kg/kWh.  Average economic
cost of diesel oil in the region: US450/llter 2/).
Remaining of the forecast sales from Rwegura and Ruzizi 11 assumed to
be paid through forecast electricity retail tariffs. The dea nd curve
for the region could be drawn with two points (1OOZ consumption at the
average tariff, and 15Z at diesel cost), and a conmsers' surplus
could be calculated that would increase the beneflts of the project.

The revenue of the sale of Ruzlzi II and Rwegura electricity is
represented by the area abed, the value of which La TxQ. The
theoretical surplus of consumers ready to buy electricity up to the
diesel cost D is represented by the area above the tariff line limited
by the demand curve: ebcf. To simplify the calculation, we assume
that the fc curve is a straight llne, thus the value of the consumers'
surplus is: 0.15(D-T)Q + I 0.85(D-T)Q - 0.575(D-T)Q.
With construction expenditures C and revenues TQ and the above
consuierm' surplus, the economic rate of return is the discount rate at which
there Is equilibrium between C and TQ + 0.575(D-T)Q - (0.425T + 0.575D)Q.

BURUNDI
POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Basis for Calculation of Economic Rate of Return
for the Subtransmission and Distribution Prolects in Cibitoke Town and
Bubanza areas and Katumba
1.         The economic rate of return was determined for each group; i.e.
Cibitoke town + Rugambo + Mparambo;  Bubanza + Mpanda + Muzinda  and
Katumba.  This rate is defined as the discount rate at which the present
values of all iacremental capital and operating costs and the benefits and
revenues attributable to the development, are equal.
Assumptions:
2.        Project life:  30 years
Costs are based on constant January 1985 prices.
Interest during construction and taxes not included.
Connection costs (BuF 60,000 (US$512) per connection) are paid by
consumers as consumers' contributions.
Sales of energy begin in 1988; number of consumers forecast by
REGIDESO and IDA as given in Annex 14.
Cost of energy is taken from Annex 23, para. 7; marginal cost of
energy from transmission to medium voltage: BuF 9.4/kWh. Losses
assumed to be 3.4%.
Electricity tariffs in constant prices assumed as given in
Annes 26.

Benefits:
Benefits were calculated with respect to electricity tariffs end also
considering consumers' surplus as follows:
Savings from existing diesel stations: amount generated in diesel units
estimated based on existing small diesel units 1/; no new units assumed
to be installed; specific consumption: 0.4kg/kWh; economic cost (border
price plus transportation cost in Burundi) of diesel oil: BuF 67/1; 2/
no increase on the cost of diesel oil was considered to keep the
economic justification on the conservative side; remaining of the fore-
cast sales assumed to be paid through electricity tariffs (for Katumba:
10% of the sales assumed to substitute very small diesel units).
Computation
3.      The streams of costs and revenues are shown in the following pages.
Sensitivity Studies
4.        Sensitivity studies were carried out assuming a cost increase of
10% and an increase in the demand in these areas of 8.5% p.a. resulting in
a delay of about one year in benefits.   Results are summarized in the
following table:

POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Basis for Calculation of Economic Rate of Return
for the Distribution Expansion In Bujumbura Districts
1.         The economic rate of return for the distribution extensions was
determined for each district. This rate is defined as the discount rate at
which the present values of all incremental capital and operating costs,
and the benefits and revenues attributable to the development, are equal.
Assumtions:
2.        Project life:  30 years
Costs are based on constant January 1985 prices.
Interest during construction and taxes not included.
Connection costs (BuF 60,000 (US$512) per cnnnection) paid by
consumers as consumers' contribution.
Sales of energy begin in 1987 to consumers connected In 1986.
Number of consumers to be comnected In 1986 and 1987 determined
by EdF based on detailed study of each district and REGIDKSO's
manpower capacity for the construction of the networks.
Assumption on the penetration of electrification of housebolds In
20 years by IDA in Annes 13.
EdP sales forecast: 2,000 kWh/year per consumer: Main criteria:
(i) it is assumed that 100 kWh/year It per consumer will be used
to substitute the kerosene wick lamps; 2/ (ii) lOX of the demand
would substitute for generation from very small diesel units to
be used In service stations, garages, small workshops; and,
(lii) the rest is assumed to be pald through electricity tariffs.
Sensitivity studies carried out with 1,800, 1,500 and 1,000
kWh/year per consumer.
Benefits from substitution of wick lamps:
- cost of wick lamps: US$7.5
- life: 3 years
- cost of wick: US$0.40
- maintenance: 4 wicks per year
- each household uses 3 lamps
- each lamp is used 3 hours per day
- specific consumption: 0.012 liter/h
- economic cost of kerosene:  BuF 67Jliter (border price plus
transportation costs in Burundi; no Increase on the cost of
kerosene was considered to keep the economic justiflcation on
the conservative side).

The economic rate of return, excluding consumers' surplus was calculated
for the base case (with 2,000 kWh/a per consumer) as 6.0. This rate shows
that the electricity tariffs are not sufficient to provide a good rate of
return for this part of the project; however the savings In liported diesel
oil and kerosene are large enough and the economic rates of return for the
whole of the economy are acceptable.
1/ 2 lamps of 40 watts; used 3 hours/day; 365 days/year gives 87.6 kWh/y;
taken round as 100 kiWhyear.
