MEMORANDUM AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
0N A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A SECOND AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for
SDR 10.5 million (US$l4.34 million equivalent) ls submitted for approval. The
proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years to
help finance a Second Agricultural Extension Project.
2.        Sector ackgr d. Agriculture plays an important role in the
economy, accounting for about 24X of gross domestic product, 361 of
merchandise exports, and 45 of the active labor force (2.2 million persons).
It is also an Important source of income for nearly 70X of the country's
population who live in rural areas.
3.        The agriccltural sector consists of three main subsectors:
(a) tree crops (tea, rubber, and coconut production), accounting for about 51
of CDP, 34X of mercbandise exports, and 161 of employment; (b) paddy,
accounting for 211 of GDP and 30X of employment; and (c) alternative crops,
censisting mainly of subsidiary food crops (pulses, oilseeds, condiments,
roots and tubers, and vegetables), and minor export crops (cinnamon, cardamom,
cocoa, coffee, chirchona, citronella, cloves, ginger, and pepper), accounting
for a negligible share of GDP, exports and employment. There is also a
limited production of high-value crops for export, consisting largely of fresh
fruits, vegetables, foliage plants, and flowers, which are in high demand in
more affluent economies. About 731 of all cultivated land is under
smallholdings, and average farm size is dilminishing.
4.    Performance.  In the 1980s, the growth record of the agricultural
sector was mized: an average annual growth rate of agricultural GDP of 41
during 1978-86, and negative growth in 1987 and 1989. Civil disturbances,
fluctuating weather conditions and levelling of yields were important
contributing factors In the recent marked variation in performane.
5.        Growth Potential. While opportunities for rapid growth in the tree
crops and paddy subsectors are limited, Sri Lanka has the potential to expand
production of subsidiary food crops for domestic consumption, as well as minor
export crops and nontraditional high-value crops for export especially to
Middle Eastern and Far Eastern markets. In these markets, the current Sri
Lankan share is small (31 of the Middle Eastern market and 0.04X of the Far
Eastern market), and the country is well positioned geographically to increase
Its market share by three and tenfold in the Middle Eastern and Far Bastern
markets, respectively. Yet, despite their high returns relative to paddy,
growth of these crops has been mixed. There has been little development of
nontraditional agricultural exports with the exception of cut flowers and
folLage plants and the moderate success In growlng gherkins.
6.        Constralts.  'The tecbnoXogy exists or is being developed under the
IDA-supported Agricultural Research Project (ARP) (Cr. 1776-CE) for faraers to
grow subsidiary food crops and minor export crops, as well as some of the
newer high-value export crops. While local market prices for these crops are



-2-
adequate and attractive relative to paddy at certain times, they are subject
to wide fluctuations, reflecting the ease with which the local market is
saturated. For traded goods, these fluctuatlons also reflect the often
destabilizing effects of discretionary import and export interventions by the
Government. There are also weaknesses in the financial sector and in land
policy. These issues are being addressed in macroeconomic and sector
dialogue. Overall exchange rate and international trade policy has been
evolving in a favorable direction. However, the present state of the
extension service severely constrains the access of farmers to the technology
needed to respond to the signals of an increasingly free market.
7.        During the mid-1980s, the costs of operating the extension service
became prohibitively high for the Government. Operating expenditures were
drastically reduced followed three years later by a cut of staff, further
reducing the effectiveness of the extension service. In 1987, the extension
service was disrupted again, this time by the devolution of authority to the
provinces. Also during this period, as paddy yields leveled off, the
extension service failed to adapt to the need to address other crops, by
switching from its "single crop" (paddy) focus to a "whole farm" approach.
Thus, as presently constituted, the extension service is unable to promote the
development of alternative crops at a cost that can be sustained by the
Government budget. There is also no enabling seed policy for greater
participation of the private sector in seed production and marketing
activities, and plant protection and pesticide management are weak.
8.        Sectoral Development Strategy.  The centerpiece of the Government's
agricultural development strategy is the efficient diversification of
agriculture through the promotion of subsidiary food crops, minor export
crops, and high-value export crops. But to provide farmers with useful advice
about these crops requires a leaner, more efficient and less costly extension
service, with fewer, but better qualified and trained extension agents, backed
up by subject matter specialists and the use of mass media communication, and
a more responsive research system. With the assistance of the IDA-supported
Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project (AEARP) (Cr. 931-CE),
implemented during 1979-86, the Government of Sri Lanka has worked to improve
extension services by introduciug a modifled training and visit (T&V)VJ
approach to extension. There is now a need for a further change to a multi-
crop extension system that responds to Sri Lanka's highly educated rural
population and the need to develop alternative crops.
9.        Two other important elements of the sectoral development strategy
are the restructuring of the tree crops subsector and continued efforts to
establish a "more level playing field" for all subsectors of the agricultural
economy, mainly by reducing the support given to paddy production.
10.       The Bank supports this strategy and is providing assistance in
restructuring the tree crops subsector, irrigation rehabilitation,
1/ T&V is a hierarchically organized and time-bound method of managing
extension, designed to deliver selected and timely technology to
farmers with strict regularity. The system encourages links with
agricultural research institutions, emphasizes a professional
approach to extension, and requires exclusive devotion to extension
work.

agricultural research, and forestry. The Bank is also supporting reform of
the overall macroeconomic and sectoral policy environment with a view to
relieve the constraints to private-sector led, export-oriented development.
11.       Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Operations.  The proposed project
incorporates lessons from the AEARP and similar work in other countries, and
from Bank involvement in the seed sector. These lessons are as follows: (a)
a coherent institutional framework is crucial for defining, coordinating, and
implementing a sustainable extension strategy and for strengthening research-
extension-farmer linkages at the national level; (b) an extension system
should be cost-effective and sustainable under projected budgetary allocations
to the agricultural sector;  (c) an extension system that relies on relatively
fewer, better qualified staff is likely to be more cost-effective than the one
that relies on large numbers of staff; (d) a whole-farm approach to extension
is required, especially one that works to identify groups of farmers with
similar values and concerns (a reference group) and to use the group as the
extension target; (e)-appropriate deployment of subject matter specialists is
required to provide the desired research-extension linkages; and (f) the
science-based seed industry needs enabling seed policy to make the best use of
Innovations and new technologies.
12.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project is an
important component of IDA's three-pronged agricultural sector assistance
strategy. At its centerpiece, the strategy calls for promotion of
agricultural diversification for import substitution and export. Improved
performance of the public irrigation services and improved efficiency and
International competitiveness of the tree crops sector are the other elements.
The project focuses on agricultural extension, plant protection and pesticide
management, and seed policy, which are pivotal in promoting agricultural
diversification and increasing farmer income and export earnings. The project
also has strong linkages with ARP as a means of enhancing the output of
relevant research, and with the IDA-financed Poverty Alleviation Project as a
means of encouraging farm households to participate in activities and
decision-making.
13.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project would increase farmers'
income and agricultural production by improving farm productivity through,
inter alia, promotion of innovative technology. To achieve this objective,
the project wc-ld: (a) strengthen agricultural extension services (except for
tree crops), and (b) develop a national seed policy.
14.       Project Description.  Over a six-year implementation period, the
proposed nationwide project would consist of: (a) a multifaceted program to
improve agrzicultural extension services, including closer integration of
existing extension services, improved use of mass media, strengthened plant
protection, quarantine and pest control, safer and more effective use of
pesticides, training, and a private sector pilot extension projram; (b)
preparation and implementation of a national seed policy; and (c)
establishment of a project management unit. The project would be implemented
by the Ministry of Agricultural Research and Development (MADR) with overall
responsibility for project management and implementation resting with the
Secretary. It would be completed by December 31, 1998. The closing date
would be June 30, 1999. The total project cost is estimated at US$18.3
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$9.5 million
(51.9%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.



- 4 -
In order to ensure an early start of the project, retroactive financing of SDR
185,000 (about US$250,000) would be made available for expenditures incurred
between Nay 1, 1992 and credit signirg for establishing the project management
unit, hiring an architectural firm, recruiting technical assistance, and to
meet the cost of few foreign fellowships. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events is in Schedule C, and the status of
Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka is in Schedule D. The attached maps show
the province and district boundaries and the agro-ecological regions, while
the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10236-CE, dated May 12, 1992 is being
distributed separately.
15.       Iroject Sustainabilitv.  The project would help develop a more
streamlined, less costly client-oriented extension service. The project would
also help the central government explore the possibilities of gradually
divesting itself of extension activities through a private sector pilot
extension program. This, coupled with the active participation of farm
households and farmer groups in activities and decision that affect their
future, would enhance project sustainability.
16.       Agreed Actions.  Agreements reached at negotiations include: (a)
formulation of a national seed policy satisfactory to IDA by June 30, 1993,
and implementation of such policy satisfactory to IDA by June 30, 1994; (b)
establishment and maintenance of a project coordination committee with
membership, responsibilities and resources satisfactory to IDA by December 31,
1992; (c) establishment and maintenance of an agricultural extension committee
satisfactory to IDA; (d) establishment and maintenance of a project management
unit with staff, responsibilities and resources satisfactory to IDA; (e)
maintenance of the working group on national agricultural extension with
membership, responsibilties and resources satisfactory to IDA; (f) use of
private contract services for about 65% of the aggregate cost of contracts for
project mass media requirements; (g) submission to IDA for review of a human
resources development plan for agricultural extension by March 31, 1993; (h)
submission of a plan of action satisfactory to IDA for the introduction of the
private sector pilot extension program by June 30, 1993, and implementation of
such plan with arrangements satisfactory to IDA, including provision relating
to contribution by beneficiaries gradually rising to at least 20X of the cost
of such program over three years; (i) formulation of a plan of action
including a timetable satisfactory to IDA for improving agricultural extension
services, and implementation of such plan in accordance with such timetable;
(j) submission to IDA for comments of a program of activities related to the
project for the following year by June 30, 1993, and by each June 30,
thereafter; (k) employment of specialists in extension and in organizational
development by December 31, 1992; and (1) conduct with IDA of a comprehensive
mid-term review by June 30, 1995. Conditions of effectiveness for the IDA
credit are: (a) the agricultural extension committee has been established; (b)
a division of responsibilities satisfactory to IDA is in effect with regard to
the agriculture sector between the center and the Provincial Councils, and
with regard to agricultural extension between the Provincial Ministries of
Agriculture and Provincial Administration; and (c) the project management unit
satisfactory to IDA has been established; the manager, civil engineer, account
officer satisfactory to IDA have been appointed; and the architects have been
employed. A condition of disbursement against expenditures in the Northern
and Eastern Provinces would be the completion of on-site appraisal and a
review of implementation arrangements to the satisfaction of IDA.



17.       g=Lromental  2gnta.  No slgnificant adverse environmental impact
is anticLpated. The definition of problems as they are perceived by the
¢omminlty is a key element in the extension approach supported by the project.
In this bottoms-up process, identifieation of problems and needs and basic
plannrng would originate at the village level as the basis for extension
actlvities that would safeguard the equilibrium of agro-systems and minimise
health hazards. There would be close liaison with the adaptive/on-farm
research programs supported by ARP. The component for strengthening the
capacity of the Seed Cortification Service and Plant Protection subdivision to
control pesticides would streamline pesticide regulatory functi-ms. It would
also increase the competence of pesticide dealers and applicators in using
pesticLdes safely thereby reducing misuse and overuse which could cause
environmental damage, reduced effectiveness, heavy residues in harvested
crops, and resistance problems and poisoning accidents. Project-funded
training activities would cover sustainable production issues and blomass fuel
conservetion measures. To ensure strong linkages between enviz.mmental
problem identifLid in the Sri Lanka Environmental Action Plan and the job of
the extension service, specific training in environmental planning and
protection would also be iucluded in the human resources development plan
submitted by the agricultural extension committee.
18.       S Lecial fterattcual Prourgms. The strengthening of agricultural
extension services would benefit the agricultural community. The whole-farm
extension approach would encourage the active participatioa of farm households
and farmer groups in activities and decisions that affect their future. Kany
farmers are women, and they are strongly lnvolved in community activities.
19.       Bonefits. The project would help sustain and iaprove farmers'
incomes and develop a more streamlined, cost offective and client-oriented
extension service. Through the establiskhent of a national seed policy, the
project would contribute to privatization of the seed industry, thereby
Improving farmers' access to a complete range of imported Lmproved crop
varieties. The project would help reduce the misuse and overuse of
pesticides, by improving pesticide legislation and registration, strengthening
enforcement, and oducating of growers and dealers about pesticide use.
20.       Risks. The project faces two main risks.  First, coordination of
physical, financial and human resources in agricultural extension services may
be strained by the rapid devolution of authority to the provinces. Pragmatic
organizational arrangements have been proposed under the project to safeguard
against this risk, including the establishment of the Agricultural Eztension
Committee and the Project Coordinating Committee and the strengthening of the
National Agricultural ExtensLon Working Group. Second, there may be some
delay in gettlng all the provinces adeqately staffed to undertake all
project-related tasks assigned to them. To minimize this risk, the level of
provincial support would be revieved each year by the project management unit
and IDA, and steps would be taken to bring this support up to the appropriate
level.



21.       Reoommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Arti¢les of Agresemnts of the Association and recommend that
the Executlve Directors approve the proposed credit.
