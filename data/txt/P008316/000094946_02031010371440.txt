3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Background
In 1992, the power sector in Bulgaria was comprised of two principal organizations - the Committee of
Energy (COE) and the Natsionalna Elektricheska Kompania (NEK). The COE was responsible for



developing and implementing power sector policy and held the delegated responsibility for the shareholder
functions of NEK. COE also set tariffs with the approval of the Council of Ministers (CoM). NEK, a
state-owned, vertically integrated power utility formed in 1992, was responsible for generation,
transmission and distribution of electricity throughout Bulgaria.
Bulgaria's endowment of commercial energy is poor, its hydropower resources are limited and nearly a
third of the total installed capacity of 12,000 MW included nuclear units which the EU and G-7 considered
unsafe. The operating capacity of the thermal power plants was significantly lower than rated levels due to
aging and the poor quality of domestic lignite. The available capacity had been further reduced due to
unreliable coal supplies from Ukraine affecting nearly 1500 MW of thermal capacity, and Bulgaria
critically depended on other countries - especially Ukraine - for reserve power to meet peak demand,
frequency control of the system and for spinning reserve requirements for nearly 1000 MW of old nuclear
units at Kozloduy in the event of unplanned outage. Further, the lack of adequate and modem control
systems for transmission and dispatching considerably reduced Bulgaria's flexibility and ability to manage
the complex system load, increased system losses and voltage fluctuations, and also caused frequent
negative ripple effects on other networks interconnected with the Bulgarian system. At the same time, the
financial condition of the newly formed NEK was poor.
To address these issues, COE, with the help of consultants, developed a strategy which was adopted by the
Government of Bulgaria (GoB) in 1992. The development of such a strategy was supported by the Bank
(Energy Strategy Study, Report No. 10143-BUL) and several other donors (USAID, USTDA, CEA, EIB,
EBRD, etc.,) which aimed at: (a) improving the operating efficiency, reliability and safety of the power
system; (b) improving voltage control and frequency regulation; (c) efficient expansion of domestic
production to reduce imports and environmental impacts; and (d) adoption of appropriate policy measures
to enhance resources for the sector and promote commercial operations. The strategy envisioned a
multi-phase effort to modernize Bulgaria's power system, of which the Energy Project is the first element.
The Project was implemented during a period of political uncertainty resulting from six governments in five
years, a severe economic crisis and the collapse of the banking system at the peak of project
implementation. Through sustained efforts of the Bank, the GoB and NEK, and through concerted efforts
of the Donors, the power sector emerged in 1999/2000 as profitable and attractive to foreign investors,
ready to meet the technical requirements of UCTE system interconnection, and well positioned to support
Bulgaria's EU accession efforts through sector unbundling and the first steps to create a competitive
electricity market.
Objectives
The project had the following objectives: (a) improve the operating efficiency and reliability of the power
system, thus reducing supply disruptions; (b) improve voltage control and frequency regulation; (c) realign
the level and structure of electricity tariffs to rationalize consumption of electricity, reduce imports, reduce
the pollution associated with electricity generation, and mobilize resources for NEK; (d) improve and
depoliticize the tariff setting system by establishing an independent regulatory mechanism to set electricity
tariffs; (e) reduce the need for electricity imnports or other high cost sources to meet peak demand; (f)
reorient the operations of NEK along more commercial lines; and (g) strengthen dam safety at the
Belmeken and Chaira dams and associated saddle dam.
The objectives of the Project were clear, important for sector development, and specifically responded to
the critical priorities in the sector. While NEK had strong technical capabilities, their lack of experience
with procurement methods required by the Bank posed implementation challenges. Also, the socio-political
- 2 -



issues surrounding tariffs posed financial risks to the project and sustainability risks for the sector.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives of the Project were not revised.
3.3 Original Components:
The objectives of the Project were implemented through the following three major components:
(a) Improvement of the supervisory control and transmission network systems of NEK in order to increase
its stability and efficiency: The main parts included installation of (i) modem communication systems
linking various parts of the power system for real-time control/operations; (ii) state-of-the-art hardware and
software for the National Dispatch Center; (iii) power plant unit control systems as part of the automatic
generation control system; and (iv) shunt reactors and fault recorders on the 400kV transmission network.
Necessary technical assistance in the design and implementation of these installations was also included.
(b) Completion of units 3 and 4 of the Chaira pumped storage hydropower plant to ensure availability of
peaking capacity and improve efficiency of power supply: The main parts included (i) civil works and
installation of turbo-generators; (ii) supply of various items including steel lining for penstocks,
instrumentation for seismic monitoring, heat pump distribution center, auxiliary systems and equipment;
and (iii) dam strengthening. Technical assistance for implementation supervision, water usage optimization,
dam safety monitoring and a panel of experts for the dam was also included.
(c) Technical assistance to help NEK operate in a commercial manner: This included the design and
implementation of a financial management improvement program covering cost accounting, financial
accounting per IAS, billing & collection, cash and budget management, and a supporting computerized
Management Information System (MIS).
The scope and focus of components were appropriate to achieve the objectives of the Project. The design
was kept simple, taking into account NEK's inexperience with project implementation with external
financing, and also the Bank's lack of experience in the country.
3.4 Revised Comnponents:
The components of the Project were not revised but the scope of the physical elements was expanded,
mainly in the transmission system part of the Project, following savings resulting from lower than estimated
prices on large contracts. Meters for measuring power/energy in the high voltage grid became necessary as
NEK's unbundling was initiated and improving the performance of the 220 kV part of the network also
became important to enhance the stability of the system.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry is judged as satisfactory. As noted above, the project design was kept simple, consistent
with experience in the region. Ownership of the Project by NEK was high, but by GoB it was less so. The
Project was highly relevant to NEK's development priorities and was consistent with Bulgaria's strategy for
power sector development. It also reinforced the overall goal supported by the Bank, namely, introducing
competition in the sector. Most assumptions made in the development of the Project were reasonable, with
the notable exception of those concerning Bulgaria's macroeconomic performance for the period early to
mid-1990s, which turned out to be overly-optimistic. This caused much difficulty in bringing about tariff
reforms. However, the final outcomes were satisfactory overall.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
-3 -



4.1 Outcome/achievemnent of objective:
Summary Assessment of Outcome
The overall outcome of the Project is rated as satisfactory. As noted in the following sections, all
envisioned objectives and development outcomes were achieved, albeit with delays, especially in the policy
area. The main project components brought the desired benefits at a cost of about 25% less than estimated.
The institutional development achieved was significant, resulting in major sector restructuring/unbundling
in a progressive way. The improved power system stability brought Bulgaria closer to its membership in
UCTE, while the reforms in sector policy and legal and regulatory frameworks significantly increased
private sector interest, with some deals in advanced stages of negotiations. The financial condition of the
sector also improved significantly.
System Performance
The improvement in system performance was satisfactory. The voltage fluctuations in the transmission
system stabilized considerably and frequency regulation was brought under control. The number of forced
outages reduced from 3556 in 1992 to 1108 by 1998 and further down to 381 by 2000 (for HV lines only).
This also helped plan the outages for maintenance purposes in a normal and controlled manner. Improved
reliability of the system also significantly contributed to the initiation of the procedure for UCTE
interconnection in 1997 followed by system testing for interconnection in 2001.
Peak Load Management
The improvement in peak load management was satisfactory. Bulgaria's reliance on neighboring countries
for meeting peak demand was virtually eliminated due to the addition of peaking capacity added by the
Chaira units. Plant availability, which was only 432MW in 1995, improved to 864MW by 1998/99,
thereby the reserve capacity of the system was increased by about 400MW or about 5% of the maximum
peak load. In fact, Bulgaria was able to offer firm capacity for export and has, since 1996, begun to export
electricity. Bulgaria's electricity exports, which increased to 4.5 TWh by 2000, are also bringing financial
gain to NEK and fiscal benefits to the country.
Dam Safety
The improvement in dam safety was satisfactory. The strengthening of the Belmeken-Chaira dams
significantly reduced vulnerability due to high seismic risks, thus enhancing safety. Working with the
intemational Panel of Experts and training in dam safety monitoring enhanced the capacity of Bulgarian
officials in these critical aspects, including exposure to western methods.
NEK's Management /Operations
The improvement in operations and management of NEK was satisfactory. As a new corporation in 1992,
NEK had no experience in modem management methods or functioning as a commercial entity. The new
organizational structure which was evolving up to and through 1999 facilitated stream-lining of decision
making, delineating lines of responsibility through functional management and improving proper separation
of govemance and management functions. The Project helped NEK adopt modem financial, accounting and
commercial policies, including establishing computerized systems. COE adopted a new tariff methodology
in late-1 996 with indexation for automatic adjustments for changes in exchange rates and the domestic
price index. This helped NEK's financial recovery; NEK's net profits increased from US$90.9 million
- 4 -



equivalent in 1996 to US$101.7 million by 1998. In May 2000, the distribution entities were removed
from the structure of NEK. In June 2000 the independent producers were also removed. Nevertheless,
NEK's year 2000 profits were still at US$97.6 million. The auditing of NEK per IAS throughout
implementation helped identify financial management inadequacies and gradually address them, as
evidenced by the auditor's opinions in successive reports.
Policy and Regulatory Reforms
The reforms achieved in improving the policy and regulatory environment for the sector were satisfactory.
While the Project aimed for the establishment of a separate regulatory agency to supervise the sector,
including setting of tariffs - all of which were achieved with significant delays - the overall reforms were far
more comprehensive. A new Energy Law was adopted by GoB in mid-1999, the State Energy Regulatory
Commission (SERC) was established within months thereafter, and the COE was reorganized by end-1999
into two separate agencies - the State Agency for Energy and Energy Resources (SAEER) in charge of
policy making for the sector, and the State Energy Efficiency Agency (SEEA) to promote energy
conservation and environmentally clean technologies in the sector. Not only was a new tariff policy adopted
in May 2000, the consistent adjustments in end-user tariffs since 1998 have established a track record of
the GoB's willingness to take politically difficult actions, as evidenced by the corresponding growing
interest of the private sector. In addition, the policy to encourage competition in the sector was adopted and
NEK was unbundled along functional lines into a separate transmission and hydropower company and
several generation and distribution companies.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The Project outputs exceeded the plan in the transmission part, were in line with the plan in the Chaira
pumped storage part, and were aligned with the evolving sector's and NEK's corporate needs under the
technical assistance part.
The improvement of the supervisory control and transmission system was satisfactory. The National
Dispatch Center was modemized using modem hardware and software contributing to real time monitoring
and management of the power system. The open architecture basis provided for both integration with other
parts of the system on different technologies and technological upgrades as might become necessary to the
dispatch center. Automatic unit controls were installed in two units of the thermal power plant Bobov Dol
and in nine units of three hydropower plants. In addition, two units in Varna, two units in ME2, and two
units in Bobov Dol thermal power plants were equipped with modem turbine govemor systems. The
protection relays with self-test features were installed at critical points in the 400 kV and in all points of the
220 kV network, which reduced fault rate and response times from 55ms to 27ms. The competitive prices
on several tenders resulted in savings which helped to provide for the inclusion of the 220 kV in the scope,
thereby enhancing the system stability and benefits of the Project.
The gain in peak and spinning reserve capacity through the Chaira pumped storage plant was satisfactory.
Unit 3 was commissioned in early 1999, and unit 4 in mid 1999, providing a combined peak capacity of
about 440 MW. The critical rehabilitation on units I and 2 improved the availability of these units and
helped restore their rated performances. The main wall and the counter wall of the Belmeken dam were
strengthened to correspond to current seismic risks.
The technical assistance items were implemented well and are rated as satisfactory. The assistance
provided for engineering, design, procurement and supervision of implementation of the physical
components complemented NEK's technical strengths and helped build capacity in project management
- 5-



under external financing. The impact of the training in dam safety and collaboration with international
panel of experts was beneficial to both NEK and relevant GoB officials. The installation of a new MIS
with financial and cost accounting modules in NEK contributed to the adoption of IAS, as was evidenced
by the continual improvement in the observation of NEK's financial auditors. The change in the scope of
MIS was necessitated by NEK's unbundling towards the end of the Project.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Economic returns for the project were satisfactory. The SAR shows an estimated ERR for the Project at
19%. The re-estimated ERR for the Project at completion is 22%. Separate ERRs were estimated at
appraisal for the Chaira component (22%), the supervisory control component (19%), and the transmission
component (11%). Cost savings in increasing active load management in the Chaira component led to an
increase in its ERR to 30%. Both costs and benefits in automatic generation control associated with the
supervisory control component remained roughly the same as estimated in the SAR. Benefits attributable to
voltage and reactive power control in the transmission component are estimated to have increased slightly
due to work done under the project on the 220 kV network reducing fault rates and response times. Net
Present Value was not estimated at appraisal or included in the SAR and, as such, was not calculated for
the purposes of this report.
4.4 Financial rate of return:
Financial rates of return were not estimated at appraisal or included in the SAR and, as such, were not
calculated for the purposes of this report.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The Project's institutional development impact was high. The inculcation of commercial discipline with
modem tools and techniques brought about a market-oriented philosophy in NEK's operational strategies,
which also contributed to turn around NEK's financial condition. The corresponding improvements in its
management practices were noticeable through, for example, NEK's handling of its restructuring and
negotiations with foreign private investors (AES, Entergy, etc.). The restructuring/unbundling of NEK into
seven distribution companies, six generation companies and a national transmission company laid the basis
for the introduction of competition. The far-reaching changes achieved in the policy and regulatory
framework through a new energy law are significant, both because of the nature of changes (see section 4.1
above) and in terms of the long term sustainability brought about by them. These developments were
outward looking, along international trends and aimed at achieving harmonization with EU accession
requirements. Bulgaria's imminent membership in the UCTE providing access to the large European market
for electricity trade is also a significant impact of the Project. The project helped Bulgaria join neighboring
countries in synchronous operation of the power system.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Three factors outside the control of the Government and NEK contributed to delays in Project
implementation. The first factor was political/economic instability. At the time the loan was negotiated and
approved in 1993, Bulgaria had begun the difficult transition from a centrally-planned to a market
economy. There have been four elected governmnents since 1991, three caretaker governments and one
"experts" government, which hindered decision-making. There was also replacement of the Presidents of
COE and NEK. These frequent changes and political instability adversely affected COE and NEK ability
to implement policies and development activities on schedule in accordance with Project commitments.
-6 -



Changes in management resulted in changes in decisions regarding restructuring which disrupted corporate
development plans and the corresponding technical assistance. Focus and attention was also diverted by the
severe economic crisis coupled with hyperinflation and the collapse of the banking system in late 1996 -
early 1997.
The second factor was accidents and problems related to physical components. The critical 400 kV line
linking the Chaira underground power house to the switchyard burned accidentally and had to be replaced
before commissioning unit 3 of the Chaira hydropower plant. While the Bank stepped-in in time to finance
the 400 kV link, a nearly one year delay in the Chaira part of the Project was inevitable due to the need to
conduct a new procurement process including developing the tender specifications. Also, a rotor had to be
taken back by the contractor for remanufacturing as problems were encountered during testing, which
resulted in more than six months delays.
The third factor was contractual problems. A contract for the MIS component was delayed due to the
consultant assisting with this procurement going bankrupt during the middle of preparation of the tender
documents. Later, NEK had difficulties in maintaining timely implementation under the Chaira component
as the contractor seemed to deliberately delay implementation progress in its desire to remain employed for
as long as possible due to the decline in the economy. NEK also experienced difficulties with Bulgarian
subcontractor companies which lacked the necessary experience in executing works according to
intemationally accepted contract conditions such as FIDIC. In spite of these exogenous factors affecting
implementation, in due course all actions were completed to the satisfaction of the Bank.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Initially, the Government took all measures, including initiating tariff increases, for loan effectiveness as
planned in August 1993. The successive governments resisted policy decisions entailing tariff increases,
even though the financial condition of NEK had deteriorated to a dangerous condition by mid-1 995
affecting the Project and prospects for other possible assistance from the Bank. The tariff increases were
necessary for the sustainability of the sector and the financial viability of NEK. However, delays in tariff
adjustments did not severely hamper Project financing in the short- term because (i) the Bank contributed
the vast majority of the funds for project financing, and (ii) NEK was able to delay other investments to
meet its contributions to the Project. The uncertainties resulting from possible loan suspension (or even
cancellation) due to non-compliance with the tariff covenant placed NEK in a difficult position to launch
new procurement or to finalize contracts. The establishment of mechanisms for tariff setting by an
independent regulatory body was also delayed, though a transitional arrangement established end-1996 for
automatic adjustment through indexation was found acceptable from NEK's viability and Project's
continuation view points. Frequent changes made by the Government in NEK management also contributed
to implementation delays.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The main factor within the control of NEK that contributed to implementation delays was NEK's poor
implementation capacity and frequent turnover of key staff, particularly in the area of procurement: In
spite of delays, ultimately NEK successfully managed project implementation to completion, including its
own restructuring and unbundling. NEK utilized certain opportunities in its favor, for example, improving
220 kV network using savings. It also proactively sought to work with COE and CoM to find solutions to
the tariff difficulty. NEK appropriately redesigned the scope of the MIS component to conform to the new
organizational structure that resulted from unbundling and committed adequate resources to organizational,
operational and financial improvements in order to maximize benefits. It is noteworthy that NEK respected
-7 -



environmental aspects in the implementation of the Project; it ensured the use of special tools and
techniques by contractors to avoid any negative impacts on the environment and stipulated environmental
conditions in contracts where feasible. NEK performed better than the Government.
J. 4 Costs andfinancing:
Total Project costs, including interest during construction (IDC), were about US$93.5 million equivalent,
or 74% of the appraisal estimate of US$126 million equivalent. The reduction of US$32.5 million
equivalent in project costs was realized in civil works (by about US$7 million), most of the other supply
items (by about US$7 million) and technical assistance (by about US$1 million). In the physical
components, savings can be attributed to conservative, international benchmarks used in appraisal
estimates, the deep devaluation of Leva exchange rate with the US$ (the exchange rate reached Leva 1800
per US$ by mid-1997 compared to the projected exchange rate of Leva 40 per US$ at appraisal) and local
subcontractors' participation at lower than international rates. In the technical assistance component,
savings were mainly from the nearly 66% reduction in the scope of the MIS due to NEK's unbundling. The
increase in IDC was due to the three-year delay in the completion of the Project.
As for financing, the Bank loan was utilized at 84% of the original amount and US$14.7 million was
canceled. NEK's share of financing also was reduced from US$33 million estimated at appraisal to
US$15.1 million equivalent (about 46%), which helped NEK considerably.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The improvement in the system's stability and safety, the turn around in Bulgaria's dependence on foreign
supplies and reserve capacity, the positive trends in the sector's finances and GoB's continuing commitment
to develop the sector indicate that the benefits of the Project are sustainable. NEK and GoB are satisfied
with the results achieved under the Project which, as noted before, is only a first element in the development
strategy. The policy and regulatory environment have already begun to provide the needed stability and
predictability for attracting private sector interest and capital. Competition in generation and supply from
unbundling are expected to further depoliticize tariff setting. Bulgaria's ambition to join the EU should also
provide added assurance on sustainability of the Project's results.
6.2 Transition arrangenment to regular operations:
Even though thermal generation and distribution operations have been separated, NEK retains almost all of
the assets acquired under the Project as it continues to be responsible for transmission & load dispatch as
well as hydropower plant operations. NEK has already internalized the new systems which are fully
deployed in day-to-day operations; as such, transition to regular operations has begun. In addition, similar
investments with financing from other sources, including the EBRD and EIB, are underway to expand
coverage of the system improvements. Sustainable improvements, as measured from imports/exports of
electricity, UCTE testing/monitoring reports, private capital flows to the sector, financial performance of
the sector, etc., should be tracked. It is recommended that an evaluation take place in 2002 for measuring
performance along these criteria and expected competitive trading in electricity. Also, the interim
arrangement of NEK serving as single-buyer up to mid-2002 should be followed-up to ensure a smooth
transition to market-based trading.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
-8 -



7.1 Lending:
The Bank's performance in lending was satisfactory. The Bank, in cooperation with other donors (the
USAID, USTDA, CEA, EIB, EBRD, etc.), provided comprehensive assistance to NEK and COE to
develop an appropriate sector development strategy and also to identify priority areas for short- to
medium-term support. The Bank ensured complementarity through appropriate coordination with the
donors during the preparation. By focusing on the critical priorities of the sector in a comprehensive way,
including sector reforms and corporate development, the Bank was able to define a long-term development
strategy for the sector.
The Bank's desire to keep the design simple could have been further supported by a realistic time table,
especially in policy related actions (e.g. regulatory agency). Better monitoring indicators for evaluating
each component of the Project would have helped both the Bank and NEK during implementation.
7.2 Supervision:
The Bank's performance in supervision is rated as satisfactory. The skill-mix and frequency of missions
was aligned with the needs of implementation and responsive to the issues as they emerged (e.g. tariffs,
dam safety). The Bank's coordination and collaboration with other development partners and donors during
supervision is noteworthy, as it also helped forge a consensus based approach to resolving difficult issues
affecting the collective developmental goals. The Bank's perseverance in handling the tariff issues under
difficult circumstances, including willingness for invoking its remedies, as well as its readiness to respond
to emerging opportunities (e.g. allocation of savings to other priority investments, redesign of MIS) ensured
desired results and expanded benefits of the Project. The Bank also provided recommendations on
protecting the poor, including life line rates and targeted subsidies, which helped GoB in the formulation of
tariff policy options.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
The overall performance was satisfactory throughout the Project cycle.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
NEK was well supported by consultants in the preparation of the Project and also benefited from early
Bank involvement. Commercial aspe&t-and Bank's procurement methods were unfamiliar to NEK, but its
/
commitment was high and senior managers were involved on a continual basis. Considering NEK's
inexperience with management of external project financing, its performance and support during
preparation was impressive and is\rated satisfactory. On the part of COE, because of its policy
responsibilities, high officials were\involved in the preparation of the Project.
7.5 Government inmplementation pe(rfimance:
Despite the changes in Government over the period of project implementation and substantial delays, the
GoB fulfilled the covenants of the Guarantee agreement to the satisfaction of the Bank, eventually. In
addition, GoB proceeded with broader sector reforms, unbundled the sector and proactively sought private
sector interest and capital. Based on the final results, GoB's performance is rated as satisfactory.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
NEK's performance during implementation was satisfactory. Project implementation was carried out by
-9-



NEK's investment division under the direct management of the Executive Director. With the exception of
frequent staff turnover, the department was generally adequately staffed with the appropriate skill mix to
handle the day-to-day implementation aspects. The unit adhered to the procurement strategy and its gradual
capacity building was evident in its handling of over 50 procurement packages, including many
large/complex ones with turnkey contracting. NEK's performance, which was very poor to start with,
progressively improved during implementation. NEK was quick to utilize a part of the savings in the Bank
loan and redesigned the scope of the MIS to better suit the new organizational structure. Despite its earnest
efforts, it could not make up for the time lost during the initial years (slow procurement and tariff issues),
but ensured full or substantial compliance with covenants under the Loan agreement throughout. NEK's
attention to financial aspects, including to timely auditing, could have been more focused.
NEK managed the environmental aspects in a prudent manner and in full cooperation with the panel of
experts by ensuring that contractors met the standards stipulated in their contracts and by diligently
monitoring dam safety aspects as expected under the Project. Its shortcomings in the initial period were
eventually addressed as evidenced by the outcomes and outputs of the Project.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
NEK's overall performance has been satisfactory in both the physical and technical assistance aspects of
the Project. COE's (and GoB's) performance, which was rated as highly unsatisfactory during mid-course
in the Project, was upgraded to satisfactory during the later years for having established a suitable sector
policy, legal and regulatory frameworks and for maintaining tariff levels as required under the Project.
8. Lessons Learned
Adhere to long-term development goals: Keeping the focus on long term development objectives pays off.
Policy reforms, such as the tariff policy, are important to the long term health and sustainability of the
sector. Such reforms require that the macroeconomic situation in a country be under control. In the case
of Bulgaria, the economic crisis and hyperinflation fueled the Government with numerous reasons for
which they did not want to meet the tariff covenant. The Bank's Project team held strong to the commitment
to encouraging the Government to meet the financial covenants of the loan and showed the Government,
through research and global evidence of experience, that it could be met and that benefits could be derived.
The Bank also partnered with other institutions such as the IMF in encouraging the Government to meet its
tariff covenant. The establishment of the currency board and the joint support of the Bank and IMF to the
Government demonstrated that this reform was necessary and doable.
Assess implementation capacity: Even though the project design was simple, NEK's lack of capacity to
deal with extemal financiers such as the Bank could have been addressed through specific TA. Addressing
implementation capacity up front may have also mitigated the problem of high staff turnover. A detailed
assessment of implementation capacity, including procurement, would have helped to avoid delays.
Remainflexible to adapt to emerging trends/opportunities: The Bank's flexible approach to allow changes
in the scope of the Project (e.g. the financing of 220 kV network improvements, redesign of MIS) helped
expand the benefits of the Project. Also, the Bank's encouragement of GoB's intention for advancing sector
restructuring showed how emerging trends could be marshaled for larger gains for the country, e.g.
Bulgaria's ambition to join the EU.

9. Partner Comments
(a) Bornower/implementing agency:
Comments from NEK:
"NEK's assessment of the overall execution of the project is positive. The loan was utilized accordingly
such that all objectives were completed and all activities set in SAR were accomplished. Concomitantly, a
delay in the execution of the project due to a number of objective factors was registered which made
necessary the two-fold extension of the loan.
The Bank team working on the project - both in its organization and execution - rendered assistance to
NEK's personnel in due time with recommendations and instructions. All ambiguities and inaccuracies
associated with the execution of the project were duly clarified and eliminated with the active assistance of
the specialists from the Bank.
All payments in respect of the contracts with the active assistance of the Bank disbursement experts during
the utilization of funds were performed in due time, without registered delays and penalties.
At the same the specialists from NEK acquired experience and knowledge associated with the
implementation of Bank financed projects, such as procedures, execution reports etc."
Comments from SAEER:
"The State Agency of Energy and Energy resources as a state authority, also makes a positive appraisal for
the utilization of the funds from the Loan in fulfillment of the project objectives. We consider that all the
measures and actions that had to be followed and fulfilled in respect with the energy sector restructuring
and set in the Action plan of the Loan Agreement, were performed. NEK has annually submitted to the
Bank its balance sheets, as their audits were performed by Arthur Andersen in compliance with the
International accounting standards.
The measures set in the Guarantee agreement are also being fulfilled. This refers to the financial aspects in
respect with the gradual orienting the Borrowers' activities towards market economy. A new state
regulatory organ was created and the energy tariffs were adjusted.
All the objectives set in SAR were fulfilled and all the projects that were envisaged for financing from the
Loan, were completed. Due to different reasonable factors, the original project estimates were decreased
and in this way, cost savings were achieved. Notwithstanding some difficulties, related to the project
implementation and to the Bank procedures, "Energy I " project has been successfully completed in relation
with the achieved objectives and costs."

10. Additional Information
Mineral Bank, which held the Special Account for the project at inception, went bankrupt. As a result,
NEK returned about US$2 million of loan proceeds to the World Bank.



During the Project implementation period, the World Bank also contributed to sector improvements through
a separate Energy and Environment Review and advisory services to develop and implement the legal and
regulatory framework.

Remark for year 2000: On May 1, 2000, the structure of NEK included transmission,
distribution and generation. By June 1, 2000, the distribution companies, the NPP and
2 TPP were separated from the structure of NEK. By December 31, 2000 NEK had
retained only the transmission functions, a part of the generation and selling of
electricity to industrial consumers. The new NEK profits for 2000 were US$41.7m as
compared to US$97.6m if it was not unbundled.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits
In order to estimate benefits from the Project, during preparation/appraisal, a computer model (Wasp) was
used to simulate the Bulgarian power system, with and without the Project. Replication of this model was
not possible for the purposes of estimating benefits at the time of the ICR. Therefore, the approach taken in
this report was to validate how the assumptions made at the time of the SAR compare with the current
situation and to infer what, if any, impact changes in these assumptions have had on the overall retums on
investments.
The major benefits of the Project predicted at appraisal consisted of increased capacity for (1) active load
management contributable to the Chaira component (2) automatic generation control including primary and
secondary regulation, and (3) voltage and reactive power control. The price of electricity at the end of the
Project was only slightly more than the level assumed at appraisal. As such, the benefits stream is not
estimated to be substantially higher. However, significant cost savings were realized in the project without
loss in scope, and hence higher rates of return were derived from the Project. The table below compares the
ERRs estimated at appraisal with revised ones for the two principal components of the Project (Excel
model results are included in Project files).
ERR (%)               SAR     Revised
The Project                      19%       22%
Chaira Pumped Storage Component  22%       30%
The Transmission Component        11%      13%
Secondary system benefits as estimated in the SAR include reduced system minimum loading and improved
frequency regulation, which have been realized. These benefits are inferred to be higher than expected due
to improvement in the 220 kV network also achieved at costs much lower than anticipated. Thus, the
economic benefits from the Project were satisfactory.
