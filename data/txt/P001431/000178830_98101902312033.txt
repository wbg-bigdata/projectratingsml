FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Liberia
Beneficiary:      Forestry Development Authority
Amount:           US$6.0 million equivalent
Term:             Standard
Project           The primary objectives of the project are to strengthen
Description:   the newly created government Forestry Development Authority
(FDA), introduce a proper framework for forestry development
and management and train Liberians in the forestry sector
to ensure that: (a) Liberia improves its benefits from the
exploitation of one of its principal natural resources; and
(b) Liberians participate more fully in the development of
the forestry industry. The project would provide FDA with
increased staff, buildings, vehicles, equipment, and staff
training as well as technical assistance required to under-
take various policy studies. The project would also establish
a 1,600 ha industrial trial plantation of fast-growing
commercial species.  The principal benefits of the project
would be increased Government revenue from forest taxes and
improved Government capability to formulate and implement
rational forest policies and investment programs. The trial
plantation under the project may lead to development of a
large-scale industrial plantation and possibly the establish-
ment of a pulp industry in Liberia. The project faces no
unusual risks, but the success of the institution building
under the project would require continuous commitment on the
part of the Government and FDA.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA FOR A
FORESTRY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Liberia for the equivalent of US$6.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a forestry development project.
The credit would be made available to the Forest Development Authority (FDA)
in the form of equity. The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and
the African Development Bank (ADB) would co-finance the project on a parallel
basis with a technical assistance grant equivalent to US$1.8 million and a
loan equivalent to US$5.0 million respectively. The ADB loan would have a
repayment term of 20 years including 5 years of grace with interest at 8
percent per annum. 1/
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic report "Liberia: Growth with Development - A Basic
Economic Report" (No. 426a-LBR dated March 1, 1975) was distributed to the
Executive Directors. An economic mission visited Liberia in November/December
1976 and its report on the "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Liberia"
(No. 1642a-LBR) dated February 28, 1978 has also been distributed to the
Executive Directors.
Structural Characteristics
3.        The growth of Liberia's economy remains heavily dependent on the
performance of the enclave sector consisting mainly of: (a) iron ore mines,
(b) rubber plantations, and (c) forestry concessions. These enclaves are
the main source of export earnings. Iron ore mining is by far the largest
single activity in the enclave sector, accounting for about one third of
gross domestic product at factor cost. There are only limited linkages be-
tween the enclaves and the rest of the economy; as a result, the benefits
of economic growth have been unevenly distributed.
4.        Another dimension of structural imbalance ia the disparity between
traditional agriculture and the (monetized) modern sector. Traditional agri-
culture has minimal interaction with the rest of the economy; however, it
supports the majority of the population - as much as 60 percent - who live at
or near subsistence level. With a population of about 1.6 million, average
per capita GNP in 1976 was US$450. While the enclave sector yields a per
capita GDP of about US$2,500 compared to US$550 for the rest of the monetized
1/   The amount and terms of GTZ and ADB contributions, which have been agreed
in principle, remain subject to confirmation by their authorities.



- 2 -
economy, the great majority of the population who live in the traditional non-
monetized sector have a per capita income of about US$100 per annum. To help
redress these imbalances the Government is trying to increase its earnings
from the concessions and use the resources to diversify the economy with
increased participation by Liberians.
Development Plan
5.        The Government has prepared a Four-Year Development Plan covering
the period July 1, 1976 to June 30, 1980. In preparing the Plan the Govern-
ment was assisted by a planning team financed jointly by the Bank, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) and the Government (Reference: President's Memorandum to
the Executive Directors, No. R74-61 dated March 25, 1974). The Plan identi-
fies the basic, long-term objectives of Liberia's socio-economic development
as: (a) diversification of production; (b) dispersion of sustainable socio-
economic activities throughout the country; (c) greater involvement of
Liberians in development activities; and (d) equitable distribution of the
benefits of economic growth so as to ensure an acceptable standard of living
for the people throughout the country. The average annual growth of real GDP
during the Plan period is envisaged at around 6.8 percent. However, because
of delays in the implementation of expected investments in iron ore mining
and some slackening in demand for the country's main exports, the Bank eco-
nomic mission has estimated that real growth during the four-year period is
unlikely to exceed 3-4 percent. Total development expenditure is projected
at US$415 million, of which US$251 million would be financed from foreign
sources and US$164 million domestically. Firm commitments accounted at the
start of the Plan for almost 60 percent of the expected foreign financing.
However, the Plan is currently being revised to take account of developments
during the first two years. This review is not yet complete but it is clear
that the cost of the public investment program will increase substantially
largely to reflect increased costs but also the inclusion of additional
projects. Actual development expenditures over the first two years of the
Plan are estimated at about $200 million. Given the financial, manpower and
institutional constraints it is likely that the implementation of a number of
the projects, as revised, will be delayed beyond the Plan period.
6.        The Development Plan attaches high priority to the development of
agriculture and basic infrastructure. The objective is to diversify and
modernize agricultural production, increase productivity, improve associated
rural economic activities such as marketing and processing, and provide social
and physical infrastructure to promote income distribution and improve the
quality of life in the rural as well as urban areas. The Government has
already embarked on two important agricultural development projects in the
Bong and Lofa Counties which are being assisted by the Bank Group and USAID.
The rubber development project, recently approved by the Executive Directors,
and the proposed forestry project will help promote export earnings and will
lead to greater participation of Liberians in the development of the country's
principal agricultural resources. At the same time the Government plans to
expand water supply and electric power utilities in both urban and rural areas
and to improve the road network, the inadequacy of which presently constitutes



-3-
a constraint to growth. However, the shortage of adequately trained manpower
at all levels is likely to prove the most important constraint to the Govern-
ment's efforts to develop and diversify the economy.  The Government is keenly
aware of this and has adopted a number of policy measures, supported by the
three Bank Group financed education projects, to tackle the problem, However,
by their very nature, these policies are likely to bear fruit only in the
long term; over the short and medium terms, the Government will have to rely
heavily on foreign technical assistance.
Recent Economic Developments
7.        During 1973-1975 Liberia, like most other developing countries, was
hit by higher import prices and international inflation. While strong world
demand for Liberia's major export, iron ore, brought large gains in export
prices in 1974, the 1975 recession in the industrialized countries signifi-
cantly reduced the demand for the country's most important export commodi-
ties -- iron ore, rubber and timber. With growth performance continuing to be
largely a function of enclave activities, growth of real GDP -- which averaged
about 6.4% a year in the 1967-1970 period has slowed down significantly and is
estimated to be about 3.0% in 1976. Preliminary estimates indicate that GDP
growth may have declined further during 1977.
8.        Liberia has had a long history of sound fiscal management, and public
sector resources have not come under undue pressure during the past decade.
A satisfactory growth in Government revenues averaging about 13.5% per year
between 1970-1975 enabled the Government to finance increasing expenditures.
Recurrent expenditures during this period grew by about 10% while development
expenditures increased nearly fourfold. However, public sector finances have
recently come under increased pressure which is likely to continue over the
medium term mainly because of an anticipated acceleration in the rate of growth
of government expenditur s coupled with a more moderate rate of growth in reve-
nues. The rate of growth of Government revenues is likely to be moderate in
view of the anticipated lower GDP growth rate as well as the continued slack
in world demand for iron ore. There may be scope for an increased revenue
effort on the part of Government as well as improvements in the efficiency
and pricing policies of the public corporations so as to ease the pressure
on central government finances. In this context, Government has recently
enacted a new Revenue and Finance Law and is also negotiating with the iron
ore companies regarding its share in profits and future dividend distribution
policies. However, in view of the narrowness of the Government's resource
base, the Government's resource mobilization effort would have only limited
effect at least over the medium term. Thus some local cost financing by ex-
ternal donors would be needed to help alleviate the Government's financial
constraint.
Balance of Payments
9.        During the 1964-1972 period, merchandise exports grew by 10% and
imports by 5.9% annually in current prices. Thereafter, from 1972 to 1974,
mostly reflecting accelerated international inflation, imports rose by 29%
annually, exceeding-the 22% annual export growth. Oil imports increased from
US$12 million in 1972 to US$56 million in 1974. From 1975 onwards the decline
in the volume of exports has been partly offset by favorable movement in the



- 4 -
terms of trade but the trade surplus nevertheless declined from US$111 mil-
lion in 1974 to US$58 million in 1976, while the current account deficit,
reflecting the substantial remittances of capital and other factor income
from enclave operations, widened to about US$81 million in 1975 and US$46
million in 1976 as compared with a surplus of US$55 million in 1973. The
current account deficits have been financed mostly by private capital trans-
actions.
Creditworthiness
10.       Liberia's external public debt outstanding and disbursed was esti-
mated at about US$201 million as of December 1976. Debt service payments as
a proportion of exports of goods and non-factor services were estimated at
4.3% in 1976 as compared to 5.7% and 7.7% for 1974 and 1972 respectively.
Debt service payments as a percentage of Government revenues have also dec-
lined from 24.3% in 1972 and 21.1% in 1974 to 13.4% in 1976. Based on the
existing debt, both ratios are projected to increase gradually in the next few
years as export earnings are expected to level off and public revenues grow
more moderately. The Bank Group share of the public debt outstanding and
disbursed is presently about 18%. Liberia's debt service ratio through the
1980s is expected to remain relatively modest (below 10%) unless there is an
unexpected deterioration in external conditions. In this context, it should
be noted that Liberia's exports are highly concentrated in a few commodities
(mainly iron ore and rubber) with unstable world market prices. Given the
country's satisfactory economic performance and its modest debt service ratio,
Liberia should be regarded as creditworthy for a significant amount of Bank
lending, blended with some assistance from IDA.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN LIBERIA
11.       The Bank has made 16 loans (including one Third Window loan) for
projects in Liberia totalling US$98.3 million; there have been 6 IDA credits
totalling US$30 million and one technical assistance grant of US$200,000
for development planning. IFC has made two equity investments totalling
US$555,000 in the share capital of the Liberian Bank for Development and
Investment (LBDI). The Bank loans have been mainly for roads, port expan-
sion, power and LBDI; IDA credits have been for education and agriculture.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of May 31, 1978 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The objectives of Bank Group operations are:  (a) to help Liberians
take greater initiative in developing their own resources for the benefit
of their own people; (b) to support policies and programs leading to broader
sharing of the fruits of economic progress; (c) to help the Government in
broadening the economic base and in overcoming infrastructural constraints to
growth; and (d) to assist the Government in mobilizing development resources
from other external agencies. In furthering these objectives particular
attention is being paid to the need to expand the supply of trained manpower
so as to relieve this potential constraint to development.



13.       In line with the priorities established in the Government's Four-
Year Development Plan, the Bank plans to give increasing emphasis in its
lending program over the next few years to the agricultural and rural develop-
ment. The Bank Group is currently co-financing with USAID two agricultural
projects currently under implementation in Bong and Lofa Counties. These
projects are designed to assist a total of about 17,000 subsistence peasant
farmers to diversify their production base and to increase their productivity
and income through the provision of an integrated package of support services
and infrastructures. It is expected that other rural development projects
aimed at increasing the incomes and standard of living of the rural poor will
shortly be identified for Bank Group assistance. A rubber development project
has recently been approved which would lead to expanded exports, increased
productivity and incomes for small and medium size rubber farmers, strength-
ened credit and extension services and greater Liberian participation in the
development of this subsector. The proposed forestry project would strengthen
the Government's forestry service, initiate an industrial plantation program
and help Liberia to better manage and exploit its forestry resources.
14.       In infrastructure, a water supply project is under consideration
which would rehabilitate and expand the Monrovia water supply system, extend
water distribution to lower income groups in the metropolitan area, and
help strengthen the management and finances of the Liberia Water and Sewer-
age Corporation. A fourth power project has recently been approved which
would expand the Liberia Electricity Corporation's thermal power generating
facilities to meet demand until a new hydro-electric generating facility has
been constructed and made operational around 1985. A feeder road project
has been appraised which would comprise a four year program for the construc-
tion, improvement and maintenance of about 800 miles of feeder roads to
support opening up of agricultural hinterlands of Liberia. In the social
sector, three education projects have been financed by the Bank Group. The
first two projects aimed at improving secondary education, education planning
and management, as well as extending the educational system to rural areas
through the provision of secondary schools and 100 village community schools.
The third project emphasizes vocational and technical training. The Bank
plans to undertake a study of the manpower needs of the economy and ways in
which to augment the supply of trained personnel.
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL AND FORESTRY SECTOR
Sector Characteristics
15.       General agriculture including forestry is the second largest pro-
ductive sector in the economy and provides one-quarter of gross domestic
product. Agricultural output in 1976 totalled US$224 million of which US$94
million originated in the monetized sector including rubber (US$44 million),
forestry (US$35 million), coffee, cocoa and palm products and US$130 million
in the subsistence sector. About 54% of the total population of Liberia or
about 150,000 households work in agriculture. With 14 persons per square
kilometer, average population density is low, ranging from 5 to 20 in the
various counties.



-6-
16.       Liberian agriculture is characterized by small, traditional farms
that comprise more than 90% of total agricultural holdings. The traditional
sector is largely outside the monetized economy, located in areas with minimal
infrastructure and composed of farms where less than 5 acres are cultivated
each year, producing mostly subsistence crops such as rice and cassava and
some cash crops such as coffee, cocoa and sugar cane. There is little or no
adoption of modern innovation. The average income of the traditional small-
holder is around US$100 per capita, compared with a national average of
about US$450. Alongside the traditional agriculture there are large foreign-
owned plantations, producing exclusively for export (rubber, timber), which
are characterized by use of trained managerial and technical staff and ex-
tensive capital outlay. Also in recent years Liberian-owned commercial
farms have gained importance. These farms are primarily engaged in rubber
production but are gradually expanding into cocoa, coffee, oil palm, and vege-
tables, as well as some poultry and livestock. Management of these farms,
with the exception of a few larger ones, is generally inefficient, and yields
are poor.
The Forestry Sector
17.       Contribution to the Economy.  In 1976 the forestry subsector
accounted for about 4% of GDP. Exports of forestry products are significant
and rank as the fourth largest export commodity after iron ore, rubber and
diamonds. Forestry exports in the period 1972-76 averaged US$13 million a
year and, in current dollar values, exceeded US$45 million in 1976, or about
4% of toial export value. The total3volume of logs removed increlsed from
48,000 m  in 1967 to about 605,000 m  in 1976, of which 315,00Q m , with an
f.o.b. value of US$35 million, were exported.  About 290,000 m  of logs3were
locally converted to sawn lumber, exports of which amounted to 49,000 m
valued at about US$8 million. The Government derived about US$8 million
in revenue in 1976 from its forests through stumpage fees, land rentals and
reforestation fees. This should be compared with its expenditure in the
forestry sector of about US$1 million. Direct employment provided by the
sector is currently about 5,000 persons, of which 5% are expatriates occupy-
ing principally the senior managerial positions. The contribution of forestry
to countrywide wage employment is about 6%.
18.       Resources and Industries.  About half of Liberia's land area is cov-
ered by forests. Some 2 million ha is closed tropical hardwood productive
forest, all of which has been allocated to 46 concessionaires. The balance
is described as open forest, which is subject to farming rights and shifting
cultivation. Of the productive foress, the estimated "sustainable" supply
of commercial timber is 1.8 million m (r) / per annum, compared with pres-
ent annual removals of about 0.6 million m . This represents a substantial
resource as the current supply of tropical hardwood from other countries is
becoming exhausted.
1/   (r) = roundwood (logs).



19.       Work on a forest resources inventory has been mainly carried out
by a German Aid forest mission. More than 235 species of trees have been
identified, of which 60 to 90 are considered to be potentially marketable.
Presently, however, less than 15 species, accounting for about 20 percent
of total standing volume, are well known on the world market. Exploitation
of the concessions has therefore mainly been a "creaming" operatiuon which
results in over-cutting of the more valuable species. Increased research
into the utilization and marketing promotion of lesser-known species could
help to prevent over-exploitation of established species and would make more
effective use of Liberia's forest resources.
20.       The present exploitable forest is likely to diminish because con-
cessionaires, who are less interested in long-term utilization than in short-
term exploitation of valuable species, are not doing enough to improve forest
management procedures (e.g., replanting). There are also competing land
use claims, mainly from shifting agriculture; the 80% of productive forest
declared as National Forest is still being encroached upon by shifting culti-
vators who follow concessionaires' logging operations. An immediate priority
is therefore to demarcate and develop permanent forest estates which would
be adequately protected and the full potential of which would be efficiently
exploited through improved forest management practices. Improved forest
management of natural tropical sorest could increase the mean annual incre-
mental production from 1 to 2 m /ha/year. Furthermore, plantations with fast
growing species can produce up to five times more wood annually than slow-
growing natural forests. This approach would reduce land needed for forestry
and release fertile forest lands for agriculture. Conversion of part of the
forest areas to tree crop cultivation could therefore be considered.
21.       Apart from Government's intention to provide continuous timber pro-
duction from the indigenous forest through natural regeneration, Liberia is
embarking on a modest reforestation program. The Government initiated a
reforestation program in 1974, financed by fees levied from concessionaires
on logs harvested. By the end of 1976, about 4,500 ha had been reforested
under this program. Since the country is ecologically and climatically
well-suited for fast-growing species for manufacturing timber, wood-pulp and
wood-based panel products, the Government intends to embark on large-scale
industrial forest plantations, provided they can be economically justified.
At present, little is known of the performance on a commercial scale of
fast-growing indigenous or exotic trees in plantations, or of the techniques
and cost of establishment. A period of intensive commercial scale trials is
therefore needed before a major program can be undertaken.
22.       Forest exploitation grew in importance only from 1968 after a pre-
liminary countrywide forest inventory was completed. Following this, more
concessions were granted, covering most accessible forest areas. Because
of lack of capital and technical knowhow, most concessionaires are foreign
entrepreneurs with European marketing outlets. Although the timber industry
in Liberia is still based on log e5ports, locally processed wood rose from
77,000 m (r) in 1970 to 290,000 m (r) in 1976 (i.e., about 48% of total
log production). Local processing - which accelerated partly from the in-
troduction of legislation in 1973 that aimed at 100% local processing of logs



- 8 -
by 1977 - is mainly concentrated on sawmilling and simple furniture produc-
tion. With few exceptions, however, local processing is unplanned and un-
regulated. The larger expatriate-controlled logging companies have made
little effort to develop local manufacturing capacity and many sawmills
are small, inefficient and poorly managed. Government regards development
of the mechanical wood processing industry as important since this will
significantly increase the value added from the sector, and contribute to
employment and industrialization opportunities.
Institutions
23.       The Forest Development Authority (FDA).  Following an organizational
study prepared by FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program, FDA was established as
a corporate body under the Forest Act in early 1977. FDA, which is financed
through government budgetary appropriations, is responsible for the adminis-
tration, conservation and control of national forest areas; formulation of
forest policies (including land use); investment proposals; forest inventory
planning and control of concession licenses in conjunction with the Concession
Secretariat in the Ministry of Finance; monitoring of private sector logging
and sawmill operations, including marketing; collection of revenues; carrying
out of forestry management programs; and research and forestry training.
24.       The Concession Secretariat.  The Concession Secretariat is the
executing body of the Concession and Investment Commission. One of its tasks
is to introduce uniformity among concession agreements, particularly invest-
ment incentives and taxes. In 1973 the Secretariat introduced a standard
agreement for forestry concessionaires, and intends to renegotiate those
agreements that were made before 1973.
Objectives. Strategies and Policies
25.       The role played by the forestry sector in the Liberian economy is
still comparatively small, but has considerable untapped potential. Thus,
with the prospect of a long-term decline in the mining industry, which
hitherto has led Liberian economic growth, and the desirability of moving away
from over-dependence on non-renewable resources such as iron ore, the Govern-
ment is anxious to develop the forestry sector as part of the strategy to
diversify and strengthen Liberia's permanent resource base.
26.       Liberia's long-term forestry development strategy would therefore
be directed toward the building up of forest inventories; improvement of
forest management and market information; promotion of viable industrial
development (mechanical wood processing, industrial plantations) with greater
Liberian equity participation; development of the present transport infra-
structure, including port handling facilities; and introduction of forest
legislation and improving enforcement.
27.       Under Liberia's Four-Year Development Plan, the Government is
seeking to:



- 9 -
(a) increase its share of the revenues from Liberia's forest
exploitation;
(b) increase output by developing efficient plantations, logging
and mechanical wood processing facilities; and
(c)  improve forest management, planning and policy formulation.
28.       Compared with other West African timber-producing countries,
Liberia's forest exploitation is a relatively new industry and accordingly
Liberia's forestry service is of recent origin and weak due to lack of
experience, restricted funds and inadequate training programs. The Govern-
ment recognizes that these objectives can only be attained through efficient
Government forestry institutions. Therefore, the strengthening of the FDA
and training of Liberians in the forestry sector is an important element of
Liberia's strategy for forest development.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The proposed project was identified by the Government and prepared
by a series of FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program missions which visited
Liberia in the period 1974-1977. The proposed project was appraised in
October-November 1977 and a Staff Appraisal Report entitled "Liberia:
Forestry Project," No. 1954-LBR dated June 27, 1978 is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations took place in Washington
from May 30 to June 2, 1978. The Liberian negotiating team was led by Mr.
Jenkins Baker, Deputy Minister of Agriculture.
Project ObJectives
30.       The primary objectives of the project are to strengthen the newly
created Government Forestry Development Authority, introduce a proper frame-
work for forestry development and management, and train Liberians in the
forestry sector to ensure that: (a) Liberia improves its benefits from the
exploitation of one of its principal natural resources; and (b) Liberians
participate more fully in the development of the forestry industry.
31.       The project would help the Government to meet its forestry develop-
ment plan objectives including protection of forests and improvement in
forest management and planning, the introduction of trial industrial planta-
tions with fast growing species, and the introduction of fiscal policies
for development of forest industries. It would complement the commercial
logging and sawmill training project being prepared by the German Agency for
Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and the Third Education Project (Cr. 1417-LBR)
under which a forestry training institute will be constructed at Bomi Hills.

Project Content
32.       The project, which would be implemented over the five-year period
1979 through 1983, would include: strengthening the Forestry Development
Authority; establishing a 1,600 ha industrial trial plantation in Grand Cape
Mount County; setting up staff training; and providing technical assistance
and consultancy services to carry out high priority studies and surveys for
the long term development of the sector.
33.       Forest Development Authority.  The project would assist FDA to
introduce better forest management practices, to improve the present in-
efficient forest revenue collection system and to control all forestry sector
operations. Additional staff, offices for FDA headquarters in Monrovia and
three regional headquarters covering 22 districts, staff housing and workshops
in the field, vehicles and other equipment would be provided. During the
project period, FDA forest management and revenue collecting staff would
increase from 300 to 430. This would result in a ratio of staff to total
forest area under concession of about 1:8000 ha, which is appropriate and in
line with other timber producing countries in West Africa.
34.       Trial Industrial Plantation.  Under the project, FDA would estab-
lish a 1,600 ha industrial trial plantation of fast-growing species in the
national forest reserve in Grand Cape Mount County. The primary purposes of
the trial plantation are to train Liberians in establishment of commercial
scale plantations and to collect and evaluate technical and financial data
necessary to determine the viability of a large scale industrial plantation
for pulp, wood chips or sawlogs.
35.       Technical Assistance, Training and Studies. -(a) The project would
provide seven internationally recruited experts to assist FDA to develop and
implement forestry and forest industry policies, improve forest management
techniques and implement the trial industrial plantation. Two experts are
already in post financed by an advance from the Project Preparation Facility
of US$198,000 approved in February 1977. (b) The project would provide a
total of 212 man-months of overseas training for selected Liberian staff of
FDA, which will include 92 man-months in forest management, forest economics
and planning; 30 man-months in industrial plantation techniques; and 30 man-
months in hardwood timber marketing. In addition, all internationally re-
cruited staff would provide in-service training of Liberian staff. (c) The
project would include a total of 80 man-months of consultant services to
provide specialist back-up services to FDA and to undertake studies relat-
ing to forest policy proposals and future forestry industry projects. The
consultant back-up services would include the establishment of an effective
market information system, strengthening FDA's accounting system and finan-
cial control, and assisting with the evaluation of plantation trial results.
The studies would include a pre-industrial plantation survey which would
investigate various end uses of the industrial plantation, including pulp
and sawlogs; a feasibility study on the charcoal industry and a forest policy
study. The average cost of consultants is estimated at US$6,000 per man-
month.

36.       Land Use Planning.  The project would also include production and
interpretation of LANDSAT imagery and infrared aerial photography for about
two-thirds of Liberia to complete the land use classification exercises. This
will provide a tool for planning agricultural and forestry development both at
the national and regional levels.
Project Cost and Financing
37.       Total project cost is estimated at US$17.5 million, which includes
an estimated US$0.3 million of indirect taxes but excludes all other identi-
fiable taxes and import duties. Costs include physical contingencies of 5%
and price contingencies ranging from 6% to 8% per annum. The foreign cost
component is estimated at US$109. million or 62% of total project costs.
38.       The proposed IDA credit of US$6.0 million would cover 34% of total
project costs and would be used to finance US$4.1 million of foreign expend-
iture costs and US$1.9 million of local costs. The IDA credit would be
disbursed against buildings and housing for FDA and the trial industrial
plantation, technical assistance, staff training and studies. Parallel
financing would be provided by an ADB loan of US$5.0 million (29% of total
project costs) which would be disbursed against the foreign costs of vehicles,
equipment, incremental operating costs and aerial photography. The ADB loan
would be for 20 years including 5 years of grace with interest at 8%. GTZ
would provide a technical assistance grant equivalent to US$1.8 million (10%
of total project cost) which would finance employment of five technical
experts. The Government would finance the remaining US$4.7 million equivalent
to 27% of total project costs. The signing of the ADB loan agreement and the
GTZ technical assistance agreement would be a special condition of credit
effectiveness (draft Development Credit Agreement, Section 5.01). The three
cofinancing agencies together would cover 73 percent of total project costs.
Project Implementation
39.       All project components would be implemented by FDA over the five-
year period 1979-1983. Construction of houses and other buildings would
be completed within the first two years, and overseas training, consultant
services and various studies within the first three years. The recruitment
of additional FDA staff would be spread over four years and the trial indus-
trial plantation would be established over five years. The FDA headquarters
would be reorganized into five divisions: Planning and Research Division
which would be responsible for formulating and monitoring all forest policies
including the forest taxation and forest management policies; two Technical
Services Divisions which would be responsible for enforcement and control of
forest exploitation and fiscal policies as well as forest protection, refores-
tation, plantations and training; and Finance and Administration Divisions
which would be responsible for all financial and administrative matters of FDA
respectively. The key positions of FDA (i.e., Managing Director, Assistant
Managing Director and Divisional Heads) are currently filled by competent
Liberians and it was agreed that these positions would continue to be manned
by persons whose qualifications and experience are satisfactory to IDA (draft



- 12 -
Project Agreement, Section 3.02). The establishment of the trial industrial
plantation in Grand Cape Mount County would be carried out by FDA's Technical
Services Division through its industrial plantation unit to be located at Bomi
Hills. The unit would employ about 20 professional and technical staff to
operate the plantation. In order to speed up implementation of this component,
FDA has already constructed access roads and cleared land for nurseries and
campsites. It is proposed that retroactive financing of up to US$250,000 be
provided to cover expenditures incurred after January 1, 1978 to carry out the
above start-up activities (draft Development Credit Agreement, Schedule 1,
para. 4).
Forest Policy Proposals
40.       In view of their importance for the planning and development of the
forestry industry, FDA will have to establish forest management, exploitation,
reforestation and fiscal policies. Some of these are already under prepara-
tion with technical assistance provided by GTZ. These policy proposals would
be completed by FDA with the technical assistance provided under the project
and FDA has agreed to submit these proposals to IDA before June 30, 1979, for
review and consultation (draft Project Agreement, Section 2.06(b)).
Large Scale Industrial Plantation Program
41.       The trial plantation component of the project may lead eventually
to the establishment over a 15-year period of a large scale industrial plan-
tation of about 70,000 ha in Grand Cape Mount County which was declared a
national forest reserve specifically for future industrial plantation devel-
opment. Once fully developed, such a plantation could produce enough wood
to sustail the production of a 250,000-ton pulp mill, 3or alternatively up to
250,000 m a year of sawn timber plus about 400,000 m of woodchips, which
would increase substantially the value added of the sector to the economy.
The results of the trial plantation in conjunction with the various studies
proposed under the project would provide the basis for determining whether
such a large scale industrial plantation is a viable enterprise. One of the
most important studies is the pre-industrial plantation survey which would
consider alternative end uses of the plantation timber, either for pulp or
sawlogs integrated with chips. The survey would also carefully evaluate
growth rate performance of the various on-going trial plantations. On the
basis of these studies, FDA would by June 30, 1982 prepare in consultation
with IDA, investment proposals for expanding the trial into a full industrial
plantation development program (draft Project Agreement, Section 2.06(a)).
Once the viability of the large scale industrial plantation has been estab-
lished, project preparation for the first investment phase of plantation
development would be undertaken by FDA. By 1983 FDA will be fully equipped to
implement the first investment phase, following increased staffing, training
and experience provided under the project.

Procurement
42.       Civil works contracts for buildings and houses would not be suit-
able for international competitive bidding since they would be large in number
and widely dispersed in location covering 22 forest districts throughout the
country. Such contracts, valued at US$4.1 million, would be awarded on the
basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in accordance with procedures
satisfactory to IDA. Simple structures such as huts, small workshops and
storage facilities would be constructed through FDA's force account up to an
aggregate amount of US$600,000. Contracts for items to be financed by ADB
(i.e., vehicles, equipment, operation and maintenance and aerial photography)
would be awarded in accordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB. Interna-
tional staff and consultants would be employed on terms and conditions and
with qualifications and experience acceptable to IDA.
Disbursements
43.       The IDA credit of US$6.0 million would be disbursed over five years
1979-83 as follows: (a) 90% of total costs of civil works (US$4.1 million);
(b) 100% of foreign expenditure for technical assistance, studies and staff
training totalling US$1.3 million; and (d) an unallocated amount of US$0.6
million. On the effective date of the Credit Agreement funds disbursed under
the Project Preparation Facility would be repaid from the credit account.
Benefits and Justification
44.       The project would have substantial, but largely unquantifiable,
benefits resulting from strengthening FDA and implementing the forestry sector
policies and programs. The project would: (a) enable Liberia to control
effectively one of its principal resources thereby ensuring that Liberia
obtains an equitable share of benefits from its exploitation; (b) promote
greater participation of Liberians in development of the forestry industry;
(c) increase the economic potential of the forestry sector through promotion
of industrial plantations and wood-processing industry and more efficient
utilization and management of forest resources. An immediate benefit of the
project would be increased Government revenue resulting from more efficient
collection of forest stumpage fees and other forest taxes. Presently it is
estimated that about 15% to 20% of forest stumpage fees are not collected by
FDA due to incorrect scaling of logs and marking of species and poor control
of log exports at ports, together with insufficient knowledge to assess the
economic value of raw and processed lumber.  It is estimated that recovery
of stumpage fees could be increased by at least 7.5%, which would represent
an increase in revenues of about US$2-3 million per annum by 1982-83. The
estimated financial rate of return from strengthening FDA, which accounts for
77% of total project costs, is 17.8% over 20 years, based on incremental costs
and the benefits derived from increased forest revenue collection. The estab-
lishment of a trial industrial plantation under the project would provide FDA
with the technical and financial data, organization and trained staff which
are needed before Liberia can embark on development of a large-scale indus-
trial plantation. Preliminary calculations indicate that a large-scale
industrial plantation such as the one being envisaged in Grand Cape Mount
County would be economically viable where the plantation timber is used for
manufacturing pulp or sawlogs integrated with woodchips.

45.       The project faces no unusual risks which may jeopardize its imple-
mentation or the achievement of its objectives. However, the success of the
institution building effort would depend to a large degree on the ability of
FDA to recruit and retain competent staff and the continuous commitment of
the Government to develop FDA into a viable forestry institution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Liberia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and FDA and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article
V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are being
distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
47.       In addition to the features of the Development Credit and Project
Agreements which are referred to in the text and listed in Section III of
Annex III, additional conditions of effectiveness would be that the ADB loan
agreement and GTZ technical assistance agreement have been signed.
48.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
49.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 305-LBR        First Education Proiect:  US$7.2 Million Credit of
May 17, 1972; Effective Date: December 18, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
After initial delays in awarding civil works contracts, project
implementation has progressed satisfactorily, and most project facilities were
in operation by the start of the school year in March 1978. All technical
assistance posts have been filled and the fellowship component has been fullly
implemented. The education, manpower, and university planning components have
been completed satisfactorily. The project Closing Date has been extended
to December 31, 1979 to allow for full disbursement of technical assistance
funds and retention period for construction. There will be a small cost
overrun that will be met by Government. Project management has been good.
Loan No. 1266T-LBR        Second Education Project:  US$4.0 Million Third
Window Loan of June 7, 1976; Effective Date:
July 8, 1976; Closing Date: October 31, 1980
Project implementation is about 15 months behind schedule due to
shortages of construction materials and unusually long rainy season but the
pace of implementation is now increasing. Most of project's technical assist-
ance personnel are in post and candidates for fellowships have been nominated.
Equipment lists are being prepared and furniture and vehicles are being pur-
chased. Construction of 40 of the 100 community school units is underway and
26 units were ready for the start of the school year in March 1978. Extension
of the Zorzor Rural Teacher Training Institute should be completed about five
months behind schedule in June 1978. The project is expected to be completed
about a year after the original completion date but within appraisal cost
estimates. Project management is good.
Loan No. 1417-LBR         Third Education Project:  US$6.3 Million Loan of
May 26, 1977; Effective Date: July 13, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily about six months
*        behind schedule.  The Division of Educational Facilities has been established
and is carrying out design work on project and non-project schools. Bids
for civil works at the VTC, AITB, and science and technology centers have
been and are to be returned in July 1978, about six months behind appraisal
forecasts.  The program continues to be behind schedule but the situation is
improving. The technical assistance program is on schedule. The technical
assistance and fellowship program for the VTC and AITB is being revised to
take account of changed circumstances since appraisal concerning the avail-
ability of technical teachers. Project management has been good.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Credit No. 306-LBR        Agricultural Development and Technical Assistance
Project: US$1.2 million Credit of May 17, 1972;
Effective Date: December 8, 1972; Closing Date:
June 30, 1978
Implementation of the project suffered during the early stages
due to financial, administrative and managerial problems but the situation
gradually improved and all project objectives, except for the Pilot Rubber
Scheme, were achieved.  The replanted acreage under the Pilot Rubber Scheme
is about 35 percent below appraisal estimates but the Scheme will be incor-
porated into the Rubber Development Project. The rice research program has
made good progress and will be continued under the Bong County Agricultural
Development Project. The closing date is being extended to September 30,
1978 to allow final disbursements under the credit.
Credit No. 577-LBR        Agricultural Development (Lofa) Proiect:  US$6
million Credit of August 1, 1975; Effective Date:
May 26, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is in its second year of implementation (the Credit
became effective in May 1976, but key technical and managerial staff did not
reach full strength until September-October 1976) and progress to date has
been satisfactory. During the first cropping season, 75 ha of swamp rice,
76 ha of upland rice, 110 ha of coffee and 35 ha of cocoa were developed.
Project proposals for feeder road improvement, training of extension staff and
farmers, input and credit supply, development of rural banking services and
schistosomiasis surveillance are being implemented satisfactorily. Disburse-
ment of IDA credit is behind schedule primarily because of late start of the
project but expected to accelerate as project activities gather momentum.
Government of Liberia has kept the project adequately funded and has given the
required support. There has been a positive response from the project farmers.
Credit No. 700-LBR        Agricultural Development (Bong) Project:  US$7
million Credit of December 29, 1977; Effective Date:
March 15, 1978; Closing Date:  December 31, 1983
Signing of the credit was delayed by several months due to staffing
problems.  Most of key project positions have now been filled and the project
implementation has begun. The recruitment of key project staff was financed
under the project preparation facility. Other project start-up activities
(e.g. construction of office buildings and staff houses) are underway.
Loan No. 1544-LBR         Rubber Development Project:  US$7 million Loan and
Credit No. 786-LBR        US$6 million Credit, both of April 21. 1978:  Not
Effective; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
Project start up activities (e.g. staff training, nursery prepara-
tion, acquisition of land, building plan) financed by the Government are
making good progress and the project implementation is expected to commence

on schedule. The project manager is in post and the financial controller has
been appointed. The project is expected to become effective towards the end
of July 1978.
Loan No. 907-LBR          Second Highway Project:  US$3.0 Million Lc .n of
June 13, 1973; Effective Date: December 28, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978;
Credit No. 395-LBR        US$2.6 Million Credit of June 13, 1973; Effective
Date: December 28, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
The design and reconstruction of the Monrovia By-Pass has been com-
pleted with a small cost overrun. The feasibility studies of the improvement
of three roads in the vicinity of Monrovia are now completed; on two of the
roads which are important links in the main highway network, reconstruction
has been demonstrated as amply justified and was included in the Fourth
Highway Project. Technical assistance in the Government's four-year main-
tenance program is already showing benefits in improved running surfaces on
earth and gravel roads and plans are now being made to consolidate the gains
and develop them still further by closer attention to the organization and
planning of road maintenance. A study to determine how best to improve the
efficiency of the local civil engineering construction industry has been
completed. The closing date has been extended to December 31, 1978 to allow
final disbursements.
Loan No. 1156-LBR         Third Highway Project:  US$27.5 Million Loan of
August 28, 1975; Effective Date: October 14, 1975;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The construction of a major bridge and of an urban main road (5.4
mi.) in Monrovia and of a rural main road (83 mi.) has started and is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily although initially somewhat hampered by bad weather
and difficulties in the supply of materials. The feasibility studies about
85 miles of main roads and an urban transport study in Monrovia are making
good progress. A feeder road construction unit became operational in January
1977 and is operating successfully in connection with the Lofa County Agricul-
tural Development Project (577-LBR). Technical assistance in building up
Planning and Programming Division of the Ministry of Public Works is proving
fairly effective.
Loan No. 1573-LBR        Fourth Highway Project:  US$13.8 Million Loan of
June 2, 1978; not yet effective; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The Project includes reconstruction and improvement of the
Paynesville-Totota and Paynesville-Robertsfield road, technical assistance
for road maintenance and pre-investment studies. The loan has not yet become
effective pending the conclusion of a loan agreement between the Government
and the Kuwait Fund which has agreed to finance the Paynesville-Robertsfield
road on a parallel basis.

Loan No. 1055-LBR         Second Development Finance Company (LBDI) Prolect:
US$4 Million Loan of December 3. 1974; Effective Date:
January 3, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979; and
Loan No. 1323-LBR         Third Development Finance Company (LBDI) Project:
US$7 Million Loan of October 7, 1976; Effective Date:
December 17, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The Loan 1055-LBR helped LBDI meet its financial requirements through
calendar year 1976. LBDI's loan approvals during calendar 1976 surpassed the
projected level for the year. Commitments and disbursements were similarly
above targets. Disbursement of Bank funds, in particular, had been faster
than projected. The loan is fully committed and 95 percent disbursed as of
May 31, 1978. The Loan 1323-LBR, signed October 7, 1976, together with loans
from the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank are ex-
pected to cover LBDI's foreign resource gap for the period 1977 and 1979.
Loan No. 1150-LBR         Third Power Project:  US$1.8 Million Loan of
August 1, 1975; Effective Date: October 20, 1975;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project finances technical assistance for establishing a
long-range development plan and detailed investment program as well as for
strengthening the management of the Liberia Electricity Corporation (LEC) and
training its staff. LEC's management continues to need external support and
the training program needs to be expanded to include practical training for
middle-level staff. The financial performance of the utility has deteriorated
and remedial measures are being taken to improve LEC's financial viability,
e.g. tariff increases, improved financial controls, in connection with the
Fourth Power Project. LEC has recently engaged a foreign electric power
utility to provide a management support team to replace expatriates who have
left at the expiry of their contracts. A US$10.0 million loan for the Fourth
Power Project was approved on June 15, 1978. The project would expand LEC's
thermal power generating facilities to meet demand up to 1985 and includes
extension of electricity to lower income groups in the Monrovia metropolitan
area.
