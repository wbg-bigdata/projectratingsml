APPRAISAL OF THE TRANS-PERAK AREA DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Introduction
1.01      The Government of Malaysia has requested Bank assistance in financ-
ing the Trans-Perak Area Development Project, which would provide for
development of 14,800 ha of new land for rice and treecrops and rehabilita-
tion of 3,700 ha of existing rice land. The proposed project combines land
rehabilitation and new land development to provicle 6,900 families with
1.2 ha of irrigated rice land and a 1.2 ha share in a treecrop plantation.
It would include roads, housing, community facilities, palm oil and cocoa
mills, and supporting services for agriculture and community development.
The project focuses on one of the major identifiable groups of the rural
poor, the rice smallholders, and addresses two of the constraints to
achieving an income above poverty level, the small size of holding and low
productivity of land. This would be the first Bank-assisted project
involving participation of the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation
Authority (FELCRA).
1.02      The Perak State Economic Planning Unit and the Economic Planning
Unit in the Office of the Prime Minister jointly prepared the project with
assistance from local consultants KPM Khidmat Sdn. Bhd. in association with
Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation (Australia). Bank missions and the
relevant implementing agencies also assisted in the identification and
preparation of the project. This report is based on the findings of an
appraisal mission comprising Messrs. R. Dy and A. Alamin, Mrs. N. Hill
(Bank), and Messrs. F. Stepanich and S.K. Ng (Consultants) which visited
Malaysia in June/July 1980. Mr. R. Qureshi led the preappraisal mission
and contributed to the report.
The Agricultural Sector
1.03      The agricultural sector plays a dominant role in the economy of
Malaysia, though its relative importance is declining as the country proceeds
toward industrialization. The sector accounts for about 24% of GDP, 40% of
export earnings, and 42% of employment. Real GDIP in agriculture grew at an
average rate of about 5% p.a. between 1973 and 19979. Based on past
investments in treecrops and new land development, and continuing public
sector investments, growth is likely to be sustained at 4-5% for the next
decade. Agricultural iroduction has been heavily export-oriented since
colonial times; howeve:r, the composition of the primary exports has changed
significantly in the last decade due to the Government's policy of
diversification in the sector. Rubber continues to be the single largest



-2-
export earner, but its share has dropped from 40% in 1969 to 21% in 1979 as
earnings from palm oil, wood products and cocoa have grown. Malaysia is the
world's largest producer and exporter of both rubber and palm oil, supplying
42% of the world's natural rubber output and 49% of palm oil production in
1979. The agricultural sector's share of total employment has gradually
declined from 53% in 1970 to 42% in 1979. The Government expects the
agricultural labor force to grow about 1% per annum for the next decade with
industry and services absorbing increasingly larger percentages of the total
labor force. The continued growth in terms of volume and prices in
agriculture, the expansion of manufacturing, and the recent development of
Malaysia's oil and gas reserves have enabled the country to maintain a
healthy trade surplus, estimated at about US$2.1 billion in 1979.
1.04      Malaysian agriculture has a strong comparative advantage in tree
crops and this accounts for the dominance of rubber, oil palm and coconut in
the pattern of land use, output and exports. Altogether, Peninsular Malaysia
has about 3.2 million ha, or about 25% of its area, under cultivation, of
which almost 2.3 million ha are in rubber and oil palm. The other major
crops are rice, which occupies about 478,000 ha, of which about half is
double-cropped, and coconut, with about 337,000 ha. The entire rice area and
about two-thirds of the treecrop area are in small holdings.
1.05      Output has grown rapidly over the past decade; rubber output
increased by 100% and palm oil by 300%. Output of rice increased by 90%,
primarily due to improved and expanded irrigation facilities. Domestic
production supplies 85-90% of rice requirements. With population growing at
2.7% p.a., an additional 45,000 tons of rice are required each year just to
maintain the current per capita consumption level. The Government has
formulated three basic objectives with regard to rice:  (a) to increase the
incomes of rice farmers; (b) to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production;
and (c) to provide reasonably priced rice to consumers.
1.06      Notwithstanding the impressive overall performance of the
Malaysian economy, some 36% of the population had incomes below the official
absolute poverty line in 1978. Two-thirds of those in poverty were in agri-
cultural households, where the incidence of absolute poverty was about 55%.
Among rice farmers, about 74% have family incomes below the absolute
poverty line. There are two main factors responsible for the high incidence
of poverty among rice farmers - small size of holdings and low productivity
per unit of land. According to a recent Bank report on rural poverty in
Malaysia, a rice farmer with no off-farm income would need 2.4 to 2.8 ha of
single cropped rice to achieve an absolute poverty level income; however, the
average holding size is 1.2 ha, with over half the holdings being smaller
than this and 90% of all holdings less than 2.6 ha. To reach a poverty level
income on an average size holding (1.2 ha) a farmer would have to grow two
crops of rice per year or earn as much from off-farm work as on his own farm.

Government Strategies for Agricultural Development
1.07       Having officially adopted in 1970 the objective of poverty eradi-
cation, the Governmuent has employed two basic strategies, both of which
impinge on agriculture. The first strategy has been land development to allow
the absorption of labor from low productivity rural occupations to higher
productivity employment. The second has been the provision of projects and
programs aimed directly at increasing smallholder productivity. Implemen-
tation of these strategies, aided by strong performance in the secondary and
tertiary sectors, has contributed to a significant decrease in the incidence
of rural poverty: from 67% in 1970 to 55% in 1973. Strong industrial growth
during this period provided enough employment oplportunities outside agricul-
ture to absorb two-thirds of the increase in the rural labor force. Large
scale irrigation projects, such as Muda and Kemubu, came into fruition in the
early 1970s and provided increases in rice productivity that significantly
changed the income position of 73,000 smallholders. They allowed the country
to reduce its imports from 42% of consumption reqluirements in 1967, to about
10% in 1979. Government agencies, such as the Federal Land Development
Authority (FELDA), carried out land development projects opening up over
1.1 million ha of new lands, mostly for treecrops, and resettled about
250,000 rural families.
1.08       With Malaysia's strong industrial base and its financial resources,
it is in a position to continue its efforts to increase the productivity of
small farmers as a principal thrust of its poverity strategy. In the Fourth
Malaysia Plan (1981-85) the Government has estab:Lished a concessionary lending
policy under which funds for projects with poverity alleviation objectives
would be onlent without interest. Other income distribution measures aimed
specifically at the agricultural sector include the recent reduction in the
rubber export tax, the increase in padi price supports, and the provision of
free fertilizers and pesticides to rice smallholdlers.
Irrigation Developnent
1.09       Irrigation development in Malaysia is confined mainly to the culti-
vation of rice. The Drainage and Irrigation Department (DID) was established
in 1932 after a serious rice shortage in the ear:Ly 1920s and the realization
that overdependence on other countries for basic food supplies was risky.
DID's responsibility was to deal with land improvement and water resources
development, particularly with regard to rice, which had been cultivated as a
wet season crop over some 100,000 ha, and treecrops, which had been estab-
lished on about 40,000 ha along coastal areas subject to tidal inundation.
Until the early 1960s, irrigation schemes were designed to stabilize produc-
tion of a single crop of rice during the wet season, providing water to
supplement rainfall during short periods of drought. In the early 1960s, the
expansion of irrigation was accelerated as part of the massive rural devel-
opment program after independence, and DID began emphasizing double cropped
rice cultivation by building storage dams and pumping stations and upgrading



-4-
distribution systems. DID has now provided irrigation to practically all of
the major rice producing areas, with the result that 80% of the country's
478,000 ha of rice land now have some form of irrigation facilities and over
50% is technically capable of double cropping. In addition, DID has
constructed drainage schemes on some 425,000 ha of land devoted to treecrops.
Although the main thrust of DID's program has been to provide irrigation
systems in traditional rainfed rice areas, they have also undertaken projects
to develop new land for rice production. The largest single system of this
type is the Tanjong Karang Irrigation Scheme, under which 20,000 ha of
coastal mangrove swamps and shallow peats were developed into productive rice
land during the late 1930s and early 1950s.
1.10      The Bank has participated in irrigation development in Malaysia
since 1965 when it financed the Muda Irrigation Project (Loan 434-MA),
followed in 1967 by the Kemubu Irrigation Project (Loan 500-MA). Together,
the project areas amount to nearly 120,000 ha, or about 25% of the rice land
in Peninsular Malaysia, and accomodate some 73,000 farm families. According
to the Project Performance Audit Report (Report No. 1295), they were success-
ful projects which helped to reduce rice imports from 42% of national require-
ments in 1967 to 17% in 1974, and resulted in increases of 75-100% in the
incomes of project beneficiaries. In these projects, the design of field
distribution and drainage systems, based on the standards prevailing in East
Asia in the 1960s, involved widely spaced secondary canals and field-to-field
irrigation and drainage. At that time, there was neither the experience in
design and construction of the more intensive modes of on-farm development,
nor widespread use of the modern varieties which depend on precise water
control at the field level. Higher standards of on-farm development are now
being initiated in the Muda II Project (Loan 1717-MA), on an area of 25,000
ha. Five other Bank-financed projects, which will improve, expand and
intensify irrigation over 116,000 ha of rice land and drainage over 212,000
ha of tree crops, are under implementation. These projects have included, in
addition to the irrigation and drainage infrastructure, provisions for
strengthening agricultural support services such as credit, extension,
processing and marketing. Coordination of the various agencies and depart-
ments is a major element in the successful implementation of the projects,
and the Government has developed an effective organization for this purpose.
A steering committee of federal and state officials is appointed to guide and
support the project manager, who has the responsibility for monitoring the
progress of all components of the project.
Area Development
1.11      Malaysia has about 2.0 million ha of undeveloped land suitable for
agriculture, much of it in swampy and remote areas similar to the site of the
proposed project. The physical works required to develop this land in terms
of tree felling, stump removal, land levelling and drainage are more than
most small farmers can accomplish with their own resources. This leaves
large-scale development of new land to the Government or private firms.
In the past, state governments, with land ownership and use under their



- 5 -
control, generally allowed the private estates to carry out most of the land
,development, with a few small-scale projects assigned to state development
agencies. With increasing emphasis on alleviating poverty and improving the
lives of the rural population, the state governments have requested federal
government participation in projects which provide, in addition to land
development, housing, schools, clinics and supporting services for
agriculture and community development.
1.12      Under the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80)., land development has been
proceeding at the rate of about 80,000 ha per year. The Bank has supported
the program with loans for six projects carried ouit by FELDA, involving more
than 25,000 settler families on about 117,000 ha of land devoted to oil
palm, rubber and cocoa. The first three projects provided for the develop-
ment and settlement of about 40,000 ha in the Jengka Triangle in the
interior of Peninsular Malaysia. Project Performance Audit Reports for
.Jengka I and II (Reports No. 2122 and 3021) noted the remarkable success of
the projects in terms of improved incomes and living conditions of the
settlers and the build-up of FELDA's technical capability. The third and
Last stage of the Jengka Triangle projects is due to be completed in 1981.
FELDA is considered a mature organization, and Bank assistance is now
focussed on expanding the implementation capacity of the Government's second
"Land development agency, FELCRA.
L.13      FELCRA was established in 1966 to rehabilitate or develop
state land schemes either on its own initiative and with the approval of, or
at the request of, the state government concerned. It was also allowed to
rehabilitate or develop privately held lands, at the request of the owners
on agreed terms. To date, FELCRA's development ac.tivities have included
rehabilitation of self-help land schemes, in which state governments made
blocks of land available to groups of individuals, and fringe development,
in which land adjacent to a village is developed f.or the benefit of existing
villagers. FELCRA is permitted to undertake both rehabilitation of existing
land or development of new lands, unlike FELDA which is confined to large-
scale new land development.
Project Formulation
1.14      The Perak State Government has long recognized the agricultural
potential of the 80,000 ha Trans-Perak swamp in th.e lower reaches of the
Perak river, but development efforts lagged on account of the area-s
inaccessibility and the fact that up to the mid-1970s there was little
economic or population pressure on the State to undertake such development.
DID provided irrigation facilities for some 3,700 ha of rice land in the
mid-1960s. The State had authorized FELCRA to carry out two settlement
schemes extending over {bout 1,000 ha and had alienated another 1,000 ha for
rice cultivation by inhabitants of surrounding villages. However, the
balance of the area was rapidly being settled by squatters, without the
benefit of development planning or provision of infrastructure. In 1976,
the Government commissioned ESAMS (Malaysia), in association with Howard
Humphreys (UK), to undertake a regional development study of the lower Perak



- 6 -
basin. This study identified four potential projects, and further discus-
sions between the Bank and the Government led to the selection of the
proposed project as the first step in further development of the Trans-Perak
region.
1.15      After the regional study, the State envisaged that both FELDA and
FELCRA would be involved in development of the area.  In view of the differ-
ent sizes of holdings and settlement patterns proposed by the two agencies
that would neither lead to uniformity in settler selection, social services
and benefits nor facilitate the administration necessary for successful
implementation of the project, FELCRA was selected on the grounds that it
had the capacity to carry out both rice and oil palm development and also
because it had two ongoing schemes adjacent to the new land to be developed.
In 1979, the Government, with the assistance of KPM Khidmat Sdn. Bhd.
(Malaysia) in association with Snowy Mountain Engineering Corporation
(Australia), reviewed the technical and economic feasibility of the project,
drawing on the information collected by the various government agencies
already carrying out programs in the project area, and made recommendations
for meeting the irrigation, transportation, processing and marketing
requirements evolving from the proposed development. The Perak State
Government-s criteria for settlement infrastructure were that (a) efficient
urban facilities should be provided in rural areas, in line with the
Government-s New Economic Policy, (b) an urban center should be established
in the southern half of Perak State, for balanced regional development, and
(c) no proposed township should take up land suitable for rice. Within this
framework, about 1,600 ha has been set aside for the proposed township on an
elevated site unsuitable for rice cultivation and at a point central to the
region and the project area. Taking into account the constraints of soil
suitability, drainage capacity and labor availability, and in line with the
policy of maximizing the number of settlers, a combined holding of 1.2 ha
of rice and a 1.2 ha share of treecrops was selected as the best means to
provide an above-poverty level income to the greatest number of benefici-
aries. The proposed project is based on this formulation. The combination
of rice and treecrops would provide settlers with a subsistence crop and a
monthly income, and would cushion their incomes against price and yield
fluctuations in any one crop.
2. THE PROJECT AREA
Location
2.01      The project is located in the state of Perak on the west coast of
Peninsular Malaysia (Map IBRD 14675). Perak has a population of about
2.0 million people and covers an area of 21,000 sq km, of which about
1.3 million ha, or 60% of the area, is classified as forest, including swamp
and jungle, and about 570,000 ha, or 30% of the area, is agricultural land,
growing mainly rubber, coconut, rice and oil palm. Estates occupy some
145,000 ha andI the balance is in smallholdings.  The protect area lies at
the southeastern edge of an 80,000 ha swampy floodplain on the right bank of
the Perak River, some 10 km inland from the Straits of Malacca and about 80
km from Ipoh, the state capital. The area is served by a bitumen all-
weather road terminating at Telok Sena, adjacent to the northern project
boundary. Telok Anson, the main district center, is directly across the



-7-
Perak river, geographically about 15 km distant, but about 80 km away by
road at present. Construction of a bridge across the Perak river, scheduled
for completion by 1985, will make Telok Anson the nearest point of rail
connections and will place its markets within reach of the project area.
Climate and Hydrology
2.02      The climate is tropical and is characterized by high rainfall,
humidity and temperature (Table 2.1) with only mninor variations in day length.
Average annual rainfall is about 2,100 mm with imonthly peaks in April and in
October through December. Rainfall is much lower and more variable in
February and the May-August period, and evaporation exceeds rainfall from June
to September. The climate is favorable for year-round rice cultivation with
supplementary irrigation and for treecrops with adequate drainage. Extreme
floods are due to the northeast monsoons spilling over the central mountain
range in the upper reaches of the 11,900 sq km Perak river watershed.  Flow
records were obtained at the Iskandar Bridge, albout 30 km northwest of Ipoh,
upstream of the project intake structure. There are no major water users,
regulatory features or inflow points between the bridge and the project
diversion. The two flood peaks in recent years occurred in 1967 and 1973; the
former, with .a 25-30 year return period, had a flow of 6,300 cu m/sec at
Iskandar Bridge and inundated the lower basin for about 10 days; the latter
had a flow of 4,400 cu m/sec. A 66 km gated flood protection dike around the
project area provides 0.6 m freeboard against the 1967 flood which is
considered to give a reasonable safety margin since the recently constructed
Temengor dam will reduce the magnitude and frequency of floods in the Perak
river. In the event that development takes place on the left bank of the
river, the Government would carry out studies for further flood control.
Topography and Soils
2.03      The project area slopes gently from EL. 9 m in the north to
El. 1.5 m in the south with about 50% of the area below El. 3 m. The northern
area is irregular with interwoven ridges and depressions predominantly running
in a north-south direction parallel to the river. The southern area is also
irregular with many depressions resulting in differences in elevation of about
0.6 m over relatively short reaches. Excess run-off flows into the river and
its tributaries.  The existing rice area varies from El. 2 m to El. 3.5 m
while the proposed rice area varies from El. 1.5 to El. 3 m. A soil survey
was carried out on about 5,200 ha of new land for rice and 8,000 ha for
treecrops. About 70% of the surveyed area is composed of riverine sediments
and the remainder is a mix of riverine and marine sediments, overlain with
shallow peat and organic muck. Soils are acidic, with pH values ranging from
3.3 to 5.0 in the north and from 4.0 to 5.3 in the south. Experience in
Malaysia shows that oil palm can withstand soil pH values as low as 3.5 and
that rice will grow satisfactorily at pH 4.2. The nutrient status of most
soils is low and substantial applications of fertilizer would be required to
sustain satisfactory yields. These soils have poor internal drainage
characteristics and are well suited for rice cu:Ltivation and moderately
suitable for treecrops with the provision of adequate drainage.

Population, Farm Size and Land Tenure
2.04      Settlement in the project area is confined to the Left Branch
Canal (LBC) area, which has been provided with irrigation facilities and
partially developed by state and federal agencies. The University Sains
Malaysia was commissioned by the Government to conduct a socioeconomic
survey in 1979 covering the four distinct blocks served by the LBC to
determine the number of households in the area, farm sizes, incomes, land
tenure, and the willingness of present residents to participate in a
settlement scheme. At the time of the survey, 3,700 ha were irrigated but
only 3,200 ha were occupied by 1,940 farm families with an average farm size
of 1.6 ha, ranging from 1.3 in Block D to 2.2 ha in Block B. Cropping
intensity of the surveyed farms was about 130%. The farms were operated by
owners, tenants, sharecroppers and squatters.
2.05      No distinct settlement pattern characterizes the entire LBC area.
Following construction of the irrigation works in 1965, farmers, including
people from outside the State, began to migrate into the area. In the late
1960s, the State allocated Block A in 2.0 ha lots to residents of nearby
villages. Block B was handed over to FELCRA in 1971, and land was
subdivided in 2.0 ha lots to 311 settlers previously selected by the State
government. Block C has undergone a mix of development modes; the State
allocated 200 ha to the Department of Agriculture for a Youth Scheme, 430 ha
to FELCRA and 200 ha to the State Agricultural Development Corporation
(SADC). The Youth Scheme, begun in the early 1970s, had 80 young single men
operating 2.4 ha lots and many have stayed on, married and now have
families. FELCRA began its operation in Block C as an Ex-Servicemen's
Scheme in 1976, with 170 settlers on 2.4 ha lots. In the meantime, the SADC
area was partially cleared and never officially settled. Much of Block C
and all of Block D have been sporadically settled by squatters as far back
as the early 1960s. Incomes are generally low throughout the project area;
about 60% of the farmers have incomes below the poverty level.
2.06      FELCRA anticipates that about 1,700 settlers would be selected
from families already cultivating rice land in the project area. It is
expected that farmers in Blocks B, C and D would be required to relinquish
holdings in excess of 1.2 ha in exchange for the shares in the treecrop area
collectively owned by the project settlers and managed by FELCRA. For most
of these families, the reduced size of holding would be more than
compensated by the treecrop benefits and the opportunity to acquire housing
and to enjoy the social infrastructure provided by the project. Farmers in
,lock A are not expected to join the project as most of them are established
residents of nearby villages. However, irrigation improvements would be
carried out on their laid.
Existing Infrastructure
2.07      The project area is divided, on the basis of topography and soil
suitability, into two agricultural areas, namely, rice and treecrops. Rice
cultivation is presently limited to the area served by the LBC and would be



- 10 -
expanded to the area served by the Right Branch Canal (RBC), most of which
is still under jungle cover. Treecrops would be cultivated on the remainder
of the project area, which is also mostly under jungle. DID started the
development of the irrigated rice area in 1961 and completed works in the
main system include: (a) an intake structure with a capacity of 21 cu
m/sec; (b) a main canal running south for 8 km to a bifurcation structure;
(c) a left branch canal with a length of about 23 km and a capacity of 8 cu
m/sec.; (d) a right branch canal with a length of about 18 km and a capacity
of 8 cu m/sec; and (e) about 13 control structures.
2.08      The LBC serves an area of about 4,900 ha through a conveyance
system that comprises 74 km of secondary canals and about 62 km of secondary
drains. The farm lots are generally 30-60 m wide and 400 m long, except in
Block A where lot dimensions are 25 m by 800 m; these lots would require
adjustment for better water control. About 1,000 ha of rice lands need
relevelling and about 1,200 ha presently under forest require clearing,
levelling, and on-farm facilities. Drains have been excavated oversize to
provide earth fill for road embankments. Access roads, built on spoil from
the drains, are narrow and muddy during the rainy season; they require
widening and surfacing. FELCRA has already provided in the existing village
settlement area (Sungei Dedap) about 500 houses similar to the ones that
would be built for the new settlers. In the 5,200 ha RBC service area to be
developed for rice cultivation, FELCRA has completed tree felling and burning
on about 1,920 ha; destumping and levelling are underway. DID has carried
out the construction of the main and secondary drains. The remaining 8,400
ha of the project area are completely covered with forest except for 1,040
ha cleared for oil palm, of which about 40 ha have been planted, and 200 ha
cleared and 100 ha planted with shade trees for cocoa. DID is constructing
about 50 km of the main and secondary drains in the treecrop area to be
completed by end-1981.
2.09      To protect the area from floods and sea water intrusion, DID
constructed a 66 km embankment and 6 tidal control gates; all of the
tidal gates are adequate to meet the designed storm runoff. The embankment
would need to be extended by about 29 km to the northwest to encompass the
project area. Access to the interior of the project area is by a public
road, currently in the course of being paved, from Telok Sena along the main
and left branch canals to Sungei Dedap. Starting at the bifurcation of the
main canal, another unpaved road has been constructed to provide access to
the township site. The LBC area has about 122 km of 2-3.7 m wide earth
surface roads constructed along secondary canals and drains. All of these
roads are in substandard condition and require upgrading.

3. THE PROJECT
Project Description
3.01      The project would provide for improvement of about 3,700 ha of
existing rice land and development of about 6,400 ha of new rice land and
8,400 ha of treecrops.  Settlement facilities would be provided for 6,900
settler families. The main features of the project are:
(a)  improvement of about 122 km and construction of about 79 km of
main and secondary canals;
(b) improvement of about 73 km and construction of about 12 km of main
and secondary drains;
(c)  development of about 6,400 ha of new land for rice cultivation,
including land clearing and levelling, and construction of
tertiary canals, drains and farm roads;
(d)  rehabilitation of about 3,700 ha of existing rice land, including
levelling on 1,000 ha and construction of farm roads;
(e) land development and crop establishment for about 8,400 ha of
treecrops, including land clearing, internal drains and farm roads
roads and bridges;
(f) improvement of the existing 66 km and construction of 29 km of
flood embankment;
(g)  construction of 53 km of project main roads;
(h) construction of a 27 km section of the West Coast Highway;
(i)  construction of a township and improvement of the Sungei Dedap
village settlement for 6,900 settler farm families;
(j)  provision of agricultural suppport services, including offices,
workshops, and staff housing; and
(k) construction of processing facilities for oil palm with a capacity
of 40 ton fresh fruit bunch (ffb)/hr and for cocoa with a capacity
of 5 ton dried beans/day.
3.02      In addition, the project would provide vehicles and equipment for
agricultural support services and operation and maintenance, and consulting
services for detailed design and construction supervision of project works
and preparation of future projects.



-12-
Project Works
3.03      Main and Secondary Canals.  Improvement would be carried out on
the existing main and branch canals to enable efficient operation. Canal
capacity is adequate and works would include desilting, reshaping and
rehabilitation of structures, especially in the RBC which has never been
operated. The RBC would also be extended about 6 km. The secondary canals
in the LBC area would be rehabilitated and 11.5 km of additional secondaries
would be constructed. In the RBC area, where none have been constructed,
about 54 km of secondaries would be provided; the canals are designed for a
capacity of 2.3 1/sec/ha and would be placed at 730 m intervals. In order
to reduce the volume of imported fill material for canal embankments and to
lower maintenance costs, the new secondary canals would be concrete lined.
3.04      Main and Secondary Drains.  The existing 66 km of main drains
would require rehabilitation to accommodate the expected runoff and about
30 km of main drains would be constructed to serve the treecrop area and the
township.  Main drains discharge through tidal control gates into channels
to the Perak river. The six existing tidal control gates are designed to
discharge 25-year frequency storm flows during high tide conditions. These
gates are adequate and two gates would be constructed to provide additional
capacity for the rice area. The drains in the rice area are designed with a
minimum capacity of 6.0 1/sec/ha to evacuate a five-year frequency storm
with a three-day duration. In the LBC area, drainage capacity is sufficient
as drains were constructed oversize, except in Block A, where construction
of about 12 km of new secondary drains and 40 control structures would be
required. In the RBC area, secondary drains totalling 64 km have already
been constructed. In the treecrop area, about 75 km of secondary drains,
spaced at 800 m intervals, would be required, and construction of about
53 km is in progress.
3.05      Rice Area Development.  About 6,400 ha of new, predominantly
jungle land, would be developed for rice production. This would involve
tree felling, burning, destumping, land levelling, surveying, and
construction of canals, drains and farm roads. Jungle clearance would be
followed by a preliminary survey for the design of the tertiary canals and
drains. Precise levelling would be carried out simultaneously with the
construction of tertiaries so that surplus earth could be used to build the
tertiary canals. About 125 km of tertiary canals and an equal length of
tertiary drains would be built at 200 m intervals (Map IBRD 14766). The
tertiaries would be formed from pre-cast concrete sections to minimize
embankment fill and lower maintenance costs as in the case of the secondary
canals. Approximately: 2100 tertiary canal offtakes would be required along
with an equal number of drain outlets. Roads, 3.7 m wide along secondary
drains and 2.5 m wide along tertiary drains, would be provided.
3.06      Rice Area Improvement.  About 3,700 ha of existing rice land would
require improvement, including destumping, relevelling of about 1,000 ha,
rehabilitation of the irrigation system for about 950 ha and upgrading of



- 13 -
about 170 km of farm roads. The long and narrow shape (25 m x 800 m) of
the farm lots in Block A (950 ha) does not permit efficient agricultural
practices and water control and would be adjusted to 50 m x 400 m. The
tertiary canals and drains would be improved to meet the new irrigation
requirements by rehabilitating all offtakes and outlets. About 920 new
canal offtake pipes and 470 drain outlet pipes would be provided. Roads
along tertiary drains would be upgraded.
2.07      Treecrop Area Development.  About 8,400 ha of land, mostly under
jungle cover, would be developed for oil palm and cocoa. This would involve
tree felling, stacking and burning and planting. FELCRA, after clearing the
-jungle, would design and construct tertiary drains at 240 m intervals and
field drains at 27 m intervals. The drainage requirements for the tree crop
area are based on removing a five-year frequency, two-day duration storm in
48 hours with a drainage system capacity of 7.5 1/sec/ha. In the cocoa
area, aeration drains would be provided at 12 m spacing. A 5.5 m wide road
would be provided along the secondary drains and a 4.3 m wide road along all
t:ertiary drains. All roads would be surfaced with 15 cm of laterite and
mining ballast to accommodate vehicles needed for harvest.  About 42 timber
bridges would be provided on main drains and 256 culverts on secondary
drains.
3.08      Flood Embankment.  The existing 66 km peripheral flood embankment
extends around the eastern and southern portion of the project area from
K:ampong Lambor Kiri to the Kampong Kayan control gate. It would be extended
by 29 km along the northwestern side to completely encircle the project area
and provide full protection from floods.
3.09      Project Main Roads   About 53 km of main roads would be built by
T'WD within the project area. Of these 27 km would have a 4.5 m wide asphalt
surface and 26 km would be the same width and surfaced with 15 cm of gravel
and mining ballast. These roads would connect the main settlements and
link the project area to Ipoh and the proposed West Coast Highway (para.
3.10).
3.10      West Coast Highway Section.  The 27 km section of the West Coast
Flighway included in the project would extend from the proposed bridge across
the Perak river near Telok Anson along the southern perimeter of the project
area to Kampong Kayan.  This would be a two-lane highway, 7.5 m wide, and
would be part of the federal highway system.  Under the Fourth Malaysia Plan,
the Government proposes to allocate funds for the construction of the bridge
across the Perak river to complete the West Coast Highway from Lumut to Port
Klang (about 270 km).
3.11      Township and 3ettlement.  The proposed township and the existing
village of Sungei Dedap would be developed to accommodate the 6,900 settler
families, about 5,500 in the township and 1,400 in the village. Each
settler family would receive a timber house (about 37 sq m of floor space)
cn about 1,000 sq m of land. In addition, water supply, electricity, roads,



- 14 -
drains and sewage disposal would be provided. Three secondary schools,
seven primary schools and a recreation center would be built. A health
center and two clinics would be constructed in the township and a clinic
would be provided in the village. Construction of houses and facilities
would be staged with development of the oil palm and rice areas. The
township roads would be laid out on a grid of about 200 m. These roads,
ranging from 5.5 m to 9 m wide, would be paved with asphalt; 2.5 m wide
alleys surfaced with 15 cm of gravel and mining ballast would provide
additional access to each settler's property.  Concrete-lined drains would
be provided on both sides of main roads. These drains would discharge into
main drains on the east and south sides of the township. Presently runoff
from this area discharges through the Sungei Dedap tidal gate, which also
drains Block B, parts of Block C and the village settlement. With the
development of the area, runoff discharges would increase and the Dedap main
drain would be rehabilitated to carry township runoff to the existing tidal
gate and two additional gates would be provided to serve Blocks C and E and
the village. River training would be carried out on the Dedap river
downstream of the tidal gates to accommodate the additional discharge from
the project area.
3.12      Buildings.  The Government agencies already operating in the
project area would require additional buildings to accommodate the new
staff. Some of the existing facilities need remodelling. The project would
provide for the construction of staff quarters, offices, stores, a variety
of agricultural facilities and farmers development centers (Annex 2).
3.13      Processing Facilities.  A palm oil mill with a total capacity of
40 tons ff b/hr in 1988 would be built by FELCRA in the project area. The
main complex and the first 20 ton ffb/hr line would be in operation in time
for the peak crop in 1986; a second 20 ton ffb/hr line would be added in
time for the peak crop in 1988 (para. 5.10). A cocoa fermentary/drier with
a 5 ton/day dried bean capacity would be established by the Federal Agricul-
tural Marketing Authority (FAMA) in the project area in 1986 (para. 5.14).
3.14      Equipment and Vehicles.  Vehicles and equipment for project opera-
tion and maintenance and agricultural support services would be provided.
FELCRA would be supplied with tractors and trailers needed for the upkeep
and harvest of the treecrop area and to help in moving labor between the
rice and the treecrop areas. DID would be provided equipment for operation
and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage system and farm roads.
Workshops would be constructed and equipped under the project to perform
routine maintenance and minor repairs on FELCRA, DOA and FOA equipment.
Water Supply, Demand and Quality
3.15      The estimated water demand for irrigation is based on staggered
planting in three parts of each tertiary irrigation block and growing two
crops of rice per year. Identical cropping schedules would be followed in
each tertiary block at staggered intervals of 21 days. Sequential irriga-
tion with staggered planting reduces peak demands for water, labor and



- 15 -
riachinery. Water demand was calculated assuming that field saturation and
crop establishment would require 304 mm of water, of which 152 mm would be
standing water and 152 mm would be required to saturate the soil.  Further
t:here would be field percolation losses of 3.5 mm per day. Monthly crop
clemands and assumptions used in calculating demand are shown in Annex 1. A
nlaximum annual demand of 347 million cu m was derived assuming that it would
be exceeded in only one out of 10 years. The maximum monthly irrigation
diversion demand would be about 1.4 1/sec/ha.
3.16      Water for the project area is diverted f'rom the Perak river at
'Telok Sena, through a gated gravity diversion structure which has a capacity
of 21.2 cu m/sec at a river level of 8.6 m above MSL and a canal full-supply
level of 8.2 m above MSL. This would be equivalent to about 2.1 1/sec/ha,
well above the peak diversion demand. Operation of the Temengor Dam up-
stream has augmented the flow of the river in the dry season, and the
rninimum river flow is about six times the maximum irrigation requirement.
WIater samples taken from the Perak river, upstream of the project, showed
the water to be highly suitable for rice cultivation with pH values ranging
from 6.7 to 7.1, chloride content from 3 to 4 ppm and total dissolved solids
from 68 to 180 ppm.
S'tatus of Engineering
3.17      Work on the irrigation system is in various stages of implementa-
1:ion. Irrigation and drainage works in the LBC area are virtually complete
except for a short length of secondary canal and drain in Block A and the
widening of canal banks for farm roads. In the RBC area, the main and
secondary drains are in place, almost half the area has been cleared, and
cLetailed designs for the secondary canals have been prepared. In the treecrop
area, construction of secondary drains is in progress. Designs for the main
roads within the project area are well underway. Designs for the 27 km
section of the West Coast highway are substantially complete and contractors
have been prequalified. Preparation of detailed designs and tender documents
for the project works to be carried out during the first year of implementa-
tion would be sufficiently advanced for procurement to start shortly after
loan approval and for construction to proceed on schedule. Contracts
t:otaling about US$30 million would be awarded during the first year.
Implementation Schedule
3.18       The project would be implemented over a period of seven years,
from mid-1981 to mid-1988. The proposed implementation schedule is shown in
Figure 3.1. The phasing of implementation is critically dependent on the
achievement of the land clearance targets, and it is therefore important
that FELCRA meet these targets. The various agencies would provide for a
build-up of staff and facilities over the implementation period. Construc-
tion of major irrigation and drainage works is in progress and work on
tertiaries and farm roads would begin in early 198.2 after land levelling.
Most of the township services would be completed by 1984 and the West Coast
Highway section would be finished by 1985. Construction of settlers' houses



- 16 -
would be phased with the land development and would be completed by early
1986. The processing facilities are planned to meet the requirement of
field production with the first phase of the oil palm mill ready by 1986 and
the second phase by 1988. All project works would be completed by June 1988.
Cost Estimates
3.19      Total project costs in mid-1981 prices are estimated at US$200
million, with a foreign exchange component of US$67 million, or 34% of the
total cost. Because of the tax-exempt status of Government departments, cost
estimates exclude all known taxes and duties. For civil works, cost
estimates are based on quantities and unit prices prepared by the implement-
ing agencies. Since construction of the irrigation works and land develop-
ment is ongoing, cost estimates include only works to be carried out after
loan effectiveness, anticipated in mid-1981. Expenditures prior to mid-1981
have been treated separately (para. 7.11). Unit prices are in line with
recent bid prices in Malaysia. Physical contingencies of 17% were applied
for irrigation, drainage, land development and road works, 10% for settlement
works, and 5% for equipment, vehicles, project buildings, and processing
facilities. Expected price increases over the project implementation period
amount to 21% of base costs plus physical contingencies, assuming cost
escalation for both local and foreign components of 9.0% in 1981, 8.5% in
1982, 7.5% in 1983-85 and 6.0% in 1986-88. Details of the project costs are
given in Annex 2 and are summarized below:

Financing
3.20      The proposed Bank loan of US$50.0 million would finance 75% of the
foreign exchange component of the project estimated at US$67.0 million. The
Government-s contribution of US$150.0 million (M$322 million) would finance
the balance of project costs through annual budgetary allocations.
Procurement
3.21      Table 3.1 shows the civil works contracts scheduled for inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) and local competitive bidding (LCB).
Construction of the irrigation works would be packaged into eight contracts,
two to be awarded following ICB procedures in accordance with Bank Group



- 18 -
Guidelines, and six following LCB procedures. ICB would also be used for
the construction of settlers' houses, project buildings, roads, and
processing facilities. The ten ICB contracts would have a total value of
about US$76 million, including physical contingencies and price increases
and would range from about US$5 to US$15 million. The size and phasing of
contracts for land development would be dictated by the rate at which land
clearance is carried out; of the fourteen contracts, seven would include the
specialized tasks of treecrop establishment and maintenance. Experience in
Malaysia has shown that works of this nature are of little interest to
international contractors. Most of the irrigation and drainage works and
settlement infrastructure, as well as the cocoa mill, are not large enough
to attract international contractors. Therefore, competitive bidding in
accordance with local procedures would be appropriate for these works.
There would be 31 contracts suitable for LCB, totalling about US$97 million
and ranging from US$800,000 to US$5 million. Bank staff have reviewed the
local procedures and they are acceptable. There is potentially adequate
competition and foreign firms would be allowed to participate. Force
account would be limited to the fabrication of gates and hoists for water
control structures by the federal DID workshop.
3.22      Vehicles and equipment costing US$8.6 million including expected
price increases would be procured by ICB in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines. A 15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty if
lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids.
Local procurement practices are appropriate for off-the-shelf items costing
less than US$40,000 each because the advantages of ICB would be clearly
outweighed by the administrative costs involved. The total cost of such
items for all components of the project would not exceed US$2.0 million.

Disbursement
3.23      Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made at the rate of 100%
against the foreign exchange cost of directly imported vehicles and equip-
ment, or the ex-factory price net of taxes for items manufactured locally,
and at the rate of 80% of total costs of imported items procured locally.
Disbursement for civil works and land development executed by contract would
be at 31% of total costs. For consulting servicess and studies, disburse-
ments would equal 100% of total expenditures. No disbursement would be made
against settlement infrastructure and force account expenditures. It is
expected that disbursements would be completed by December 31, 1988. The
estimated schedules of expenditures and disbursements and the proposed
allocation of the proceeds of the loan are presented in Annex 2.
Accounts and Audit
3.24      The agencies involved in the project are all subject to normal
Government controls and audit procedures. Assurances were obtained that
all agencies involved in project implementation would maintain separate
accounts which would be collated by the Project Coordinator and forwarded
to the Bank on a regular basis.
Environmental Effects
3.25      Land development would be carried out within the guidelines of the
Malaysian Conservation Act which provides adequalte safeguards against erosion,
siltation and excessive flooding. Commercial grade timber has been extracted
from the forests in the project area and only residual timber remains to be
salvaged prior to land clearing operations. No 'Loss of habitat critical to
endangered species is expected. The settlers would be provided with a water
supply which would be much safer than the existing dependence on rain and
surface water. The palm oil mill would be located away from the population
centers in order to minimize the nuisance of unp:Leasant odors. Palm oil
effluent would be treated by a ponding system beiEore its discharge to meet
the standards set by the Division of Environment under the Ministry of
Science, Technology and Environment. The biolog:ical oxygen demand level of
the effluent would have to be treated below 500 ppm before discharge. Water-
course disposal would be possible as the point of discharge is close to the
sea and the rate of dilution in the Perak river is high. As assurance was
obtained that the Government would take all measures necessary to ensure that
the design, construction, and operation of the works in the project would be
carried out in accordance with appropriate ecological and environmental
standards.

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Coordination
4.01      Overall responsibility for coordinating project related activities
would rest with a Project Coordinator. His main administrative responsi-
bilities would include: (a) monitoring the plans, programs and schedules of
implementing agencies and synchronizing their activities with the overall
project schedule; (b) preparing annual project budgets, including staff and
training requirements and procurement of vehicles and equipment; (c) coord-
inating multi-agency agricultural support programs; (d) representing the
project management in periodic meetings with relevant Government agencies for
fund approval and releases and for staffing requirements; (e) reporting
progress at regular intervals to the Government and the Bank; and (f)
coordinating the selection of settlers and the phasing of their intake with
land development, irrigation works, housing construction and the provision of
community facilities. The appointment of a suitably qualified and experienced
Project Coordinator would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
loan.
4.02      A Steering Committee, composed of the Secretaries-General of the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Land and Regional Development,
the State Secretary of Perak, and other officials would guide the Project
Coordinator on policy matters. The Project Coordinator would be the
Secretary of the Committee. This management structure has worked well in the
previous Bank-financed integrated agricultural development projects (Loans
973-MA, 1294-MA, 1444-MA, 1522-MA, 1632-MA and 1717-MA) and is in line with
the federal and state responsibilities and jurisdictions in Malaysia. The
establishment of the Steering Committee would be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed loan.
Implementing Agencies
4.03      The implementing agencies for the project would be:  the Federal
Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA) under the Ministry
of Land and Regional Development; the Drainage and Irrigation Department
(DID) under the Ministry of Agriculture; and the Public Works Department
(PWD) under the Ministry of Works and Utilities. Other participating
agencies include: the Town and Country Planning Department (TCPD) and the
State Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) for settlement services (para.
4.07); the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the Farmers' Organization
Authority (FOA), the Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development
Institute (MARDI), and the Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM), for agricultural
support services (paras. 4.11-4.16); and the National Padi and Rice Authority
(LPN) and the Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority (FAMA) for processing
and marketing (paras. 5.06 and 5.14).



- 21 -
4.04       Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority.  FELCRA
w,ould be responsible for land development and reha!bilitation, establishment
of treecrops, construction of settlers housing arnd settler management and
administration. FELCRA is organized in three functional divisions and
eleven regional offices, under a Director-General, assisted by a Deputy
Director General. Recognizing that growth and diversity in its operations
will require modifications in its organizational structure, FELCRA proposes
a gradual reorganization to accommodate its expanded functions.  The pro-
posed organization is shown in Figure 4.1. At the project level, FELCRA's
field staff would be organized into five divisions, headed by a Chief FELCRA
Officer (Figure 4.2).
4.05      Drainage and Irrigation Department.  DIII would be responsible for
implementing the irrigation and drainage works, farm roads and flood
protection embankment. Civil works would be constructed by contractors.
DID would engage consultants for construction supervision (para. 4.17) and
appoint a team of key staff headed by a Resident Engineer for overall
direction and supervision. To ensure that design concepts are effectively
itransmitted from the design staff to the district-level staff who would
operate and maintain the completed systems, DID would prepare a designer-s
operation manual covering major project works on completion of final design.
The Perak State DID would assume responsibility for operation and
maintenance of works upon completion and acceptance by the Federal DID.
4.06       Public Works Department.  PWD would be responsible for the design
and construction of project main roads, as well as; the 27-km section of the
West Coast Highway which would provide access fromi the project area to Telok
Anson in the southeast and the towns of Sitiawan and Lumut in the northwest.
Settlement
4.07       Settlement Services.  The Town and Country Planning Department
(TCPD) would be responsible for planning and design of the township. The
township would include basic community facilities such as electricity, water
supply, schools, clinics, government buildings, maLrkets and stores. The
State Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) would be responsible for
township development. SEDC would coordinate with the implementing agencies
on the phasing and construction of community facilities, including: the
lNational Electricity Board for electricity; the PWD for township roads and
drains, water supply and waste disposal; the Department of Education for
schools; and the Department of Health for clinics. In addition, SEDC would
also be responsible for the construction of commercial facilities and PWD
for Government buildings. Upon completion, SEDC would turn over the
township to local government authorities for maintenance and administration.
An assurance was obtaired that a detailed implementation schedule for
provision of the towns'iip facilities would be forwarded to the Bank for
review and comment by December 31, 1981.
4.08       Settler Selection and Administration.  The Perak State Government,
:Ln conjunction with FELCRA, would select the settlers. Settlers would be



- 22 -
given a house on a 0.1 ha lot, 1.2 ha of padi land, and a 1.2 ha share in
treecrop areas. Rice plots would be individually owned, while the treecrop
area would be a joint holding to be managed by FELCRA. The project would
accommodate about 6,900 settlers all of whom would reside in the project
area with their families; 5,500 in the new township and 1,400 in the village
settlement. No settlers will be more than 12 km from their rice plots.
According to the socioeconomic survey conducted in 1979 about 1,700 settlers
were already in the project area either as smallholders, tenants, or
squatters. The State Government has given priority for settlement to these
residents. About 5,200 new settlers would be selected; the State Government
has expressed willingness to accept settlers from other states. New
settlers would be citizens of Malaysia, between 21 and 50 years of age,
married, landless or owners of subeconomic sized holdings, and with some
experience as rice farmers. By the end of 1980, screening of about 10,000
applications was in progress. Settlement of the first 350 families is
scheduled prior to the first rice planting in 1983. The balance of the
settlers would be selected according to the phasing of rice land development.
4.09      Settlers would sign the Legal Settlers Agreement with the Govern-
ment upon arrival in the project area.  This would entitle them to a loan
covering all costs of agricultural land development and housing and would
bind them to follow the rules laid down by the Government including
adherence to the rice cropping schedule determined by the Project Coordin-
ator and agreement to furnish labor in the treecrop area. Failure to abide
by the rules could result in the settler being expelled from the project
area. During the first year, each new settler would receive a loan to cover
the full padi production cost during the first season and half of the padi
production cost during the second season, net of the fertilizer subsidy, and
a subsistence loan of about US$280; these would be charged to the settler's
land development loan account. FELCRA would deduct loan repayments for land
development and housing from the net proceeds of the treecrops and distri-
bute the balance as dividends. Housing loans would be repayable in 15 years
with a 2-year grace period and land development loans in 20 years with a
10-year grace period. Under the Government-s new interest-rate policy,
these loans would be interest-free. FELCRA would hold title to the land and
the house until the loan has been fully repaid. FELCRA's annual management
cost would not be charged to the settlers but would be financed by a Federal
Government grant. An assurance was obtained that the settler selection
criteria and the draft settler agreement would be forwarded to the Bank for
review and comment before December 31, 1981.
Field Management
4.10      The degree of management exercised by FELCRA would depend on
whether the agricultural activities were related to rice or treecrops.
Management of the 10,000 ha of individual holdings devoted to rice cultiva-
tion would be in the form of general guidance. The Project Coordinator
would have the power to enforce cropping schedules and other conditions of
the settlers' agreement. The 8,400 ha of treecrops would be operated as a
plantation under FELCRA's direct management and control. The project area



- 23 -
would be divided into schemes, each comprising about 400 ha. In the rice
area, a senior manager would be responsible for two schemes (Figure 4.2).
The Project Coordinator would determine crop calendars jointly with DID,
FELCRA, and DOA every season. Land preparation would be mostly done by
contractors supplemented by FELCRA and FOA machinery. Nursery establish-
ment, transplanting, weeding and pest control would be the responsibility of
individual settlers. Harvesting would be carried out by combines provided
by contractors and supplemented by FELCRA and FOA. In the treecrop area,
the senior manager would administer three schemes or about 1,200 ha.
Settlers would receive wages for their field maintenance and harvesting
work. Specialist tasks, such as assisted pollination, would be carried out
by specially trained settlers.
Agricultural Support Services
4.11      General.  In view of the fact that in the rice area FELCRA is per-
forming a coordinating role and that many agencies of the Government would
be involved in the provision of credit, seed and technical support for the
rice farmers, the complexity of coordinating the delivery is much greater
than where FELCRA is operating directly as a plantation manager. Therefore,
this section deals solely with the rice component and the tree crops are
described under Chapter 5 in paras. 5.07-5.14.
4.12      Extension.  The Department of Agriculture (DOA) would implement
the agricultural extension component and the State DOA Director would be
administratively responsible for its organization and operation (Figure
4.3). As the project area is situated in West Perak, the Regional
Agricultural Officer at Titi Gantong would have direct control of all DOA
programs in the project area. He would coordinate with the Chief FELCRA
Officer on policy matters regarding extension activities in the rice
schemes. A DOA extension officer would be stationed in the project area to
oversee day-to-day activities. The four units under the DOA extension
program are the Agricultural Extension Unit, the Farm Family Development
Unit, the Regulatory and Support Unit, and the Seed Production Center.
These units would receive support from the DOA te!chnical branches based
in Titi Gantong, namely, the Crop Production, Crop Protection, Farm
Mechanization, and Soils and Analytical Services. An assurance was obtained
that DOA, in consultation with other agriculture-related agencies, would
prepare an agricultural services operations manual as a guide for project
field staff by Decemaber 31, 1984. The operationaLl methodology of the
extension system is widely known as the Training and Visit system
being used in other Bank-assisted agricultural projects and presently being
implemented throughout the whole country under the Ilational Extension
Project (Loan 1493-MA). Each agricultural technician (AT) would be
responsible for about 600 farmers. The AT would conduct bi-weekly visits to



- 24 -
review conditions of demonstration plots and farmers fields and discuss
important impact points over the coming two weeks, including rice varieties,
fertilizer applications, and water management. The AT would also meet
regularly with the Chief Extension Officer, other DOA units and the subject
matter specialists of the. technical branches.
4.13      Research.  The Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development
Institute (MARDI) would play a major role in the research for new rice
varieties. Its program would include: adaptability of varieties in the
project area, responses of different varieties to fertilizer applications,
and varietal performance against pests and diseases. The main research
support would be provided by MARDI's research station at Parit Buntar. Crop
demonstrations and verification trials of existing and potential crops would
be jointly planned and carried out by MARDI, the DOA Crop Production Unit
and the DOA extension personnel in the project area.
4.14      Seed.  Under the National Extension Project, five of DOA's exist-
ing Crop Production Centers (CPCs) were selected as seed production centers
and funds were included for the installation of processing and storage
facilities, together with small seed testing laboratories. One of these
CPCs is located in Titi Gantong, adjacent to the project area. An assurance
was obtained that the DOA would develop the seed production center at Titi
Gantong to meet the requirement of the project. At an average seeding rate
of 40 kg/ha, the project would use about 800 tons of rice annually at full
development. Assuming replacement with improved seed every six seasons, the
average annual requirement would be about 270 tons, which would be produced
by selected growers and approved by the DOA Crop Production Unit before
distribution.
4.15      Fertilizer and Agrochemicals.  Annual fertilizer consumption in
the project area amounts to about 1,300 tons.  About 80% is in the form of a
basal mix (15:15:15) and 20% is urea. Since 1979, FOA has administered an
input subsidy scheme whereby fertilizers valued at US$70/ha, up to a limit
of 2.4 ha, are distributed each season to rice farmers. This package is
sufficient to meet the currently recommended application rates, in terms of
nutrients, of 65 kg/ha N, 37 kg/ha P205, and 37 kg/ha K20. The estimated
annual fertilizer requirement at full development would be, in terms of
nutrients, about 1,800 tons of N, 600 tons of P205, and 300 tons of K20,
which would allow usage at the rate of 90 kg/ha of N and 30 kg/ha of P205
and K20 per season. It is expected that at full development there would be
a substantial increase in the use of agrochemicals, which at present are
seldom applied.
4.16      Credit.   The Bank Pertanian Malaysia (BPM) currently extends
credit to farmers in the existing rice area. Padi production loans are
generally given for one season and are repaid within one month after
harvest. With the project, this coverage would be expanded and as most of
the fertilizer inputs are covered by subsidy, BPM would provide the balance



- 25 -
of production cost. FELCRA is currently acting as Local Credit Center
for BPM in the project area. As the rice area expands and the farmers
credit demands increase, BPM would eventually set up a branch at the
proposed township. At full development, the total credit requirement per
season would be about M$4.3 million (US$2.0 million).
Consulting Services
4.17      The cost of consultants for design and construction supervision
would be about US$2.8 million, covering about 1,140 man-months of services
over a period of seven years, together with vehicles, survey equipment,
transportation and other minor costs. The average man-month cost (including
salary, overhead, profits, travel and subsistence) is estimated to be about
US$2,000. DID is currently engaged in the design and construction of six
ongoing Bank-assisted projects covering a total of about 140,000 ha of
irrigation for rice and 210,000 ha of drainage for treecrops, in addition to
other externally and locally financed projects. In view of the heavy work
load on existing projects, DID would require about 680 man-months of local
consultants time to assist in construction supervision. The PWD and SEDC
would require about 460 man-months of local consultant services, to review
designs and assist in preparation of tender documents and construction
supervision of the project main roads and township facilities. In addition,
the project would provide for about 420 man-months of consulting services,
totalling US$2.0 million and broken down into about 250 man-months of local
and 170 of expatriate time, to assist the Government in the preparation of
future projects, at the average man-month cost of about US$2,000 for local
consultants and about US$7,000 for expatriate consultants. An assurance
was obtained that consultants engaged under the project would be employed
under terms of reference and under conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Land Acquisition
4.18      The Perak State Department of Lands and Mines would be responsible
for land acquisition and property compensation. About 70 ha, or less than
1% of the rice area, is presently alienated to private owners and would be
acquired as right-of-way for project construction. In addition, about 320
ha, or about 3% of the treecrop and township areas, would be acquired for
plantation establishment. The land acquisition needs of the project are
relatively small as most of the land is state-owned.
Operation and Maintenance
4.19      The Perak State DID would be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of the main and secondary canals and drains and the flood
embankment.  The annua. O&M cost for DID facilities is estimated at
US$50/ha. The farmers under the supervision of FELCRA field staff would be
responsible for the operation and maintenance of the irrigation systems
below the service unit turnouts. As improved water control and management



- 26 -
are key elements in achieving yield targets, irrigation O&M staff would play
a vital role in the improved delivery system. The irrigation overseers would
make joint visits with the extension workers and FELCRA's field assistants to
farmers' groups before each crop season to work out irrigation and planting
schedules, advise the farmers on maintenance of canals and drains, and brief
them on planned water distribution and management. FELCRA would maintain the
farm roads and drains in the treecrop area and would be responsible for
management and operation of the palm oil mill. Maintenance of the 27-km
section of West Coast Highway would be carried out by PWD, who would follow
the current practice by which maintenance is contracted to private enterprise
at the rate of M$6,200/km. The other implementing agencies would be
responsible for the maintenance of their respective components. Details of
O&M costs and vehicle and equipment requirements are shown in Annex 2.
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.20      For the project to be successful when FELCRA has completed con-
struction, farmers must reach a projected padi yield of around 4.0 t/ha and
a cropping intensity of 190%. In addition, FELCRA's treecrop operation would
have to be carried out so that farmers' incomes are adequately supplemented
by wages and dividends. To do this on a sustained basis, farmers must
receive a sufficient and timely supply of farm inputs, such as credit, seed,
fertilizers, pesticides, threshing and drying facilities, and transport and
marketing services. If these inputs do not reach the farmers or if water
delivery is not carried out on a timely basis, the success of the project
would be threatened. In addition, farmers must be able to meet the labor
requirements of their individual rice holdings and the treecrop operations.
The Project Coordinator would be responsible for monitoring the flow and
buildup of farm inputs in the project area before and during each cropping
season. This would give project management sufficient warning of any
shortfall and allow appropriate action to be taken. It would also enable the
Government to evaluate the benefit flows in the project area. FELCRA's field
staff, reporting directly to the Chief FELCRA Officer, would collect input
and output data for the rice area and would provide data on the treecrop
operations. This material would be collated and analyzed by the Monitoring
and Evaluation Unit that would be established at FELCRA headquarters. Since
the proposed project represents the Government's first effort to combine rice
and treecrops in a settlement/land development project, the impact on
beneficiaries would be of interest to a number of Government agencies dealing
with poverty alleviation objectives, as well as those involved in rural
development. An assurance was obtained that the Government would, not later
than December 31, 1982, submit to the Bank for review and comment detailed
proposals for monitoring and evaluation of the project.

5. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
Rice
5.01      Cropping Pattern, Yields and Production.  Agricultural production
in the project area is limited to about 3,200 ha in the service area of the
LBC. Present yields average 2.8 ton/ha, with a cropping intensity of 130%,
giving an average annual padi production of about 12,000 tons. DOA
estimates that yields in the project area are lower than other rice areas in
the State due to poor water management. Because of unreliable water
control, farmers use long-maturity varieties proven to be suitable for deep
water conditions and local cultural practices. Untimely agricultural
operations and the use of long-maturity varieties have led to a wide
staggering of planting dates and low cropping intensity.
5.02      In the absence of the project, there would be no significant
change in cropping patterns. A slight increase in yields would be possible
with the development of higher yielding varieties along with some improve-
ments in agricultural support services and farm practices in the existing
rice area. With the project, the irrigation and drainage system would be
improved for the existing 3,700 ha and a new system would be provided for
6,400 ha; with better water management, a cropping intensity of 190% would
be achieved at full development. With the project, average yields would
reach 3.8 ton/ha in the wet season and 4.2 ton/ha in the dry season. These
yields are now being achieved on similar areas in Perak state where water
supply and drainage are adequate. With good water management, improved
extension services and adequate supplies of credit and inputs, projected
yields would be reached five years after completion of project works. As a
result of the project, padi production would increase from about 12,000 tons
at present to about 77,000 tons at full development. The expected changes
in cropping patterns, yields and production are shown in Table 5.1.
5.03      Cropping Calendar.  The achievement of maximum benefits from
irrigation is dependent on strict adherence to a cropping calendar. A
closely followed cropping calendar also minimizes technical and organiza-
t;ional bottlenecks and facilitates effective extension and water management.
Three distinct cropping schedules, each lagging by one week, would be
established in the project area (Fig. 5.1). The implementing agencies would
work together to coordinate water delivery, planting schedules, and supplies
of inputs and services. The most significant change from existing practices
would be the establishment of regular double cropping, allowed by the
introduction of modern varieties with shorter growing periods, water
management, and discipline.

5.04      Farm Mechanization.  At present land preparation over 60% of the
cropped area is limited entirely to manual clearing of vegetation by
brushing with a scythe; two-wheel tractors and rotary cultivators are used
on the remaining area. Lack of farm roads and inability to drain the
fields limit the use of four-wheeled tractors. With better drainage and
access, it is estimated that mechanized land preparation for both wet and
dry-season crops would increase to about 90%. Four-wheeled tractors would
be provided by private contractors and supplemented by DOA, FELCRA and FOA.
BPM would provide additional credit facilities to settlers to pay the
private contractors.



- 29 -
5.05      Harvest and Transport.  About 90% of the rice area is harvested
manually. Under project conditions of greatly improved access and drainage,
use of combine harvesters would gradually increase and reach about 90% of the
cropped area at full development. Machinery would be supplied and operated
by private contractors, supplemented by DOA, FELCRA and FOA. FELCRA has a
storage and padi drying center at Sungei Dedap village settlement
consisting of a store with a capacity of 7,000 bags (500 tons) of padi and
four concrete drying yards with a total area of about 4 ha. Storage is a
problem during harvests particularly for the off--season crop but FELCRA is
constructing a second store to ease the shortage until the integrated padi
processing complexes of LPN become operational (para. 5.06). Due to lack of
drying facilities most farmers sell their padi partly dried and take a
reduced price. Padi is transported by motorcycle or bicycle to FELCRA's
storage center which doubles as a purchasing cent:er during harvest. With the
project, threshed grain would be transported to the processing centers mainly
by trucks supplied by private contractors and FELCRA.
5.06      Processing and Marketing.  At present, FELCRA acts as a purchasing
agent for the National Padi and Rice Authority (LPN) in the project area.
Padi is then transported by private contractors to the LPN mill at Simpang
Lima, about 160 km to the north. A transport charge is deducted from the
purchase price. Poor access prevents the farmers from utilizing any sea-
sonal surplus in processing capacity across the Perak river in Telok Anson
and Sungei Manik. To meet the projected buildup of padi production in the
project area, three integrated storage, drying and milling complexes would
be established. LPN would build a 30 ton/hr dryer and a 5 ton/hr mill in
1982 and another in 1984; FOA would provide adequate drying yards, two batch
dryers with a combined capacity of 40 tons every 16 hours, and a 2 ton/hr
mill for operation in 1982. LPN would provide aclditional capacity following
build-up of padi production. The completion of t:he proposed bridge across
the Perak river would also provide access to the private and LPN mills at
.Telok Anson and nearby areas. Assurances were obtained that the Government
would allocate adequate funds to LPN and FOA to provide facilities for padi
drying, storage, rice milling, and marketing in t:he project area.
Oil Palm
5.07      Yields and Production.  The project would develop about 7,200 ha
of virgin land for oil palm cultivation. Harvesting would begin at the end
of 1983, four years after the planting of the first trees. By 1992, the
project would achieve full production at an average annual output of about
155,000 tons ffb. At extraction rates of 20% for palm oil and 4% for palm
kernel, the project would yield about 30,000 tons of palm oil and 6,000 tons
of palm kernel. Estimated yields are in line with FELCRA-s experience.
Projected yields and production are given in Anne!x 4 and summarized below:

5.08      Crop Establishment and Management.  Felling, land clearing and
burning would be carried out between October and March. With the project,
adequate drainage and access roads would be provided. A leguminous cover
crop would be planted immediately after clearing operations. Planting of
palm seedlings would begin in September and could extend into January of the
following year depending on the size of the scheme. Planting materials in
polybags, 12-14 months old, would be initially purchased from the nearby
private estates prior to FELCRA's establishment of a nursery in the project
area. A density of 148 trees/ha would be obtained with trees planted every
8.8 m in rows 7.6 m apart. The crop would then be maintained for about
three years until harvest, during which time monthly weeding rounds would be
carried out, dead or weak plants replaced, and regular fertilizer
applications made. Beginning the fourth year after planting, foliar
analysis would be periodically conducted by laboratories servicing the
private plantation sector to guide FELCRA's field staff on the rate and
timing of fertilizer application. Fertilizer applications would be based on
well-established levels peaking in the eleventh to twentieth year after
planting when about 300 kg of sulfate of ammonia, 235 kg of rock phosphate,
400 kg of of muriate of potash and 170 kg of kieserite per ha would be
applied. Assisted pollination would commence about six months before the
first harvest and continue up to twelfth year after planting. Field upkeep
would continue during the 25-30 year economic life of the estate, including
regular rounds of weeding and fertilizer applications.
5.09      Harvest and Transport.  Correct timing of harvest and speedy
transport of ffbs to the mill are essential to production of quality palm
oil. Harvesting would be carried out all through the year at intervals of
about 10 days. From 7-8% of the annual production is obtained monthly,
except during the peak month, usually between September and November, when
about 15% is obtained. Settlers, grouped into teams and supervised by
FELCRA's field assistants, would be responsible for cutting and collection of
fruits from 200 ha blocks. In the field, ffbs would be transported by
FELCRA's tractor trailers to centrally located loading ramps and then
transferred to trucks for shipment to the mill.



- 31 -
5.10      Processing and Marketing.  In the early stages of the project,
FELCRA would transport ffbs to their palm oil mill at Nasaruddin, about 30 km
from the project area. This mill, financed by a separate Bank loan, would be
operational by 1983 and would have the capacity to handle project production
until 1986. FELCRA would construct a mill in the project area to be opera-
tional by 1986, with an initial capacity of 20 tons ffb/hr and then expanded
to 40 tons ffb/hr by late 1988. This capacity would be adequate until about
1992, and FELCRA would provide the additional capacity to handle project
production at that time.
Cocoa
5.11      Yields and Production.  About 1,200 ha would be planted to cocoa.
Harvesting would begin in 1983 on the first 100 ha block planted in early
1981. By 1992, the project would reach full production with an annual
output estimated at 1,450 tons dried beans. The projected yields and
phasing of development take into account the climatic and soil conditions in
the project area and the intensive management requirement of the crop.
Projected yields and production are given in Annex 4 and summarized below:
Table 5.3: COCOA YIELDS AND PRODUCTION
Year                           1983      1988       1992       1996      2000

5.12      Crop Establishment and Management.  As land clearing operations
are carried out in the treecrop area, the best clrained and most suitable
soils in blocks of 100-250 ha in each phase would be planted to cocoa. A
year in advance of cocoa establishment, shade trees would be planted 5 m
apart within cocoa rows, giving a density of abcut 670 plants/ha. Planting
would be completed at least one month before the onset of the dry season to
ensure better establishment. Cocoa planting materials, of the Trinitario/
Upper Amazon hybrid, would have a density of 1,330 trees/ha. Seedlings would
be obtained from DOA's Hilar Perak CPC which is presently producing about
700,000 cocoa seedlings annually. Field upkeep of cocoa, including regular
rounds of weeding and manuring, pruning, shade mianagement and disease
control, would continue throughout the 25-30 year economic life of the
estate. Fertilizer applications would be based on well-established levels
averaging 760 kg/ha of NPK-Blue between the fifth and twentieth year. Foliar
analysis would be periodically conducted to guide the field staff in
fertilizer applications.
5.13      Harvesting and Transport.  Harvesting would involve picking ripe
pods from the trees and splitting them to extract the wet beans. On



- 32 -
average, about 20% of the annual crop would be harvested in the peak months.
Harvesting would be at intervals no longer than 3-4 weeks and weekly
harvesting would be done where pod diseases or rodents are liable to cause
appreciable losses. Wet beans stored in baskets or plastic bags would be
transported to FAMA's processing center from the field collection points.
Initially, raw cocoa beans from the project would be transported by private
contractors to FAMA-s cocoa processing plant in Sabak Bernarn, about 130 km
to the south.
5.14      Processing and Marketing.  FAMA would construct a 5 ton/day
fermentary drier module in 1986 for operation in 1987 and would expand
capacities as project production builds up. FAMA would be responsible for
marketing the dried cocoa beans for export or to local processors.
6. MARKET PROSPECTS, PRICES, FARM INCOMES AND PROJECT CHARGES
Market Prospects
6.01      Rice.  The total rice production of Malaysia, amounting to about
1.46 million tons in 1979, is consumed locally, and additional rice is
imported, mostly from Thailand and the People's Republic of China, to meet
domestic demand of about 1.7 million tons. Today, local production is
estimated to supply 91% of domestic consumption requirements. A production
increase is expected at the rate of 3.2% p.a. up to 1990, taking into
account all ongoing and pipeline irrigation projects, and a consumption
increase of 2.7% per annum, based on population growth alone. With these
projections Malaysia would produce about 2.1 million tons in 1990 but would
still have to import about 100,000 tons of rice. At full development, the
project would produce about 76,000 tons of padi, equivalent to 50,000 tons
of rice, of which some 7,000 tons would be consumed in the project area and
about 43,000 tons would be marketable surplus. The production surplus could
be easily disposed of in nearby markets, as the states of Perak and Selangor
are traditionally rice-deficit areas.
6.02      Palm Oil and Palm Kernel.  The oil palm produces two distinct
oils, palm oil and palm kernel oil, both of which are important in world
trade. Palm oil is generally extracted in the producing country; palm
kernel is usually shipped whole and the oil is extracted in the importing
country. Palm kernel oil is very closely akin to coconut oil. Oils from
both products compete with other vegetable oils and with animal and marine
oils and fats for industrial and edible uses. Palm oil contains for the
most part the same fatty acids as other fats and oils. One advantage lies
in the nutritional value; with a high carotene content, it is a rich source
of Vitamin A. The increasing use of palm oil in Malaysia for cooking,
instead of coconut oil, could be a positive step to remedying the Vitamin K
deficiency found to be extremely common among rural Malays. Another
characteristic, the low polyunsaturated fatty acid content, gives it an
advantage in that these acids are less liable to oxidation and their



- 33 -
presence gives products a longer shelf life; a disadvantage is that palm oil
is not one of the oils with high levels of polyunsaturated fats preferred by
western consumers for its health benefits.
6.03      Malaysia is the world's largest producer and exporter of palm oil,
accounting for 53% of total world production and 76% of total world exports
in 1978. Exports of palm oil grew over ten-fold between 1965 and 1978, from
0.14 million tons to 1.5 million tons. Malaysia-s major markets have been
Singapore, the UK, the Netherlands, the US and India, which together absorb
about 70% of its export volume. The best prospects for increasing the demand
of palm oil would be to increase its share of the world market for fats and
oil. One factor that could increase palm oil½s share substantially would be a
price decline. This, in effect, is what the Bank has forecast for the period
between 1980 and 1990; it is anticipated that world production of palm oil
will increase, prices in real terms will subsequenltly decline, and palm oil's
share of the total fats and oils market will increase from 15% at present to
28% by 1990.  For the same period, world production of palm oil is expected to
grow at the rate of 5.9% per annum and world exportLs at 8.4% per annum, more
than double the growth rate of fats and oils in general. Malaysia-s exports
are expected to be about 3.5 million tons by 1985 and 4.6 million tons by 1990
in a world market projected at 4.9 million tons and 6.6 million tons,
respectively. The project production of 30,000 tons of palm oil and 6,000
tons of palm kernel at full development would represent less than 1% of the
country's exports.
6.04      For Malaysia to remain a leading producer and exporter, it must
build up an international reputation for producing high quality oil, and for
palm oil to increase its competitive position, market research and promotion
of new end-uses are necessary. Towards these ends, the Government established
t:he Palm Oil Research Institute of Malaysia (PORIM) early in 1979,
incorporating the Palm Oil Research Branch of MARDI. The institute's program
includes, in addition to agronomic activities, the study of processing and
quality control and research on new uses for processed oil, by-products, and
effluents.
6.05       Cocoa.  Cocoa is a tropical commodity produced only in developing
countries, with about 2/3 of current production originating from West
Africa. The growth rate of production up to 1990 is expected to follow the
historical rate from 1955-77.  Based on world grindings, a reasonably good
proxy for global consumption, cocoa demand grew at: 3.1% per annum from
L955-77 and is projected to increase only marginally slower at 2.9% per
annum to 1990.  By 1990 world production is estimated at 2.4 million tons,
with 1.5 million tons exported as beans and 0.8 mi'llion tons exported as
intermediate products, to satisfy a world demand of 2.3 million tons. This
is compared to a 1980 production of 1.6 million tons, with 1.3 million tons
exported as beans and 0.2 million tons as intermediate products, to satisfy
a demand of 1.5 million tons. Cocoa is a relatively new commercially
cultivated crop in Malaysia, and signs are pointing towards its buildup as
the third major crop after rubber and oil palm.  The Government is actively



- 34 -
encouraging the development of cocoa on smallholdings especially as an
intercrop with coconut. FELDA is also developing a large area in Sabah for
cocoa cultivation. To improve productivity on smallholdings, which at
present account for 45% of the cocoa area, the Government, through FAMA,
provides facilities for processing, subsidizes inputs, and distributes high
yielding clones. Production increased from 3,500 tons in 1970 to 29,000
tons in 1979 and is projected to reach 64,000 tons by 1990. The project
production, reaching 1,450 tons in 1996, would be exported, but would
represent a small portion of total production. Malaysia is not a partici-
pant in the International Cocoa Agreement. The acceptance of export quotas
imposed on its signatories would be contrary to the Government intention to
expand production, but it is likely that at some future point when produc-
tion has stabilized, the pricing and marketing provisions of the Agreement
may offer sufficient incentive for the country to join.
Prices
6.06      The calculations for palm oil, cocoa and rice prices are presented
in Annex 4 and are summarized below. The financial farmgate prices for palm
oil, palm kernel and cocoa are based on the Bank's commodity price forecasts
for 1981 and 1990; for rice it was assumed that the ratio of financial to
economic prices established by the Government in 1980 through its retail,
wholesale and farm level price control/support activities would be
maintained. Adjustments have been made for grade differentials and
processing and transport costs, and prices have been expressed in mid-1981
constant terms. The present and future economic prices of each crop were
derived by calculating the c.i.f. price for rice and the f.o.b. prices for
palm oil, palm kernel and cocoa in local currency and working back to the
farmgate, excluding taxes and adjusting domestic costs by applying specific
conversion factors to express all local costs in border price equivalents.
6.07      Rice.  In addition to operating a network of rice mills and
maintaining the national rice stockpiles, LPN is responsible for setting
purchase prices for a wide range of grades and varieties of padi in the
major producing areas at the beginning of each season. LPN mills generally
pay the purchase price, discounted for moisture content in excess of 14% and
for dirt, empty grains, straw, or other foreign matter. Private mills
generally offer prices equal to or better than the official prices. The
purchase price at the millgate in 1981 is $561/ton for long-grain rice,
M$528/ton for medium-grain and M$495/ton for short-grain. After deductions
for moisture and transport to the mill at Simpang Lima, the financial
farmgate price is estimated at M$510 per ton. With the project, the cost of
transport to the mill, borne by the farmer, would be reduced when the LPN
and FOA mills in the project area become operational.



- 35 -
6.08      The rice produced by the project is expected to be equivalent to
the higher grades of Thai rice. However, since the quality of imported
rice is generally lower, a mixture of 10-15% brokens, for economic analysis
the price of the lower quality has been used. These grades are generally
traded internationally at prices 10% below that of the Thai 5% brokens, for
which the Bank makes long-term projections. For financial and economic
analysis, it is assumed that the milling ratio would be 65%, that the
primary market for project output would be Ipoh, the state capital, and that
the farmgate prices would rise along with the projected world market price.
The Bank-s forecasts and the derived prices are shown below:

6.09      Palm Oil and Palm Kernel.  Prices for fats and oils cyclically
fluctuated during the past two decades, reflecting increases or shortfalls
in production and exports, but displaying no clear trend. For palm oil and
palm kernel, the Bank forecasts a rise in real prices in the early 1980s,
which will further stimulate expansion of cropped area, and a subsequent
price decline as increasing supplies of oils from palm and other tree crops
flow into international markets in the latter half of the decade. The
Bank-s forecast and the derived prices are as follows:

6.10.     Cocoa.  The demand for cocoa is inelastic and price tends to
fluctuate with production. A world record crop in 1964/65, the direct
result of the rapid rate of plantings in the early 1950s, sent prices to
their historic low of less than US$0.37/kg. At the opposite extreme, a
shortage resulting from bad weather in 1976 and limited plantings in the
1960s sent prices to an unprecedented high, averaging US$3.79/kg in 1977.
Cocoa prices are projected to decline throughout the 1980s on account of the
anticipated high level of world production and the increasing use of cocoa
substitutes in chocolate and confectionary. Malaysian cocoa sells for 6-10%
less than standard Ghana cocoa. The Bank's forecast and the derived prices
are as follows:

Farm Incomes
6.11      All project settlers would have practically the same incomes,
generated mainly from padi sales and treecrop wages and dividends. Settlers
would receive wages for field maintenance and harvest labor in the treecrop
area and dividends, starting in year 4, would average about M$830 per year.
Additional family income is expected from the sale of fruits and vegetables
raised in the houselots and from the products of cottage industries, which
would be promoted by the Farm Family Development branch of the Extension
Service. FELCRA expects that family labor would contribute 36 man-days per
month, based on 1.5 units of labor for 24 days each, except for brief
periods when harvesting of padi and treecrops coincide. At these times, it
is assumed that the family could supply two units of labor. Through incomes
from padi sales are assumed to remain constant (in 1981 prices) after full
development of the project, the net family income would vary from year to
year on account of declining wages and dividends from treecrops as
productivity decreases, and the phasing of loan repayments with housing
loans paid during years 3 to 15 and land development loans in years 10 to
20. A cash flow for a typical settler is given in Annex 5 and summarized
below.

6.12      The farm budgets shown in Annex 4 compare the potential settlers
present incomes to their expected incomes with the project. The examples
are representative of the income situations from which settlers are likely
to be recruited: 1.2 ha of rainfed holdings outside the project area and
1.2 and 2.1 ha of irrigated holdings under the present conditions prevalent
in the project area. Based on the selection criteria, one can assume that
virtually all potential settlers are presently in poverty. During the
project life, the settlers would have average incomes well above the poverty
level (US$320 per capita) but still less than the critical consumption
level (CCL).
Project Charges
6.13      Water charges would be treated along the lines of the previous four
Bank-financed irrigation projects in Malaysia (North Kelantan, Northwest
Selangor, Krian-Sungei Manik, and Muda II). In M[alaysia, operation and
maintenance costs are funded from general state aLnd federal revenues. Nominal
water and drainage rates are collected by state governments and form part of
the general revenue. Since virtually all the Trans-Perak settlers would be
Muslims, they would be subject to the compulsory religious tithe, zakat, which
in Perak State is levied at a rate of 10% of gross value of annual padi
production. On project farms, zakat would average about US$250 per farm per
annum at full development, about four times the irrigation system operation
and maintenance costs per farm. Thus zakat payments would make a substantial
contribution to capital cost recovery. Also, because the project entails
major social infrastructure, land clearing and crop development costs,
settlers would be required to repay without interest the capital costs of
housing, land clearing and treecrop development. Repayment of housing costs
over 15 years, with a '-year grace period, would require annual payments of
US$205 per family. Repayment of land clearing, tree crop development and

production loans over 20 years, with a 10-year grace period, would entail
annual payments of US$525 during the repayment period. At present the
Government imposes export taxes of about US$215/ton on palm oil and US$95/ton
on palm kernel. At full development in 1992, the project output would produce
tax revenues of about US$5.6 million. Based on present values of project
-eat, loan repayment, zakat, water charges and export taxes, the rent
recovery indices for the beneficiaries range from 42-46%. For the total
project, the rent recovery index, excluding housing loan repayment, is 37%.
The impact of the Government's new interest rate poLicy is indicated by a
comparison of the cost recovery index of 41%, calculated on the basis of
interest-free loan repayment by settlers, with 49% if interest were charged.
Since the project beneficiaries would remain below the CCL, even in their
highest income years, the cost and rent recovery indices would be acceptable,
especially in view of the Government's strong commitment to poverty
alleviation.
Processing Plant Cash Flows
6.14      The projected cash flows of the two processing plants that would
be financed under the project are shown in Annex 5. FELCRA's palm oil mill
is expected to incur losses during the first two years while the plant is
under construction and plantation production of ffbs builds up. Similarly,
FAMAAs cocoa processing plant would incur cash losses during the first two
years. The Government would make up any resulting cash deficits. Ownership
of the palm oil mill would be handed over to the sesttlers when the
investment costs have been recouped.
7. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.D1      The project would develop about 14,800 ha of new land, 6,400 ha
for irrigated rice, 7,200 ha for oil palm and 1,200 ha for cocoa, and
rehabilitate about 3,700 ha of existing rice land. About 6,900 farm
families, mainly new settlers, would be direct beneficiaries. The project
would contribute to the Government's goals of poverty alleviation,
self-sufficiency in rice, increased exports, and more balanced regional
distribution of development. The average capital cost in financial prices
is estimated at US$10,000 per ha and US$24,000 per farm family directly
benefited. The cost per farm family is much higher than in other recent
Bank-financed irrigation projects in Malaysia, whic'h range between US$2,000
and US$4,000 for Northwest Selangor (Ln 1522-MA), Krian-Sungei Manik (Ln
1632-MA) and Muda II (Ln 1717-MA) projects. The reason for this is that
previous projects involved only improvements to existing physical works in
contrast to Trans-Perak, where most of the works are new and the project
includes land clearance, settlements, processing plants and a section of the



- 40 -
West Coast Highway. Compared to previous land settlement projects, the cost
per family (in 1981 prices) is close to Keratong (Ln 1044-MA), which was
US$24,800, and Johore (Ln 967-MA), US$22,000, and higher than FELDA VI (Ln
1590-MA), US$12,500. The settlement infrstructure cost per family is
US$6,700 in the proposed project and US$2,400 in the FELDA VI project; the
level of infrastructure required for development of a township designated
as a growth center is considerably higher and more expensive that for the
nine geographically scattered rural settlements in the latter project. The
settler families would achieve per capita income levels of about US$485 at
the peak of loan repayment and about US$560 after the loan has been repaid,
well above absolute poverty (US$320 per capita). In comparison, the
irrigation projects would provide average per capita incomes of about US$350
and US$400, respectively, with about 15% of the beneficiaries remaining
below the absolute poverty level and the land settlement projects would
allow average incomes from about US$400 to US$600 per capita. The incre-
mental annual production of 42,000 tons of milled rice at full development
would result in net foreign exchange savings of about US$22 million while
the incremental output of palm oil, palm kernel and cocoa would result in
net foreign exchange earnings of US$21 million (all in 1981 prices). The
project would also provide housing and community facilities for settlers in
a township and a village, and a wide range of agricultural support services.
7.02      Foreign Exchange.  The unit of account is uncommitted foreign
exchange in the hands of the Government, expressed in terms of local
currency. All tradeable components are valued directly in foreign exchange
and converted to local currency at the official exchange rate of MS =
US$0.465 and adjusted for dealer or processing margin, local transport and
handling. Conversion factors for a number of broad categories of goods and
services produced or consumed by the project have been used to express all
nontradeable inputs and outputs in terms of the unit of account (Annex 4).
7.03      Benefits.  Projected yields, cropping intensities, and production
are discussed in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 presents the farmgate prices for
inputs and outputs, based on the Banks price forecasts for rice, palm oil,
cocoa and fertilizers. Gross returns, production costs, labor requirements,
and farm budgets are given in Annex 4. For the palm oil and cocoa mills,
output has been valued at economic prices and inputs at farmgate economic
prices, with the mill assuming the transport cost. Operating costs, based
on local experience, were adjusted to economic prices by the conversion
factor for inputs. Benefits for the West Coast Highway section were
calculated on the basis of vehicle operating cost savings for passengers,
agricultural and miscellaneous freight traffic due to a reduction in travel
distance. Traffic related to the project was considered separately from
traffic outside the project area. Project area traffic included transport
of palm oil, cocoa, agricultural inputs and passengers taking into account
the projected buildup of production and population, and excluded rice, since
the major market is expected to be Ipoh. "Outside the project traffic
included agricultural traffic, projected to increase at the rate of 3% p.a.,



- 41 -
and miscellaneous freight, increasing at 7% p.a.; t:ransport of rice, sugar
and palm oil was excluded on the basis of local processing availability.
Passenger traffic was based on the projected population of Sitiawan and
Lumut, the nearest urban centers. Relevant basic dlata were obtained from a
feasibility study of the East-West Highway prepared for the Government by
local consultants (MINCO) and confirmed by PWD traffic counts at selected
points on major highways in the area. Annex 6 summarizes the foregoing
information and gives the expected economic benefits from the project for
each component.
7.04      Distribution of Benefits.  All of the direct benefits to be derived
from the project would accrue to the settler families, about 35,000 people.
The settler families, 90% in the target group, have average incomes of about
US$230 per capita, about 70% of the 1981 absolute poverty level income of
US$320. With the project, average incomes are expected to range from US$535
to US$620 per capita. While these incomes would take the project
beneficiaries above the absolute poverty level, it is expected that their
incomes would still remain below the projected CCL (US$790 per capita) at that
time. Additional benefits would accrue to the sett:lers through improved
housing and community facilities.   Indirect benefits, e.g.  increased
emnployment in the public and private sectors, more commercial activity and
higher quality of life, would accrue to most of the project area population,
projected to be about 47,000 people at full development.
7.05      Employment Impact.  The annual demand for labor with the project is
estimated at 2.0 million man-days. About 6,900 set:tler families would provide
the total labor supply of 10,400 workers at full development equivalent to
1.5 workers per farm family. Assuming 24 work-days per month, the total
available monthly labor supply would be 250,000 man-days in 1992. Peak
monthly demand occurs in March and September at 249,000 mandays and 271,000
man-days, respectively. The labor supply deficit in September would be filled
through a slight increase in labor availability per farm family to 1.7 from
1.5 originally assumed. Since output foregone by most project beneficiaries
would be less than the market wage rate, i.e., the labor market for rice
smallholders is characterized by surplus labor, the opportunity cost of labor
at domestic prices was valued at 70% of the existing market wage of M$10/day
and adjusted by the consumption conversion factor to M$5.67/day in border
prices. The economic cost of labor at full development would be about
M$11.1 million.
7.06      Investment Costs.  The total economic capital cost excluding hous-
ing and community facilities is about US$99 million. This includes allowance
for physical contingencies but excludes expected price increases. Local
costs have been multipli-!d by the conversion factol for construction (0.77).
Separate economic analyFes have been conducted for the agricultural component
(IJS$72.8 million), procassing facilities (US$7.7 million) and the 27-km
section of the West Coast Highway including the Perak river bridge (US$18.6
million). Benefits from improved community facilit:ies, including housing,
water supply, electricity, education and health facilities have not been
quantified but are assumed to be at least equal to cost (US$42.7 million).



- 42 -
With the Malaysian population growing annually by about 360,000 persons or
60,000-70,000 households, new housing and associated services equivalent to
about ten times the total provided by this project would be required each year
merely to accommodate the expanding population.
7.07      Development Period.  According to the project implementation
schedule, all works would be completed by mid-1988 (Figure 3.1). Full
agricultural development would be reached in the project area by 1992. For
purposes of economic analysis, it is assumed that benefits from the
irrigation systems would begin in 1982 and continue increasing until the
projected yield is achieved.
7.08      Economic Rate of Return (ERR).  On the basis of the foregoing
assumptions and discounting the costs and benefits over a 30-year evaluation
period, the overall ERR is 18%. At a discount rate of 10%, the estimated
opportunity cost of capital in Mlalaysia, the economic net present value of
the project in 1981 prices is about US$92 million. The agriculture
component has an ERR of 18%, the processing facilities, 25% and the West
Coast Highway section, 15% (Annex 6).
7.09      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity of the rate of return was tested
to cost overruns, reduction of benefits, and implementation delays. The
analysis was carried out on the total project and on each component. Within
the agricultural component each crop was analyzed separately and also tested
to sensitivity of shadow wage rates. In addition, the rate of return was
calculated for the case in which the costs of housing and community
infrastructure were included. The results are shown below.

7.10      Sensitivity analysis was also used to determine which variables
would be most crucial to the agricultural component. In carrying out the
sensitivity analysis, two measures were developed for each variable tested,
the crossover value and the elasticity. The crossover value is the value of
the variable tested for which NPV discounted at 10% is zero and is a measure
of how the variable can differ from its most likely value before the project
becomes economically nonviable. The crossover value may also be interpreted
as the value of the variable tested, beyond which the economic rate of
return would fall below 10%. The elasticity is defined as the percentage
change in NPV discounted at 10% with respect to a 1% change in the variable
tested. It is a measure of the rate of change of NPV for any change in
variables, at the most likely value of that variable./l The results are
presented in Annex 6.  The likelihood of these critical variations is
dLiscussed below.
(a) Rice. Rice is most sensitive with respect to cropping intensity
and least sensitive with respect to the shadow wage rate. The
crossover value for cropping intensity, 156%, is about 34 per-
centage points less than the expected cropping intensity. Since
farmers in the area at present are averaging 130% cropping
intensity, it is unlikely that with the close guidance of FELCRA and
the timely availability of water and agricultural inputs that the
cropping intensity would fall to the crossover value. The crop is
moderately sensitive with respect to yields, world market prices and
construction costs.
(b) Oil Palm. The crossover value for yields, cropping intensity and
world market price if about one third less than the expected
value. With FELCRA managing the tree crop area on a plantation
basis, it is highly unlikely that cropping intensity would be
reduced to the crossover value and unless there is a serious
outbreak of uncontrollable disease or drought of lengthy duration,
it is unlikely that yield would fall to 14.6 tons/ha, the
crossover value. The world market price is, of course, beyond the
control of the project.
(c) Cocoa. This crop is sensitive with respect to yields, cropping
intensity and world market price. A 6% decline in any of these
variables would lead to an NPV of zero. This crop is being
planted on only 1,200 ha, out of a total treecrop area of 8,400
ha and a total planted area of 18,500 ha. Since cocoa is
generally a smallholder crop interplanted with mature coconut,
its inclusion in the proposed project represents a limited trial
by the Government to test its suitability for land development
projects.
/1 The elasticity generally changes for movements along the NPV-variable
curve.

7.11      Sunk Costs.  As the proposed project would finance the incremental
investment necessary to complete the irrigation and drainage system in which
DID has been involved since 1961, the project's agricultural component has
also been analyzed to throw light on the question whether, with hindsight,
the original decision to proceed with the project was well founded. Past
costs have been expressed in mid-1981 prices and converted to economic
values by excluding estimates for taxes and transfer payments and applying
to local costs the construction conversion factor (0.77). Economic benefits
from these past investments have been estimated on the basis of the existing
rice area. FELCRA-s land clearing costs for the initial phases of new rice
area along with initial clearing and development work for treecrops from
1979 to mid-1981 have been included. These FELCRA investments have yet to
generate benefits. Costs for upgrading of project area roads prior to
mid-1981 have also been included. With the above assumptions, the economic
rate of return is estimated at 13%.
7.12      Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the project,
and those normally associated with project benefits, costs, development
period and implementation delays have been evaluated in the sensitivity
analyses. However, coordination among the implementing agencies would be
crucial to project execution. To reduce this risk, the appointment of the
Project Coordinator has been made a condition of effectiveness and adequate
funds for consulting services have been provided to assist the
project-related agencies.
8. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government on
the following major points:
(a)  the implementing agencies would maintain separate accounts for the
project; these would be collated by the Project Coordinator and
forwarded to the Bank on a regular basis (para. 3.24);
(b) the Government would take all measures necessary to ensure that
the design, construction and operation of the project works are
carried out in accordance with appropriate ecological and environ-
mental standards (para. 3.25);
(c) the Government would forward to the Bank for review and comment by
December 31, 1981 the detailed implementation schedule for provision
of township facilities (para. 4.07);



- 45 -
(d)  the Government would forward to the Bank for review and comment
by December 31, 1981, the settler selection criteria and the
draft settler agreement (para. 4.09);
(e)  DID would prepare, on completion of final design, a designer's
operations manual covering major project works, (para. 4.05) and
DOA would prepare an agricultural services operations manual as a
guide for project field staff by December 31, 1984 (para. 4.12);
(f)  DOA would develop the seed production center at Titi Gantong
to meet the requirements of the project (para. 4.14);
(g)  consultants engaged under the project would be employed under
terms of reference and under conditions acceptable to the Bank
(para. 4.17);
(h)  the Government would submit to the Bank for review and comment by
December 31, 1982, detailed proposals for monitoring and evalua-
tion of the project (para. 4.20); and
(i)  the Government would ensure that adequate funds are allocated to
LPN and FOA to provide padi drying, storage, milling, and
marketing facilities as required (para. 5.06).
8.02      The appointment of a suitably qualified Project Coordinator (para.
4.01) and the establishment of the Steering Committee (para. 4.02) would be
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
8.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$50.0 million, with a 17-year maturity including a
grace period of four years. The Borrower would be the Government of
Malaysia.

/a  Economic prices were determined by adjusting financial base estimates using
standard conversion factors from Annex 4, Table 2: 0.72 for port handling
costs, 0.66 for transport costs, and the general conversion factor, 0.89,
for milling costs.
/b  For estimating financial farm-gate prices, it was assumed that the ratio of
financial to economic prices established by the Government in 1980 through
its retail, wholesale and farm-level price control/support activities would
be maintained. Thus, the projected financial prices were estimated by mul-
tiplying the economic farm-gate price estimates by the ratio of the 1980
purchase price for medium-grain padi (adjusted by farm-to-mill transport
cost), M$470, to the estimated 1980 economic price, M$595; i.e., by 0.79.

/a  The cash flow is calculated for a typical settler arriving In 1985.
lb  During the first year of settlement, the settler receives:  (i) an income maintenance loan of $600 from FELCRA to carry him until the first harvest and (ii) a production loan
to cover 100% of production costs for the first crop and 50%  for the second crop.  After four cropping seasons, approximately 25% of the area is releveled, and FELCRA
provides an income maintenance loan to compensate for the production lost.
/c  Based on 5 persOns/family.
