1. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      The Republic of Korea (ROK) is situated in the southern part of
the Korean peninsula and occupies a land area of 98.9 thousand sq km. About
two thirds of the land is mountainous and largely unsuitable for human
settlement. There are ten major river basins in the country which account
for 75% of the land area. The climate is characterized by dry and cold
winters, warm summers and cyclical droughts.
1.02      Korea's population in 1981 was 38.7 million.  Its population
density of almost 400 persons/sq km is one of the highest in the world; it
is also one of the most urbanized of the developing countries. The overall
population growth rate decreased from 3% in 1960 to about 1.5% at present.
The urban population in 50 cities (Si) and 137 towns (Eubs) with over 50,000
and 20,000 persons respectively, constituting 60% of the total, has been
increasing by 5% p.a. between 1975 and 1980, or at about three times the
overall growth rate. There are 1,253 small communities (Myeons) with
populations between 10,000 and 20,000 and 62,328 smaller villages. By the
end of the century the urban population is expected to level off at about
80% of a total population of 50 million. This rapid urbanization is
creating problems of increasing population density, traffic congestion,
sanitation and other environmental problems and has stretched all urban
services, particularly those provided by the Government, like water supply.
Government priority earlier focused on developing the industrial sector,
leaving urban infrastructure and services relatively neglected. Starting in
the 1970's, the government began to give increased priority to the delivery
of social services, improving the water supply sector and related health
conditions.
The Environment
1.03      Korea's accelerated industrial and urban growth has been respon-
sible for a decline in the quality of the environment because of increasing
water, soil and air pollution. Surface, groundwater and soil pollution is
caused mainly by agricultural chemicals, improper collection and disposal of
night soil, solid wastes and toxic industrial wastes and sludges, directly
and through runoff. Fish kills have been reported in coastal waters off
Ulsan, Masan and Jinhae. Air pollution standards for long-term exposure to
sulphur dioxide (0.05 ppm versus 0.03 ppm in the US) were exceeded in Seoul
in 1979 by more than 100% and in Busan by more than 16%.
1.04      Government programs are producing results.  Waterborne diseases have
declined steadily since 1971. The crude death rate went down from 13 to 7
per thousand persons between 1960-81, while life expectancy increased from



- 2 -
53 to 66 years in the same periode. However, intestinal parasitic infections
are still prevalent, particularly in areas where nightsoil is used as
fertilizer.
Water Resources
1.05      The Ministry of Construction (MOC) has jurisdiction over the
development and use of water resources throughout Korea. The Agriculture
Development Corporation (ADC), a semi-autonomous agency under the Ministry
of Agriculture and Fisheries, has authority to construct dams for irrigation
and to reclaim land for agriculture. In 1980 the total volume of water
supplied was estimated at 17.5 billion cu m with 14.2 billion cu m (73%)
available from rivers, 1.4 billion cu m (18%) from groundwater and 3.3
billion cu m (19%) from storage reservoirs. Domestic consumption was 14%,
industrial 4%, agricultural 64% and other uses 18%.  Total volume of
precipitation is estimated at 114 billion cu m per annum.  Groundwater
reserves are estimated at 232 billion cu m but may prove difficult to
develop on a large scale.  The supply of water is expected to increase from
17.5 to 29.7 billion cu m by 1991 with storage reservoirs providing 80% of
the additional demand, or 44% of total supply.
1.06      The four largest river basins - Han, N4agdong, Geum and Yongsan -
contain 66% of the land, and 70% of the industrr and urban population of
Korea. Most of the major cities and industries and the best agricultural
land depend on these rivers for water. Water resources are becoming scarce;
the annual surface water runoff per capita is only about 1,700 cu m or about
40% and 12% of run off per capita in Japan and the US, respectively.
Furthermore, two thirds of the average annual precipitation of 1160 mm is
concentrated in three months, July to September. Serious floods are frequent
during these months, followed by cyclical droughts. Several multipurpose
dams have been or are being constructed in the four main river basins to
reduce flooding and to provide storage for municipal and industrial needs,
agriculture and power generation (Annex l). The cost for water resource
conservation and development is increasing rapidly due to the shortage of
suitable dam sites and increasing land compensation costs.
Sector Organization
1.07      There is no single agency in charge of overall planning, program-
ming and financing of the water supply and sanitation sector. At the Central
Government level four Ministries are directly involved in the sector in
various ways.  These are: the Ministry of Construction (MOC), the Ministry
of Home Affairs (MOHA), the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs (MOHSA); and
the Economic Planning Board (EPB) (see Chart 1).
1.08      MOC is responsible for planning, financing and constructing major
works for water supply production and for water resources management
(including collection of hydrological data, issuing licenses for abstraction
of water and planning multipurpose dams) through, respectively, the Water



Works and Dam Development Divisions of the Water Resources Bureau. The
Sewerage Division of the Urban Planning Bureau performs a similar function
in respect to major sewerage works. MOC has five regional construction
offices which are responsible for implementing and inspecting works in
different provinces. The Industrial Sites and Water Resources Development
Corporation (ISWACO), a semi-autonomous corporation under MOC, promotes and
builds industrial sites and industrial water supply, constructs and operates
multipurpose dams and regional water supply projects.
1.09      MOHA, through its Local Finance Division, under the Local Finance
Bureau, is responsible for overseeing the management of city Water Bureaus
(WBs), including the approval of bonds, loans, tariffs and the expansion of
distribution and storage facilities. The WBs (Water Divisions in the
smaller towns) are part of each city and the cities are under the provincial
government. However, Seoul, the capital city comes directly under the Prime
Minister Office while the other three "special cities" (Busan, Daegu and
Incheon) are under MOHA's jurisdiction. The management, planning, design,
construction and operation of water works in the municipalities is the
responsibility of the WBs. They operate as independent entities; accounts,
revenues, costs and budgets are separated from the general accounts of each
city. WBs are subject to guidance and staff receive training from MOHA; new
accounting guidelines for all WBs have been developed by MOHA and are
satisfactory to the Bank.
1.10      MOHSA is responsible for the standards and quality control of
drinking water and for establishing policy guidelines, providing funds and
monitoring implementation for rural water and sanitation programs. Under a
MOHSA program 28,000 simple piped rural water supply systems have been
completed by 1980. This successful water supply program is expected
to be completed by 1986. Each county (Gun) constructs these systems
assisted by the provincial government and MOHSA.
1.11      The Office of Environment (OOE), created in 1980 under MOHSA, is
responsible for environmental policies and pollution control (solid, liquid
and air). It has six regional offices for monitoring, controlling and
coordinating environmental projects. Under the Environmental Preservation
Law, OOE also must approve development projects which have an important
impact on the environment.
1.12      EPB, through its Price Policy Bureau, sets guidelines on tariffs.
EPB also approves and allocates counterpart funds for MOC's projects which
are financed by foreign loans. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), through its
International Finance Bureau, coordinates foreign finance for development
projects.
Service Levels
1.13      About 55% of Korea's population was served by piped water supply
systems in 1980, compared with 17% in 1960 and 33% in 1970.  The level of



- 4 -
service was better (83%) in the 50 larger cities with populations over 50,000
(including the capital city of Seoul with a population of 8.7 million) where
high population densities and polluted aquifers leave no alternative to
publicly supplied water.
1.14      The reliability of water supply is generally poor since the
expansion of services has lagged behind the rapid urban growth. The fringe
areas of many cities suffer from low pressures and water rationing.  During
1981, the total volume of water produced by municipal and industrial (M&I)
systems amounted to 4,500 million cu m, of which almost 90%O was surface
water, the remainder being groundwater.  Water produced by M&I systems
averages about 260 liters per capita per day (lpcd), with production in major
cities such as Seoul, Busan and Incheon being of the order of 260-350 lpcd.
However, one quarter to one half of the water produced is unaccounted-for,
leakage being a major factor. Technical assistance and training in leak
detection are included in the project (para. 3.03). Almost half of the
water consumed is used by commercial, industrial and government consumers,
with domestic usage being below 100 lpcd. The uncertain pressures and high
leakage, together with the discharge of sewage effluents into street drains
with consequent dangers of infiltration, make the water in the distribution
systems of several cities unsafe. Except for the rural systems, treated
water is chlorinated before distribuition although optimum dosages are not
always consistently maintained.
1.15      In a sample of cities with populations over 50,000, only 22% of the
dwellings had flush toilets in 1979; the rest used night soil collection
systems.  Most of the waste water from septic tanks, domestic use and urban
runoff is discharged untreated, into surface waters.  Night soil is fre-
quently used as a fertilizer after composting wilth rice husks in rural
areas. This situation is now being improved. There are vault privies with
night soil collection and treatment facilities in 40 large cities serving a
population of 20.8 million. Master plans for sewerage and sewage treatment
for Seoul and Busan have been prepared and construction started in 1982.
Seoul has existing treatment plants (360,000 cu m1 per day fCMD]) capable of
treating the sewage of one third of its population and would have almost
three times this capacity by 1987. Busan has a plant treating night soil
from about half of its population. Two additional sewage treatment plants
and main sewers are scheduled for construction during 1984-87. In 1981,
there were 104 night soil treatment plants in Korea; a project to construct
another 66 plants, covering 102 small and medium towns (5,000 to 50,000
inhabitants) to treat 60% of the nightsoil is being prepared by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB).
1.16      It is estimated that 42% of water pollution is due to municipal
wastes and night soil, 45% to industrial wastes and 13% to agricultural
runoff. There are about 16,000 industrial plants in the country generating
pollutants, often toxic in nature, which require treatment before disposal.
Important progress in pollution control has been achieved in recent years
with the enactment of the Environmental Preservation Law (December 31, 1977),
its Technical Regulations (July 1, 1978) and the establishment of the OOE in
January 1980.



-5-
Sector Development
1.17      Sector investment (at 1983 prices) increased from $218 million
in the Third Plan, to $530 million in the Fourth Plan (1977-81) and is
forecasted at $1,442 million for the Fifth Plan (1982-86)./1 Government's
policies for the sector in the Fifth Plan include preservation of water
quality, replacement of obsolete equipment and pipelines, investment in
sewerage and sewage treatment and expansion in capacity and coverage of
water supply systems. Budgetary constraints may slow down implementation.
The target for 1986 is to increase the overall percentage of population
served by treated water from 55% to about 70% but in cities with more than
50,000 persons the percentage of population served by treated water would
increase from 83% to 93%. Given the high rate of urban population growth,
maintaining even the present coverage requires substantial investments.
1.18      Environmental pollution abatement is a feature of the Fifth Plan;
the Master Plan for environmental protection of the Han River Basin
(financed by ADB) has identified priority pollution control investments for
the Metropolitan Seoul area. OOE, under Loan 2072-KO (First Water Supply
Project), is undertaking satisfactory measures in the Nagdong River Basin:
(a) a comprehensive Water Management Survey of the Nagdong and the other two
major river basins is being conducted by OOE since 1981 and is scheduled for
completion in 1984; (b) river water quality monitoring stations have been
established, including eight in the Nagdong Basin; and (c) the industrial
complexes of Gumi, Ulsan, and Changweon/Masan and the cities of Daegu,
Gwangju, and Busan will have major sewerage and treatment facilities by
1986. Similar plans are underway for Incheon, Banweol, Yeochan, Daejeon and
Jeongju. Furthermore, OOE will impose pollution charges on industries
violating pollution standards and is establishing an Environmental Fund
which will charge polluting industries and provide low interest loans for
investments in pollution control. Government plans to increase the
percentage of population served by sewage treatment plants from 6% in 1980
to 35% by 1991, and the sewage treatment capacity from 0.5 to 8 million CMD
during the same period. Sewerage investments in the Fifth Plan are estimated
at $1 billion in 1982 prices.
Sector Financing and Tariffs
1.19      The expansion of water production capacity, distribution and
storage facilities and house connections are financed in part by loans which
are budgeted by MOC and provided to the cities through the Korea Development
Bank (KDB). These loans finance 40-70% of the production expansion
components, or some 25% of total investments, and bear commercial interest
/1 Of which $700 million are Central Government and the rest local
government expenditures.

rates (currently 10%), with a repayment period cif 15 years, and grace
periods linked to construction schedules. The balance is financed by foreign
loans, WBs  internal generation (15-35%), local city bonds (20-40%)
currently at 8.5% interest and commercial loans. However, a reliable source
of funds is not available. Since bonds and commercial loans are repayable
within five years (compared with a 40-year useful life of assets and 3-5
year construction period), debt servicing payments are high even with
refinancing. In the rural sector, the provincial government and MOHSA each
finance one third of the investment costs with the remainder being financed
by the villages.
1.20      Tariffs are set by the WBs, with the approval of MORA, and in
general cover the cost of operation, debt service and contribute to capital
investments. The Price Policy Bureau of EPB provides guidelines on maximum
tariff increases which reflect macroeconomic policies. Charges on industries
or cities abstracting water directly from major rivers are collected by ISWACO
to recover the cost of investments un dams and reservoirs. Tariffs for supply
of bulk water for cities or industrial sites are determined by ISWACO with the
approval of MOC and EPB.  At present there are no Government financial
performance targets for either ISWACO or in general for the WBS. Under this
project such targets will be established for the Water and Dam divisions of
ISWACO, and marginal pricing policies for the water available from the
proposed barrage would be implemented (paras. 5.09 and 6.10). Sewerage is
financed from city revenues and loans; separate sewerage tariffs are now being
introduced in the major cities.
Manpower
1.21      There is a lack of basic information ont availability of manpower in
the water sector and on training needs as identified by the Sector Study./l
To overcome this, a Sector Manpower Survey, for which Terms of Reference have
been discussed with MOC, is to be carried out under Loan 2072-KO. Training
programs for the sector will be based on findings of this survey and further
studies envisaged under ADB's Small Towns Water Supply Project. Proposals for
operational training needs of the five cities financed under Loan 2072-KO have
been formulated and are being reviewed. Generally the level of education and
trained skills available in Korea is high, and equipment and facilities are
well maintained and operated. Expertise is lacking in specific special skills
required (high rate filter operation, leak detection, and computer techno-
logy), and training programs are expected to focus on these special needs. In
the sanitation sector a UNDP funded project for development and training of
manpower for environmental pollution control is being implemented by OOE
since 1982.  This project provides support (equipment, curricula
development, foreign training advisors, and overseas training) to the
National Environmental Protection Institute for comprehensive basic and
/I WHO/IBRD Cooperative Program - Republic of Korea; Sector Study on Water
Supply and Sanitation (1981).



sDecial training programs for personnel in central and local government and
industry. These programs will train 4,700 persons in various fields of
environmental pollution control between 1983 and 1985.
Issues and Constraints
1.22      The fragmentation of responsibilities amongst four ministries has
resulted in a lack of coordination in sector planning. Rivalry between the
two principal ministries responsible for the sector, MOC and MORA, at times
causes each to pursue its own priorities without reference to overall sector
objectives. Some of the responsibilities of the sector agencies are highly
complementary, requiring closer coordination and cooperation, (e.g. MOHA
should strengthen the WBs- finances and operation in anticipation of
facilities built by MOC, and approve bonds and tariffs required to finance
investments). Under the First Water Supply Project, agreement was reached
with the Government to establish an Interministerial Committee (IMC). This
Committee has been established under Terms of Reference agreed to by the
various ministries and the Bank. The IMC will study these coordination
problems and make recommendations to delineate more precisely the respective
responsibilities. These studies have been delayed beyond the original
target of June 1983. A sector study was completed by consultants during the
preparation of the recently approved ADB's Small Towns Water Supply Project.
This study, after Bank comments, would be reviewed by the IMC and final
recommendations to improve sector coordination would be completed by
December 31, 1984.
1.23      Korean consultants are technically competent to design most water
supply, distribution and sewerage systems. However, local project prepara-
tion is generally weak in economic and financial analysis. External assis-
tance is still required in these areas and for the design of large dams,
pollution control, treatment plants and optimal design technology. Tech-
nical assistance would be concentrated in these areas.
1.24      While local water facilities are well operated technically, the
WBs financial and management practices require improvement. Deficiencies
include a high level of unaccounted for water, the nonuse of double entry
accounting, manual billing, weak management information systems, and
insufficient staff. The project addresses these problems through two
national components, which would introduce in WBs measures for leakage
detection, and institutional improvements in accounting and financial
management (using microcomputer-based software and hardware). This would
reinforce MOHA's efforts to implement improved financial practices in all
WBs.
1.25      At present Korea does not have a well-developed system for mobil-
izing and allocating resources for the sector. Although water supply
projects require lengthy construction periods and provide service for many
years, the main stable resources available are short-term borrowings and
internal revenues. This results in investment lagging behind demand and
debt service higher than if long-term financing were available. As one



- 8 -
option for providing long-term fundls for the sector, the Bank is discussing
with the Government the establishment of an urban fund to finance, inter
alia, water supply investments.
Bank Objectives and Lending in the Sector
1.26      Bank objectives in the sector are: (a) to promote adequate,
reliable and affordable water and sanitation services; (b) to help
strengthen the institutions and improve coordination within the sector,
particularly in the area of investment planning; and (c) to develop a solid
financial basis for the sector, including improved cost recovery through
better pricing policies and access to long-term resources. In line with
Government's own shifting priorities, the Bank hlas been assisting Korea to
improve the functioning and efficiency of urban areas. A critical urban
service in a densely populated country such as Korea is the provision of
adequate and reliable water for residential and industrial use. Bank
support for all urban services, including water supply, is expected to
improve the quality of life for all Koreans, as well as eliminate this
possihle bottleneck to continued economic growth. The Bank is in close
contact with other international agencies (ADB, OECF and TJNDP) who are
actively working in the sector.
1.27      The Bank has helped finance several projects with sectoral
components: (a) the Chungju Multipurpose Project, approved in 197X, (Loan
1666-KO) where about one third of the benefits are for water supply; (b) the
Rural Infractructure I and II Projects (Loans 1216-KO and 1530-KO) which
financed 11,400 rural piped water supply systems; (c) the Second Regional
Project in Gwangju (Loan 1758-KO) included water supply for provincial
cities and industrial sites; and (d) the Kyongju Tourism Project (Loan
953-KO) included water supply and sewage treatment facilities. The ongoing
projects are being implemented satisfactorily. For Loan 1216-KO OED has
prepared an Audit Report which notes, that almost twice the originally
planned number of village water systems had been satisfactorily implemented
without delay and for Loan 953-KO the Completion Report stated that the
water supply component had been implemented satisfactorily but that slow
growth in tourism had resulted in excess capacity and poorer than anti-
cipated financial performance for the water supply component. The proposed
Jeonju Regional Project (appraised in April 1983) would include water supply
and distribution facilities for Jeonju City. The First Water Supply Project
(Loan 2072-KO), approved in 1982, is expanding the water supply in five
cities (Daegu, Gwangju, Masan, Changweon and Jinhae). The hiring of
consultants for supervision resulted in some initial delays, but the project
is now being executed smoothly, and compliance with covenants is generally
satisfactory. However, reduced Government expenditures in 1983 have
resulted in budget deficiencies in some of the project cities. These
financial shortfalls were discussed with the Bank and at a recent meeting of
the IMC satisfactory financial plans were agreed upon for 1983 and 1984,
including government loans and grants, bonds and additional tariff increases
before end-1983.

II. POPULATION AND WATER DEMAND IN THE NAGDONG RIVER BASIN
Location
2.01      The Nagdong region (32,100 sq km, Map I) covers one third of the
total area (98,900 sq km) of Korea, includes the provinces of Gyeongbuk and
Gyeongnam, and contains one third of the population of the country. The
region produces 30% of the agricultural and 40% of the industrial output.
The bulk of this comes from the Nagdong River Basin (23,600 km sq). This
basin is experiencing intense development, has a population of 8.5 million
and comprises 70 municipalities, including 14 cities in addition to Busan
and Daegu, the second and third largest cities in Korea.
Water Shortage Problem
2.02      The rainy season, in which about two thirds of the rainfall
occurs, (July to September), is capricious and shows large variances from
year to year. The geomorphological features of the basin, which has a high
percentage (76%) of mountainous land with slopes steeper than 20%, promote
quick runoff. Consequently river discharges vary considerably; from 30 cu
m/s or less to more than 10,000 cu m/s. Appropriate places for the
development of storage reservoirs are scarce, since the river widens down-
stream of Andong. The Andong Dam (financed by ADB) has been in operation
since 1976 and is the main water conservation structure in the basin. Two
other dams on tributaries, the Namgang and Yeongcheon Dams, are only
important for flood control and local water conservation.
2.03      The Andong Dam, with a storage capacity of 926 million cu m, is
situated 340 km from the river mouth. It takes about 12 days for water
released from Andong to reach Busan. During the dry cold season (January-
February) and periods of low flow and peak agricultural demand, substantial
portions of the reservoir releases do not reach the delta area. Thirty-seven
municipalities (12 cities and 25 towns) have or are constructing water
supply facilities depending on the Nagdong river or its tributaries. Water
supplies are presently curtailed, and any further water extraction would
only exacerbate the problems of the downstream users during the critical
period of January to June.
2.04      The increasing demand on the river, and the resulting decreased
flow of fresh water in the delta, has resulted in exponentially increasing
salinity of water at the intakes for Busan, Ulsan/Onsan and the Gimhae
agriculture polder area. Korea's water quality standards specify a maximum
salinity for potable water of 150 ppm (as compared with 250 ppm in most
developed countries). However, salinities in excess of 2,000-2,500 ppm have
frequently been reported since 1975 at the Busan intake, forcing Busan and
Ulsan to stop pumping for hundreds of hours (Annex 10, para. 1). Salinity
intrusion even reaches Samrangjin, located 44 km upstream from the river
mouth.



- 10 -
2.05      The Gimhae polder area, the largest: area of flat land in the basin
(15,000 ha), constitutes 30% of the total irrigated paddy area along the
main stream. This fertile land is gradually being damaged due to irrigation
with water with salinity levels well above those registered in Busan.
Release of water from Andong can no longer alleviate this problem. The
situation would worsen dramatically when the new water supply projects under
construction in Busan, Changweon, Jinhae, Daegu, Gumi, Masan, etc., enter
into operation by 1985/86. The proposed barrage at the river mouth is
necessary to reliably ensure saline free water at the main intakes for the
Gimhae polder, Busan and Ulsan/Onsan. This would make available the Andong
water (presently wasted to sea in unsuccessful attempts to prevent salt
water intrusion) to meet increasing water demands of all the cities depen-
dent on river water, particularly Busan, Ulsan/Onsan, and Gumi and the four
cities under the First Water Supply Project (Daegu, Masan, Changweon and
Jinhae). Failure to resolve this problem wilL cause serious damage to the
local and national economy and adversely affect some II million people by
the year 1992.
Population Served and Water Demand
2.06      The 37 municipalities depending on the Nagdong River or its tribu-
taries for water supply are experiencing rapid rates of population growth,
resulting from successful industrialization and rapid urbanization. MOC has
made population forecasts for these municipalities up to the year 2001
(limited to 1991 for some towns). It has also set targets for population
coverage, which averaged 83% in 1981 (varying from 30% to 89%) and is esti-
mated to increase to 93% by 1991 as a result of projects under construction
or scheduled during this period. MOC-s population projections were reviewed
by the Bank (Annex 3, Tables 1 and 2). The main difference between MOC
projections and projections in Annex 3 is for Busan.  MOC forecasts a
population growth of 2.6% p.a. beitween 1981-91 for Busan. However, since
annual data for the last 20 years show a stead;y population growth of 5.3%
p.a., the projections in Annex 3 assume a more gradual decline in the rate
of growth, averaging 4.7% p.a. for that period and 2.6% between 1991-2001.
2.07      The projection of water demand is based on the population and
levels of service explained above and the estimated per capita water pro-
duction.  As a result of the intense industria:Lization in this area (which
has many new industrial cities like Changweon and Gumi), and the rapid
increase in the population-s income (growing at 6.9% p.a. during the last 20
years), the average per capita demLand, including water losses, is assumed to
increase from 225 to 395 lcpd during the next 20 years. This includes high
industrial and commercial demand. The resulting demand (Annex 3) is
generally lower, but of the same order of magnitude as the water demand
estimated in other studies (UNDP FAO 1971; HAPCHEON, 1974; ISWACO, 1974;
NEDECO, 1976; JICA, 1980, and NEDECO, 1983), and confirms the magnitude of
the water requirement in the Nagdong Basin.
2.08      Agricultural water demand is related to the area under rice culti-
vation. The demand projection for agricultural water was made by ISWACO and

the project consultants (NEDECO/1), and assumes that the expansion of culti-
vated area will be very slow and will end before the year 2000. Both analyses
assume that water use for agriculture will increase only some 140 million cu m
per year until 1991. Since its coincidence with the low river flow months is
only during a short period (May to June), this incremental demand has not been
included thus making the overall demand estimates somewhat conservative.
2.09      The total water demand for municipal and industrial use is shown in
Annex 3. The demand until 1986 is suppressed, partly because of insufficient
water treatment and distribution facilities (Graph 2.1, and Annex 3). The
water demand would increase 30% between 1983-816, when projects under construc-
tion financed by the First Water Supply project, as well as similar projects
in Busan and other cities, would be completed. The total water demand in
million cubic meters per day (CMD) is expected to increase from 1.9 in 1981 to
4.1 in 1991 and 6.8 in the year 2001. The main water users are Busan,
Ulsan/Onsan and Daegu, which represent 81% of t:he total municipal and
industrial demand. Busan has already started the construction of additional
facilities for 0.5 million CMD (para. 3.04) ancl is planning to double its
present capacity (from 0.9 to 2 million CMD) by 1990. The incremental water
demand (Graph 2.2) shows that the water made available by the proposed barrage
(about 25 cu m/s) would be fully used within the next eight years, and other
sources of water (Hapcheon Dam) will be needed thereafter.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Origin
3.01      The need for a barrage at the Nagdong River mouth has been recog-
nized since 1966. The project is based on studies undertaken since 1966: the
Nagdong River Basin Preinvestment Study (UNDP/FAO, November 1966-March 1972),
the Nagdong Basin Study (MOC, March 1973), and the Nagdong River Basin
Development Project Feasibility Study (Nippon Koei, 1976). The Nagdong Delta
Study (UNDP/FAO, 1974-1977) identified the estuary barrage as the next most
economical investment project to increase available water resources in the
Nagdong River.  A feasibility study made by NEDECO in 1976 confirmed that the
barrage is the least-cost solution to avoid sal:inity problems and to make
available some 25 of the 40-50 cu m/s of water presently used to repel
salinity and wasted to sea. Detailed design (by NEDECO) was financed under
the Chungju Multipurpose Project (Loan 1666-KO), and carried out during
1980-83. The Interim (1981) and Final (1983) Reports are in the Project file.
The overall design has been reviewed by an Expert Review Panel (ERP) esta-
blished by ISWACO in consultation with the Bank. Agreement has been reached
between the ERP, ISWACO, NEDECO and the Bank on all aspects of design. The
specifications, contract documents and drawings have been modified accord-
ingly. A project identification mission visited Korea in December 1982, the
preappraisal was in February and the appraisal in May 1983. The project is
based on final designs prepared by NEDECO.

Project Objectives
3.02      The objectives of the project are to:
(a)  eliminate problems of water salinity at the water intakes for
Busan, Ulsan/Onsan and the Gimhae agricultural area;
(b)  make available to Busan and another 12 cities (Si) and 24 towns
(Eubs) as well as to industrial zones, about 25 cu m/s (2.2
million CMD) of water presently released from upstream dams to
prevent seawater intrusion into the Nagdong river;
(c)  transfer technology in the area of leak detection and control, and
implement such programs in about 15 cities where unaccounted-for-
water exceeds 30%;
(d)  establish improved accounting and management information systems,
including micro-computer software and hardware, which would be
implemented and tested initially in about 15 WBs, and extended to
other WBs;
(e)  implement sound financial and water pricing policies in ISWACO;
and
(f)  protect the Nagdong's estuarine environment and develop ISWACO's
environmental management expertise.
Project Description
3.03      The proposed project includes three components (Annex 4):
(a)  The Nagdong Barrage.  The barrage is located at the Nagdong River
mouth at Hadandong (Map 2). The site is accessible by road from
Busan, which has good road, rail, air and port facilities. The
510 m long concrete barrage, retaining a 5 m water head in the
reservoir, would control the left branch of the Nagdong River from
Hadandong in Busan to the delta island of Elsukdo and is flanked
on the west by a 1,200 m long dike across Elsukdo and a 700 m long
closure dam across the right river branch. These provide an addi-
tional access from Busan to the west (Gimhae Airport, Masan/Jinhae
coastal road and Seoul/Busan Expressway). The barrage includes
its appurtenant works, the dikes, dredging, the land reclamation
of 190 ha, a discharge sluice, a navigation lock, fish passes, a
four-lane road, and service and operation facilities.  The project
also provides for the systematic monitoring of the estuarine
environment, quantitative and qualitative ecological impact stud-
ies and the preparation and implementation of an environmental
protection program by ISWACO (para. 3.15 and Annex 2); laboratory
equipment for these studies and microcomputer hardware for
environmental and financial management are also included;



- 14 -
(b)  Leak Detection Program.  This program is designed to reduce the
large wastage of water, decrease the associated expenses in
chemicals and energy, and 'Lessen the magnitude of future invest-
ments required to expand water supply capacity. Appropriate
methodologies will be designed and implemented to detect and
correct water leakage in about 15 cities on a pilot basis.
Experience gained will allow replication nationwide. Equipment to
detect leaks will be acquired and the staff of the cities' WBs
will be trained in this technology which is practically new to
Korea; and
(c) Institutional Development FProgram. This program comprises the
acquisition of microcomputer hardware as well as the design,
preparation, testing and dissemination of microcomputer software
for WBs throughout Korea. By developing common programs to handle
billing, general accounting, payroll, inventory management and
other functions, this component would assist in strengthening the
accounting, financial and managerial capabilities of WBs.
Initially the system will be designed for and tested in about 15
cities but would be extended later to all WBs in Korea.
Complementary Works
3.04      Busan is the largest port and the second largest city in Korea,
with a population of 3.4 million. Busan has plans to use about half the
water made available by the barrage, 'be relieved of water rationing and
salinity problems, and have improved road access to the west, as well as 190
ha of reclaimed land for industrial and residential use. During the next
few years, Busan will carry out a major water and nsewerage works expansion
program to be partly financed by the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund (OECF) and commercial loans. Busan has started implementing a 500,000
CMD extension to its water supply and distribution system. This program
includes new intake and raw water pumping mains, a treatment plant, main
transmission and booster pumping stations, secondary distribution and
leakage control programs and would increase the percentage of population
connected to water supply from 90% to 95% during this period. Busan is also
planning to construct the Jang Lim Sewerage scheme comprising main inter-
ceptor sewer and lift stations.  These sewerage works are necessary to
divert industrial and domestic wastes, particularly from the Sasang
industrial area (presently being discharged untreat:ed into the river), to
downstream of the barrage. This will remove any danger of pollution
affecting the water supply intakes after barrage construction. Busan is
also planning to carry out minor modifications necessary to existing storm
water pumping stations serving the diked areas adjaLcent to the barrage.
Busan's complementary works were reviewed by the Bank. The total cost is
$130 million and the financing plan, including $25 million OECF financing
for water supply, is satisfactory (Annex 12). These works are an important
complement for the timely achievement of project objectives and would be
implemented by Busan City Water and Construction

Bureaus supported by local consultants. Assurances were obtained from
Government that these works will be completed by December 31, 1987. A
detailed description of these water and sewerage works is included in Annex
12. Water supply expansion works are being built satisfactorily by other
main cities (Daegu, Ulsan/Onsan, Masan, Changweon, etc.), and are planned by
MOC for the smaller towns.
Construction Schedule
3.05      The project will be implemented between October 1983-June 1988.
The project is in an advanced stage of preparation, and bids were received
from prequalified contractors in accordance with Bank guidelines. Construc-
tion, supply and installation of all works for the barrage were included in a
single contract. This is expected to improve coordination and reduce the
execution time. It was also necessary because of' the limited working space
available within the dewatered building pit and the interdependent nature of
design of the various components. River diversion is not a problem since
the closure dam is scheduled for construction onLy after barrage completion.
Advantage will be taken of the 1983/84 dry season to construct the main
coffer dams for the building pit and. the 1987/88 dry season for the closure
dam. The two national components are scheduled f'or execution during
1984-86. Chart 3 shows the project construction schedule.
Project Cost
3.06      The total cost of the project, including physical and price con-
tingencies, is estimated at US$174.9 million, of which $78.3 million or
about 45% would be the foreign exchange component (Table 3.1). Taxes and
duties are estimated at US$8 million equivalent. A cost summary for the
Nagdong Barrage component is shown in Table 3.2 and detailed estimates in
Annex 5. The total financing needed, including interest during construction
and the front-end fee, is $195.7 milLion./1
3.07      Cost estimates are based on detailed engineering and the contract
award. The base costs are expressed in September 1983 prices. Physical
contingencies have been estimated at 17%. Price contingencies for foreign
costs were estimated at 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% p.a.
thereafter. Local price contingencies assume that domestic inflation would
be 5% in 1983 and thereafter would be equal to the increase in foreign
costs. Price increases over the project period are equal to $22.7 million
or 15% of base cost plus physical contingencies. The consultant
/1 ISWACO's practice is to capitalize the interest during construction.
This has been calculated on the basis of the Bank loan, plus one
short-term loan (four year terms, 10% interest:) of W 8.4 billion from
commercial banks.

cost for the supervision of the barrage and environmental management support
to ISWACO is estimated at $5 million, and consultant cost for leak detection
and institutional development is estimated at $4.3 million. The average
man-month cost (including salary, fees, international travel and sub-
sistence) is $10,500, the average local and expatriate man-month costs are
$6,000 (320 man-months) and $13,500 (550 man-months), respectively.
3.08      About 750 families living in the barrage area would be required to
relocate, and 310 ha of low lying agricultural land would be acquired by
ISWACO. In addition, fishermen will be compensated for damages during the
construction period. The total cost of land and other forms of compensation
are estimated at US$20 million in L983 prices. Payments for land would
average US$25,000/ha for rice land and US$16,000/ha for cultivated upland.
All families, rural and urban, wou:Ld receive removal and subsistence pay-
ments. The Government's policy is to promptly pay fair prices for land and
property, compensation, removal expenses and sulbsistence during relocation.
Land acquisition, relocation and compensation plans are being undertaken
satisfactorily by a joint committee representing Busan City, MOC and ISWACO.
ISWACO and the Government have satisfactorily executed many similar
programs. Agreement has been reached with the Government that the
compensation and relocation programs would be periodically reviewed by the
Bank and the Government.
Financing Plan
3.09      Details  of the Nagdong barrage financing plan, and annual Govern-
ment contributions are shown in Table 3.3. The overall project financing
plan is shown in Table 3.4. The proposed Bank loan of $78.5 million,
including the capitalized front-end fee of $0.2 million, would finance the
foreign exchange component of the project (47% of total project costs
excluding taxes), or about 40.1% of the gross ccst of $195.7 million,
including interest during construction ($20.8 million). Interest during
construction is based on the Bank's loan interest and front-end fee, and a
short-term commercial loan of W 8.4 million at 10% interest, repayable
before project completion. ISWACO would contribute $26.7 million (13.6% of
gross cost), government equity $40.0 million (20.5%), and cities' internal
generation $3.7 nllion (1.9%). Part of the land reclaimed during 1984/85
would be sold by ISTAA.) between 1986-88 to finance $46.8 million or 23.9% of
the gross cost of the pro-*ecu_ The financing plan was reviewed during loan
negotiations, and government contributions of W 31 billion during the period
1984-86 were confirmed, including W 14 billion in 1984. Given the long time
required to build the project and sitart collecting revenues, ISWACO
requested a longer grace period (4.5 rather than 3 years) and shorter
maturity (12 years rather than 15) ior the proposed Bank loan. These terms
are recommended. The Government would relend the Bank loan to ISWACO and to
the project cities through MOHA (para. 4.01).

Project Implementation
3.10      ISWACO will be responsible for the implementation of the barrage
component. Responsibility for engineering and procurement would rest with
ISWACO headquarters at Daejeon, while construction supervision would be
under a project office to be set up by ISWACO at Busan (para. 3.12).
ISWACO's Director of Water Resources would serve as Project Director report-
ing directly to the President of ISWACO. ISWACO staff would be responsible
for the project management with the support of engineering consultants. The
staff assigned to the project would be organized in three construction
supervision units, one quality control, one administrative, land acquisition
and compensation and one environmental management unit. MOHA's Local
Finance Division and the beneficiary cities (Annex 4) will implement the
national programs for leak detection and institutional development. MOHA
will hire consultants, individuals as well as joint ventures between local
and foreign consultants, to design, prepare and implement detailed work
programs and work with city WBs to train their staff. The consultants will
also assist MOHA in monitoring progress and evaluating results.
Responsibility for procurement of equipment and hiring of consultants would
rest with MOHA's Local Finance Division. Detailed implementation plans are
described in Annex 4.
Consulting Services
3.11      Consulting services for detailed engineering were financed from
Loan 1666-KO (Chungju Multipurpose Project). The supervision of construc-
tion and environmental management would be financed under the project.
About 350 man-months of foreign assistance would be needed. Engineering
consultants (NEDECO), whose terms and conditions of employment by ISWACO are
satisfactory, are assisting in the preparation of contract documents,



- 20 -
prequalification of bidders and the evaluation of bids and the contract
award. NEDECO has also been hired for: (a) supervision of civil works
construction, inspection of equipment fabrication, and supervision of equip-
ment installation and performance tests; (b) review and certification of
contract payments; (c) assistance in establishing and managing an environ-
mental management unit; (d) preparation of monthly and annual progress
reports; and (e) assistance in the initial operation of the project and in
establishing operation and maintenance procedures. About 200 man-months of
foreign consultants, and about 320 man-months of local consultants, would be
needed for the leak detection and institutional improvement programs. These
consultants will be hired by MOHA in accordance with Bank guidelines.
3.12      ISWACO will assign staff to work closely with the consultants in
all aspects of project implementation, and will provide the majority of the
supervision field staff. ISWACO's proposal to establish a project construc-
tion office at Busan with a staff of 90 (already on ISWACO's payroll) is
satisfactory.  The Expert Review Panel will be convened as necessary during
execution to advise management on any special technical problems
encountered.  Other specialists may be hired if necessary.  The panel will
meet again soon after commencement of work.
Environmental Impact
3.13      The Nagdong estuary is a wintering and stopping place for migra-
tory birds from the Arctic region during the winter months. The estuarine
ecosystem of the area is characterized by tidal iflats and wetlands protected
by a string of barrier islands at the estuary mouth, and is fed by nutrients
brought down by the Nagdong River. The salinity gradient in the estuary
provides a good medium for biological activity. The favorable geographical
and biological characteristics provide the migratory birds with the habitat
and food supply they require during the winter months. The main areas of
the estuarine habitat have been declared a National Monument by the
Government, and hunting is strictly prohibited (see Annex 2).
3.14      During the design stage of this project, it was well recognized
that adverse effects on the environment had to be! minimized and the bird
habitat preserved. Extensive environmental impact studies were carried out
by NEDECO and, as a result, the land reclamation component was reduced from
600 ha to only 190 ha, bordering the Busan City developed area, and the
three originally proposed design alternatives were abandoned. The revised
design includes underflow and overflow gates in the barrage and a discharge
sluice in the closure dam. This enables water circulation even at low flows
and permits the discharge of adequate volumes of nutrient-rich water into
the estuary. Fish passes in the wing walls were also added. Construction
operations, particularly dredging operations, would be carefully controlled,
with borrow and disposal areas selected to minimize adverse effects on the
estuary. An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), was prepared by ISWACO
and approved by the OOE (Annex 2, Attachment 1) contingent upon ISWACO
establishing an Environmental Management Unit (EMU) to survey and monitor
the bird habitat, (in cooperation with established environmental groups and



- 21 -
universities) and taking countermeasures to minimize adverse effects during
and after construction. OOE will monitor results through quarterly progress
reports. A further EIA is to be prepared for the use of the 190 ha
reclaimed land. A Bank consultant reviewed the environmental impact of the
project on the bird habitat. The consultant agreed with the OOE conditions
and recommended that ISWACO establish an environmental management capability
and ROK give additional protection to the estuary to prevent remaining
wetlands from being further developed.
3.15      Measures required to protect the environment have been discussed
with ISWACO, who agreed to establish and maintain the EMU satisfactorily.
The EMU has already been established, including expatriate environmental
experts supported by ISWACO's staff. ISWACO also agreed to establish an
Environmental Management Section at ISWACO Headquarters to advise on
environmental issues. This section, under the Director of Planning, would
eventually supervise EMU and provide ISWACO the capacity to integrate
environmental concerns in the construction of future projects. Quite apart
from the environmental considerations arising from the construction of the
Barrage, a major threat to the bird life is the population pressure to
reclaim additional land from the sea. The present status of the area as a
National Monument has not prevented this reclamation in the past. Under the
project further protection under existing laws would be given to defined areas
of wetland. This would limit further fishing and agricultural development,
curtailing land reclamation in critical areas of the estuary. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that:
(a) Environmental actions recommended by OOE would be implemented
by ISWACO (Annex 2, Attachment 1);
(b) EMU would monitor the estuarine environment and enforce
conditions for its protection during construction;
(c) EMU would prepare a study by December 31, 1984, under TOR accept-
able to OOE and the Bank, of the intertidal areas which should be
fully protected. Based on this study, as reviewed by OOE and the
Bank, MOC would establish not later than June 30, 1985, a zone in
the estuary a "Natural Environment Preservation Area" under the
National Land Use and Management Law of December 31, 1982,/I and
OOE would designate, not later than December 31, 1985, within this
zone of the estuary a "Natural Ecological System Preservation
Area" under Article 9, para. 3, of the Environmental Preservation
Law of December 31, 1981. The proposed zone would be inside the
boundaries of National Monument #179; and
(d) an Environmental Management Section would be established by ISWACO
at headquarters not later than December 31, 1984.
/1 This is an intermediary legal step required before establishing a
"Natural Ecological System Preservation Area."

Operation and Maintenance
3.16       ISWACO has considerable experience in the operation and
maintenance of multipurpose dams. Key personnel of ISWACO from existing
projects will be employed in the inspection, installation and performance
testing of equipment in order to become thoroughly familiar with the
equipment and its operation.  The main contract also provides for on-the-job
and overseas training of key ISWACO staff. The principles of barrage
operation have been established in sufficient detail for project formulation
and assessment of project benefits. However, further studies are needed to
specify more detailed operating rules and to minimize any unfavorable
ecological impacts from the barrage. The proposed barrage, although a
relatively large structure, has a low (5 m) head and small storage volume
and would not cause severe damage in the unlikely event of failure.
Assurances were obtained from ISWACO that a suitable maintenance and
inspection program for the barrage would be available for Bank review not
later than December 31, 1986. ISWACO's proposal should include a
description and schedule of the maintenance and inspection program.
Procurement and Disbursements
3.17      All civil works and equipment for the barrage, estimated at $81
million in 1983 dollars, have been procured through international competi-
tive bidding (ICB) following Bank guidelines. Procurement of all supplies
and construction for the barrage and appurtenant works were under one con-
tract to ensure proper integration oi- the different project components and
the earliest completion of the project. Technical specifications and the
bidding documents were reviewed by the Bank. Advance contracting has been
included, given the urgency to start the construction in October at the
start of the 1983 dry season, to avoid a year's delay in project completion.
Six joint ventures and four local contractors presented bids on August 10,
1983. The contract was awarded on September 10, 1983 with Bank concurrence.
The Bank has made it clear that advance contracting was undertaken at govern-
ment risk and Bank financing of the project was contingent on the Board's
approval of this project. Advance contracting reduced the estimated project
cost and foreign component since actual bids were 36% lower than engineers
estimates.  This is mainly the result of Korea's highly competitive construc-
tion industry and some alternative technical solutions proposed by the
bidders. The leak detection equipment would also be procured following ICB
procedures. Microcomputer hardware up to $400,000 in aggregate would be
procured through prudent international shopping. All bidding packages over
$100,000 equivalent would be subject to the Bank's prior review of procure-
ment documents. Consultants for the project's supervision have alredy been
hired, and consultants for the two national programs would also be hired
following Bank guidelines.
3.18       The proceeds of the loan wculd be disbursed against:  (a) 55% of
the works contract for the barrage (which includes civil works and equip-
ment); (b) 100% of local expenditures (ex factory cost) and 100% of the
foreign expenditures for computer hardware and software, and equipment for
leak detection and for monitoring the environment; (c) 100% of the initial
mobilization payment for the Nagdong Barrage; and (d) 100% of the cost of
consulting services.  Retroactive financing has been included for the



- 23 -
engineering and environmental consultants, which are required to start
working before the start of project construction. Retroactive financing is
limited to consultant expenditures after October 1, 1983, totalling not
more than 0.5 million (0.6% of the proposed loan amount).
3.19      Given the advanced stage of project preparation and contracting
and the satisfactory implementation of projects in the sector, disbursement
of the proposed loan is expected to take five years (1984-88), somewhat
faster than the average time indicated by the disbursement profile for the
country. The project Closing Date would be June 30, 1989. The
estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 6.
IV. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCIES
The Borrower
4.01      The borrower will be the Government, which will relend $73.5 mil-
lion to ISWACO. Signing of this subsidiary loan agreement would be a
condition of loan effectiveness. A Project Agreement will be executed with
ISWACO covering the Nagdong Barrage component. The Government will relend
the balance of the loan ($5.0 million) through MOHA to the project cities
for leak detection and institutional development. Relending terms and
conditions would be the same as the Bank loan plus a 0.05% p.a. handling
charge. The foreign exchange risk would be borne by ISWACO and the cities
benefitting from the project.
Implementing Agencies
4.02      ISWACO would be the main executing agency for the Nagdong Barrage,
and MOHA for the two national components. ISWACO is the borrower for Loan
1666-KO (Chungju Multipurpose Dam). This project is being executed
satisfactorily and would be completed on schedule (December 1985). ISWACO
was established on February 1, 1974, pursuant to the law for the promotion
of industrial sites and water resources development, and undertakes
development of: (a) industrial sites and special areas; (b) water resources
for irrigation, flood control, power generation, industrial and municipal
water supply; and (c) operates and maintains multipurpose dams and
facilities to provide bulk water for industrial and municipal consumption.
ISWACO succeeded the Korea Water Resources Development Corporation,
established on November 1, 1967. ISWACO has planned and constructed and has
completed or is about to complete five industrial estates or new cities
(Ulsan/Onsan, Changweon, Yeocheon, Daeduk and Gumi), three shipyards, and
five multipurpose dams (Soyang, Daecheong, Andong, Seomjingang and Namgang).
Three industrial estates, one new town (Banweol) and one multipurpose dam
(Chungju) are presently under construction. In addition to the Nagdong
Estuary Barrage and the Hapcheon Dam, six other dams are expected to be
built within the next 10 years. ISWACO also operates eight regional water
supply systems (Seoul Metropolitan area, Ulsan, Pohang, Majin, Yeocheon,
Daedug, Geoje and Gumi, Annex 11).



- 24 -
4.03      ISWACO is managed by a Board of Directors (Chart 2) consisting of
a President, one Vice President and five Directors (Planning,
Administration, Industrial Sites, Water Resources and Public Utilities),
appointed for three-year periods, and one Auditor, appointed for a two-year
period. ISWACO's President is appointed by the President of Korea. The
Vice-President and Directors are appointed by the Minister of Construction.
ISWACO has developed into a large and competent organization with 16
departments, 17 local offices and 1,214 employees of which 530 are in
Daejeon headquarters and 684 in local offices. Many of ISWACO's 500
engineers have been trained abroad and, working together with foreign
consultants, have acquired considerable experience in the design,
construction, operation and maintenance of many large projects. Any loans
applied for by ISWACO have to be approved by MOC.
4.04      ISWACO's chief sources of funds are periodic capital subscriptions
by the Government, loans from KDB, Eoreign loans and revenues from its
operations. Industrial sites together with related loan obligations are
sold to users at cost.
4.05      ISWACO's operation is efficient, with administrative expenses
representing 5% of the cost of the ][ndustrial Sites, Dams and Water
Divisions. Bulk water is measured at pumping stations and users' intakes.
Reported unaccounted-for water is less than 5%. Meters are calibrated often
and there are meter shops at different locations.
4.06      ISWACO's financial operations are in three main activities:
industrial sites, dams and water supply. These operations are conducted
independently with separate accounts. General ledger and payroll are com-
puterized. ISWACO's basic data and accounting policies are satisfactory and
follow the "Accounting Regulations for Government-invested Corporations".
Financial results are produced in a timely manner, and detailed management
reports summarize financial results and the status of projects. ISWACO's
financial results are submitted to MOC and audited by its internal auditor
and the National Inspection Board. Since ISWACO has loans from several
international agencies (ADB, OECF and the Bank) its financial statements are
also audited by an independent auditor, a large and respected Korean firm.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that: ISWACO's financial
statements would continue to be independently audited, and that a copy of
the auditor's report would be sent to the Bank within six months after the
end of each fiscal year. ISWACO has insurance against fire, as well as for
vehicles, and is self-insured against other risks.
4.07      MOHA's Local Finance Division (LFD) will coordinate the design and
implementation of the leak detection and institutional development programs
and be responsible for hiring consultants and supervising the technical
assistance and training provided to the cities. LFD, under an ADB sector
loan, has strengthened its financial and technical capacity by hiring
engineers and financial analysts to assist the WBs in the execution of



- 25 -
foreign-financed projects. In addition, the LFD would coordinate and
provide support for the Busan City water and sewerage components which would
be implemented, respectively, by the Water and Construction Bureaus of the
city, with support from local consultants. Assurances were obtained during
loan negoLiat-ons that within six months of the end of each fiscal year MOHA
will submit a summary of these project component cost accounts, as audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
ISWACO - Financial Performance
5.01      ISWACO is a corporation owned by the Government (95%) and the
Korea Development Bank (5%). Its authorized capital is W 500 billion, of
which W 280 billion ($370 million) was paid in as of December 31, 1982.
ISWACO has been growing rapidly and its fixed assets increased 3.7 times in
the last four years. ISWACO's main sources of funds have been Government
equity contributions, loans from KDB, foreign loans and internal cash
generation.
5.02      ISWACO's financial performance between 1978-82 has been generally
satisfactory with a debt/(debt plus equity) ratio of 54% and a current ratio
of 1.4. However, ISWACO's net income has only been 2% of its equity and its
operating ratio was almost 100% due to the effect of the industrial sites
division (para. 5.04). ISWACO's financial statements are shown in Annex 9,
and a summary is presented in Table 5.1. ISWACO's corporate planning has
been hindered by the lack of clear Government policies for its rates and
tariffs. Under the project, financial targets for ISWACO's Water and Dams
Divisions would be implemented (para. 5.09).
5.03      Until 1981 ISWACO was exempted from income and defense taxes, now
charged at a rate of about 11% of net income. ISWACO's fixed assets and
depreciation have not been revalued since 1977; depreciation is therefore
underestimated and income overestimated. The Korea Assets Revaluation Law
allows the revaluation of fixed assets when their estimated value exceeds
25% of the book value. Assets revaluation is detailed and requires the
approval of Government auditors. ISWACO's fixed assets should be revalued
to adequately gauge its financial performance, including rates and tariffs
for services, and to avoid overpayment of taxes. Assurances were obtained
during loan negotiations that the fixed assets of the Water and Dams
Divisions will be reassessed not later than December 31, 1984, and that for
purposes of rate analysis the value of fixed assets of these Divisions will
be updated annually until the next formal revaluation, using 85% of the
annual increase of the wholesale price index. This index is a good
indicator for the cost of capital goods and 85% of this index would provide
a conservative proxy of ISWACO's fixed assets until the following formal
revaluation. ISWACO's revenues and expenses from its different divisions
are sunmiarized in Table 5.2.

/a Including depreciation.
Industrial Sites
5.04      ISWACO's activities before 1974 were only in the water sector, but
its main activity during subsequent years has been the construction of
industrial sites and new towns. With the completion of many of these proj-
ects, ISWACO's revenues and expenses from these activities are declining and
explain the decrease of revenues from W 151 billion in 1979 to W 73 billion
in 1982, with a corresponding reduction of expenses from W 150 to W 67.7 bil-
lion during this period. Industrial sites and new towns are financed by
Government equity contributions and long-term loans from KDB. After
construction these industrial sites, together with related loan obligations,
are sold at cost. Therefore the net income and cash generation now depend
on other ISWACO activities, namely those of the Dams and Water Supply
Divisions. The appraisal's financial analysis is centered on these
divisions.
Water Division
5.05      MOC finances all production and transmission systems for bulk and
treated water supplies to more than one city (regional systems); these
systems and those built by ISWACO are operated by the Water Division. This
division also provides treated water to several industrial zones and some
adjacent cities. Ninety-seven percent of its revenue is from the sale of
raw water while treated water provides the remaining 3%. Presently ISWACO
provides water to eight regional systems including Seoul. MOC is



- 28 -
preparing feasibility studies for three other regional systems for some 50
cities and towns, including a Third Stage Project for the Seoul Metropolitan
area. This $300 million project is included in the financial projections
for this division (Annex 8) and would be constructed between 1985-88.
ISWACO's raw water sales are expected to increase from 900 to 1,300 million
cu m per year between 1982-88. During the 1982 drought, ISWACO's sales of
hydro-generated power were reduced from 988 tco 614 GWH resulting in a
deficit of W 1,660 million in the Dams Division (Table 5.2). This contrasts
with the results of the Water Division, which increased its total water sold
between 1981 and 1982 from 658 to 920 million cu m (40%) and increased its
revenues by 65%, compensating for the poor performance of the power
operations.
Bulk Water Tariffs.
5.06      ISWACO's tariffs for raw and treated water are satisfactory and
include fixed charges for the basic contracted water capacity, metered
charges varying with the volume used and surcharges for volumes used in
excess of the contracted supply. ISWACO's water tariffs were increased 100%
in the Seoul Metropolitan area between 1980/81. Slightly lower increases
were approved for other areas to equalize prices for all cities in Korea
(this cross subsidizes the smaller cities.) The present tariff was approved
on December 21, 1981 as follows:
ISWACO'S WATER TARIFF (W/cu m)
Basic         Metered                         Excess
consumption   consumption                      over basic

Future Financial Performance of the Water Division.
5.07      Power expenses represent 68% of the t:otal expenses of the Water
Division. These expenses are expected to increase less than proportionally
with the volume of water produced, because the main charge (for installed
capacity) would remain constant until the completion of the Third Metro-
politan Stage project. Other expenses are also expected to remain practi-
cally constant (in real prices) until the Third Metropolitan Stage project
enters into operation. Large capital expenditures on this project would
result in a marginal cost of W 80/cu m, compared with a present tariff of
W 30/cu m. General expenses would increase less than proportionally because
of economies of scale. Under the proposed covenant (para. 5.09), the Water



- 29 -
Division would have to increase its water charges by 31% in real terms
between 1983-89. The Water Division would have a satisfactory financial
position (Annex 8) with a working ratio of about 66%, debt service coverage
ratios between 1.8 and 10 times, and a capitalization ratio of 11-19%.
Excess cash generated by this division, accumulating to W 23 billion by
1987, would contribute to financing the large dams investment programs.
Financial highlights for this division are shown in Table 5.3.

Dams Division
5.08      The Dams Division operates three Multipurpose Dams (Andong, Soyang
and Daecheong). Fixed assets incorporated by ISWACO include only water
supply, power and 30% of the cost allocated to agriculture. The cost
allocated to flood control and 70% of the cost allocated to agriculture are
not included in the fixed assets, but recovered by general taxes. The
respective operational expenses for these services are subsidized by the
power and water revenues. The Dams Division's revenues are:
(a) sales of bulk energy to the Korea Electric Power Company (KEPCO),
which represent 85% of this division's revenues. ISWACO's power
generation capacity would increase 135% in 1986 upon completion of
the Chungju Dam;
(b) water charges to cities and industries using water from rivers
regulated by ISWACO. The volume of water billed (including the
Nagdong barrage water) is expected to more than double by 1988
(from 1,100 to 2,500 million cu m); and
(c) charges for irrigation; present billing of only 87 ha to be
increased to 25,000 ha by 1988 (due to billing of present users
and additional areas irrigated by new dams entering into opera-
tion).



- 30 -
Tariffs and Other Charges
5.09      Charges and tariffs for services of the Dams Division are low,
resulting in a negative 0.3% rate of return on revalued assets in 1982. This
reflects the difficulties in setting tariffs for powerful clients (KEPCO,
the cities, agricultural users).  Under the Chungju Multipurpose Project,
ISWACO agreed to discuss with the Bank and impLement by December 31, 1983,
satisfactory tariffs for power./l An overall financial performance target
for all services under the Water and Dams Divisions is needed. The revenues
of these Divisions should cover operation, maintenance and debt service and
provide a reasonable contribution to future investments.  Lack of agreed
financial targets is a major shortcoming for ISWACO since its projects
require a long construction period (up to seven years); but there are no
criteria to set ISWACO's revenues and financial contributions during this
period. Government agreement on setting a minimum financial performance
target is an important institutional improvement. This objective would be
achieved with a rate of return of 4-5% on revalued fixed assets in
operation.  This would provide a net internal cash generation of about 19%
which is satisfactory considering ISWACO½s huge investments (para. 5.11).
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that ISWACO's tariffs and
charges in the Water and Dams Divisions will be adjusted annually as needed
to achieve a rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in operation not
lower than 4% in 1984 and 1985 and 5% thereafter.
5.10      ISWACO's charges are proportional to the cost of each system.
Power charges are W 9.5/kWh in Soyang, W 23.8/kWh in Daechoeng, and W 26.7/
kWh in Andong. Under the proposed rate of return power charges would double
in real terms between 1982-86 (from W 13.9) to 29.l/kWh)./2 Water charges are
W 1.3/cu m in Soyang, W 2.7/cu m irn Andong and are specially contracted in
Daecheong. Water made available by the barrage is expected to be charged at
about W 7/cu m. The total average water tariff would increase 74% in real
terms (from W 1.9/cu m to W 3.3/cu m in 1983 prices).  These tariff
increases are large but are considered feasible,, and are needed to provide
ISWACO with resources to participate in financirng a large investment program
of $1,090 million between 1983-88, including the Chungju Dam ($480 million),
the Nagdong Barrage ($167 million), and the Hapcheon Dam ($240 million).
Another six dams (Annex 1) are in different stages of feasibility analysis,
and some of them would be built during the next ten years.
/l  In discussions with Bank staff in June 1983, ISWACO informed them that a
Korean firm had been engaged to undertake the cost allocation study
necessary to establish an apropriate tariff for the electricity to be
sold from Chungju Dam, now expected to commence commercial operation in
mid-1985. The proposed tariff is likely to be available for Bank review
by end-October rather than June 30, 1983 as originally agreed.
/2  ISWACO-s power tariffs are negotiated with KEPCO and if necessary set by
MOC in consultation with EPB. ISWACO expects to increase its average
power tariff from W 13.8/kWh to W 18.4/kWh in 1983 retroactively to
January 1, 1983.

Future Financial Performance of the Dams Division
5.11      Under the proposed revenue covenant (para. 5.09), the financial
position of the Dams Division would be satisfactory (Annex 7): its
operating expenses would represent less than 20% of its revenues, its debt
service ratio would exceed 1.4, and its debt/(debt plus equity) ratio would
be below 26%. ISWACO's overall financing plan for its Dams Division is
shown in Annex 7, Table 5. The total investment between 1983-88 is W 850
billion ($1,090 million). The Bank, through Loan 1666-KO and the proposed
project would finance 11.3% ($124 million), OECF 10.4%, other loans 1.9%,
government equity contributions 57.6% and ISWACO internal generation 18.8%.
Additional dam investments and their financing could affect ISWACO's
financial position. Assurances were obtained during loan negotiations that
ISWACO would not incur any additional long-term debt without prior Bank
concurrence, unless its debt service coverage exceeds 1.3 in any calendar
year. Financial highlights for the Dams Division are shown in Table 5.4.

Reporting Requirements - Monitoring Indicators
5.12      In order to permit the satisfactory monitoring of the investment
program and financing plans, assurances were obtained that:
(a)  ISWACO would send to the Bank five-year financial projections for
the Water and Dams Divisions before August 31 of each year. The
projections would include an income statement, statement of cash
flow, balance sheet with details of water and power demand,
total investments and financing resources;



- 32-
(b)  ISWACO would establish, not later than March 31, 1984, a system
of monitoring indicators and targets satisfactory to the Bank
(Annexes 7 and 8), and send to the Bank not later than August 31
and February 28 of each year semiannual information on these
indicators, the compliance with loan covenants and the analysis
of project execution and cost; and
(c)  ISWACO and MOHA would prepare a project completion report
satisfactory to the Bank, not later than six months after the
loan closing date.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
6.01      The proposed project meet:s urgent needs to make more water
available for 37 cities and towns :in the Nagdong River Basin, including
Busan and Daegu (the second and thiLrd largest cities in Korea), and
Ulsan/Onsan (an important industrial city). The Nagdong River Basin has 30%
of the country's population and generates 40% of its industrial production.
Korea's monsoon weather results in three months of intense rain followed by
a long dry period. Variable weather conditions exacerbate this problem and
subject most cities to water shortages, especially in the lower reaches of
the river. Salinity intrusion that reaches up to 44 km upstream of the
river mouth is a major problem. To try to maintain a salinity level below
an acceptable standard for drinking water (300 ppm), a minimum river flow of
40-50 cu m/s is being wasted to sea. This flow, plus variable conveyance
losses, has to be supplied from the Andong Dam 370 km upstream. The
construction of the Nagdong Barrage would eliminate the problems of salinity
for Busan, Ulsan/Onsan and the large Gimhae agricultural polder, and would
allow the use of about 25 cu m/s of this water by these and the other cities
in the Nagdong basin.
6.02      Major institutional improvements are also included:  (a) under the
project, agreements have been reached with the Government to set financial
targets for ISWACO's Water and Dams Divisions and to implement marginal cost
pricing for the water made available by the barrage; (b) long-term institu-
tional and environmental objectives would be achieved by the establishment
in ISWACO of an Environmental Management Section which should develop exper-
tise to reconcile the construction of future projects with environmental
concerns; and (c) the two national components, the leak detection and insti-
tutional development programs, would transfer appropriate technology in leak
detection and control (saving capital and operating expenditures in water
supply), and in accounting and finance, (improving accounting, financial
management and operations of the WBs). The development of common micro-
computer software for basic accounting and management needs would correct
present accounting deficiencies, ancd avoid a dupLication of effort and
resources resulting from each city t:rying individually to develop, with
limited financial and human resources, the same programs. These two



- 33 -
national components are expected to have a large multiplier effect and
eventually improve the operation, management and financial administration of
the WBs in Korea.
Least Cost Solution
6.03      The Nagdong Barrage was identified in many studies (UNDP/FAO-1972,
FAO/NEDECO-1976, NEDECO-1981, NEDECO-1983) as the least-cost solution to
prevent salinity intrusion and provide additional water. Other more costly
alternatives include upstream storage dams, reservoirs in the cities and
relocating water intakes turther upstream. Furthermore, recent salinity
data show that the water supply intakes for the downstream cities (Busan,
Ulsan/Onsan) would experience unacceptably high salinity levels even if high
river flows (in excess of 60 cu m/s) could be maintained. Upstream storage
dams would not be able to reliably provide these flows, and it would be a
wasteful use of scarce water.
The Nagdong Barrage Benetits
6.04      Municipal and Industrial Water.  Water works expansions are under
construction in the main cities in the basin (including Busan, Masan,
Changweon, Jinhae, Daegu, etc.). Under present demand conditions, the
pumping of water has to be stopped for hundreds of hours in the cities of
Busan and Ulsan. These two cities represent half of the population and 60%
of the municipal and industrial water demand on the river (Annex 3). The
river flow available for salinity repulsion under present dry weather
conditions is about 40 cu m/s. After the barrage is operational, a flow of
15 cu m/s would be maintained to allow tor dilution, navigation, tisheries
and to provide nutrients to the estuary area. The remaining 25 cu m/s
(enough to supply water to 10 million persons at 200 lpcd) would be
available to the cities and to agricultural users (para. 6.05). The
benefits of this component were estimated at the value of constructing the
least-cost alternative (upstream relocation of the water intake) that would
provide water within tolerable salinity levels. Further details are
provided in Annex 10.
6.05      Agriculture.  The Gimhae polder area is the largest single
irrigated area (15,000 ha) and one of the most productive agricultural zones
in Korea. Salinity intrusion forced the abandonment of the original water
intake at Daedong. The present intake, Weolcheon, sited Z km upstream ot
Daedong but r km below the Busan intake, has experienced salinities over
2,000 ppm, which would result in gradual deterioration of crop yields. In
fact, NEDECO's computer simulations forecasted that critical agricultural
salinity levels (1,200 ppm) would be reached at the agricultural intake one
to two years earlier than at the municipal intake. Under the project, the
Gimhae polder would be partially surrounded by tresh water and the Daedong
intake would be used again and would provide water by gravity. The
availability of fresh water makes drainage (not included in the project)
technically and economically feasible. This would result in an
intensification of agriculture and a higher crop yield in the polder area.
Irrigation upstream of the Gimhae Polder is expected to increase slowly and
has not been included in the project benefits.



- 34 -
6.06      Land Reclamation.  Dredging associated with the project produces
sand useful for land reclamation and allows the reclamation of 190 ha within
the municipal boundaries of Busan. This prime land, adjacent to fully
urbanized areas with all public services and within minutes of downtown
Busan, is extremely valuable for this city given the scarcity of land for
its future development.
6.07      Bridge Function of the Barrage.  A four-lane roadway (with a
possibility of additional two future lanes) has been designed on the
barrage. This bridge function would improve the accessibility of the right
bank area and reduce travel distances. It will also reduce traffic conges-
tion costs on the three existing river crossings. The barrage crossing will
result in about 3% of the Gimhae polder area (450 ha) being urbanized by the
end of the decade, thus increasing the value of this land. The location of
the barrage fits into the existing and planned road network of Busan.
6.08      Power Benefits.  The Andong Dam (926 million cu m, or 7% of the
annual river flow) has an after-bay weir. The hydropower plant is equipped
to pump water back to the main reservoir during off-peak hours for re-use
during peak hours. The barrage eliminates the concern for a large,
continuous flow now required for salinity repu:Lsion, and eliminates the pump
back energy cost.
Project Cost Allocation
6.09      The present value of the estimated benefits and alternative costs
for the multipurpose functions of the barrage are shown in Annex 10, Table
2. The justifiable expenditure for each component is the lower of these
values. The joint cost is the total cost less the separable expenditures,
and is allocated in proportion to the remaining justifiable expenditures.
The cost allocation shows that 79% of the cost should be recovered by
ISWACO's water and power charges and land sales. The agriculture and bridge
function benefits (including land appreciation) would be recovered by the
Government through established taxes and represent 21% of the cost of the
barrage.
Marginal Cost of Water
6.10      NEDECO's original report estimated that water supply failure on
the Nagdong River would be in 1984. However, water flows have been
insufficient to maintain a salinity level below 300 ppm since 1977. This
problem has continued and reached a critical level in 1982, which is
therefore considered the failure year. Additional upstream water usage
after 1982 would greatly increase the water problems for cities nearer the
river mouth. The estimated incremental water use after 1982 and the
construction and operating costs of the barrage are shown in Annex 10, Table
4. The marginal cost of water is W 8.3 for a discount rate of 10%.
Although this price is 3 times higher than present charges by ISWACO in
the Nagdong River (W 2.7/per cu m), it is affordable, representing only 4%
of the water tariff for treated water in Busan. Although the application



- 35 -
of marginal cost pricing to this project will have only a relatively small
impact on ISWACO's overall revenue, the acceptance and demonstration of this
principle is a major institutional innovation, which, when extended to
future projects, would improve ISWACO's capacity to self-finance additional
water works and would promote efficient use of water resources in Korea.
Letters of understanding have already been signed by the main beneficiaries
(Busan and Ulsan/Onsan) on cost recovery. These letters establish: (a) that
the users confirm that the barrage will benefit their respective cities; and
(b) that upon project completion (by 1988), the cost would be levied to all
municipalities and industries increasing their water usage after 1982.
Assurances were also obtained from ISWACO that upon completion of the
barrage, water charges would be levied on all cities which increased their
water usage after 1982. Water charges would be based on the average
long-term marginal cost (of the costs allocated to water supply) at a
discount rate acceptable to the Bank.
Economic Rate of Return
6.11      The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for the Nagdong Barrage, which
represents 95% of the project cost, is estimated at 24% (Annex 10, Table 5)
No ERR was estimated for the national components which are small and distri-
buted in several cities. Sensitivity analysis shows that the ERR would be
22% if the water supply benefits are reduced 10%. The ERR would still be
10% with the following switching values: (a) 89% reduction in water supply
benefits; (b) 137% reduction in land reclamation benefits; and (c) if the
land reclamation, bridge and power benefits are excluded. These rates of
return are satisfactory and are considered conservative estimates of the
project ERR, since some water supply benefits (like the improvement of the
living standards of the present population, which would receive reliable,
saline-free, water supply) are difficult to quantify and were not included
in the analysis.
Population Served
6.12      The main beneficiary would be the city of Busan, whose programs
for improving water services will have to be curtailed if no additional
water is available. Busan is already suffering from salinity problems,
which result in discontinuous supply and rationing and may cause consid-
erable damage to installations using this water. About one million more
persons would receive water in Busan by 1988, including 300,000 in relative
poverty./l Overall, the project would improve the water supply to about
7.8 million persons presently depending on the unreliable supply of the
Nagdong River, and would provide the capacity to serve about 4 million more
persons by 1992. Most of the population without water or with rationed
service is of low income and about one million of them are in relative
poverty.
/1 Persons with incomes below one-third of the country's average per
capita income.

Project Risks
6.13      There are no special risks in the project.  However, investments
in other projects could reduce the annual budgetary allocations and slow
down project implementation. This is not considered likely given the high
priority accorded to this project by the Government. Government contri-
butions have been confirmed (para. 3.09). In addition, there is a risk that
Busan water works extensions, which have already started, and the Jang Lim
interceptor sewer could suffer some delays. However, the Government has
provided assurances that these works will be completed by December 31, 1987,
well before the barrage starts opierating in 1988. Environmental risks have
been minimized by studies and special conditions included in the project
(para. 3.15).
VII. AGREEMENTS RIEACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Assurances were obtained from the Government during loan nego-
tiations that:
(a)  Busan complementary water and sewerage works would be completed
before December 31, 1987 (para. 3.04);
(b)  Government contributions for the project would be provided in
a timely manner (para. 3.09);
(c)  a zone of the Nagdong Estuary would be declared a "Natural
Ecological System Preservation Area" to protect the estuarine
environment (para. 3.15); and
(d)  MOHA's component project cost accounts would be audited (para.
4.07).
7.02      Assurances were obtained from ISWACO during loan negotia-
tions that:
(a)  ISWACO's Water and Dams Divisions would achieve a satisfactory
rate of return (para. 5.09);
(b)  environmental protection actions would be implemented (para.
3.15); and
(c)  a maintenance and inspection program for the barrage would be
available for Bank review not later than December 31, 1986 (para.
3.16);
(d)  fixed assets would be revalued not lal:er than December 31,
1984 (para. 5.03);



- '37 -
(e)  ISWACO would not incur additional long-term debt unless debt
service coverage exceeds 1.3 in any calendar year (para. 5.11);
(f)  audit statements (para. 4.06) and periodic reports and monitor-
ing indicators (para. 5.12) would be sent to the Bank; and
(g)  upon completion of the barrage, the water made available
by the barrage would be priced at its marginal cost (para. 6.10).
7.03      Signing of a subsidiary loan agreement between ISWACO and the
Government would be a condition tor loan effectiveness (para. 4.01).
7.04      With the above agreements and conditions the proposed project
would be suitable for a Bank loan of $78.5 million, for a term of 12 years,
including a grace period of 4.5 years at the standard variable interest
rate. The borrower would be the Republic of Korea.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Main Multipurpose Projects in Korea
1.        The main multipurpose projects in the basin of the four largest
rivers, the Han, Nagdong, Geum and Yongsan, are:
(a) Han Basin. The studies for the Han River Basin, completed in
1971, were financed by USAID and formulated a comprehensive
plan for the development of the basin-s water .esources.
Existing projects in the Han Basin include the Hwacheon
Project (1940), the Soyang Gang Multipurpose Project (1973)
and several smaller hydroelectric projects. The Chungju
Multipurpose Dam, financed by Loan 1666-KO, is scheduled to be
completed in 1986 and will provide almost complete regulation
of the runoff from 26% of the catchment area of the Han Basin,
and generate 460 MW of peaking capacity.
(b) Nagdong Basin. The studies for the Nagdong Basin were financed
by FAO and completed by NEDECO, a Netherlands consulting firm,
between 1966 and 1977. The first phase included the construc-
tion of the Andong Multipurpose Project, completed in 1976 and
financed by ADB. The project finances the construction of the
following phase, the Nagdong Barrage, while the construction of
the Hapcheon Dam (being financed by OECF) is scheduled between
1984-1988.
(c) Geum Basin. A study of the Geum Basin was completed in 1972.
The only major reservoir site in this basin, the Daecheong
Dam, was completed in 1981. The development of an estuary dam
near the mouth of the river has been studied under the Seeds
Project (Loan 942-KO).
(d) Yong San Gang Basin. The first stage of the development plan of
this basin, the Yong San Gang project was completed in 1978,
financed by Loan 795-KO. The second stage, financed by Loan
1364-KO, is scheduled to be completed in 1984.
2.        To reduce the. large toll in human lives and property resulting
from floods, and to provide additional water for urban, industrial and agri-
cultural demand, while increasing hydroelectric generation capacity, ISWACO
is planning to build seven additional large multipurpose dams which are
expected to be in operation by the 1990s. Existing and proposed ISWACO
projects are summarized in Table 1.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
The Environment - Nagdong Estuary
1.        The Nagdong estuarine environment, an area designated as National
Monument #179 since 1966, consists of some 240 sq km of farmland, fresh,
brackish and tidal waters, delta islands, sand spits and mudflats, both in
the main river and in the tidal estuary (see Map 2, and Figure 1). The city
of Busan bounds this area on the east (left) bank of the river. Agricultural
development during this century, including dikes and river control struc-
tures, has resulted in the reclamation of some 15,000 ha (150 sq km) of
prime farmland mainly on the west bank. The tidal reach extending some
60-70 km upstream of the proposed barrage site at Hadan is characterized by
a decreasing salinity gradient with important agricultural and city water
intakes 15-25 km upstream from Hadan. The west bank and the large delta
island of Elsukdo are farmed intensively all year round. East bank
development includes important commercial and industrial areas of Busan city
including the major Sasang Industrial complex. Both river banks are diked
for river training and flood control, and the river runs in a well defined
channel. The wetlands on both banks between dike and river have also been
reclaimed and are intensively cultivated.
2.        The lower southern portion of Elsukdo Island, the mudflats and
sand bars in this area, as well as the river itself and the numerous
waterways like the Jukring Gang (another delta branch of the main river
converted into a freshwater lake by sluice gates at both ends, Daedong and
Nogsan) in the agricultural polder area, provide winter resting, feeding and
stopover grounds for numerous species of migratory waterfowl. This zone
also contains some important fish and seaweed farms. Being a transitional
zone from fresh to sea water and receiving nutrients from sediment load
carried by a well aerated slow moving river, the area is rich in plankton,
algae and bottom flora and fauna. These support the bird and fish life in
this zone. There is also a well enforced and observed ban on hunting over
the whole designated area.
3.        The Nagdong estuary though not large by international standards is
the main bird habitat in Korea. A major concern in the preparation of the
project has been the protection of the environment. Three originally
selected alternative sites with extensive land reclamation were abandoned on
environmental grounds. The ecological aspects were studied by NEDECO, and
the ornithological problems were analyzed by a consultant hired by the Bank.
The main concerns and solutions adopted are:

ANNEX 2
Page 2
(a)  Land reclamation disturbing the habitat of migratory birds.
This was curtailed, and now includes only 190 ha, about one
third of the area recommended by the original feasibility study.
The area retained for reclamation borders developed areas of Busan
City and has been excluded from National Monument #179 by the
Ministry of Culture and Information. No land reclamation is
included in the right bank of the river.
(b) Increased industrial pollution resulting from increased water
retention time. Under the project the Jang Lim interceptor
sewer will be built by Busan City before December 31, 1987 to
convey industrial and domestic waste beyond the barrage (para.
3.04). Busan-s City plan includes an outfall treatment plant.
These works should actually improve the environment, reducing
or eliminating altogether the pollution load from the Sasang
industrial complex and developed areas bordering the river.
(c)  Loss or reduction of tidal flats.  This is considered a transi-
tory problem, and given the low flows of water after barrage
construction, it is expected that the tidal flats would actually
increase and stabilize some years after project completion.
(d) Loss of nutrients because of the limited outflows. This prob-
lem, which existed in the first three alternatives considered,
has been minimized by the inclusion of underflow and overflow
gates in the barrage and' of a discharge sluice in the right
river branch incorporated in the closure dam.
(e) Disturbance of birds by traffic or human activities. A ban on
hunting has been strictly enforced. This has resulted in birds
being unafraid of humans; they stay undisturbed as close as within
100 meters of urbanized areas.
4.        An Ecological Impact Assessment (EIA) was prepared by ISWACO for
OOE, based on NEDECO recommendations. OOE approved the project subject to
conditions designed to minimize any adverse influence on the environment
(see Attachment 1). These conditions are designed to ensure that ISWACO
would protect the bird habitat. They require the establishnment of control
measures, both during and after barrage construction, based on quantitative
and qualitative analyses of changes in the principle parameters which are
relevant to maintaining the estuary as an attractive habitat for migratory
birds; water quality (chemical and biological), sediment movements and
morphology of the river and estuary, flora and fauna and distribution of
tidal and river currents. They also require that the planning for the
marketing and use of reclaimed land takes into account environmental
considerations.

ANNEX 2

5.        ISWACO will comply with these conditions mainly through an
Environmental Management Unit (EMU), operating at the Busan Project Office,
which has already been established and staffed satisfactorily. The core
staff of this Unit consist of an Environmental Management Specialist (an
expatriate supplied by NEDECO) and a wetland biologist and water quality
specialist to be recruited locally. This core staff will be supported by
local and foreign specialized staff as required. This core team will be
responsible for planning and executing the required studies in cooperation
with environmental associations and universities and monitoring and
controlling construction operations to minimize adverse effects. ISWACO
will also establish an Environmental Management Section at Headquarters by
December 31, 1984 under the Director of Planning. This section will be
responsible for overseeing environment-related activities of the EMU at the
Busan Project Office and will be developed for managing the environmental
impact of all ISWACO projects in close cooperation with OOE. The project
provides funds of about US$1.9 million for the environmental management of
the Barrage Project, including laboratory equipment and training.
6.        ISWACO is discussing with Busan City arrangements for the
planning, servicing and marketing of the 190 ha of prime land reclaimed
under the project. The first parcels of reclaimed land are expected to be
available for marketing by the end of 1985 and ISWACO will submit an EIA on
the use of this land to OOE.
7.        A main concern with respect to the environment is the population
pressures generating a demand for reclamation of more urban and agricultural
land. In the Nagdong estuary, these pressures could lead to the reclamation
from the sea of areas of the estuary which may be essential for the
preservation of the bird habitat. The shallow intertidal areas of the
estuary bounded by the Gimhae polder to the north and the barrier islands to
the south are vulnerable in this respect. The project therefore requires a
study, to be conducted by the EMU, in accordance with TOR to be reviewed by
OOE and the Bank, to identify areas which are vital for the continued
preservation of the bird habitat. Based on the results of this study, MOC
should establish, not later than June 30, 1985 a Natural Environment
Preservation Area in the Nagdong Estuary (under the National Land Use and
Management Law of December 31, 1982). OOE should then designate not later
than December 31, 1985 a Natural Ecological System Preservation Area within
the Natural Environment Preservation Area (under the Environmental
Preservation Law of December 31, 1981) (para. 3.15). Figure 1 shows the
features of the estuary and a tentative definition of the areas to be
protected under the above laws. The designation of these areas as
preservation areas by MOC and OOE will ensure their continued availability
under controlled environmental conditions as a habitat for migratory birds.
8.        An important task of the EMU will be to ensure that the contractor
responsible for barrage and ancillary works construction (all major works
are packaged under a single contract) observes all the conditions for envir-
onmental preservation laid down in the conditions of contract. Specific



- 46 -                              ANNEX 2
Page 4
clauses in the specifications relate to the methods, equipment and techniques
to be employed, the control of noise and soil, water and air pollution and
the preservation of the project area in its present condition. Particular
attention is paid to the control of dredging operations to minimize effects
on the estuary. This is the first time that a major contract in Korea
requires a contractor to include in his bid price allowances for environ-
mental preservation during construction.
0.        The quality of water in the limited storage reservoir (50 million
cu m) created by the barrage has been studied and reported on by the con-
sultants, NEDECO. The main conclusion was that maximum allowable domestic
and industrial waste discharges into this reservoir area would have been
exceeded at the present rate of development by 1988 when the barrage is due
to be commissioned. It was therefore necessary to ensure that domestic and
industrial wastes from Busan, mainly from the Sasang Industrial area, would
be intercepted and discharged at a point well downstream of the barrage,
preferably after adequate treatment. Busan City is planning to construct,
before December 31, 1987, the Jang lim Sewerage scheme which consists of a
main interceptor sewer (15.5 km long) with lift stations along the left river
bank to intercept domestic and industrial wastes from Gupo in the north,
Sasang, Hadan and Jang Lim areas in the south to the proposed sewage treat-
ment plant and outfall at Jang Lim about 2 km downstream of the barrage (see
Map 2 and Annex 12).  These works would effectively improve the water quality
in this stretch of the river and would remove any danger of pollutants inter-
fering with operation of water intakes at Mulgeurm and Maeri, 20-25 km upstream
of Sasang. A dissolved oxygen level of over 4 mg/l can be maintained in the
reservoir, even under minimum flow and hot weather conditions, adequate to
support fish life and prevent anaerobic decomposition of sediments. Eutro-
phrication may result in seasonally high concentrations of plankton and algae
growths in the lower reservoir. The water intake at Mulgeum, however, is not
likely to be affected. For flushing out of the reservoir and to provide for
some mixing and a precise control of the water release rate for estuary
management purposes, four of the ten radial gates controlling the barrage have
been designed to operate as overflow weirs and all ten gates have provisions
for controlled underflow. A discharge sluice has also been provided in the
right river branch closure dam to provide for flushing out of this portion of
the reservoir and provide nutrient rich water to the western side of the
estuary.

1/ The total number of municipalities in the Nagdong Basin is 70, including 16 cities (Si), 38 Eubs and 16 iyeons.
2/ Present demand is rationed, mainly because of lack of water treatment and distribution facilities. The water demand will increase drastically  in 1985 and 1986 wher t1 
projects under construction by Daegu, Masan, Changweon and Jinhae l4inanced by the First Water Supply PrnJectl would be completed, as well as similar projects in Busan-
and other cit:es.
3/ Water demand is strongly seasonal, with peak demand about 207 over the average. However the peak demand occur in August when the river carries maximum flow.
The critical seasonal demand is about 5X, over the average (May-June).

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Description
1.        The project has three components, which are described below.
A. The Nagdong Barrage
2.        The main statistics for the barrage works are given in Table 1.
The Nagdong Barrage works (see attached photograph) consist of:
(a)  the 511 m long concrete barrage with wingwalls and nine river
piers equipped with ten 47.5 m wide radial gates; and a four-
lane highway (with provision for extension to six lanes) on a
prestressed concrete box girder bridge spanning across the nine
barrage river piers and two wing walls,, The bridge girders also
support the main gates and hoisting gear. Between piers and
seated on the river bed is a thick concrete sill protected both
upstream and downstream by rock aprons., The whole structure has
been designed as a single unit with the piers transmitting the
main vertical and longitudinal loads to stable dense sand/gravel
foundation layers about 30 m below by mreans of vertical and
raked cylindrical steel piles. The concrete sill, anchored by
means of cylindrical steel piles and sheet pile cutoffs, protects
the river bed and provides a water seal between the gates and the
river bed; it also transmits all lateral loads between wingwalls
and piers and anchors the removable steel guides which would
hold stop logs isolating each radial gate during cyclical
maintenance.
(b) The right bank (west) wing wall of the barrage includes a 9 m wide
x 50 m long navigation lock for barges up to 500 dwt, and fish
passes designed to facilitate movement of eel and salmon across
the barrage.
(c) The main channel on the east branch is dredged to a width varying
between 530 m at the barrage to 720 m at the main river
confluence 2 km upstream. The river channels adjacent to the
barrage sill would be protected by rock aprons, placed on graded
granular filters. The downstream end of the rock apron and filter
is protected by polyprop filter cloth anchored with gabions.  The
diversion channel would have an average width of 350 m and would
be dredged to -5 SMSL /1 to divert part of the the river flow back
/1 SMSL; Standard Mean Sea Level.

having a crest level of +6.00 m SMSL. All dikes and berms
subject to submersion will be protected using ballasting
mattresses and dry masonry. The closure dam on the western

ANNEX 4
Page 3
river bank will be constructed, after completion of the
barrage, using quarry runs dumped from trucks from both banks,
and pumping sand against this dumped material. Seabed
protection will be provided using polypropylene and rice straw
ballasted mattresses, anad final closure with rock boulders and
pumped sand will be carried out in a single day, under favorable
river flow and tide conditions. After river closure is achieved,
the dam will be brought up to designed cross sections. A
discharge sluice 10 m wide x 7 m high is incorporated in the
closure dam.
(e)  all ancillary works; road works and viaducts, operations
building and service areas and services;
(f)  About 190 ha of land reclamation (to about +2.00 m SMSL upstream
and downstream of the barrage) will be carried out, partly using
suitable dredged materials from the construction pit and partly
from dredging of additional suitable materials from selected
borrow areas. Precautions will be taken to prevent dredged fines
from being deposited in the river channels; most of this material
will be transported to disposal areas at sea below the -15 m SMSL
contour line. The raising of levels of portions of Elsukdo Island
upstream of the barrage (to about +3.00 m SMSL), which will be
subject to flooding due to the closure of the west river branch,
will also use up some of the unsuitable material. If considered
desirable from an ecological viewpoint some of this unsuitable
dredged material may also be used to raise bed levels in the west
branch river to create new intertidal areas and mud flats.
3.        Hydrology.  The computation for design floods is based on earlier
studies/i which were reviewed during detailed engineering (1980-82) by
NEDECO and ISWACO.  The data series from 6 river gauging stations, from
1941-78, was used in the studies. The design f:Lood (T=500 of 18,300 cu
m/second) adopted is based on histcrical water 'Levels and river discharges
measured at Jindong station (80 km upstream of barrage site at Hadan),
extrapolation of the rating curve, determination of extreme flows at Jindong
and estimation of extreme flows at the barrage site.
4.        Tide, Wind and Ice Effects.  The normal tide levels at the estuary
mouth show an average tidal variation of 0.94 m; this is estimated to
increase to 1.41 m after barrage construction. Studies have also concluded
that no tidal resonance is likely to occur in the estuary and that a
possible phase shift of partial tides will only have a minimal influence.
Extreme tidal conditions in combination with critical wind speeds have been

Development Project, Feasibility Study 1976 (Nippon Koei Co); Nagdong
Basin Study, 1973 (MOC) Regional Flood Frequency in the Nagdong Basin.

estimated to result in critical water level differences of 1.25 m and 3.45 m
between the river and the estuary after barrage completion. Critical ice
loads for the barrage have been computed, amounting to 0.20 m thickness,
based on the analysis of air temperature, wind velocity, cloud cover and
freezing periods in Busan.
5.        Geology and Foundation Conditions.  The estuary is characterized
by deep alluvial deposits with rock at -50m SMSL only encountered near the
left bank wingwall (Hadandong). A feature of the profile, along the axis of
the barrage, is the interbedding of a dense sand/gravel layer at depths of
about -30m SMSL by a thick overlay of soft clay with sand pockets and an
underlay of stiff clay, and a dense sand layer with gravel and boulders.
The stiff clay layer is limited to the barrage site only. Soil
investigations included bore holes (maximum depth 60m) with standard
penetration tests, field vane shear tests, sampling and field permeability
tests. Laboratory work consisted of classification tests, shear and
consolidation tests and chemical analysis of soil and water samples. Test
pile driving and loading tests will be carried out by the contractor under
the supervision of a qualified geophysicist. The overall design, including
foundation design, has been reviewed by an Expert Review Panel (ERP)
established by ISWACO in consultation with the Bank. Agreement has been
reached between the ERP, ISWACO, NEDECO and the Bank on all aspects of final
design and specifications, and contract documents and drawings have been
modified accordingly.
6.        Construction Materials.  The major construction materials -
cement, quarry materials and steel - are readily available at reasonable
costs within the country, except some grades and thicknesses of steel
required for the steel piles and gates. Electrical and mechanical gear for
gate hoists and navigation locks as well as the lock, radial and sluice
gates will be partially imported and manufactured locally under license.
Most of the material dredged from the foundation pits and upstream and
downstream river channels is unsuitable for use for fills and will be barged
and dumped out at sea without affecting the estuary regime. The contract
allows for the pilot testing of cyclone separation technology to improve the
fills required for land reclamation. The results of this pilot test would
be judged on environmental grounds and, if found satisfactory, would be used
for part of the land reclamation. Rock required for upstream and downstream
protective aprons and the closure dam core is available from commercial
quarries in the vicinity of Busan. Sand and other suitable filling materials
will be borrowed from identified areas both upriver and from the seabed; the
locations of these borrow areas minimize the effect on the river of changes
in bottom profiles and sediment load. The project construction will require
approximately 23,000 tons of cement, 9,000 tons of reinforcement steel,
10,500 tons of steel piles, 1,850 tons of gate fabrication steel, 900,000 cu
m of quarry materials for the closure dam and aprons, 25 million cu m for
dredging in foundation pits and approach channels, 2.5 million cu m of
suitable fill materials in dikes and the closure dam and 4 million cu m of
fill for land reclamation works.

B. National Leak Detection Program.
7.        The Local Finance Division in MORA will implement a national leak
detection and control program aimed at conserving water resources and
reducing operational costs and capital investments. The project will
finance the transfer of appropriate technologies in this field, the
implementation of demonstration programs in 15 cities, the purchase of
equipment, and the training of key personnel to assist cities in
implementing this technology.
8.        MONA have tentatively identified the 15 cities /1 to be included
in the program, including four cities with over 500,000 population, five
cities with populations betwee 200,000 and 500,00O, and six cities with
under 200,000 population. All these cities have a reported leakage ratio /2
above 22% and a treated water production over 40,000 CMD. The program will
be implemented in two phases.
9.        Phase I Program.  During E'hase I (over the first 6-9 months), MOHA
will employ consultants (probably a joint venture between an established
local consultant with experience in water distribution and a specialized
foreign consultant with experience in leak detect:ion) to carry out, with
city staff, basic surveys of each city's distribution network, and identify
the priority areas within each network for carrying out leak detection and
rehabilitation programs (1984-86). During this initial phase, the
consultants will also prepare specifications for additional equipment
requirements (to supplement equipment available within each city) and for
purchase of modern specialized leak detection equipment developed for this
special purpose. During this initial phase, the consultants would also
prepare training programs, select key city staff to receive training and
start initial traning of staff to apply the methodologies designed to detect
and rectify leaks and operate and maintain specialized equipment. It is
estimated that 50 key city staff will receive such training over the program
period. MORA will be responsible for hiring of consultants and procurement
of equipment in accordance with Bank guidelines.
10.       Phase II Program.  The second phase of the program, to be
implemented over the next two years (until end-1986), would mainly be
/1 These cities are: Class 1 - Daeju, Incheon, Gwangju, Daejeon; Class 2 -
Suweon, Cheonju, Mogpo, Jinju, Cheju; Class 3 - Bucheon, Wonju, Cheongju,
Gunsan, Yeosu, Masan.

carried out by WB staff with consultant support, identifying and rectifying
major leakages and instituting measures to minimize future leakages in their
distribution network. Funding requirements for replacement and
rehabilitation works will be estimated and with MOHA's support included
annually in each city WB budget. Such funds will be specifically earmarked
for implementation of this phase of the program.
11.       Program Targets.  MOHA will, through the consultants, continuously
monitor and evaluate the efficiency of design and implementation of the
program and be able to adjust the program as necessary to fit conditions in
each city. The target for each city is to achieve a reduction in the
leakage ratio of 12 percentage points and a reduction in unaccounted for
water ratio by 16 percentage points during the program period. These are
considered achievable targets, given the high present values of each of these
indicators (averaging approximately 27% and 41%, respectively, in the
program cities).
12.       Costs and Benefits.  Annex 5, Table 2 includes a summary of
overall costs for this component. These costs are based on expenditures to
be incurred on behalf of each city by MOHA and passed on by way of loans.
In addition to these costs, each city budget will provide for additional
costs of staff, including training, repair and rehabilitation of networks
and implementation of preventive measures during 1985/86. During succeeding
years, city budgets will provide funds to continue the program and amortize
the project loan. Benefits from this program will accrue to each city by
way of: awareness by city staff of costs of water wastage, availability of
presently wasted water for sale with considerable savings in treatment and
distribution costs, and postponement of investments in production capacity.
Annex 5, Table 3 gives a tentative breakdown of costs by city and by program
components. These allocations will be refined during phase 1 program in
consultation with cities.
C. Institutional Development Program
13.       A national program will be undertaken to improve accounting and
management information for city WBs. This includes the assistance of local
and foreign consultants, to prepare basic software for billing, payroll, and
storage of general accounting and management information for use with
micro-computers and to provide training in implementation of proposed
systems to MOHA and selected staff of the WBs. The manuals, software and
systems produced will be available to all other WBs in Korea.
14.       MOHAs, Local Finance Division, has selected 16 cities, six with
more than 50,000 connections each, and ten with between 20,000 and 50,000
connections, to be included in the first stage. A further sixteen cities
with 20,000 to 50,000 connections each have been identified for inclusion in
a second stage. A third stage, including eleven smaller cities with about
10,000 connections each, has also been identified.

15.       This program has been proposed by I4OHA given that more than 300 WBs
in the country have generally not developed their accounting and financial
management sufficiently, to keep pace with expansions in capacity and number
of accounts handled. The larger WBs have made a start by introducing
computerized billing systems but most cities rely on old manually operated
systems and have to hire qualified accountant:s at the end of each year to
close accounts and prepare, as best as possible, end of year balance state-
ments and information. Accounting and billing and preparation of financial
management information making revenue projections, etc., during the year is
done manually with associated inefficiencies, errors and delays. Further-
more, WBs do not use standardized methods and. practices, making it extremely
difficult for MOHA to obtain a consolidated picture and compare the relative
performance levels and forecast needs of each of these WBs. MOHA has since
1981 studied this problem in detail and has introduced new standardized
accounting guidelines, which were reviewed by the Bank, for use by WBs. The
program now proposed is the next step in improving their management
efficiency.
16.       Stage I.  MOHA will in the first stage of the program (of about
12 months  duration) employ consultants to work with selected city-staff to
make improvements in present accounting methods and practices in accordance
with the new guidelines. They will introduce standard procedures and formats
to facilitate computerization, identify and test commercially available
computer software programs suitable for WB applications, modify such programs
and/or write new programs as required for particular applications and assess
types and capacities of computer hardware best suited for each city-s needs.
Consultants will also start a program of training selected key staff
(managers and technicians) in computer techniques and system planning and
operations (at least four to six persons in each city). These training
programs will be of about two weeks duration each, full time, followed by
on-site training backed by training manuals to be produced by the consult-
ants.
17.       Stage II.  In the second stage, (also of about 12 months duration)
cities will purchase, through MOHA, recommended computer hardware and intro-
duce computerized systems and software packages with the assistance of the
consultants. Staff training and continuous monitoring and evaluation of
results will also be a feature of this stage. Experience gained in these
cities will assist in smoothening out implementation problems in cities
benefitting from subsequent stages of this program.
18.       Costs and Benefits.  MOlIA will employ about 18 manmonths of
foreign specialized accounting and computer expertise, and about 85 man-
months of local consultants. These services are estimated to cost
W 584 million and will be apportioned to each city on a time sharing basis.
Computer equipment is estimated to cost W 500 million (about 32 units).
$0.85 million of the Bank loan of $5.0 million to MOHA will be available

to finance this component. Balance fund requirements of about W 420 million
will be contributed by the cities. Annex 5, Table 2 shows overall costs of
this component. The implementation of this program will introduce greater
efficiency in management of WBs with associated benefits for each city. This
program is expected to eliminate duplication of efforts and expenses in
software and hardware, improve the financial practices of the WBs, produce
reliable management information, help improving the sector efficiency and
provide a basis for improved management and allocation of resources within the
sector.

Economic Analysis
Failure of the Nagdong River Basin System
1.        The failure of the Nagdong River Basin system is reached when
excessive salinity /1 pollutes the downstream reach and interferes with water
abstraction from the river. This is especially important for (a) the
agricultural water intake (22 km from the river mouth) of the agricultural
Gimhae polder, the largest single irrigation area and one of the most produc-
tive agricultural zones in Korea; and (b) the water intake for Busan (Mulgeum)
and Ulsan/Onsan (27 and 29 km from the river mouth). These two cities
represent half (4.1 million) of the total population, and almost 60% of the
estimated demand of 37 cities and towns in the Nagdong Basin (Annex 3). These
two cities service an important part of the industrial production of the basin
which represents 40% of the country's total, with 7,000 industries located in
Busan alone. In 1976 FAO/NEDECO estimated that Andong Dam would be able to
supply the water demand without excessive salinity levels until 1989 under the
1967/68 drought conditions. The NEDECO study in 1981 forecasted that the
failure year would be reached earlier, by 1984. However, salinity levels in
excess of 5 to 10 times permissible salinity standards have been recorded at
Busan since 1977. This required stopping water pumping for 373 hours in 1977,
178 hours in 1978 and 274 hours in 1981 (even abstracting at salinity levels
of 500 ppm). 1982 has been the worst year, with high salinity levels not only
during the dry season (winter) but also during the month of June. As a result
daily stopping of pumping took place at Busan and Ulsan during almost two
months between January and March and again in June. This serious problem was
analyzed in NEDECO-s updated Nagdong report, May 1983, concluding that 1982
should be considered the failure year: any city using additional upstream
water after 1982 would only exacerbate the problems of downstream users. This
conclusion is used in the assignment of water charges (para. 9).
2.        Recent data show that even with flows of 60 cu m/s at Jindong (the
lowest gauging station, 80 km from the river mouth, where flow measurements
are independent of tidal variations), recorded salinity levels exceed 2,000
ppm at the Busan intake. This is about 10 times the salinity level
forecasted by simplified one-dimensional salinity models. Salinity levels
depend on the complex interaction of many variables (flow and withdrawals,
/1 Korea's standard for drinking and industrial water supply specifies
maximum salinity (chloride) levels of 150 ppm. For the analysis of
alternatives, maximum salinity levels of 300 ppm were allowed for
municipal water and 1,200 ppm for agricultural water.

depth, geometry, currents, tidal amplitude, winds, etc.). Salinity
intrusion depends particularly on water depth (to the cubic power) which is
easily affected by storms and floods. Salinity records at Mulgeum indicate
that the flow requirements to maintain acceptable salinity levels for the
downstream users, under the forecasted demand, are of such an order of
magnitude that they cannot reliably be met by additional water releases from
upstream dams. This applies to Hapcheon Dam (17 cu m/s) which was
originally considered an alternative to the barrage but is now being built
and justified on the basis of electric power generation only. Locations for
dams in the river basin are scarce and any dam would reduce critical
agricultural areas. However, even if upstream dams could solve present
salinity problems and provide sufficient water to meet the additional water
demand, using this volume of water (enough to supply 10 million persons) for
salinity repulsion is a waste of a scarce resource. The barrage would
eliminate existing supply and salinity problems and would allow the use of
about 25 cu m/s, presently being wasted to control salinity, for 37 cities
and towns depending on the river for their water supply. A minimum flow of
about 15 cu m/s would be maintained to allow for minimum dilution,
navigation, and fisheries requirements and to provide nutrients to the
estuary area.
Least-Cost Solution
3.        As explained in SAR para. 6.03, the barrage has been identified as
the least-cost solution for these problems in many studies dating back to
1972. In addition to upstream dams, the feasibility study analyzed the
construction of water storage facilities in the cities (which would provide
water during the critical period). This alternative requires large areas of
land (already a critical factor in many cities) and costly changes in the
water conveyance systems. Another alternative studied was resiting upstream
of water intakes for Gimhae, Busan and Ulsan. A minimum resiting of the
water intake (11 km upstream of present locations) was considered for the
alternative cost of water (para. 4) and the project ERR. These alternatives
are, however, not fully comparable. For example, the Gimhae agricultural
polder area, with the barrage, would be bordered by fresh instead of highly
saline water, minimizing salt water infiltration. Furthermore, the barrage
would provide practically saline-free water, whereas other alternatives
would only maintain salinity levels below a maximum limit.
Alternative Cost of Water Supply
4.        The alternative cost of water supply was estimated based on the
cost of relocating the water intakes of the cities of Busan and Ulsan/Onsan,
and the Gimhae agricultural area to an upstream location. At such a
location, salinity should be below allowable international standards (300
ppm for municipal and 1200 ppm for agricultural water) under mean spring
tidal conditions. As a result of increasing demand, the water available in
the river after abstractions would be around 15 cu m/s by 1992.

This low flow would have a more than proportional effect on salinity
(because of much lower dilution capacity, velocity and inertia forces).
With flows as low as 15 cu m/s, salinity levels are expected to increase 2.8
times (Project File reference 3). The alternative location of the water
intakes was estimated to be 9-10 km upstream of their present location,
based on salinity profiles constructed for the river with 15 cu m/s flow and
mean spring tide conditions. However, since the river bed shows an average
difference of less than 0.5 meters between Busan's present intake and the
new estimated locations and there is a sharp rise in the elevation of the
river bed (3.5 meters) in the next few kilometers, the analysis of the
alternative cost of water assumes the relocation of the water intake to this
point, located in km 40, only 11 km and 13 km upstream from present Ulsan
and Busan water intakes (Table 1).
5.        The alternative investment costs are phased in such a way as to
either enter into operation at the same time as the barrage or when future
expansions are needed. Construction costs were calculated based on actual
prices for similar works, reduced 15% due to the present reduction of
construction costs. Operational expenses (power) assume that the resited
intakes would be used only six months per year for water supply and three
months per year for agriculture. Present intakes would be used during the
rest of the year. No further extensions are added after 1992, when the
incremental demand in the river basin reaches the limit (25 cu m/s) of water
made available by the barrage (Annex 3).
Project Cost and Benefits
6.        The project multipurpose benefits are described in paras. 6.04-
6.08. The cost allocation follows the "separable cost, remaining benefits
method" as shown in Table 3. The project cost, benefits, separable and
alternative cost of each component are shown in Table 2. The project cost
for economic analysis excludes taxes and duties, and the cost of
microcomputer hardware. The main benefit, water supply, is estimated as the
saving in the alternative cost of transferring the intakes. This is
conservative, since other estimates (like the cost of failure of the
domestic and industrial supply and alternative storage) yield higher values.
The feasibility study analyzed in detail the situation with and without the
barrage and the increased agriculture yield achievable with a reliable fresh
water supply; some of the agricultural benefits are achieved directly;
others require some drainage improvements, the costs of which have been
deducted from the benefits. The bridge function has the separable cost of
viaducts and roads. Its alternative cost (Table 2) is a bridge at a similar
location, the cost of which is about 64% of the expected benefits. These
benefits include the reduction in distance and avoidance of traffic
congestion toward Jinhae and the airport. Land is scarce and valuable in
Busan. The vicinity near downtown and easy access to Busan resulting from
the barrage would allow some areas of the polder to be urbanized in the
medium term (by 1988). Conservatively a reduced area (450 ha, 2% of the
polder in the right bank) is assumed to appreciate in value by
W 10,000/pyong (8% of the estimated land value at the left bank). With the
announcement of the Government decision to build the barrage, the land near

the barrage on the left bank has already reached values between 130,000 and
1,000,000 W/pyong (about $172 to $400/sq m).
7.        Power benefits result from the capacity to use Andong Dam water
(926 million cu m) as needed to generate peak power, without the constraint
of a continuous minimum average flow. This saves energy, presently used
during off-peak hours to pump-back from the after-bay weir to the main
reservoir.
8.        For land reclamation the alternative costs and benefits are
assumed the same. This provides some cross-subsidization for water supply.
There is no other available land with so extremely favorable a location
(bordering Busan's main areas, with all public services) which could be used
for alternative analysis. Furthermore, without the barrage and the channel
dredging associated with the barrage works (which provide part of the
filling material) and the construction of new protection works, this
separate component may not be feasible. This, and the difficulty of
allocating the separate cost of many general components, (taxes,
compensations, engineering, etc.) explains the large difference between the
benefits and separable costs of this component. About 30% of the reclaimed
land would be used for roads, parks and public services. The remaining
land, net of the cost of main infrastructure, has a value estimated today at
W 160,000/pyong (for the net area) or about W 128,000/pyong for the total
area. Given the scarcity of land in Busan, the real price of land is
expected to continue rising by the time the land reclamation is completed
(1987), but this increased value has not been included in the analysis.
Cost Recovery - Marginal Cost
9.        As explained in para 6.10, the cost of water supply, land reclama-
tion and power (79%) would be recovered through ISWACO charges. The
traffic, land appreciation and agricultural benefits (21%) are to be
recovered by Government established taxes. The cost of water would be
recovered through water charges close to the marginal cost. The marginal
cost is estimated between W 6.5 and W 8.3/cu m for discount rates between
8-10% (Table 4). To assess future water charges, consideration should be
given to the social and political impact of large increases over the present
low charges for Andong Dam water (W 2.7/cu m), and the difficulty of
collecting water charges from a river subject to wide seasonal fluctuations.
Agreement has been reached that water would be charged at the marginal cost
using a discount rate acceptable to the Bank (para. 6.10). This would
provide ISWACO with a satisfactory financial rate of return.
Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
10.       The ERR is estimated at 24% (Table 5).  This is conservative since
some of the water supply benefits (like the improvement of living standards
and the provision of saline-free water) are difficult to quantify and have
not been included in the analysis. The sensitivity analysis and switching
factors in Table 5 and para. 6.11 show that the project would be justified
even under extreme assumptions.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financial Projections
Inflation
1.        Local price contingencies assume that Korea's inflation will be 5%
in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% p.a. thereafter. The expected
price contingencies for foreign costs are estimated at 8% for 1983, 7.5% for
1984, 7% for 1985 and 6% p.a. thereafter. The exchange rate is assumed at
W780 per dollar.
Taxes
2.         ISWACO was previously exempted from income taxes but is now
required to pay income and defense taxes at a rate of about 11% of its net
income before taxes. Provisions for income taxes have been included in the
financial projections for each division.
Assets Revaluation
3.        Korean regulations allow for the revaluation of fixed assets when
their estimated value exceeds the book value by 25% or more. The
revaluation is detailed and requires the approval of Government auditors.
ISWACO has not revalued its fixed assets since 1977. This results in low
rates and tariffs (since the depreciation and average net assets used to
compute the rate of return are underestimated) and the payment of more taxes
than necessary. The revaluation of some assets is expected to exceed 200%.
The financial projections include the estimated revalued fixed assets, and
maintain the fixed assets revalued thereafter, using 85% of the increases in
the wholesale price index as a conservative proxy for the price increase of
capital goods.
Water and Dams Divisions
4.         These divisions are the only income generating Divisions in ISWACO.
The Industrial sites just recover the respective direct expenditures. Opera-
tional revenues in the financial projections include sales of water and power,
and the collection of charges from municipalities or industries using water
from rivers regulated by ISWACO's dams. Incidental revenues (as land sales)
are not included. The expenses include the allocation of general administra-
tion, taxes, operational interest, and the estimated revalued depreciation.
This explains the difference in 1981-82 between these projections and the cost
breakdown shown in Table 5.2.
A. Water Division
5.         The Water Division owns and operates bulk water production and
transmission facilities built by MOC. ISWACO provides bulk raw water to
eight regional projects including the Metropolian area of Seoul. ISWACO



- 84 -
ANNEX 11
Page 2
also provides treated water to industrial areas and some cities adjacent to
them. Financial projections for this division take into account the
forecasted Third Stage Project for the Metropolitan area, whose feasibility
study has been completed and is expected to be built between 1985 and 1988.
Water Demand - Tariffs
6.        The analysis of the raw and treated water demand is available in the
project files. The water demand is projected in. accordance with the catego-
ries in the present tariff structure. Unaccounted-for water is assumed at 5%
since only bulk pipelines are included and water is metered at the receiving
end of treatment plants. ISWACO's tariffs for raw and treated water are
satisfactory and include fixed charges for the basic contracted water
capacity, metered charges varying with the volume used and surcharges for the
volume used in excess of the contracted supply. ISWACO's water tariffs were
increased 100% in the Metropolitan Seoul area during the years 1980 and 1981.
Future tariff increases are as needed to achieve the covenanted rates of
return on revalued assets (4% in 1984-85, 5% thereafter).  The Third
Metropolitan Stage is expensive, with a marginal cost of about W 80/cu m
(compared with W 30/cu m now).  Achievement of the covenanted rate of return
requires tariff increases of 31% in real terms between 1983-89.
Expenses
7.        Power expenses represent 68% of the total, and include a fixed
charge, depending on installed capacity (which remains constant until the
capacity is expanded) and charges per kWh used, which are projected in pro-
portion to the volume produced. Personnel expenses have been projected
constant (in real prices) until the Third Stage e!nters into operation, when
about 10% more staff would be needed. Materials and maintenance are
projected on the basis of historical expenses and trends. Other expenses
are projected in proportion to the volume of raw water produced, which
represents 97% of the water sold.  Central administrative expenses are
allocated in proportion to the direct expenses of each division.
Debt Service
8.        The debt service is mainly with ADB (US$22.2 million payable in 24
years at 7.5%), which financed the First Stage Metropolitan Project.
Cash Flow
9.        The Third Metropolitan Stage Project is assumed to be financed (as
in the first two stages) by Government equity contributions and foreign
loans. A foreign loan of US$100 million with 15-year terms including 3.5
years' grace is assumed for the Third Stage, which has an estimated cost of
$300 million. Cash available from the Water or Dams Divisions is
transferred as needed between these Divisions. About W 23 billion are to be



- 85 -
ANNEX 11
Page 3
transferred from the Water to the Dams Division between 1984-87 to help
finance the large dams program. In addition to this project, capital
expenditures for equipment replacement are also included. Interest during
construction is capitalized.
Balance Accounts
10.       Accounts receivable, in accordance with present experience, are
forecasted at 40 days of billing. Inventories are projected as a function
of the annual material expenditures. Accounts payable are about one month
of the capital expenditures.
B. Dams Division
Fixed Assets
11.       The Dams Division operates three multipurpose dams (Andong, Soyang
and Daecheong). Fixed assets incorporated by ISWACO include only water
supply, power and 30% of the cost allocated to agriculture. The cost
allocated to flood control is not included in the fixed assets, but the
respective operational expenses are subsidized by the power and water
revenues. Based on present estimates of cost allocations, 61% of the Chungju
Dam, 70% of Hapcheon Dam and 79% of the Nagdong Barrage would be incorporated
into the fixed assets. Average depreciation is estimated at 3% p.a.
Demand
12.       Demand projections for the Dams Division were made during the
appraisal. The main factor is the Chungju Dam, which would double the
present power and water supply capacity. The Chungju Dam is expected to be
completed on schedule by end 1985. The power generated by ISWACO replaces
more expensive power generation using coal and oil. Therefore, the full
power capacity is expected to be used as soon as it is completed.
Tariffs and Other Charges
13.       Charges for power are based on kWh used (W 13.9/kWh in 1981).
ISWACO has been discussing with KEPCO, and expects to increase these charges
to W 18.4/kWh by end-1983. Under the proposed financial covenant (para.
5.09), these charges are expected to be increased to W 35.6 /kWh by 1986
(97% in real terms between 1982-86). Charges for water are based on the
water used by municipalities or industries which expanded their capacity
after the construction of ISWACO's regulating dams. Average charges are
W 1.9/cu m (W 2.7 in the Nagdong River) which are expected to increase to
W 3.1/cu m by 1986 (26% more in real terms). The water made available by
the barrage is assumed billed at a price equal to the marginal cost. For
financial projections this price is assumed at W 7/cu m in 1983 prices,
which is the marginal cost at 9% discount. Irrigation charges are based on
the number of irrigated hectares. Under past policies, nc charges were
levied on agricultural users, but now charges of W 20,880 er ha are being
applied, and the number of hectares billed is assumed to i crease from only
87 ha in 1982 to 25,000 ha by 1988.

ANNEX 11
Page 4
Expenses
14.       Expenses other than depreciation represent only 31% of the
revenues of the Dams Division. The main expense is personnel, which
accounts for 46% of the operating expenses before depreciation. The number
of personnel is expected to increase 40% in real terms in 1986 (when the
Chungju Dam enters into operation), and 20% more by 1988 with the operation
of the Hapcheon Dam and the barrage. Power expenses to pump-back water
during non-peak hours are estimated to increase by 15% in real terms between
1984-87. Materials are forecasted based on the new assets entering into
operation.
Flow of Funds
15.       The Dams Division forecasts large investments ($1,090 million
between 1983-88 including $310 million in 1984) in three main projects:  (a)
the Chungju Dam, financed by OECF, the Bank and Government contributions;
(b) the Nagdong Barrage financed by the Bank, sales of reclaimed land,
internal cash contributions and Government grants, with the latter financing
about 21% of the total project, corresponding to those investments to be
recovered by the Government through established taxes (Annex 10, Table 3);
and (c) the Hapcheon Dam to be financed by OECF ($100 million), Government
grants and local loans. ISWACO's internal generation would finance about
19% of the total investment during the period 1983-88. This is remarkable,
since ISWACO's capital expenditure in new dams during this period would be
about three times the revalued net assets of the Dams Division. ISWACO is
planning to build another 6 dams during the next ten years. However, no
decision has been taken, financing plans have not been prepared and the
feasibility studies are not complete. Therefore, the investments (other
works) included in the financial projections are only tentative.
Balance
16.       Accounts receivable are forecast at 10% of the amount billed.
Other fixed assets include those assets which are not for rate of return
calculation (agriculture, flood, etc). Contractor payables represent one
month of annual capital expenditures.

SECOND WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Busan City Complementary Works
1.        Water Supply Extensions.  The city of Busan Water and Construction
Bureaus will finance and build before December 31, 1987 (see also Table 1) a
water supply extension scheme Stage I (500,000 CMD), which would provide
water to 95% of Busan's population by 1987, comprising:
(a) a new water intake and pumping station at Maeri (3 km
upstream of the present Mulgeum water intake) with an installed
pumping capacity of 1,600 hp;
(b) one raw water pumping main, 2.2 m diameter and 6.5 km long,
from Maeri to supply the new treatment plant at Deogsan on the
west bank of the Nagdong River;
(c) the first stage (500,000 CMD) of the water treatment plant
at Deogsan comprising conventional treatment facilities,
ancillary building and staff quarters;
(d)  the first stage (about 30 km) of primary distribution
pipelines, of which about half are 2.2 m and the balance
between 600 and 1,500 mm diameter;
(e) two booster pump stations with an installed pumping capacity of
4,800 hp and 9,400 hp at Sasang and Mandlek, respectively; and
(f) engineering and land acquisition to implement the above works.
2.        Estimated costs of these works at 1983 prices are W 72 billion to
be financed by OECF (W20.0 billion, 27.8%), internally generated funds
(W 23.5 billion, 32.6%), MOC loans (W7.0 billion, 9.7%), and bonds (W 21.5
billion, 29.9%). Busan expects to complete these works by mid-1986. Secon-
dary and tertiary distribution works for W 17,200 million (about 10 km)
would also be executed during 1984-87, financed by internal contributions
by Busan-s WB and house connection charges.
3.        Busan would also finance and build before December 31, 1987:  the
Jang Lim area sewer interceptor /1 which will intercept all sewage and
/1 Busan City is also planning to build sewerage and sewage and industrial
wastes treatment schemes to serve all the major city-developed catchment
areas. Work is ongoing on the construction of the Yongho Treatment
Plant to serve the main city central and harbor areas, and the S<>_g
sewerage scheme which includes a sewage treatr nt plant to control
pollution of the main bay (expected to be comfieted by 1986).

industrial wastes presently being discharged into the Nagdong river from
Hwamyoung in the north to Jang Lim in the south, including the major Sasang
Industrial Complex. This includes 15.5 km of interceptor sewer and box
culvert and lift pump stations.  Minor modifications necessary to existing
storm water pumping stations will also be incorporated in these works.
These works form part of the Busan City Master Plan. Detailed engineering
will be completed by June 1984 and construction started in 1984 for
completion in 1987. Estimated costs of the above works at 1983 prices are
W 12.5 billion ($16 million) to be financed 20% by City funds, 60% by
foreign and commercial loans and bonds and 20% by Government.
4.        The City is also planning to complete the sewage treatment plant
at Jang Lim at a cost of W 20.5 billion (at 1983 prices) as part of its
pollution abatement activities. These outfall treatment works are being
designed to meet OOE effluent quality standards of 40 ppm BOD and 30 ppm
suspended solids and comprise primary and secondary treatment and sludge
digestion facilities to treat 76,000 CMD of domestic and industrial wastes
from a 50 sq km catchment area bordering the Nagdong river.
