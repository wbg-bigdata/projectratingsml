Agency
Financing Data      IBRD Variable Spread Loan, USD300 million

Operation Type      The first single tranche operation of a two-year programmatic DPL series.

Main Policy Areas   Public Financial Management, Poverty Reduction and Public Service Delivery
                    Since 2004, the three previous DPL series (DPLs 1-4, 5-6 and 7-8) have helped the Government of
                    Indonesia (GoI) towards achieving its medium-term growth and poverty reduction objectives. This
                    new INSTANSI DPL series is expected to contribute to the achievement of the following targeted
                    outcomes by 2014:
                    •     Greater integrity and more effective use and management of public funds (continued
                          improvements in Central Government ministries and agencies [K/Ls] receiving an ‘unqualified’
                          audit opinion from 63 percent for FY2010 to 84 percent for FY2013; and with the percentage of
                          total capital expenditure disbursed by end of Q2 increased from 18 percent in 2012 to 22 percent
                          in FY2014);
Key Outcome
                    •     Strengthened GoI efforts to reduce poverty and vulnerability, through better informed and
Indicators
                          evidence-based policy and program decisions (with the percentage of social assistance programs
                          in Central Government expenditure increasing from 3.3 percent in FY2011 to 4.5 percent in
                          FY2013).

                    As discussed in the following sections, the proposed Institutional, Tax Administration, Social and
                    Investment (INSTANSI) DPL is a beginning of a new series of two-year DPLs, which continues the
                    reform efforts supported by the three previous DPL series that have been implemented since 2004. The
                    Investment Climate pillar of the previous DPL series has been moved to two separate DPLs that will
                    also be presented in 2012, i.e. Connectivity (Connectivity DPL) and Financial Sector and Investment
                    Climate Reform and Modernization (FIRM DPL).
                    The overall goal of the DPL program is to assist the GOI achieve its medium-term growth and poverty
                    reduction objectives through strengthened public finance management, and poverty alleviation and
                    service delivery efforts. Policy reforms supported by this operation will focus on the following pillars:

                    (i)   strengthening public financial management (PFM) through improvements in the medium-
                          term results orientation of the budget process, the introduction of an enhanced automated budget
                          and treasury system (SPAN) and ICT services, improved budget execution within Central
                          Government, strengthened state assets management, improved Government accounting and audit
                          functions, as well as improved tax administration; and
Program
Development         (ii) enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts through improved governance and
Objective(s) and         institutional accountability, better measurement and targeting of the poor in social assistance
Contribution to          programs, improved household-targeted poverty reduction programs, i.e. Jamkesmas, and
CPS                      community-based poverty reduction programs, i.e. the National Program for Community
                         Empowerment (PNPM).
                    As highlighted in the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) issued in
                    February 2011, the DPL series continues to be at the center of the WBG support in strengthening
                    Indonesia’s Central Government institutions and systems, a key cross-sectoral engagement theme
                    under the 2009-2012 CPS. The CPSPR recognizes that the DPLs have helped the GOI’s efforts to
                    improve the effectiveness and accountability of Central Government institutions and systems under the
                    long-term objective to enhance public financial management and governance to increase the
                    development impact of priority budget expenditures.



                                                                                                                    7
                 •    High and volatile energy subsidy costs could significantly reduce fiscal space for other priority
                 programs and undermine medium-term plans. The 2012 Budget was revised to provide for the
                 possibility of increasing subsidized fuel prices, if international oil prices were 15 percent above the
                 level assumed in the budget, combined with compensatory cash transfers to the poor. However, with
                 international oil prices falling, this condition is unlikely to be met in 2012. Nontheless, fuel subsidy
                 spending is projected to rise significantly in 2013, reflecting increased consumption. This imposes a
                 substantial budget rigidity and opportunity cost in terms of spending on key development priorities.
                 In the run-up to the presidential election in 2014, it is unlikely that the GOI will implement a
                 relatively unpopular fuel price hike, unless costs escalate more significantly. The DPL seeks to
                 partially mitigate this risk by promoting more transparent medium-term and performance based
                 budgeting (PBB), which should better highlight some of the policy trade-offs, as well as
                 strengthening the ability of compensatory programs to better target the poor and vulnerable groups.
                 •    The initial focus of PFM reforms, on enhancingexpenditure controls and oversight, is likely to
                 make budget spending more difficult in the short-term, potentially undermining support for the
                 reforms. Indonesia has made significant strides in PFM with increasing transparency, expenditure
                 controls, and independent oversight (as shown by the 2011 PEFA update). However, the tightening of
                 controls has exacerbated existing problems of budget execution, particularly for capital spending, and
                 increased the risk aversion of Government officials, potentially delaying much needed spending. To
                 mitigate this risk, the DPL seeks to balance the further strengthening of expenditure controls and
                 compliance, with efforts to streamline procedures and improve the quality of spending (e.g. with the
                 MTEF, PBB or better targeting for poverty spending) as policy makers look for more rapid results.
                 •    Some recent policy outcomes have tended to be protectionist, generating concerns about the
                 increasing risk of political pressure by vested interests. Recent policy moves in investment, trade and
                 mineral sector regulation could be viewed as moving away from efficiency and favoring special
                 interests. The risk is that such lobbying could undermine progress in other key reform areas, such as
                 taxes where the compliance rates are already low, especially as political tensions build in the run-up to
Risks and Risk
                 the 2014 elections. The DPL program is expected to help put in place a mechanism for stronger GoI
Mitigation
                 coordination and consultation on key reform areas, thereby providing more regulatory certainty.
                 •    The multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional capacities create a
                 challenge in coordinating and implementing the reform efforts. The reforms supported by the
                 INSTANSI DPL are driven by priorities that were developed and articulated formally through
                 dialogue and consensus within the Government; hence their implementation helps to further enhance
                 coordination between various ministries and agencies. The overall commitment to and ownership of
                 reforms remain strong, and the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs has performed well in
                 ensuring consistent and effective cross-ministerial coordination. The DPL program has also helped
                 strengthen the capacity of the various institutions involved, which is complemented by other Bank
                 instruments, including investment projects, technical assistance and AAA and trust fund support.
                 •    The external environment is fraught with uncertainty and shocks could offset some of the recent
                 benefits from strong growth and divert attention from longer-term reforms. Shifts in market sentiment
                 could result in sudden, large and a potentially disruptive reversal of capital inflows, while the external
                 accounts, and growth outlook, remain sensitive to global commodity prices and demand, particularly
                 from China. Similarly, increases in domestic and international food prices would negatively impact
                 poor and vunerable groups. However, the Government has developed a track record in precautionary
                 and proactive measures during the recent global financial turmoil, which should help limit the impact
                 of such turbulence on Indonesia. These include a sound macroeconomic and fiscal framework, the
                 use of trade measures, as in 2008, to mitigate the impact of rising food prices; the use of budgetary
                 sources to expand social protection programs and to intervene in stabilizing food prices; and
                 Presidential Decree No. 5/2011 aimed at safeguarding domestic rice production against extreme
                 weather. Furthermore, the recent PERISAI DPL, approved in May 2012, along with parallel facilities
                 from other development partners, explicitly aim to mitigate GoI financing concerns in the face of a
                 crisis. In addition, by supporting improvements in the targeting of social protection and the quality of
                 public spending, notably for capital spending, this DPL could help to enhance the effectiveness of the
                 Government’s response to future shocks.

                                        I.      INTRODUCTION

    1. The proposed Institutional, Tax Administration, Social and Investment Development Policy
Loan (INSTANSI DPL ) to Indonesia, for USD 300 million, marks the beginning of a new series of
annual single-tranche DPLs. The proposed operation is deeply rooted on the previous DPL series that
consisted of: (i) first DPL series (DPLs 1-4), which was implemented from 2004 to 2007 and anchored to
the FY04-08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS): (ii) second DPL series (DPLs 5-6) that was implemented
from 2008-2009; and (iii) third DPL series, which was initially set out as a three-year DPL series (DPLs 7-9)
to be implemented from 2010-2012. Initially focused on supporting the GoI’s macroeconomic stabilization
efforts, the previous DPL series covered a broad range of reform efforts aimed at improving the investment
climate, strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery.
Given that the reform agenda is far from finished and an extension of the reforms is needed, the GoI has
requested to terminate the ongoing third DPL series (DPLs 7-9) a year earlier and present the INSTANSI
DPL as a new, two-year series. This new DPL series is still anchored under the FY09-12 Country
Partnership Strategy, and continues to deepen the reforms supported under the previous DPL series.

    2. The INSTANSI DPL continues to support the GoI’s policy and institutional reforms that are
aimed towards strengthening its public finance management and enhancing its poverty alleviation and
service delivery efforts. The INSTANSI DPL policy actions continue to be aligned with the Government’s
development priorities, as outlined in the latest five year plan (RPJMN 2010-2014), surrounding the
following pillars:

i)        strengthening public financial management through improved results orientation in the budget
          process, linking budget formulation and execution to the Integrated Financial Management System
          (Sistem Perbendaharaan dan Anggaran Negara or SPAN) with improved provision of IT services,
          streamlined budget execution and management of budget authority within the Central Government,
          strengthened management of state assets, improved Government accounting and audit functions, as
          well as improved tax administration; and

ii)       enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts through improving governance and
          institutional accountability, improving poverty measurements and targeting of the poor, improving
          poverty reduction programs at the household and community levels, i.e. Jamkesmas and the
          National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM).

    3. In developing the operation, the Bank and the Government considered several design
alternatives, including the possibility of supporting such reforms through a single multisectoral DPL.
The INSTANSI DPL stems from the result of these discussions. The GoI has requested that the overall DPL
series that has been implemented since 2004 be restructured to allow for broader Bank engagement on
priority sectors in line with the GoI’s own strategic plans, particularly those related to public financial
management and poverty, connectivity and financial and private sector. The sectoral approach aims to
maximize synergies across the Bank’s program in Indonesia, increase ownership of the reforms by the
relevant institutions, and improve targeting of complementary technical assistance programs. As a result of
the DPL restructuring, this year the Bank will support the following three sectoral DPLs for a total amount
of about USD 500 million. These include:

      •   The Institutional, Tax Administration, Social and Investment Development Policy Loan
          (INSTANSI-DPL, formerly named “DPL 9?). This operation will focus on strengthening
          public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation efforts to improve the
          quality of fiscal spending.




                                                                                                           9
    •   The Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform and Modernization (FIRM) DPL.
        This operation aims to promote the development of a sound, efficient and inclusive
        financial sector and accelerate investment in order to support GOI in achieving its economic
        expansion and poverty reduction goals, by supporting reforms to improve financial system
        stability, promote financial sector diversification, enhance financial inclusion and support
        investment climate regulatory reform.

    •   The Connectivity DPL. This operation supports reforms to reduce domestic logistics costs
        and strengthen inclusive development, by: (i) strengthening national coordination and
        regulation; (ii) strengthening intra-island connectivity; (iii) improving inter-island
        connectivity; and (iv) improving international connectivity.

    4. The overall focus of the INSTANSI DPL, Connectivity DPL and FIRM DPL is consistent with
the World Bank's Development Policy Review (2008), and are fully aligned with the 2009-2012
Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR). Both of these strategic Bank documents
highlight that Indonesia’s main challenge is not so much the design of appropriate policies or programs or
the raising of financing, but rather strengthening the institutions in charge of implementing those policies
and programs so that their developmental impact is enhanced. This is indeed the ultimate objective of the
three proposed DPL operations, within the areas of public financial management and poverty alleviation,
financial inclusion and investment climate, and connectivity.

    5. With the restructuring of the DPL series, the proposed INSTANSI DPL becomes more
streamlined, focusing on two core policy areas: strengthening public financial management and
enhancing poverty alleviation to improve the quality of fiscal spending. The INSTANSI DPL no longer
focuses on improving the investment climate, the policy actions of which have been incorporated into the
new Connectivity and FIRM DPLs, while actions related to reducing the tax burden and improving tax
administration have shifted to the strengthening public financial management pillar. Actions under the
poverty pillar that are aimed at enhancing financial inclusion are addressed under the FIRM DPL.

     6. The Government’s ongoing policy and institutional reform priorities cut across the three
different DPLs. For example, in the area of connectivity, the Connectivity DPL supports policy and
institutional reform efforts that are aimed at reducing domestic logistics costs and improving trade
facilitation. In the area of public financial management, the INSTANSI DPL continues to support important
institutional changes to help ensure that Government plans, budgets and tax administration are more results-
oriented and therefore achieve better development outcomes. And in the area of poverty and social services,
the GoI continues its ambitious reform to improve the implementation of its anti-poverty programs by
extracting program beneficiary lists for priority Cluster 1 programs (PKH and Jamkesmas) from the unified
database, which should help enhance their targeting and ultimately increase their impact on the poor.
Whereas in financial sector, the FIRM DPL supports policy and institutional reforms that aim to reinforce
financial system stability, promote financial sector diversification, enhance financial inclusion and
strengthen the investment climate.

    7. Indonesia has made remarkable progress over the past decade in terms of macroeconomic and
political stability, which supports the proposed INSTANSI DPL operation. Output growth has been
strong and consistent, averaging 5.5 percent per year over 2002 to 2011, grounded on increasing private
sector investment, strong domestic consumption and generally sustainable external surpluses. Although
financial markets remain vulnerable to changes in international investor sentiment, external imbalances have
declined rapidly as corporate and financial sector balance sheets were repaired. Increasing revenues,
combined with restrained expenditures, have contributed to low fiscal deficits. In an environment of
controlled inflation and rising incomes, Indonesian citizens’ living standards have improved and poverty
levels have fallen, although many remain close to the poverty line. In addition, as the result of a decade of


                                                                                                          10
relatively successful political and institutional reforms, Indonesia in 2012 is a highly competitive,
decentralized electoral democracy. A system of checks and balances between legislative, judicial, and
executive branches is increasingly in place, with no one branch of Government able to dominate, and few
institutional outcomes ‘guaranteed’. The overall macroeconomic situation and policy framework, as well as
prospects for both growth and continued prudent fiscal policy, warrant continued support for Indonesia’s
structural and institutional reforms through the INSTANSI DPL.

     8. The INSTANSI DPL is expected to further enhance coordination and implementation of GoI
reforms in key policy areas, which is critical for accelerating growth to 7 percent and beyond, and
continuing improvements in social outcomes over the medium term. For planned increases in fiscal
expenditures to lead to improvements in public services, Indonesia will need more effective and accountable
institutions that can translate available resources into better development outcomes. This will be particularly
important as Indonesia embarks on a period of second generation reforms to provide, for example, more
sophisticated services in infrastructure, better education, and a sustainable health system. Improvements in
the public financial management and poverty alleviation, supported by the INSTANSI DPL, are expected to
not only improve the quality of fiscal spending, but also the quality of social outcomes overall.

     9. Overall progress achieved under the DPL program continues to be satisfactory. The DPL
program has established a good track record in advancing key policy and institutional reforms. These
reforms have supported Indonesia’s achievement in terms of accelerated economic growth and poverty
reduction. Supporting Indonesia’s relatively ambitious policy reforms is at the core of the World Bank’s
program in Indonesia. 1 Over the past few years, in addition to the core DPL series, the World Bank has also
been supporting policy reforms in the infrastructure sector (through the Infrastructure DPL, closed in FY11),
the Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF DDO) and the PERISAI DPL-DDO, both of which provide
critical support to Indonesia during periods of heightened global financial uncertainty. The proposed
INSTANSI DPL also continues to complement the World Bank assistance to Indonesia, which is provided
through a variety of instruments (i.e. investment projects, technical assistance, and advisory services).

    10. The INSTANSI DPL continues to be led by and based on GoI priorities. In addition to the
continuous policy dialogue that takes place between the different GoI counterparts and the World Bank, a
series of formal dialogues took place and will continue throughout the preparation of the INSTANSI DPL,
in order to formulate the supported policy actions and to assess their progress. The Japan International
Cooperation Agency/ Government of Japan, which is also providing program support, along with other
development partners, participate actively in the consultation process. Technical assistance is often provided
by different development partners in support of the policy actions identified by the Government. The
INSTANSI DPL was negotiated with the GOI in October 2012 and is scheduled to be presented to the
World Bank Board in November 2012. All policy actions have been completed.

                                          II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

    11. Indonesia has made remarkable progress over the past decade in terms of macroeconomic and
political stability. Output growth has been strong and consistent, averaging 5.5 percent per year over 2002
to 2011. This has been grounded on increasing private sector investment, strong domestic consumption and
generally sustainable external surpluses. International commodity demand has been supportive, but the non-
tradable sectors have accounted for the majority of output growth. External imbalances have declined
rapidly as corporate and financial sector balance sheets were repaired, although financial markets remain
vulnerable to changes in international investor sentiment. Increasing revenues, combined with restrained
expenditures, have contributed to low fiscal deficits. In an environment of controlled inflation and rising
incomes, Indonesian citizens’ living standards have improved and poverty levels have fallen, although many

remain close to the poverty line. In addition, as the result of a decade of relatively successful political and
institutional reforms, Indonesia in 2012 is a highly competitive, decentralized electoral democracy. A
system of checks and balances between legislative, judicial, and executive branches is increasingly in place.

    12. Compared with other countries in the region, Indonesia was less affected by the global
economic downturn of 2008-09 and growth has since moved back to, and above, pre-crisis levels. GDP
growth declined from 6 percent in 2008 to 4.6 percent in 2009 but subsequently recovered to 6.1 percent
over 2010 and 6.5 percent in 2011. The social impact of the crisis was also limited, there were few reports of
layoffs, poverty and unemployment rates continued to fall and households’ spending power was supported
by inflation slowing to decade lows. This relatively strong performance was supported by the health of
public and financial sector balance sheets and the strength of domestic demand, particularly private
consumption. Indonesia’s export mix, focused on commodities, benefited from international price rises and
demand for raw materials from China and other emerging economies. Policymakers also took proactive
measures during the crisis, including a fiscal stimulus package, supportive monetary policy and a significant
contingent support package from development partners in the event of a worsening of the crisis.
Nevertheless, the fiscal deficit came in below target in 2009, 2010 and 2011 which, combined with strong
GDP growth, supported the downward trajectory of Government debt to just below 25 percent of GDP,
down from over 90 percent in 2000. Indonesia’s sovereign ratings have been upgraded and in late 2011 and
early 2012 were moved back to investment grade by Fitch and Moody’s for the first time since 1997/1998.
The improved creditworthiness, along with high relative yields and the levels of liquidity in some developed
economies, contributed to the strong portfolio inflows into Indonesia over 2010 and the first half of 2011.

    A. The Current State of the Indonesian Economy

     13. Supported by domestic demand, Indonesia’s recent growth performance has remained robust
although, as in other countries in the region, there have been spillovers from the deterioration in the
global economy and volatility in international financial markets. Growth in 2011 moved up to 6.5
percent year-on-year, the highest annual growth rate since 1996, from 6.1 percent in 2010 (Figure 1). In the
first half of 2012 growth remained solid, at 6.3 percent and 6.4 percent in the first two quarters, despite the
weakness in the external environment. Domestic demand, particularly private consumption and investment,
has continued to drive growth. However, weakening external demand has subtracted from growth since late
2011, in line with the deterioration in the trade and current account balances discussed below. Recent
growth has also been broad-based across sectors, as the strength of domestic demand continues to support
growth in key services sectors, such as trade, transport and communications. Within the tradable sectors,
non-oil and gas manufacturing has also performed relatively strongly.

     14. Inflation has remained relatively stable over the past year as food price spikes have unwound
and the likelihood of subsidized fuel price hikes has decreased. Sharp increases in food prices
contributed to rising headline CPI inflation in late 2010. But, as these shocks unwound, inflation declined
over 2011 and reached a two-year low of 3.6 percent year-on-year in February 2012. Since then inflation has
moved up gradually, to 4.6 percent year-on-year in July 2012, due mainly to higher food prices. Core
inflation has also remained low at 4.3 percent in July. Expectations of higher prices associated with a
potential adjustment of subsidized fuel prices have also subsided with the reduced likelihood of such a
policy change (see discussion below).

    15. Following strong inflows over 2010 and 2011, overall balance of payments outflows have been
seen since Q3 2011 (Figure 2). These represent the first quarterly deficits since the end of 2008. Initially, in
the second half of 2011, outflows were due primarily to the reversal of inflows on the volatile capital
account. Subsequently, the main driver of the net balance of payments outflow has been the diminishing
current account balance, moving into deficit in the fourth quarter of 2011 and hitting a record low since the
Asian crisis in the second quarter of 2012. As a result of of these trends, and with BI taking measures to
stabilize the exchange rate, international reserves have also fallen over 2012, moving to USD109.0 billion at
end-August 2012, around 2.2 times the level of recorded short-term external debt by remaining maturity.

    16. In recent years, as in other emerging markets, portfolio capital flows to Indonesia have been
affected by the swings in international investor risk aversion and concern over global growth
prospects. Periods of heightened international risk aversion have contributed to portfolio capital outflows
from Indonesia, primarily of local currency fixed income securities (Figure 3). Non-resident investor
holdings of local assets are relatively high, for example, their holdings of rupiah-denominated tradable
Government securities (SUNs), at USD23.7 billion at end-July 2012, accounted for 28.4 percent of the
outstanding stock. As discussed below Bank Indonesia has introduced a number of measures in recent years
to address the risks of short-term portfolio outflows. Direct investment inflows, attracted by Indonesia’s
large and growing domestic market, its natural resources and relatively low manufacturing labor costs, has
been rising gradually since 2010. Inflows moderated in the second half of 2011 but remained relatively
strong, moving total inflows up to USD18.9 billion in 2011 from USD13.8 billion in 2010. FDI continued to

be solid at USD 8.2 billion in the first half of 2012 despite slowing from USD10.3 billion in the same period
2011.

     17. The trend move into a current account deficit reflects to a large extent the strength of
Indonesia’s domestic demand set against weakening external demand. These factors have contributed to
a decline in the goods trade surplus while there has been a continuation of the large services deficit and
rising outflows on the income balance (in line with strong FDI). Both declining commodity prices and
volumes have also contributed to falling export growth as the monthly trade balance moved into deficit from
April to July 2012. Imports have also come down, with a lag as in 2009, in part likely because a capital and
intermediate goods imports are related to exports. External debt-to-GDP has been on a downward trend
(moving to 27.3 percent at end-June 2012 from 35.9 percent at end-2006) and is likely to remain stable
despite a higher current account deficit (see IMF 2012 Article IV external debt sustainability assessment).
There is, though, the risk that, in the current fragile external environment, a further widening of the deficit
raises concerns over external financing needs. Should weaker export demand persist, this risk should be
mitigated by a reduction in imports used to produce exports and the impacts of price adjustment through the
weakening of the exchange rate. On the capital account side, it is encouraging that, as discussed above, FDI
has, to date, remained solid (accounting for a rising share of capital inflows).

    18. The volatility in international capital markets has been transmitted to local asset prices,
although domestic banking sector performance remains solid. As in international markets, over the past
year Indonesian equities have seen sharp swings in prices. The rupiah has also come under pressure,
depreciating 12.9 percent against the US dollar to Rp 9,573 per USD from the beginning of August 2011 to
30 August 2012. Local currency government bond yields have risen gradually over 2012 as a mixed
consequence of the expectation on higher future inflation, related to the potential hike in the subsidized fuel
price, and then rising international risk aversion. However, they remain at relatively low levels historically
(with the five-year yields at around 5.5 percent). Overall banking sector indicators have remained solid. The
capital adequacy ratio, while down slightly, remains at 17 percent. Non-performing loans were down half a
percentage point over the year to 2.2 percent. (For further details on recent performance and policy
challenges in the sector see the Financial Sector and Investment Climate Reform And Modernization DPL
program document).

     19. Strong growth over the past five years is reflected in a significant improvement in Indonesia’s
poverty and employment numbers. Indonesia’s poverty rate, measured at the national poverty line, fell
from 16.6 percent in March 2007 to 12.0 percent in March 2012. Both urban and rural poverty rates have
been declining and the decline was spatially uniform. However, the 0.5 percentage point decline since
March 2011 is the lowest drop in ten years, reflecting the slowing rate of poverty reduction evident in the
last four years The poverty rates over this period for male-headed and female-headed households are similar
(although female-headed household poverty experienced considerably more volatility earlier in the decade).
Despite this positive progress, nearly 40 percent of Indonesians live on 1.5 times poverty-line expenditure
(or less), meaning there are many who remain vulnerable to impoverishment. There remains the challenge of
ensuring that GDP growth translates into sufficient creation of quality jobs. Employment growth of 3.2
percent year-on-year was seen in August 2010, falling to 1.4 percent in February 2012. There were changes
in the weighting series between August 2010 and February 2011 which makes employment growth
comparisons for February 2010 and August 2011 difficult. The official open unemployment rate has
continued to trend downwards, falling to 6.3 percent in February 2012 from 6.6 percent in August a year
before (or 6.8 percent on February 2011).

    B. The Macroeconomic Policy Framwork


    20. Bank Indonesia has shifted its monetary policy stance in line with international developments
and the prospects for the path of administered fuel prices. In anticipation of a worsening external
environment, and with inflation declining, Bank Indonesia loosened monetary policy at the end of 2011 and
beginning of 2012. Rate cuts in October, one of the earliest policy responses in the region, were followed by
further reductions in November 2011 and February 2012 respectively. Furthermore, the lower bound of
Bank Indonesia’s operational corridor (the overnight deposit facility rate) was also widened in September
2011 and January 2012, moving it to 200 basis points below the policy rate. With the proposal to raise
subsidized fuel prices, inflation expectations picked up and BI indicated it was ready to shift its stance,
including through measures to manage short-term liquidity. Although inflation expectations have since
receded, in August 2012 BI increased the overnight deposit facility rate by 25 basis points, in part to support
the exchange rate in the face of the current account outflows. As in other economies, the central bank has
also made increasing use of a range of macroprudential tools. For example, in the context of strong credit
growth (above 25 percent year-on-year) it has imposed maximum loan-to-value ratios for housing loans and
minimum down payment on vehicle purchases.

    21. In terms of exchange rate policy, the Rupiah has depreciated gradually over the year with
interventions to manage volatility. In early May 2012 there were reports of shortages in onshore US dollar
liquidity and BI has responded through a number of measures to support FX liquidity, for example
introducing a foreign currency “Term Deposit Instrument?. These measures follow earlier policy actions
aimed at preventing disruptive capital outflows, such as example, reinstating limits on short-term offshore
borrowing of banks and raising holding periods on SBIs. With the rising demand for dollars given the
overall balance of payment outflows, there has been a gradual depreciation in the exchange rate over the
year with the authorities underscoring their commitment to exchange rate flexibility in the 2012 IMF Article
IV.

    22. Fiscal deficits and debt continue to be conservative but the allocation of spending could be
improved and, with subsidy spending increasing, the deficit is projected to rise in 2012. The realized
(audited) 2011 Government deficit of Rp 84.4 trillion (1.1 percent of GDP) came in well below the revised
Budget level of Rp 151 trillion (2.1 percent of GDP), as under-spending in core Government programs more
than offset high spending on energy subsidies. The revised 2012 Budget increased the deficit for the year to
2.2 percent of GDP, up from 1.5 percent of GDP in the original budget. The upward revisions to the 2012



                                                                                                            15
revenue and expenditure numbers were both driven by the increase in the assumed oil price. In light of the
likely higher spending on energy subsidies the Government proposed a one-third increase in the subsidized
fuel price in its draft revised Budget. However, the approved revised Budget authorized the Government to
make such an increase, but only if the six-month average Indonesia crude oil price was 15 percent higher
than the USD105 assumed in the Budget. The revised Budget also included additional spending on
temporary compensating programs in the event of a fuel price increase, including a cash transfer to the poor
combined with anti-poverty programs at the community level and public transport subsidies while
infrastructure spending also received a boost. As in most previous years, realization of expenditures on core
programs is likely to come in below budget and revenues continue to grow strongly, although oil and gas
non-tax revenue are lower than initially projected due to lower oil lifting. Latest Government projections are
for the 2012 Budget deficit to come in Rp 179 trillion, slightly below the revised Budget level in nominal
terms but still 2.2 percent of GDP. In terms of budget transparency, the central Government publishes its
annual Budget in a timely manner. It is usually posted on the Ministry of Finance website within one week
after the Budget has been passed.

    23. For 2013, the Government’s recently proposed budget projects a narrowing of the deficit to
1.6 percent of GDP, or Rp 150.2 trillion. The reduced deficit reflects the Government’s intention to
increase revenue to GDP (from 15.9 percent to 16.2 percent) as efforts continue to broaden the tax base,
while at the same time reducing nominal spending relative to GDP (to 17.9 percent of GDP vs. 18.2 percent
in 2012). Despite this conservative overall spending stance, and an oil price assumption in 2013 of USD100
per barrel, USD5 lower than the 2012 assumption, there is a significant increase in energy subsidy spending,
driven by growing consumption and a weaker exchange rate; the energy subsidy allocation is 62.9 (35.8)
percent higher than the level in the original (revised) 2012 Budget. Total subsidies (rising 29 percent on
revised 2012 levels to Rp 316.1 trillion) along with personnel spending (rising 13.6 percent from 2012 to Rp
241.1 trillion) thus continue to account for the lion’s share of total public expenditure. Capital spending,
while projected to rise a further 15 percent in 2013, continues to run into implementation constraints and
will likely lag infrastructure development needs.

     24. The decision not to increase subsidized fuel prices on 1 April in the approved 2012 Budget was
as a missed opportunity and there remains the need to redirect this spending to more pressing
development needs to support medium-term growth and development and to address the distortions
and inefficiencies of the current subsidies. The fall in international oil prices since early May 2012 made
it highly unlikely that the condition for a hike in subsidized fuel prices will be met. An electricity price hike
planned for 2012 that would have limited spending on electricity subsidies has also been postponed. In the
proposed 2013 Budget, there is no indication of a fuel price adjustment although it is proposed that
electricity tariffs be increased by 15 percent on average for higher wattage customers (although details of
this mechanism are to be decided and the proposal is subject to Parliamentary approval). From the
perspective of fiscal sustainability a higher deficit is manageable given Indonesia’s strong initial debt
position and conservative deficits-to-GDP. However, in the case that oil prices move up sharply, the risk of
hitting Indonesia’s three percent of GDP deficit limit could prompt a tightening in spending in key
development areas. Furthermore, it is the opportunity cost of the current spending on subsidies that is of
particular concern given other pressing development needs, along with the fact the fuel subsidies are an
ineffective and poorly-targeted method of assisting the poor (with the vast majority of the benefits going to
richer households who own cars and motorbikes).

    25. Low deficits, budget discipline, prudent fiscal policy and high nominal GDP growth have
enabled Indonesia to reduce its public debt burden significantly. In the past ten years, Indonesia’s public
debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen to slightly below 25 percent in 2011, from around 90 percent in 2000. This
improvement in Indonesia’s debt position stands out among other economies in the region and has been
possible through a combination of fiscal conservatism and high nominal GDP growth. Indonesia’s
Government debt-to-GDP ratio is likely to continue falling in the years ahead and the downward debt
dynamics appear to be robust to a plausible range of macroeconomic shocks, in line with those suffered over
the past 10 years (see Annex 5). This relatively positive picture focuses on solvency issues rather than
liquidity and roll-over risks, which may occur even if solvency is solid. Indonesia’s financing position is
supported by cash reserves from previous over-financing and the still conservative fiscal deficits. However,
as highlighted above, a sharp tightening in global and domestic financial markets, as seen in 2008, would
potentially limit the Government’s ability to meet gross financing needs on reasonable terms. Recognizing
this risk the Government has raised a sizeable share of financing early in the year (with gross securities
issuance at end-August at 73.4 percent of the full-year target under the revised Budget) and has put in place
contingent financing from donor partners, including the World Bank’s PERISAI operation.

    26. In response to the deterioration in the current account deficit in Q2 2012, Bank Indonesia and
the Government also announced a number of policy responses. These policies were designed to adjust
the current account deficit to “a sustainable level to support the momentum of the national economy?. For
example, Bank Indonesia will focus on stabilizing the Rupiah “in accordance with its fundamental
conditions? while the measures announced by the Government include support for boosting exports but
appear to be aimed mainly at limiting dependence on imports and supporting domestic production. It is
unclear whether such policies are likely to be effective, and they could introduce distortions over the
medium-term. Furthermore, it is important not to over-react to the recent current account deficit numbers or
make policy missteps that could adversely impact investor sentiment, thereby actually putting more pressure
on external balances. Allowing for a gradual weakening of the exchange rate, as has been seen recently,
could also facilitate an improvement in the trade balance.

   27. In summary, the overall macroeconomic situation and policy framework warrant continued
support for Indonesia’s structural and institutional reforms through the INSTANSI DPL.

    C. Indonesia’s Economic Outlook

     28. Risks to the outlook for the Indonesian economy remain weighted to the downside, and are
likely to remain high in 2013. Global financial markets and portfolio flows to Indonesia remain volatile,
with the global economic outlook highly uncertain, with weaker growth in high income economies,
moderating commodity prices and continued financial market turbulence. The direct impact of lower growth
in the EU on Indonesia’s economy is likely to be limited, as Indonesia’s exports are relatively diversified by
export destination direct linkages. However, a further deterioration in international financing conditions or
in commodity prices and demand relative to the baseline scenario would be of particular concern. A seizing
up of global US dollar liquidity could have important implications for Indonesia’s financial sector, and
potentially have spillovers to the real economy, through investment and trade financing, and to Government
financing costs. Lower international commodity prices or demand could affect Indonesia’s GDP growth via
their impact not only on trade (with commodity exports accounting for around two-thirds of the value of
exports) but through domestic consumption and investment, as well as lower fiscal revenues. However, a
sharp recovery in oil prices, for example due to supply shocks, could also refocus attention on the cost of
Indonesia’s fuel subsidies.

   29. In a baseline scenario of international financial market fragility combined with relatively
weak external, but continued solid, domestic demand, growth of 6.0 percent is forecast for 2012,
moving up to 6.4 percent in 2013. The underlying macro assumptions for this baseline include a continued
weakness in external demand with overall international commodity prices also projected to moderate.

    30. Under more adverse but plausible scenarios framed around the above external risks, growth
in 2013 could decline to around 4 percent of GDP, the lowest in a decade. Taking the above downside
risks into account, different scenarios can be considered to simulate the impact of external shocks on
Indonesia’s economy (see Table below). The main impact would be felt in 2013 given the strong
performance in 2012 to date. Under a scenario similar to 2009 which assumes a greater growth slowdown
due to the real impact of the financial crisis and credit tightness, as well as a moderate decline in commodity
prices leading to a sharp contraction in the terms of trade, GDP growth is cut to 4.7 percent in 2013 (down
1.7 percentage points on the baseline scenario), reflecting lower investment and exports. If a financial crisis
precipitates, or accompanies, a significant growth slowdown also in emerging economies as well as a sharp
drop in global commodity prices, growth could fall even further in 2012, down to just under 4 percent.

    31. The outlook for China is of particular importance for Indonesia. A drop in China's growth down
to 7 percent would directly cut Indonesia's major trading partner growth by 0.17 pp (given a weight in
Indonesia’s exports of 11 percent in 2011). The second round effects via global and regional trading partner
growth would also clearly be important. However, the real concern with a relatively marked slowdown in
growth would be if China's growth leads to a sharp fall in global commodity prices - particularly coal and
minerals that form a sizeable share of Indonesia's exports. If significant commodity price declines were
sustained then this would spill over to domestic consumption and investment in Indonesia as household
incomes and corporate investment, and fiscal revenues would also decline. Estimates of the spillovers vary
across studies but, estimates in the September 2012 IMF Article IV report on Indonesia, incorporating direct
and indirect trade effects and global commodity price impacts, suggest that a 1 percentage point reduction in
China’s growth could lower Indonesia’s GDP by up to half a percentage point. The IMF report also
highlights there would also be spillovers through the commodity channel from a shift in the composition of
China’s growth from investment to consumption.

    32. Growth could also move substantially lower if the impact of adverse external shocks is
amplified domestically. Growth would still be above 4 percent in the international scenarios discussed in
the previous paragraphs. This is similar to that seen in 2009, when growth dropped during the height of the
global financial crisis but remained at 4.6 percent. However, it is important to note that these GDP


                                                                                                                 19
projections combine the external scenarios with moderations in the underlying domestic drivers of growth,
i.e. private consumption and investment. In the event that there was a major dislocation to these drivers, for
example due to domestic policy miss-steps or problems in the domestic financial sector, then the downside
risks to growth could be much greater, and hence the importance of crisis preparedness measures.

D. Policy Challenges

    D. 1. Macro-economic policy

    33. There remain a number of challengs for the macro fiscal and monetary policy framework.
Bank Indonesia will need to remain vigilant to potential rising inflation and any financial sector risks if
domestic demand remains robust. The 2012 IMF Article IV report notes that this will require the usage of
traditional monetary policy tools given that macroprudential measures on certain sectors will “not tackle the
underlying condition of easy money?. Indonesia’s fiscal position is in a strong starting position at the
aggregate level and the deficit is likely to remain conservative. However, flexibility to respond to a
downturn in growth is limited by the disbursement issues in infrastructure and the efficiency of spending is
limited by the continued burden of energy spending. More generally, there is a need to improve further the
quality of the allocation and efficiency of spending, although in the run up to the elections in 2014 the near-
term political environment may limit the likelihood of addressing fuel spending expenditures or limiting the
growth of personnel expenditures. Failure to make such improvements in the medium-term could lower the
growth outlook going forward and ability of the Government to meet its development objectives,
notwithstanding the level of resources allocated.

     34. Although Indonesia is relatively well placed to weather external shocks, it is also important to
further improve preparation for a potential crisis through enhancing the range of instruments and
policies available to deal with increased volatility and improving the resilience of its economy and
public finances. Risks in the global environment remain high both from developments in the Eurozone, the
fiscal cliff in the US and the uncertain impact of recent quantitative easing on commodity and emerging
market capital flows. Indonesia remains well-positioned to withstand external real and financial shocks due
to its continued strong economic performance and policies, low Government debt levels and significant
reserves. Importantly, the 2013 proposed Budget retains a number of measures to deal with any future crisis


                                                                                                                              20
situation that had been introduced in the 2012 Budget. Other elements of the Government’s crisis
preparedness has been the establishment of crisis management protocols and continent financing facilities
with development partners to support financing of critical public expenditures in the event of an increase in
market financing pressures. The World Bank PERISAI DPL-DDO operation, in addition to supporting
short-term policy measures aimed at enhancing crisis preparedness, provides contingent budget support,
which the Government intends to draw down only in the event of a significant worsening of the financing
conditions. The Government has also secured additional contingent financing of around USD3 billion from
the Government of Japan (Yen 120 billion), Australian Treasury (AUD$1 billion) and the Asian
Development Bank (USD500 million).

    D. 2. Structural challenges

    35. Sustained progress on structural reforms can also play an important role in not only
enhancing medium-term growth prospects but also in supporting the confidence of investors in the
economy in the near term. A number of recent trade and investment policy measures or proposals have
created a sense of rising protectionist policy making. The measures include, for example, restrictions on
imported horticulture products, an export tax and new divestment regulations in the mining sector and
proposals to limit single ownership in the banking sector. The objectives of these policies, such as moving
up the value chain domestically and creating quality jobs, are not necessarily the concern but rather whether
these policies are likely to achieve these objectives (and whether they may introduce distortions into the
economy which, in the long-term, could be a drag on growth). In addition, the presentation of these policies,
which is often changing and inconsistent, highlights coordination difficulties across ministries and limited
consultation with stakeholders. In addition to their uncertain effectiveness, there is a risk that the
continuation of such policies, or other perceived “policy missteps? could weaken some of the confidence of
investors in domestic policy making (particularly in the run up to the 2014 presidential elections). Limiting
further such missteps, along with a continuation of the Government's ongoing work on crisis preparedness
will be important to maintain investor confidence in a fragile global environment.

    36. Looking towards the medium-term, continued progress on policy reforms and key investments
in infrastructure and skills development will be required if Indonesia is to move its potential growth
rate up towards 7 percent and beyond. The continuation of recent growth rates of around 6.5 percent
appear sustainable over the next few years, supported on the demand-side by rising incomes and domestic
consumption, and on the supply side by Indonesia's demographic dividend and strong investment growth
rates reflecting the attractiveness of the domestic market, commodity endowment and relatively low labor
costs. However, sustaining such growth rates over the medium-term, or moving them higher, will require
investments in infrastructure and addressing regulatory and investment climate constraints on businesses.
For example, for 2014-2016 the 2011 IMF Article IV baseline potential growth rate is 7.1 percent, rising to
7.9 percent in an upside scenario in which infrastructure and structural reforms proceed faster than in the
baseline but declining to 6 percent in a downside scenario in which infrastructure development proceeds
slowly and there is little progress on structural reform. Private and public investment in infrastructure as a
share of GDP, at around 4 percent in 2009, is still significantly lower than prior to the 1997/98 crisis.
Infrastructure has been identified by the Government as a key constraint for growth, leading to large
increases in budgetary allocations to the infrastructure sector as well as efforts to attract more private sector
investment.


E. The Political and Social Context

    37. From 2001 to 2010, Indonesia experienced a deepening and entrenching of democracy and a
return to stable and strong economic growth. The beginning of the current administration’s second tenure
saw widespread public disenchantment with weak law enforcement and high-profile scandals involving the



                                                                                                              21
police and the attorney general’s office. Yet despite political tensions within the Parliament, the coalition
structure and consensus-oriented approach of the ministerial cabinet have been maintained. Policy-making
continues to benefit from the reform-orientation and technocratic background of several key cabinet
members as well as leadership from the President and Vice President. A cabinet reshuffle in the second half
of 2011 saw some significant changes, including in the economic ministries, but the overall reform
orientation of the cabinet has remained.

    38. Political positioning can be expected to rise in 2012. Given that parliamentary and presidential
elections are planned for April and July 2014, political tensions and positioning can be expected to rise
again next year. This is likely to give rise to distractions that will make the Government’s task of
implementing institutional reform more challenging, particularly as coalition members may seek to
disassociate themselves from controversial or popular reforms.

    39. Some recent policymaking outcomes from the administration have tended to be
protectionist, generating concerns over Indonesia’s overall investment climate and
commitment to reforms. For example, the issuance of a decree that will eventually eliminate
foreign majority ownership of mines could increase the risk of regulatory capture by special
interests, which in turn could undermine economic efficiency. Other controversial policy moves
include: the banning of rattan exports to protect domestic furniture makers; restrictions on imports
of horticultural products; and the tighter rules on establishing retail and restaurant franchises, in a
bid to promote domestic businesses. This protectionist trend and the regulatory uncertainty that it
creates could potentially expand to other sectors, especially if economic growth slows as a result of
the accelerating global slowdown and also as political tensions build in the run-up to 2014.

    40. Nevertheless, there have also been some notable successes in other policymaking. For example,
very sound candidates have been appointed to the new leadership teams in the KPK and the General
Election Commission (KPU), in addition to the commissioners appointed to the new Financial Services
Authority (OJK). The administration also succeeded in passing a new Law on Land Acquisition Procedures
for Public Interest Developments, along with the implementing Presidential regulation, which bode well for
smoothing the way forward for land purchases for important infrastructure projects.

    41. Progress in reforming the judicial and law-enforcement agencies continued to be slow. Recent
cases of corruption highlighted the vast challenges in reforming the judicial and law-enforcement systems in
Indonesia. These included allegations of corruption affecting most political parties, investigators conspiring
with a corrupt tax auditor, senior police and Attorney General Office (AGO) personnel fabricating evidence
against two Anti Corruption Committee (KPK) deputy-chairs, and police officials conducting suspicious
financial transactions. Thus far, progress towards the resolution of these cases remains to be slow.

    42. Instances of sectarian violence against minority groups highlight the need for the Government
to strengthen efforts in upholding the laws concerning the freedom of religion. The past year has seen
an increase in the number of instances of religious violence and intolerance.

    43. Although the risks of terrorist attacks have much reduced in recent years, the threat remains.
Following the spate of terrorist bombing and loss of life, mainly on Bali and Java since 2002, the authorities
have made solid progress in neutering the terrorist networks in Indonesia.

    44. Over the past decade there has been considerable progress toward gender equality in
Indonesia, particularly in the area of education. However, persistent gender disparities remain.
Maternal mortality rates remain relatively high for Indonesia’s income level, and as in other countries,
women’s voices in the public domain remains weak. While Indonesia’s female labor force participation rate
increased from around 45 percent in 1980 to about 55 percent in 2008, it still remained below the 70 percent


                                                                                                           22
average for the region. Furthermore, women still earn less than men in all sectors, are more likely to work in
the informal sector and are the majority of unskilled migrant laborers. Gender gaps in wages in the service,
industry and agriculture sectors in Indonesia are among the largest in the region. The important
socioeconomic variations in Indonesia are that urban educated women have higher returns than men with the
same education, while women at the bottom end of the wage distribution (i.e. among the lowest educated
individuals) face the biggest wage gap. Enterprise surveys also suggest that, within the same firms, women
are more likely than men to be temporary workers – around 25 and 17.5 percent of women workers in
exporting and non-exporting firms compared to less than 10 percent of male workers are on temporary
contracts in Indonesia. While female-owned and managed enterprises are not inherently less productive,
they tend to be less capitalized and operate in less remunerative sectors.




                                                                                                           23
            III. THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM PROGRAM AND BANK
                              SUPPORT

     45. The proposed INSTANSI DPL is designed to support the Indonesian authorities’ reforms to
strengthen public financial management and enhance poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts,
in light of the Government’s ongoing program of wide-ranging structural and institutional reforms.
The INSTANSI DPL focuses on a set of medium-term policy measures underpinned by a wide-ranging
program of longer-term reforms that the Government has been implementing over the past decade. The
World Bank has supported these longer term reforms through a range of programs, particularly through the
ongoing DPL program since its inception in 2004. Key elements of the Government’s longer-term
institutional and structural reform program are outlined below, while the proposed INSTANSI DPL program
is described in Section V.

    A. Indonesia’s Overall Development Agenda

    46. Since the 1998 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia has come a long way in reinforcing economic
stability and initiating structural reforms. Within the first five years after the crisis, overall stability was
restored on both the macroeconomic and political front. Lacking the finances to undertake many needed
investments, at that time the Government’s initial focus was on fiscal consolidation and putting in place the
basic legislative framework for the new Indonesian political setting. On the economic front, the focus was
on restructuring the banking sector, which had collapsed as a result of the crisis, and on restoring the fiscal
position of the Government. By the end of the first five years post-crisis, macroeconomic stability had been
restored and the political arena had been stabilized. Thereafter, to prepare for the end of its IMF program,
the Government issued a White Paper in September 2003 that outlined plans for macroeconomic and fiscal
consolidation and a series of structural reforms to restore confidence in the Indonesian economy and boost
investment. These plans were broadly maintained by the Government led by President S.B. Yudhoyono who
came to power in late 2004, with the plans incorporated into the Medium-Term Development Plan RPJMN
2004-2009. Indeed, the history of fiscal prudence then provided the Government with the fiscal space
needed to meet Indonesia’s rising development challenges.

    47. Upon taking office, the second Cabinet led by President S.B. Yudhoyono moved rapidly to
announce its first 100-day action plan in early November 2009. The action plan included 15 priority
program areas, 45 detailed programs and 131 specific action plans. The 15 priority areas were a mixture of
reformist initiatives and conventional policy goals. In descending order of priority, these included
combating legal mafias, revitalizing the defense industry, combating terrorism, electricity, increasing food
production, production of fertilizer and sugar, land-use and spatial planning, infrastructure development, and
climate change and the environment. Responsibility for monitoring progress rested with the head of the new
Presidential Delivery Unit (UKP4). Although the 100-day action plan was relatively un-ambitious in terms
of economic or institutional reforms, it appears to have been successful in achieving its objectives, with the
monitoring unit UKP4 closely following progress on key Government priorities.

     48. Also in February 2010, the Government unveiled its Medium-Term Development Plan
(RPJMN) 2010-2014, which outlines the GOI’s development programs and reform initiatives towards
a more inclusive and equitable development. The new RPJMN lays out 11 national priorities including:
(i) bureaucracy and governance reform; (ii) education; (iii) health; (iv) poverty reduction; (v) food security;
(vi) infrastructure; (vii) investment and business climate; (viii) energy; (ix) environment and disaster
management; (x) least developed, frontier, outer, and post-conflict areas; and (xi) culture, creativity, and
technological innovation. Most programs under poverty reduction, education, and health are a continuation
or expansion of the existing development programs, such as the integrated social assistance program
including the national insurance system (Jamkesmas), scholarships for the poor, cash transfers (BLT),
conditional grant assistance for poor households (PKH), School Operational Assistance (BOS), and the



                                                                                                             24
expansion of rural community development programs (PNPM Mandiri). Some new program priorities
include constructing 19,000 km of highway across the five largest islands, increasing electricity generation
capacity by 3,000 MW per annum, building transportation infrastructure based on the National
Transportation System and Transportation Blueprint, introducing a single identity number to be applied by
2011, reducing the number of least developed areas by 50 districts by 2014, developing a national logistic
system, and implementing an electronic investment license and information system. These new priorities
reflect the Government’s focus on infrastructure for the next five years.

     49. With the target of increasing economic growth to 7 percent and reduction in poverty rate to 8-
10 percent by 2014, the RPJMN 2010-2014 highlights the need for growth with equity and a range of
cross-cutting policies to ensure that development is both sustainable and inclusive. Private
consumption is projected to grow by 5.3-5.4 percent annually, while investment and exports are projected to
rise annually by 9.1-10.8 percent and 10.7-11.6 percent, respectively. The emphasis of the RPJMN is on a
strategy that is pro-growth, pro-jobs and pro-poor, with particular relevance for increasing investments in
infrastructure and strengthening the pro-poor agenda.

    50. Addressing gender issues has become a Government priority. The issuance of INPRES No.
3/2010, together with some ministerial regulations on gender budgeting and mainstreaming 2, signify the
Government’s serious efforts toward a more equitable development, involving women and children.

     51. In May 2011, the Government launched its Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of
Indonesia’s Economic Development 2011-2025 (MP3EI or “the Masterplan?) as Indonesia’s new,
longer-term strategy to become an industrialized economy. The Masterplan goes beyond the five-year
development plan and aims to boost Indonesia’s economic growth to 7-9 percent during the coming decades,
aimed at becoming one of the 10 largest economies in the world by 2025. It argues that such high growth
levels can only be attained by structurally transforming the economy through higher levels of investments in
priority sectors and especially infrastructure. The new MP3EI is based on three strategies: (i) the
development of six economic corridors 3 aimed at fostering centers of growth by developing leading
resource-based industrial clusters in each major island group.; (ii) the strengthening of national connectivity,
strengthening connectivity and synergies between those centers of growth, including international
connectivity; and (iii) the acceleration of technological and R&D capacity, to complement connectivity by
improving human resources capabilities and increasing investments in research and development. According
to the new MP3EI, these strategies will need to be supported by an improvement of Indonesia’s investment
climate, including its trade and investment policies.


    B. Key Reform Directions Supported by the DPL

    52. The proposed INSTANSI DPL continues to support the Government’s development agenda.
The overall goal of the DPL program is to help the Government achieve its development objectives, as
outlined in the RPJMN 2010-2014. In particular, INSTANSI DPL supports the GoI’s reform efforts in: i)
strengthening public financial management; and ii) enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery
efforts. As explained in the introduction section of this program document, the INSTANSI DPL no longer
covers the area of improving investment climate, which is being shifted to the Connectivity and FIRM


2
  These include MoF Regulation No. 93/ 2011 on ministry/agency work planning and budgeting that requires the
provision of gender budget statement; Ministry of Home Affairs Regulation No. 67/2012 for gender mainstreaming;
and Bappenas decree No.19/ 2012 on Steering and Technical Teams that are mandated with institutionalizing and
accelerating gender mainstreaming in Bappenas.
3
  The six regional corridors are Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Bali-Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT), and Papua
and Maluku.


                                                                                                                  25
DPLs. This section describes the key Government reform achievements and directions under the two pillars
supported under the INSTANSI DPL.

     B. 1. Public Finance Management

    53. Since the White Paper in 2002, the Government has shown strong, persistent commitment
towards building a modern public financial management (PFM) system. A new regulatory framework
has largely been established. 4 Remarkable efforts have been made to improve business processes and
systems throughout the entire budget cycle, including audit, legislative oversight and supportive civil service
reforms. It has thereby addressed a multitude of risks related to capacity constraints, poor infrastructure, and
weak governance across the PFM institutional and stakeholder landscape. In the medium to long term, it is
expected that improvements in Indonesia’s PFM systems will lead to better targeted and more flexible
allocations of public funds to priority development needs and more efficient, transparent and accountable
spending. This is fundamental to improving public service delivery and desired development outcomes.

    54. The breadth and depth of PFM reforms over the relatively short period are commendable.
Most notable include: the introduction of performance-based budgeting (PBB) and a medium-term
expenditure framework (MTEF); the strengthening of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems; the
development of an integrated budget and treasury system (SPAN); full implementation of a Treasury Single
Account (TSA); strengthening of cash and debt management functions; development of accounting
standards to provide for a ‘full accrual’ framework; an inventory and appraisal of Government assets and the
introduction of a state asset management information system; the introduction of e-procurement systems and
establishment of a new procurement agency (LKPP); and adoption of the COSO control framework and
strengthening of external audit.

    55. While progress has been substantial, and reforms are generally moving in the right direction,
considerable challenges remains. Among others, reforms of Central Government budgetary systems to
improve the policy orientation in budget formulation and execution need to be strengthened. The new
budget and treasury system (SPAN) is expected to commence roll-out in 2013, which will necessitate some
fine tuning of procedures and the underlying business processes at spending agencies need to be
reengineered. Reform of the regulatory framework and implementation of e-Government procurement will
continue in 2012, including the development of a permanent procurement management function in
implementing agencies. Relevant and reliable financial reporting needs to be strengthened along with human
resources in Government accounting and reporting. The COSO control framework needs to be fully
implemented and the internal audit function strengthened. The Government’s M&E capacity needs to be
further enhanced to support the focus on getting better results, including with the move towards PBB.

    56. Improving the performance of the tax system also remains a key part of the medium-term
reform objectives. The Government’s medium-term plan is to further increase tax revenue from its current
low level of around 12 percent of GDP, to around 15 percent (closer to the non-OECD regional average). 5
This is well within the estimate of an additional 2-5 percentage point of GDP that could be collected through
better coverage and improved compliance. 6 Given that tax policy has already been simplified and rates are
broadly in line with regional comparators, this is to be achieved through the implementation of the next
stage in the reform of tax systems and administration. The first phase of tax reform—which focused on
modernizing tax offices, improving governance, and strengthening the legal framework—was largely
completed by 2009. The Directorate General of Taxes (DGT) has restructured, moving from a “tax type? to
a functional organization with a field office network targeted to specific taxpayer segments—i.e. large,

4
  The most noteworthy laws issued include the State Finance Law No. 17/2003, the State Treasury Law No. 1/2004 the State Financial Audit Law
No. 15/2004 and the Procurement law (54/2010).
5
   The MOF has a more ambitious medium-term target of 18 percent of GDP for tax revenues.

medium, and small taxpayer offices in addition to one High Wealth Individuals unit. To improve
governance, DGT introduced new corporate values, a code of conduct, a whistleblower system and
established an internal compliance unit. Key achievements also include strengthening the legal framework
for taxation through amendments of the three main tax laws.7 These have improved the balance between
taxpayer rights and the authority of the tax administration, reduced corporate and personal income tax rates,
and revised the list of exempt and zero-rated goods and services for VAT.

    57. Overall, public financial management reforms are technically complex and involve enormous
amounts of data, new procedures an ICT systems and people. The sheer size of Indonesia, the scope of
its Central Government PFM systems (covering 29,000 spending units), the number of involved
stakeholders, and the ambitious nature of its envisaged reform agenda make PFM reforms a particularly
challenging undertaking that will continue to require significant amounts of expertise, coordination, capacity
building and sequencing. However, the Government has shown continued commitment to complete the
planned reforms, through the development of annual and medium-term plans and strategies that ensure the
proper phasing and coherence of reforms — for example, the Government produces an Annual Strategy
Note that coordinates support for the GoI’s reform program, in part through a Bank administered multi-
donor trust fund for PFM. The Government’s strategy is also informed, and adjusted, by considerable
analytic work that helps to prioritize and sequence the reforms (see Box 1).




7
    These include the enactment of the amended General Taxation Provisions and Procedures Law No. 28/2007, which strikes a better balance
    between the rights and obligations of taxpayers and the powers of tax officials, an issue of longstanding concern to the business community; the
    Income Tax Law No. 36/2008, which reduces corporate and personal rates, simplifies administration and increases legal certainty; and a law
    recognizing electronic signatures, which clears the way for initiatives such as electronic registration and filing of tax returns.



                                                                                                                                                   27
Box 1: Analytical Underpinnings for PFM Reform Support

          Indonesia’s proposed public finance reforms address the findings and recommendations of recent
assessments, including those of the World Bank. Starting in 2001, the Country Financial Accountability Assessment
identified weaknesses in the country’s accounting standards and systems as significant hurdles in the improvement of
the governance and accountability environment in the country. New accounting standards have been implemented
across the Government agencies since 2003, involving the development of new accounting systems and procedures, a
move from single entry to double-entry accounting and the adoption of a new chart of accounts. A repeat assessment
of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) was also conducted in 2011, following a first
assessment in 2007. The results showed that Indonesia has made steady progress in strengthening the quality of its
Public Financial Management (PFM) systems and processes, and continues to inform the prioritization of ongoing
reforms. The chart below compares the average PEFA ratings for each of the six main categories of the budget cycle.
Substantive improvements were made in five of the six categories, namely: the comprehensiveness and transparency
of the budget, policy based budgeting, predictability and control in budget execution, in accounting, recording and
reporting, and in external scrutiny and audit.




Note: The Chart shows the simple average of the PEFA ratings in each category, with a maximum rating of 4 for an ‘A’ and 1 for a ‘D’ and half a
point is given for a ‘+?.

          The self-diagnostic assessment conducted by the National Public Procurement Office (NPPO) in 2007 using
the Base-Line Indicators (BLIs) tool, presented a “snapshot? comparison of the actual system against the
international standards. The baseline benchmarking of Indonesia’s procurement system showed it scored 62.5 percent
for the “Legislative and Regulatory Framework? (PILLAR I), 55 percent for the “Institutional Framework and
Management Capacity? (PILLAR II), 59.3 percent for the “Procurement Operations and Market Practices? (PILLAR
III) and 69 percent for the “Integrity and Transparency of the Public Procurement System? (PILLAR IV), in
comparison with recognized international standards. Since 2007, it is expected that there will be improvements on
some of the indicators of Pillars I and II with the establishment of LKPP and ongoing reforms. In 2012, the Bank is
also conducting a survey of procurement at the subnational level, to identify weaknesses and constraints.
         The first phase of the tax administration reform effort has also generated tangible results. The IMF estimated
that administrative improvements accounted for over half of the 1.1 percentage points of GDP increase in tax
collection over the period 2002–2006 (Brondolo et al. IMF WP/08/129, 2008). Investment climate surveys
conducted by the University of Indonesia reveal that the compliance costs for filing returns, obtaining VAT refunds,
and customs clearance have improved since 2005–2007 (though not on the “Doing Business? surveys). The Tax
Office has also shown consistent improvement in the Corruption Perception Index score, measured by Transparency
International Indonesia (TII) every two years. In 2010, the TII’s Bribery Index, which measures corrupt interaction
with the public service, placed the national tax administration as the lowest (best) among all government institutions.
Nonetheless, the IMF recently estimated that an additional 2-5 percentage points of GDP could be collected “based
on broadening the tax bases and increasing compliance? (IMF, 2011, Indonesia: Selected Issues).




                                                                                                                                            28
    58. The World Bank uses a number of instruments to support the Government’s PFM reform
agenda. The DPL helps to reinforce the Government’s ownership of and commitment towards the
achievement of reform milestones. Through the Government Financial Management and Revenue
Administration Project (GFMRAP), the Bank is also providing support to design and implement the
aforementioned IFMIS solution, SPAN, which has involved a comprehensive reengineering of business
processes, institutional reform and change management. Implementation of SPAN is expected to
significantly improve the timeliness, reliability, integrity and transparency of budget spending and reporting.
As a cross-cutting reform, it should also enhance the capability of managers to efficiently manage service
delivery. The Public Financial Management - Multi Donor Trust Fund (PFM-MDTF) provides additional
resources to support critical activities to keep the reform agenda on track together key development partners
— the European Commission, the Governments of the Netherlands and of Switzerland, USAID and the
World Bank. The Bank also supports the tax reform agenda through the Project for Indonesian Tax
Administration Reform (PINTAR) that aims to increase the efficiency of taxpayer data collection and
management, improve tax administration human resource management, strengthen tax audit and collection
functions and implement a comprehensive change management process.


     B.2. Poverty Reduction

     59. Despite strong economic growth and falling poverty in the last decade, many households that
continue to live on the edge of poverty. The last decade in Indonesia has seen a return to strong economic
growth, and the poverty rate has fallen from 23.4 percent in 1999 to 12.5 in 2011. Sustained economic
growth contributed to this success by creating more jobs and increasing public expenditures for health,
education and infrastructure. Not seen in the falling overall poverty rate, however, is the persisting high
degree of vulnerability. Much of the Indonesian population is clustered just above this line; around 25
percent live below the official near-poor line of 1.2 times the poverty line, and 40 percent below 1.5 times
the poverty line. Living standards remain low for many Indonesians not in poverty, and relatively small
shocks to their income and consumption can send them into poverty. Consequently, around half of the poor
this year will not have been poor last year; that is, they are newly poor. 8

    60. Female-headed households (FHH) in particular experienced much more volatile poverty rates
than the male-headed households (MHH). While poverty rates for female-headed households (FHH) and
male-headed ones (MHH) experienced a similar reduction over the 2000s, the FHH poverty rate was much
more volatile than the MHH rate over the first half of the decade. This suggests that FHH interact with labor
markets differently to MHH, face different risks to income and consumption, or have differential access to
coping mechanisms and are less able to smooth consumption when shocks occur. Despite tangible progress
(e.g., gender parity in enrollment rates at all levels of education), persistent gender disparities also remain.
Maternal mortality rates remain relatively high for Indonesia’s income level and women’s voices in the
public domain remains relatively weak. While Indonesia’s female labor force participation rate increased
from around 45 percent in 1980 to about 55 percent in 2008, it still remained below the 70 percent average
for the region. Furthermore, women still earn less than men in all sectors, are more likely to work in the
informal sector and are the majority of unskilled migrant laborers. Further, Indonesian women are
disproportionally more excluded from formal financial services than men. The World Bank Access to
Finance Survey 2010 and Migrant Worker Survey found that women are less likely to borrow, and when
they do so, they are more likely to borrow informally.

    61. Indonesia introduced a range of national poverty reduction programs to protect poor and
vulnerable households from shocks. In response to the East Asian financial crisis, the Government

8
  Further analysis and discussion on the nature of poverty and vulnerability in Indonesia, and the effectiveness of social assistance
programs in addressing them, can be found in recent World Bank's major reports (2012), Targeting the Poor and Vulnerable in
Indonesia, and Protecting the Poor and Vulnerable in Indonesia..


                                                                                                                                    29
established a broad safety net (Jaringan Pengaman Sosial, JPS) and introduced large commodity price
subsidies (Operasi Pasar Khusus, OPK). The JPS consisted of temporary, short-term programs including
public works (Padat Karya, PK), scholarships and funding for health services. A second generation of social
assistance programs was then introduced following the partial removal of regressive fuel subsidies in 2005.
A portion of the savings from the subsidy cuts were reallocated to four programs: operational aid to schools
(Bantuan Operasional Sekolah, BOS), health insurance for the poor (Asuransi Kesehatan Miskin, Askeskin),
village infrastructure (Infrastruktur Pedesaan, IP) and rice for the poor (Beras Miskin, Raskin). Later, the
Government also introduced a temporary unconditional cash transfer (Bantuan Langsung Tunai, BLT) to
help poor and near-poor households cope with the inflationary shock caused by the fuel subsidy removal.

    1. These programs evolved into the current range of national programs that are part of the
Government’s poverty reduction strategy. The strategy is articulated around the following three main
clusters:

•   Cluster I consists of household-based social assistance programs that target poor and vulnerable
    households and individuals. This collection of programs includes: Jamkesmas (Jaminan Kesehatan
    Masyarakat), health service fee waivers: Raskin, a subsidized rice distribution; and Beasiswa untuk
    Siswa Miskin (BSM), a collection of programs that provide cash transfers for poor students. It also
    includes a newly piloted conditional cash transfer program (Program Keluarga Harapan, or PKH).
•   Cluster II covers poverty-reduction interventions at the community level. This cluster predominantly
    consists of the National Community Empowerment Program (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan
    Masyarakat Mandiri, or PNPM-Mandiri), which was scaled up nationally between 2007 and 2010,
    providing block grants to rural and urban sub-districts that support community-level development
    projects.
•   Cluster III includes initiatives that aim to expand economic opportunities for low-income households by
    improving access to credit for micro- and small- and medium-sized enterprises, such as the development
    of a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion and scaling up the Kredit Usaha Rakyat (KUR) program.

    62. The Government is committed to accelerating the pace of poverty reduction over the
upcoming five years. Since the 2009 elections, there has been renewed commitment by the Government to
intensify policy reforms that support poverty reduction and improve the effectiveness of national poverty
reduction programs. The President declared poverty reduction to be one of the highest development
priorities for Indonesia. The RPJMN 2010-2014 highlights the Government’s aim to lower the poverty rate
to 8-10 percent by 2014. The President’s triple-track development strategy (pro-growth, pro-jobs and pro-
poor) will reduce poverty by strengthening economic growth, stimulating job creation, and deepening
investments in its poverty reduction strategy.

     63. To improve the effectiveness of the national poverty reduction strategy, overall oversight and
coordination responsibilities have been elevated to a cabinet-level team led by the Vice President. The
Government has taken its first step to implement the national poverty reduction programs across all clusters
by elevating the overall oversight and coordination to a newly created National Team for the Acceleration of
Poverty Reduction (Tim Nasional Percepatan Penanggulangan Kemiskinan, or TNP2K). The Vice-
President chairs the TNP2K, which includes all Government agencies responsible for the planning,
financing and implementation of poverty reduction programs. It is responsible for implementing the main
poverty reduction strategies outlined in the RPJMN 2010-2014, which include: (i) integrating the family-
based programs into the family-based social assistance system and expanding coverage for main social
assistance programs; (ii) scaling-up the PNPM-Mandiri from Rp 9.3 trillion in 2009 to Rp 11.9 trillion in
2012; and (iii) expanding the coverage of KUR and improving its distribution mechanism. To support these
strategies, the Government is identifying reforms that will enhance the delivery and effectiveness of its
poverty reductions programs and maximize the impact of increased funding on the most vulnerable
segments of society. These include institutionalizing program assessment and improved governance

empowering Local Governments, communities and service providers to deliver quality services.

Box 2: Analytical Underpinnings for Service Delivery Reform Support
       World Bank analytical reports, including Making the New Indonesia Work for the Poor, have found that even
though Indonesia has made progress in reducing poverty many people remain poor and vulnerable. Sustained economic
growth has helped more Indonesians escape poverty, by creating more jobs and increasing public expenditures for
health, education and infrastructure. Indeed, the poverty headcount has fallen from 16.7 percent in 2004 to 13.3 percent
in 2010. Yet despite these gains, there are still 32.5 million Indonesians who currently live below the poverty line and
approximately half of all households remain clustered around the national poverty line (Rp 200,262 per month). The
gap between the poor and non-poor is also widening. The Gini coefficient, a measure of consumption inequality, has
increased from 0.32 percent in 1999 to about 0.37 percent in 2009 and regional disparities also persist with eastern
Indonesia lagging behind other parts of the country, notably Java.

       The reduction in poverty rate has been slower than expected, partly because there are not enough opportunities
for poor workers to move into better jobs in the formal and non-agricultural sectors. The Bank recently completed the
Indonesia Jobs Report, a comprehensive analytical overview of the labor market over the past 20 years. The report
finds that the majority of Indonesia’s working population of 104.5 million is concentrated in the agricultural and
informal sector. Formal employment grew at an impressive rate of 1.2 percentage points per year from 2003 until 2007.
Formal sector employment for the poor increased by only 0.8 percentage points and remained roughly constant for the
near-poor. Those who entered the formal sector faced dropping wages.

        Household-based social assistance programs play an important role in the Government’s strategy to reduce
poverty. In 2012 the Bank released Protecting Poor and Vulnerable Households in Indonesia, a comprehensive
household social assistance public expenditure and program review, to provide an evidence base for program and
policy reforms. The report provides three key conclusions. First, spend better to achieve a more optimal mix of
welfare-improving programs, by scaling up or institutionalizing cost-effective programs, rationalizing those that deliver
too little at too high a cost, and re-engineering programs that are struggling to deliver benefits to those most in need, as
well as improving access to services. Second, as reforms are implemented, spend more on cost-effective programs and
remaining gaps. Indonesia’s strong fiscal position makes this increase affordable. Finally, develop a long-term reform
roadmap to establish and sustain a comprehensive social safety net. This may involve consolidating programs under a
single system and transforming agencies to accelerate poverty reduction and protect the vulnerable.

       The Bank also released an analytical report on Targeting Poor and Vulnerable Households in Indonesia. The
research found that while the poorest households are most likely to receive program benefits, many are excluded while
many non-poor households participate. Less than half of the poorest 40 percent of households receive BLT and
Jamkesmas (1st and 2nd quintile), while many non-poor also benefit from programs, with a quarter to a fifth of total
benefits going to the richest 40 percent. While over 70 percent of the poorest 40 percent receive Raskin, high
population coverage levels are due to sharing the rice among many non-poor households as well as poor, resulting in a
substantial dilution in benefits to each household. The report recommends that Indonesia develop a National Targeting
System (NTS), featuring a beneficiary registry, which could improve targeting effectiveness and ensure program
satisfaction and acceptance.


     64. The Bank uses a number of instruments to support the Government’s poverty reduction goals.
Starting in 2010, a multi donor trust fund initially supported by AusAID was established to support the
Government in making informed and evidence-based decisions about poverty reduction policies and for
programs, as well as to build the analytical capacity of local universities and think tanks for research and
assessing poverty-related issues. This Partnership for Knowledge-based Poverty Reduction (PKPR) uses a
three-pronged strategy in its engagement with the Government that focuses on: (i) providing poverty
analytics and building analytical capacity to inform poverty and social protection policies, programs and
strategies; (ii) supporting the Government in the design, implementation and evaluation of key poverty and
social protection programs; and (iii) improving the quality and accessibility of data needed for poverty
analysis and policymaking. Since 2005, the Bank has also been using the DPL series to support Government
reforms aimed at improving poverty reduction outcomes.



                                                                                                                        31
     65. The Bank also manages a multi donor support facility that provides technical assistance and
strategic oversight for the National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM-Mandiri). The
facility pools together grants provided by the Governments of Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, the
United Kingdom, the United States of America and the European Commission, to help the Government to
achieve its goal of providing PNPM block grants to all 70,000 villages in the country, at a cost of USD1
billion a year. Grant funding provided through the PNPM Support Facility is used to build Indonesian
capacity for large-scale poverty reduction, with the aim of making the program a sustainable operation.
Capacity building programs supported by the facility engage a broad range of partners, including national
and Local Governments, universities and research centers, civil society organizations and grassroots
initiatives. The facility supports a number of pilot operations to test innovative ways to support communities
in reaching MDGs, to make community projects more environmentally sustainable, or to work through civil
society organizations (CSOs) to reach the most vulnerable.

                   C. Other Related Reform Priorities and Areas of Development


    66. Outside of the main pillars of reform covered by the DPL, there are two major areas of
reform in which the World Bank is also involved that are relevant to the success of this DPL series.
These are civil service/bureaucracy reform and decentralization. The Government is actively addressing the
challenges of reform in these areas, with support from development partners.

        C. 1. Civil Service/ Bureaucracy Reform

     67. Strengthened PFM systems and poverty alleviation programs will not by themselves resolve
the weaknesses in the implementation of public policies. Delivery also depends on improving the
institutional capacity and capability of the public sector, and in recognition of this the Government placed
Bureaucracy Reform as the first priority of the RPJM 2010-14. The MoF has been at the forefront of such
reforms for some years. More generally, the President approved a Grand Design and Roadmap for
Bureaucracy Reform (BR) in late 2010 and the President’s Monitoring Unit (UKP4) and a BR Steering
Committee, chaired by the Vice-President, are closely monitoring progress. By 2012, some 52 ministries
and central agencies (K/Ls) are anticipated to be implementing BR, with the goal of all 76 K/Ls
implementing BR by 2014. 9 A new M&E self-assessment system for BR has been rolled out in 2012, under
the Ministry of State Administration Reorm (MenPan) that will include a public dashboard measuring the
BR progress of all K/Ls. The Government also announced a moratorium of the (net) recruitment of civil
servants nationally, from September 2011 to December 2012, and a draft Civil Service Law (ASN) has been
endorsed by the Parliament, which could lay the foundations for modernizing the civil service.

        C.2. Improvement of the Decentralization Framework

     68. With the ‘big-bang’ decentralization of 2001, Indonesia went from being one of the most
centralized countries in the world in administrative, fiscal and political terms, to one of the most
decentralized; but the transition is far from complete. While some surveys show an improvement in
satisfaction with local service delivery, significant challenges remain. Overlapping responsibilities without
a coordinated decentralization framework prevent effective service delivery, and Sub-national Government
accountability and transparency mechanisms are weak. Much central funding devolved to the sub-national
entities — at around 30 percent of budgets — is spent on personnel’s salary and other administrative costs,
reducing the incentive to address civil service costs. While the Special Allocation Fund (DAK) has been
growing rapidly, the Government’s strategy for using this important instrument is unclear. Unlike most
decentralized countries, Indonesia has just started transferring very limited tax powers to Local
Governments, which in general still distorts incentives and creates unhealthy dependence on transfers from

9
    The Government has also announced the first pilot and then role out the BR to all 33 provincial and 491 city/district authorities.



                                                                                                                                         32
the center. Meanwhile, many Local Governments misuse revenue-raising authority that constrains business
development and trade compromising the investment climate. Given the important role of Sub-national
Governments in public investment, particularly in the infrastructure sector where the needs are great,
amending the law on sub-national government taxes and fees, as well as reforming on-lending and on-
granting regulations, is urgent. Most regions also need to improve technical capacity to implement reforms.

     69. To support the decentralization reform and Local Government agenda, the Bank, together
with development partners, will continue to improve the environment within which Local
Governments operates. After the closing of Decentralization Support Facility (DSF) in early 2012, the
Bank has continued its on-going support by providing resources and coordination for both central level
agencies and Local Governments around analysis and critical capacity building through various programs
and activities. Beginning in 2010, the Bank has provided resources and assistance to improve the special
assistance grants (DAK), with an initial emphasis on enhancing accountability and reporting of grants to
infrastructure sub-sectors within pilot Local Governments. World Bank programs also work directly with
Local Governments to enhance capacity and improve financing in districts across Indonesia, including
through the Initiative for Local Government Reform (ILGR) and the Urban Sector Development and Reform
Project (USDRP). Both aim at changing governance behavior in the context of decentralized public service
delivery by targeting reform minded Local Governments and encouraging increased accountability through
citizen participation. In addition, the Public Expenditure Analysis and Capacity Harmonization (PEACH)
program carries out Public Expenditure Reviews designed to better inform spending decisions at the local
level. PERs have been completed in 10 provinces with Local Governments working closely with local
academic institutions and local stakeholders to improve policy and analytical capacity, , including on gender
analysis in expenditure review.

             IV. BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROGRAM

    A. Links to the 2009-2012 Country Partnership Strategy

     70. The proposed INSTANSI DPL supports the emphasis of the CPS on strengthening Indonesia’s
institutions and systems, a key cross-sectoral engagement theme (Figure 5). As highlighted in the 2009-
2012 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR), issued in February 2011, the DPL series
continue to be at the center of the Bank’s support for strengthening Indonesia’s Central Government
institutions and systems. The CPSPR recognizes that the DPLs have helped the Government’s efforts to
improve the effectiveness and accountability of Central Government institutions and systems under the long
term objective of enhancing public financial management and governance to increase the development
impact of priority budget expenditures. Underpinned by advisory and monitoring work, as well as
institutional capacity-building in collaboration with other development partners, DPLs have also supported
key reforms in the areas of private sector development, community development and poverty alleviation.
According to the CPS, this current generation of DPLs is expected to build on strong relationships with the
reform-minded economic ministries and continue to support the Central Government in strengthening
effectiveness of its institutions and systems. This includes efforts to promote more efficient public
expenditures, strengthen tax administration, enhance the overall business climate and strengthen poverty
alleviation and service delivery.




                                                                                                          33
                          Figure 5: 2009-2014 CPS core engagements




    B. Relationship to Other Bank Operations

     71. The Bank is supporting the Government’s reform agenda using mutually supportive
instruments. While with the DPL series the Bank supports the Government’s ownership and commitment
towards the achievement of reform milestones, with other technical assistance and financing instruments it
supplements that support through the necessary advisory, human and financial capacity to carry out the
reforms. Projects such as the GFMRAP and PINTAR, directly reinforce changes to the underlying
institutional, incentive and organizational frameworks for core functions of the MoF and other related
institutions, including fiscal-policy formulation, budgeting, treasury, internal audit, procurement, revenue
dispute resolution and legislative oversight.

    72. The DPL series support to the reform of Government institutions and systems directly
contributes to the effective implementation of the other investment lending operations in the country.
The reform of PFM systems seeks to address some of the core problems faced in the delivery of key
investment in social sectors. Examples include the unpredictable release of funds and cumbersome budget
adjustments. The DPL will also complement efforts being undertaken through the Connectivity and FIRM
DPLs, by increasing the transparency and efficiency of the Government’s spending and strengthening inter-
governmental fiscal relations and reforms that foster accountability.


    C. Collaboration with Other Development Partners and the IMF

    73. The proposed INSTANSI DPL is being prepared in collaboration with the Government of
Japan (GoJ) / the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The Asian Development Bank had
in the past provided parallel financing to the DPL. Harmonization around the DPL has allowed the World
Bank, the ADB and the GoJ/JICA to build upon the natural synergies and complementarities that exists
across their respective portfolios. The DPL program has also provided a solid foundation to deepen the
harmonization agenda in Indonesia with other development partners around this or other initiatives and
programs.

 *To be determined

    74. The collaboration extends well beyond the co-financing arrangements. Japan provided USD100
million for the first three operations, and last four operations and USD200 million for the fourth. A further
contribution from the GoJ/JICA, is expected for INSTANSI DPL. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
also provided parallel financing of USD200 million for each of DPLs 2-7. Both development partners have
worked with the Bank on joint preparatory work, the drawing up of common policy stances and reaching
common agreement on the fulfillment of triggers, monitoring progress on overall program implementation,
achievement of medium-term objectives and the selection of policy actions in collaboration with the GoI.

    75. The contribution of the GoJ/JICA has intensified in the PFM area. The technical assistance and
support that JICA has provided over the years to Indonesia, as well as numerous Japanese companies, has
provided a rich source of analytic information and substantive direction to the reform agenda in the PFM,
tax, and investment climate areas. JICA currently provides technical assistance support to Bappenas and
DGT, on the development of a performance-based budgeting system and HR in tax administration
respectively. The DPL process also provides a forum for discussions between the GoJ/JICA and the GoI.

    76. Other development partners were also engaged in policy dialogue on different areas of the
INSTANSI DPL. Other development partners such as the European Commission and the Australian
Government have participated as observers during the joint consultation session with the GoI. This has
helped ensure that the various reforms supported through the policy dialogue of the DPL series complement
and are reinforced by other development partners’ programs. Underpinning the policy dialogue is advisory
technical assistance (TA) that the Government has drawn upon. Further, there continues to be synergies
between the DPL and bilateral support provided by donors through trust funds. For instance, the PFM
MDTF complements the DPL policy dialogue, supports some of the PFM-related institutional reforms and
closely complements the ongoing GFMRAP and PINTAR projects.

    77. The Government continues to welcome the development partners’ harmonized approach.
GoI counterparts have appreciated the donor harmonization, which led to a notable reduction in the
transaction cost of policy dialogue. Moreover, donor harmonization around the Government’s own program
has bolstered country ownership of the reform process and has helped change the nature of the relationship
with these donors to one of a reliable partnership.

    78. The IMF has also been closely involved with the overall operation. The IMF and the World
Bank in Indonesia continue to consult regularly on macro and sectoral issues, and the Bank coordinates
closely with the Fund in its missions. In addition, the Bank, the Fund and development partners have
worked closely on the PFM agenda and the DPL’s indicative triggers have been developed in close



                                                                                                          35
coordination. The DPL has thus provided a platform to push the reform agenda in these crucial areas where
both institutions are working.


    D. Lessons Learned from the previous Development Policy Loan (DPL) Series

     79. Important lessons have been learned over the course of the core DPL and IDPL series, which
are relevant for the INSTANSI DPL. These lessons stem from the nature and evolution of the relationship
between the Bank and the Government, and also from the characteristics of the DPL program as a means of
offering policy support, together with the changing policy environment on the ground. Some of the lessons
may be particular to the Indonesian case because of the broad scope and depth of the Bank’s engagement
with the Government, supported by a range of resources that include significant donor trust funds. As
highlighted in the Implementation Completion and Results (ICR) Report for DPLs (7-8), Indonesian DPLs
benefit from a large field team presence that is actively engaged with the Government through various other
instruments in addition to the DPL. The socialization on both sides is deep and the processing has become
standard. As a result, although the task team leaders for the DPLs change, the lessons learned from previous
DPLs are seamlessly incorporated into future operations, and the series has become more mature and
efficient. The following lessons are particularly worth highlighting:

    •   Lesson 1: The application of a set of basic principles has contributed greatly to the successful
        implementation of the Indonesian DPL series. Based on earlier experiences processing the DPL
        series, the Bank team had outlined a few principles to guide them when selecting policy areas and
        prior actions. First, there has to be a robust engagement and relationship with key high-ranking
        counterparts who were “champions? of reform, had reasonably well-defined agendas, and the
        authority to advance their agenda, thereby ensuring strong government ownership and execution of
        the reforms. Second, the GoI counterpart has to see some value to adding some element of their
        reform agenda or work program into the DPL process and would therefore make the time and
        reform commitment to participating process. Third, there also had to be a champion on the WB side
        for including the reform in the DPL process, which incentivized staff to engage in the DPL if it was
        in parallel support to their work program. These three basic principles ensured that the prior actions
        would be actively monitored by both sides for completion in a timely way.

    •   Lesson 2: For a mature DPL series, a broad program scope limits the breadth of the reforms
        that can be taken. Given the coordinating nature of the DPL program across the three distinct
        pillars, in order to keep it operational, the number of implementing agencies engaged has to be kept
        limited. This in turn affects the policy areas and actions that can be selected. Also, as the key value
        of the DPL process is in elevating reforms — a broad DPL is kept manageable by limiting the
        number of reforms selected. Therefore to deepen the reform agenda it makes sense to move to a
        sectoral DPL, which will allow involving a broader set of institutions and increase the number of
        reforms in the policy area. This approach will maximize synergies across the Bank’s program in
        Indonesia, increase ownership of the related policy reforms by the relevant institutions, and
        improve targeting of complementary technical assistance programs. A similar action was done in
        the first DPL series, when the infrastructure component was spun out into its own DPL series, this
        allowed the management of the DPL for PREM related actions to be set in the core DPL and the
        infrastructure-related items to rest with the SD team.

    •   Lesson 3: The splitting of the DPL series is a positive reflection that the value of the DPL
        series extends beyond the financial disbursements. Although the new DPL series will provide a
        combined financing similar to the core DPL series, the government’s willingness to invest more of
        their time to process three DPL highlights the benefits gained from the DPL process. DPLs have
        provided a convening forum for the various units within the government, but also within the Bank,
        to discuss reform priorities, progress, and cross-agency issues, e.g. M&E. Development partners,


                                                                                                            36
        even with no financial involvement in the DPL, have attended the DPL meetings as a useful means
        of gauging the priorities and issues in the Government’s reform agenda.

   •    Lesson 4: The DPL series can serve as a useful incubator to test out new reform agendas and
        counterparts. The DPL has served as a tool to test out reform agendas, like the connectivity,
        education and finance agendas, to test whether or not a counterpart champion would be able to
        drive future reforms through the DPL process. In these cases one or two prior actions (or
        sometimes just benchmarks) would be selected, the new institutions socialized to the DPL process,
        and this experience helps guide future program support.

   •    Lesson 5: A gradual approach should be taken when working with newly created institutions.
        In the case of DPL-7, there was a great sense that the creation of the new task force TNP2K would
        help energize the policy reforms areas of Pillar 3 and an ambitious reform agenda was envisioned.
        However, there were complications in the relationship between TNP2K and Bappenas that
        contributed to a complex environment for achievement of the prior actions. Moreover, it also
        served to distract from other poverty reform areas that the Bank and Bappenas/TNP2K were
        working on, as more time was spent resolving DPL issues. Therefore, although Pillar 3 was an
        established reform area, and both government counterparts had committed champions, it would
        have been better to have gradually introduced the reform agenda to test out the political dynamics
        of the two units.

Other lessons are:

   •    Lesson 6: Strong Government ownership and committed counterparts are vital, but just as
        important is ownership over the pace of the reform process. As a growing middle-income
        country, Indonesia can access domestic and international capital markets, thus offering it a range of
        financing choices. While the Bank’s financing is attractive, the driving reason for the
        Government’s engagement with the Bank through the DPL program is the utility of the instrument
        in bolstering, locking in and accelerating critical reforms. To succeed, DPLs not only need the
        commitment of Government at the highest level but also that of mid-level officials responsible for
        implementing the reforms and following progress on a daily basis.

   •    Lesson 7: Reflecting on the previous IDPL series, on going Bank collaboration with
        counterparts and support from high-level on policy dialogue are crucial for the success of
        DPL operation. Such level of Government support also helps increase commitment from the mid
        level officials responsible for delivering the policy reforms. Finally, constant dialogue between the
        Government and the Bank is fundamental and is best facilitated by a strong field presence across
        sectors which views policy discussions as a natural part of ongoing support.

   •    Lesson 8: As in IDPL and other DPL operations, progress on institutional reforms need not
        be linear and there should be sufficient flexibility for modifications and increased complexity
        as the reform program evolves. Institutional reforms that involve changing the way the
        Government works, especially in the face of entrenched interests and organizational cultures, are
        complicated, often unpredictable undertakings for which there are no simple recipes. What is
        needed in this context is commitment to reform, a continued sense of urgency, and preparedness so
        that when the right opportunity presents itself, reforms that had otherwise been apparently slowed,
        may be advanced rapidly. This approach can allow for progress through incremental reform.

   •    Lesson 9: DPLs are only one instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted
        engagement, and the choice of instrument should be contingent on the issue, the political
        context and the institutional circumstances. This is related to Principle 3 of the Good Practice



                                                                                                          37
    Principles on Conditionality but is particularly applicable in the Indonesian case because of the size
    and scope of the World Bank program here. The Bank program in Indonesia is one of the largest of
    any country in terms of number of staff and overall resources. Large teams are working closely on a
    daily basis with Government counterparts on a wide range of issues from public financial
    management and trade and investment, to finance, public expenditures and poverty. In this context
    the DPL is not the only instrument for supporting reform, but one of several important tools
    including analytical work, knowledge sharing, and technical assistance.

•   Lesson 10: Policy based operations provide an important instrument to convene policy
    makers, policy implementers, donors and others stakeholders for ongoing dialogue on sector
    issues. As highlighted in the previous IDPL operation, across the board, and particularly in the
    areas of PPP, the water sector, and land acquisition, the convening power of the program was
    important to integrate related programs and foster peer learning among unrelated activities. The
    land working group successfully brought a complex land acquisition law to Parliament through an
    “action plan? developed by the inter-ministerial working group (as part of IDPL). Cross-
    fertilization across sectors took place in the case of Output Based Aid (OBA). The water sector’s
    success demonstrated to the road sector how OBA could be applied to road maintenance.

                                   V. THE PROPOSED OPERATION
    A. The INSTANSI Development Policy Loan

     80. The proposed USD300 million INSTANSI DPL marks the beginning of a new series of annual
single tranche DPLs. The previous DPL series had focused on improving the investment climate,
strengthening PFM and enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts. As noted earlier, the
INSTANSI DPL is being restructured in light of the two other DPLs that are also under preparation,
Connectivity and FIRM DPLs, and focuses on the PFM and poverty alleviation and service delivery pillars.
The focus on these two core areas is underpinned by the rationale that strengthening PFM is essential for
enhancing government effectiveness and governance, particularly in a more deconcentrated fiscal and
political environment, and enhancing service delivery and poverty alleviation efforts is essential if Indonesia
is to bring about more broad-based improvements in welfare for its people. The two pillars are therefore
complimentary. Progress achieved under the previous DPL series has been satisfactory overall, which
warrants the continued program support through this INSTANSI DPL, through the following prior actions:

                                       The Borrower has issued a Government Regulation (No.31/2012) for the
                                       implementation of Article 35A of Law 28/2007 and a Minister of Finance

                                       improved tax compliance.
                         Pillar 2: Enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts
                                       The Borrower, through TNP2K, has signed four memoranda of understanding
                                       with the Coordinating Ministry of Peoples Welfare, the Ministry of Health, and

                                                                                                                    39
     81. The eight INSTANSI DPL prior actions identified above were developed based on the
continuing DPL program dialogue with the GoI. Four of these prior actions had previously been
indicated in the DPL-8 program document. In addition, the following four prior actions are being proposed,
which were developed based on the GoI’s continuing reform agenda: (i) Issue a Minister of Finance
Regulation simplifying and clarifying the practice of withholding funds for budget allocations (“Bintang?);
(ii) Introduce new General Ledger under SPAN (daily transaction conversion stage); (iii) Complete the
design and build phase for the new budget planning system; and (iv) Finalize the PNPM Roadmap, which
covers strategic directions and action plan.

    82. A number of prior actions that were indicated in DPL-8 are no longer supported through the
INSTANSI DPL. These include the following: (a) Start implementation of Single Sign-On for two key
agencies of INSW (i.e. BPOM and Customs), which is now being supported separately through the
Connectivity DPL; (b) Issue draft guidelines for an M&E framework, based on specific performance
indicators, that provide the basis for the next RPJMN and annual budgeting, which has been downgraded
into a benchmark action as it will be a ‘living document’ refined over the course of the next year or so; (c)
Issue new law (PP) and related MoF regulations governing budget execution, which is being delayed to the
2013 INSTANSI prior actions; and (d) Draft procurement law submitted to Parliament, where the timing is
uncertain and support is being provided outside of the DPL through technical assistance.

    83. In addition to the prior actions, the INSTANSI DPL also supports a set of benchmark actions.
These benchmark actions represent reform steps that need to be taken before more substantive reforms can
take place over the longer run. The classification of prior and benchmark actions allows more prioritization
and focus over more critical prior actions, while still acknowledging the GoI’s broader reform process. Such
classification therefore helps ensure sustained GoI ownership and the mapping out of a comprehensive
multi-year DPL program. Details on the prior and benchmark actions are provided in Annexes 2-3.


A.1. Pillar I: Strengthening Public Finance Management
    84. The Government continues to modernize its PFM in order to improve the integrity,
accountability, transparency and performance of the budget. The 2002 White Paper provided the
overall framework for the subsequent implementation of PFM reforms in Indonesia, commencing with a
major revision of the enabling legal framework. These efforts are part of a broader public sector reform
agenda to improve governance, enhance public service delivery and ultimately achieve sustained economic
growth and poverty alleviation. The initial reforms focused on consolidating the budget, improving
expenditure controls and strengthening oversight, particularly the financial audits. The Government has
simultaneously been developing a new Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), called SPAN,
aimed at increasing the integrity, reliability and efficiency of budget and treasury operations, while enabling
more timely and robust budget reporting and oversight.

    85. In the past year the Government has achieved notable milestones in PFM reforms including:

    • The finalization of new PFM business processes that have been used to configure the SPAN
      system—including the new Chart of Accounts (CoA), General Ledger design, spending,
      commitment and payment procedures, cash management etc. — the MoF approved a new project
      charter and a comprehensive transition plan for rolling out SPAN in 2013;
    • Further progress in implementing the MTEF, with a number of important reforms in the budget
      preparation process;
    • New regulations to improve budget execution, i.e. to promote multi-year contracts; reform Budget
      virement to give more authority to program managers; to streamline budget documentation; and
    • The Government issued a new regulation to support the implementation of accrual accounting (PP
      71/2011), supported by a MoF regulation detailing the accounting policies under the new CoA.



                                                                                                            40
    86. The INSTANSI-DPL is increasingly supporting measures designed to enhance the quality of
public spending. At the forefront of the agenda is the move toward performance-based budgeting (PBB)
and a fully operational Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), as required by the 2003 State
Finance Law. This includes further steps to improve the link between the monitoring and evaluation of past
performance and future budget decisions. Reflecting progress in improving expenditure controls, the
Government is placing increased emphasis on streamlining the budget execution process to address
constraints that are particularly affecting infrastructure spending. Further reforms are aimed at improving the
management of state assets and liabilities, enhancing public sector (e-)procurement, and strengthening audit
and accounting functions.

    Policy Sub-Area I.1. Strengthening Budget Formulation and M&E Systems

    Reform Aim: Improve results orientation and MTEF in the budget process

    87. The 2003 State Finance Law mandated three pillars of budget reform: (i) a unified budget to
remove the previous distinction between development expenditure and routine expenditure and allow for
prioritization across all kinds of expenditures in the budget; (ii) a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
(MTEF), which aims at strengthening the capability to plan and prioritize expenditures for the medium
term; and (iii) performance-based budgeting (PBB), which would restructure the budget according to
programs and activities and introduce non-financial performance indicators, and allow for a results-based
evaluation and budget allocation.

    88. While the unified budget was implemented in the 2005 budget, PBB and the MTEF are still in
the early stages of implementation. However, notable implementation milestones have already been
achieved. Supported by previous DPLs, and following a joint circular from the MoF and Bappenas in 2009,
a revised program structure has been introduced by all line ministries and ministry-level agencies with the
RPJMN 2010-2014 and FY2011 budget. The work plans and budget submissions for 2012 incorporate
performance indicators for all programs and activities. As a first crucial step in implementing the MTEF,
work plans and budget documents — from the plans (RKP and Renja-KL) to the budget document (RKA-
KL) — have also been transformed into rolling multi-year documents and line ministries and agencies have
prepared detailed forward estimates for two out-years beyond the fiscal year as required by the MoF
regulation in 2010.

    89. The MTEF also implies a fundamental change in the budget preparation process. Regulations
have been put in place to incorporate medium-term budget forecasts and the treatment of new initiatives
during the budget preparation process. The new initiative procedure was first introduced with the
preparation of indicative budget ceilings for 2012. To enhance the credibility of the MTEF, the Government
has prepared documentation that explains differences between proposed budget ceilings and previous
medium-term forward estimates. The documentation was previously intended to be presented to Parliament
(DPR) along with the draft 2013 budget law, but is now planned for next year. This is a major
implementation milestone for MTEF reforms, as it helps ensure that the MTEF information is publicized
and used in all major aspects of the budget preparation cycle. Ultimately, this will help ensure that the
MTEF is integrated with the annual budget cycle, rather than operating as a separate planning exercise. This
change will need strong commitment from all the relevant stakeholders, intensified capacity building, and
changes to business processes and systems. A further development will occur with the use of SPAN to
prepare the 2014 budget in 2013. The increased functionality provided through the budget preparation
module will allow the Government to clearly separate the MTEF elements in preparing the 2014 budget and
facilitate a more detailed reconciliation with the prior year forward estimates in budget documents. In the
coming year consideration will also be given to budget reforms that enhance the strategic nature of the
DPR’s examination of the budget. The intention is to introduce new approaches in the budget discussion



                                                                                                            41
and documents that emphasize budget appropriation at the program level rather than the detailed allocation
for each spending unit.

    90. In an important move that supports the MTEF and PBB reforms the Government is
examining the way in which the costing of transactions and activities is regulated in both the
preparation and execution of the budget. The aim is to replace the existing framework of input focused
regulations and establish a control framework that provides increased flexibility for spending units while at
the same time encouraging economy in spending. The Government has prepared a draft white paper for a
new and simplified costing methodology, and in 2013 it expects to have in place regulations establishing a
new costing methodology, in line with the baseline and new initiatives processes of the MTEF, which also
determine the basis for allocating costs to programs/activities.

       Reform Aim: Strengthen the use of monitoring and evaluation in the planning and budgeting cycle

    91. The annual budget cycle is also being strengthened by gradually introducing new procedures
for performance monitoring, evaluation and management. During the preparation of the 2013 budget the
government circulated draft guidelines (PMK No. 112/2012) for line ministries for the review of baselines in
order to find savings to finance new initiatives and improve the quality of spending. Through this process
around Rp 20 trillion in baseline reductions were identified that were used to finance new policy measures.
This initiative is expected to be further developed during 2013 by introducing an integrated baseline review
process that includes an assessment of the policy performance in the prior year when determining the
baseline. In addition a targeted spending review process is being developed that makes an in-depth
examination of the effectiveness and efficiency of spending feeding into the subsequent budget process.
The effort to strengthen the link between the M&E of budget expenditures and the planning for the
subsequent budget is critical, but challenging. It aims to achieve continuous improvements to the quality of
spending by building lessons from the past budgets into the next cycle. Alongside these process
improvements the introduction of the SPAN system is also expected to provide crucial support to the
emerging M&E agenda by facilitating the reporting of financial and non-financial information by spending
units and line ministries.

       Reform Aim: Streamline budget execution and flexibility of budget management

    92. One of the main objectives of the PFM reform is to streamline and simplify the budget
execution process and provide more flexibility to the spending units in implementing and managing
their budgets. This is particularly important given the challenges faced by spending units and line
ministries in implementing infrastructure projects. The SPAN provides a critical foundation for streamlining
procedures while retaining control, as it will facilitate the full budget cycle process from preparation,
allotment, and execution until M&E in one integrated database. However, as part of the INSTANSI-DPL
several additional steps are envisaged to address delays caused by the process of virement, the prevalence of
the use of “bintang? and a number of elements of the current budget execution regulation. These were
identified as key factors behind delays in disbursement in a recent World Bank study. 10

    93. Despite recent revisions, virement regulations are still viewed by spending agencies as overly
complex and a major source of spending delays. The level of delegated authority and approval processed
could be further simplified and streamlined. There are currently five different authorities that may be
involved in budget revisions: the Parliament (DPR), the Finance Minister, DG Budget, DG Treasury and the
spending unit itself. This is due to a combination of the limited flexibility given by the DPR and the lengthy
processes at the MoF in approving in-year budget virement. For the latter, the MoF has decided that starting
in FY 2013 it will apply a one-stop service in which the budget management (allocation, allotment, and in-
year virement) will be approved by one unit (DG Budget). The INSTANSI-DPL is supporting the

                                                                                                                      42
development of a MoF White Paper that examines the simplification of virement procedures, consistent with
the proposed new government regulation (PP) on budget execution.

    94. The practice of withholding funds for ‘approved’ budget lines (“Bintang?) is an important
factor constraining budget execution. The “Bintang? is imposed either by the MOF or the DPR when
there are reservations about a particular budget allocation, often because the documents supporting the
expenditure are considered incomplete. However, this practice often creates more confusion and delays than
simply rejecting incomplete budget submissions, particulary if it relates to only a portion of a program. It
would often be preferable for the detailed assessment of the supporting documents to be reviewed either
during budget execution or ex post. As a first step to address this problem the MoF issued a new regulation
(PMK No. 112/2012) simplifying and clarifying the practice of withholding funds for budget allocations
(“Bintang?). In 2013, the MoF intends to review the effectiveness of the new regulation and to consider
additional measures aimed at eliminating the use of the “Bintang? practice and putting increased reliance on
ex-post controls.

    95. Finalization of the draft Government Regulation (PP) on budget execution is a priority action
for the MoF, which will address some current obstacles to budget execution alongside other measures.
These include:

    -   Removing the requirement to appoint Satker officials annually: Although the multi-year
        appointment of officials was introduced by Presidential Regulation No. 53/2010, most Satker
        officials still assume that their appointment is only effective for one fiscal year and they are
        reluctant to execute the budget for the new FY until they receive a new appointment letter. This PP
        clarifies that the appointments of Satker personnel (proxy budget user/head of Satker; commitment
        makers; payment verifier; treasurer) are not limited to one fiscal year.
    -   Confirming the rule of advance (early) procurement before the fiscal year started: Although
        Presidential Regulation No. 53/2010 on Procurement permitted line ministries to start the
        procurement process prior to the beginning of a new fiscal year, many Satker are reluctant to apply
        this flexibility since it is not yet regulated by the MoF. This PP will give assurance to the Satker
        staff that they are allowed to conduct advance procurement and, to cover any related costs in
        processing, a contract that will be signed the next fiscal year.
    -   Integrating the State Financial Information System: This PP requires the MoF to organize an
        integrated State Financial Information System that will cover both the line ministries’ information
        system for state finance, and the local government information system for local government finance.

In April 2012, the Finance Minister requested the Justice and Human Rights Minister to finalize the draft PP
through a harmonization process involving meetings with the other line ministries. All stakeholders have
agreed the measures and the MoF has submitted the final draft of the PP on “Procedures of State Budget
Execution? to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights to be sent to the President for approval. The MoF is
optimistic that the PP can be issued before the end of FY 2012.


Reform Aim: Development of SPAN and enhanced ICT integration and services

     96. The implementation of SPAN represents a major milestone in the PFM reform agenda. It will
enhance not only the controls over financial transactions but will also provide a basis to improve the
performance across the entire budget cycle from planning to reporting. Given the importance of this reform,
it features prominently in the INSTANSI-DPL.

   97. Despite some difficulties encountered during the application development stage, SPAN made
good progress in 2011 and 2012 and is expected to be rolled out in stages to all 177 Treasury Offices
(KPPN) early in FY 2013. In the past year there have been some important achievements which include:


                                                                                                         43
(i) A revised Project Charter, which contains details of activity implementation such as objectives, scope,
governance, risks and work plan schedule, was approved by all stakeholders, including the Minister of
Finance; (ii) Changes in the business processes used in the SPAN configuration were approved by the
Directors General; (iii) The Functional Requirements were frozen; (iv) The new Chart of Accounts (COA)
structure was signed-off; (v) Data from the legacy systems were validated and cleaned, ready for migration
to SPAN; and (vi) the testing phase commenced.

     98. The next critical stage in the implementation of SPAN is the completion of the application
build phase, which precedes user acceptance testing. The INSTANSI-DPL is supporting the completion
of the design and build phase for the new budget preparation system. The completion of the build phase will
reflect that all 414 Application Functional Designs (AFD) and technical designs are completed; issues on
conversion items are closed; SPAN interfaces with other external applications are finished; all programs for
customization are developed; and end-user manuals are created. Once the build phase is completed, the
SPAN application will be ready for the User Acceptance Test before it is rolled out to all treasury offices in
stages starting in early 2013.

    99. Alongside the preparation of the SPAN application the project involves the development of a
link between individual Satker and the system located in Treasury offices. An integrated web-based
application called SAKTI (Sistem Aplikasi Keuangan Terpadu Instansi) is proposed for this purpose. The
MoF has signed a contract for developing the web-based SAKTI application that will be used by all the
29,000 Spending Units to link with the SPAN (Hyperion and Oracle EBS). The finalized SAKTI application
will be used by all spending units in 2013 once SPAN is in operation. The inclusion of a solution for budget
submissions through SAKTI will be important to ensure full budget system integration and harmonization.

    100.        The SPAN project includes the development of a new budget preparation module that
provides more advanced functionality to support both budget planning and performance
management. In September 2012, the DGB has completed the design and build phase for the new budget
preparation system (Hyperion), which is ready to be tested by both DG Budget and line ministries as the
users. The completion of Hyperion has been delayed from the original scheduled roll-out in 2012 because
the developer was required to develop the Custom Web application to enable Hyperion to fulfill the needs of
DG Budget to continue to perform budget approval, virement (budget revision) and fund blocking
(“bintang?) at the Spending Unit (Satker) level. Custom Web is a connecting bridge between the SAKTI
applications, which will be used by about 29,000 work units, and Hyperion, which will be used by 250
budget portfolio program managers at the Echelon 1 level of the line ministries. The MoF is expected to use
all the new applications (SAKTI, Hyperion, Custom Web and SPAN) to support the 2014 budget
preparation in 2013, replacing the RKA-KL application.

    101.        From an accounting and reporting perspective, an important milestone has been with
the introduction of a new General Ledger under SPAN. This was accomplished in March 2012 and
marked the completion of the first step in the roll out process of SPAN. This phase reflects the daily
conversion of fiscal data from the old to the new chart of accounts (COA) in the general ledger of SPAN,
known as the "GL Open stage". It means that fiscal information can be reported on the basis of the improved
COA from the data that is now stored in the SPAN database. It is expected that the semester and annual
central government financial statement report will be prepared from SPAN in 2013, as the system is also
being fully deployed (once completed there will be no need for conversion tables as all transactions will be
processed in SPAN).

    102.       One of the most significant challenges of SPAN is to ensure that users are properly
trained and receptive to the new system. This preparation is considered one of the key success factors in
such large ICT enabled institutional reform programs. Therefore a 'Change management and
communications' program has been underway since late 2010. The program has helped the MoF complete
the training modules for SPAN and make available the necessary training related resources (e.g. detailed


                                                                                                           44
training plan, physical training facilities, trainer staff and sufficient budget). The timing of the change
management and communication program is critical to support the successful roll out of SPAN. Over the
coming year it is envisaged that the training programs for all SPAN users (Training for Trainers, End Users
and User Acceptance Test training) will be completed.

    103.         Beyond the SPAN development, the INSTANSI-DPL continues to support the MoF's
strategy to integrate ICT services across the ministry to enhance coordination and efficiency. The
creation of the ICT shared services unit for the MoF (PUSINTEK), and the gradual adoption of the ICT
blueprint recommendations have been supported under previous DPLs in order to promote greater integrity,
security, interoperability and efficiency of the ICT systems. Consistent with the direction set by the Finance
Minister the MoF has advanced ICT integration by establishing a single Data Center (DC) and consolidating
five existing DCs into a new facility (Pusintek) in Jakarta. This consolidates DCs that were previously run
separately by DG Debt Management, DG Customs, DG Budget, DG Treasury and State Revenue Module. A
further step envisaged in the coming year is to bring the IT security awareness of all MoF units to the
desired level.

    Reform Aim: Improve government accounting and audit functions

    104.        Weaknesses in internal controls and fragmentation of the internal audit function pose
a significant risk to reforms introduced in other areas of public financial management. The 2007
PEFA assessment classified internal controls as weak and the internal audit function in the country as
fragmented and characterized by weak capacity. Subsequently, the GoI issued Government Regulation No.
60/2008 and Presidential Instructions (Inpres No. 4/2011) on Government Internal Audit Systems as
required by Article 58 of Government Regulation No. 60/2008. These regulations have been a cornerstone
for government internal control and audit systems, as the Government has thereby adopted the Committee of
Sponsoring Organization (COSO) as its control framework and also clarified the roles and responsibilities of
various players in the internal audit arena. The next critical step is formulation of an internal audit strategy
and the development of a code of ethics, audit standards and peer review guidelines. However, PP No.
60/2008 mandates the creation of an association of internal auditors to perform these functions. Hence,
INSTANSI DPL supports the establishment of a task force to facilitate the creation of a professional
association of internal auditors. Once the professional association is in place, its mandate would be to
develop a code of ethics, audit standards and peer review guidelines for internal auditors.

   105. Regarding the implementation of the Government internal control system based on the
COSO model, after developing a strategy for roll-out to various ministries and line departments, a
Control Self Assessment (CSA) manual has already been prepared and is now being socialized in five line
ministries and three local governments. CSA is one of the key tools for carrying out risk mapping in the line
ministries. It is expected that all the line ministries will carry out a risk-mapping exercise, identifying the
major risks and how they can be mitigated. This is at the heart of PP No. 60/2008 and the adoption of a
COSO control framework in Indonesia.

    106. Indonesia continues to move towards accrual-based accounting. Financial reports prepared
on an accrual basis are more useful both from accountability and decision-making perspectives. The
target is to switch to full accrual accounting by 2015. The draft standards have already been prepared and
the Government has issued Government Regulation No. 71/2010 on accrual-based accounting. This marked
the achievement of policy consensus among various government stakeholders on an accounting framework
that would enable the Government to better manage its finances and risks. Subsequently, the Government
issued and disseminated a Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK No. 238/2011) on new accrual based
accounting policies and chart of accounts. The MoF regulation formally adopts the new chart of accounts
and accrual-based accounting policies.




                                                                                                             45
Policy Sub-Area I.3. Improving tax administration

     107. Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of tax administration is expected to increase
revenue while lowering taxpayers’ compliance costs. The DGT remains constrained by ineffective
systems and weak human resource management, which force it to implement an inefficient “cookie cutter?
model for the tax office organization structure and hinders the creation of professional service staff, for
example in tax audit. The focus of the current phase of tax administration reform is on strengthening the
self-assessment system, streamlining business processes, realigning the organization structure, improving
the quality and integrity of ICT, introducing risk-based compliance enforcement and resource allocation,
modernizing human resource management, improving professionalism and staff integrity and strengthening
governance to support the entire tax operations. DGT’s medium-term reform strategy is therefore
concentrated into two inter-related programmatic streams reflected in the DPL:
     • Modernizing the core tax administration system, by ensuring more equitable enforcement and
         lowering taxpayer compliance costs through improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the core
         tax administration system; and
    •   Modernizing DGT human resources, improving professionalism and staff integrity, and
        strengthening governance to reduce corruption.

     108. The Bank-supported Project for Indonesian Tax Administration Reform (PINTAR) is a
major component of DGT’s efforts to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, but procurement delays
have pushed back implementation. The USD110 million PINTAR was designed to follow a systematic
and integrated approach to strengthen and streamline business processes, modernize human resource
management, and enhance information technology infrastructure. PINTAR is also designed to adopt a
project and change management approach based on international standards and practices to implement
reforms in key aspects of the core tax administration system, including: (i) taxpayer registration, (ii) returns
and payments processing; (iii) taxpayer and revenue accounts database; (iv) centralized document
management; and (v) risk-based audit and collection. However, as with many ICT related programs, the
procurement is complex and faces significant delays and uncertainty. Furthermore, DGT is reviewing its
strategic plan and the requirements for the reform and procurement are likely to need revising.


Reform Aim: Modernize DGT human resource management

    109. Modernizing human resource management, improving professionalism and staff integrity,
and strengthening governance is a priority for DGT’s reform agenda. DGT currently has around
33,000 employees, but lacks staff in key areas, such as tax audit and HR organization. The business rules
need to be strengthened in a number of areas to promote greater controls between tax functions and
taxpayers. Although an HR Strategic Blueprint was completed in 2011, DGT currently still has limited
flexibility to reform and modernize the HR management and organization to support the overall tax
administration reforms due to the rigidity of government-wide standards. DGT will likely require
exemptions from the centralized rules currently controlled by the State Ministry of State Administration
Reform (MenPan).

     110. DGT initiated the national Bureaucracy Reform (BR) program in 2012. This was reflected in
the Director General of Taxes Decree No. 146/2012 concerning the Establishment of a BR and Institutional
Transformation Team. Since institutional transformation is also becoming a critical agenda throughout the
MoF, all the initiatives and activities in support of BR in DGT are in line with the MoF’s broader
institutional transformation objectives, which are reflected in the MoF’s Destination Statement 2014.
Furthermore, DGT’s BR programs follow MenPan-RB Regulation No. 20/2010, which includes nine pillars
in support of the national micro program of BR: (i) Change Management; (ii) Laws and Regulations
Alignment; (iii) Organizational Strengthening and Alignment; (iv) Business Process Improvement; (v) HR


                                                                                                             46
Management Improvement; (vi) Supervisory Strengthening; (vii) Performance Accountability; (viii) Public
Service Quality Improvement; and (ix) Monitoring and Evaluation.

     111. In carrying out BR and designing the future organization structure, DGT will need to
undergo restructuring. DGT is assessing the impact of the current strategic plan and future concepts for
the operations relative to DGT’s current organization. The initiative to review the strengths and weaknesses
of its current organization structure provides an opportunity to realign the future business processes with the
future organization structure, although in the absence of PINTAR this is likely to be a more limited process
and the original milestone of approving a new organizational impact assessment for the reforms has been
dropped. Instead, the DGT will focus on a few priority areas to reform, including developing the
organization and procedures for strengthening the data processing centers, procurement services and
taxpayer call centers. A new performance management system is also being developed to help focus and
monitor tax auditors’ work to more priority cases, taking a more risked-based approach.

Reform Aim: Modernize the core tax administration system

    112. Major outreach programs and simplification efforts have increased the number of registered
taxpayers from a total of about 4.8 million in 2006 to more than 20 million by 2012. However, the
increase in the number of registered taxpayers, who are mostly individuals and small businesses, has not
resulted in a significant increase in revenues, as substantial coverage gaps and systemic weaknesses remain.

    113. The delay in PINTAR has pushed back the deployment of a new integrated core tax
information system to at least 2015. To maintain the reform momentum DGT is continuing to identify and
realize “quick wins.? These include improving the performance of the current ICT system (SIDJP),
removing duplicates from the taxpayer master file, systematically compiling third-party data, further
developing tools to facilitate compliance activities, reallocating human resources based on risks and revenue
potential, and implementing online systems for processing VAT refunds for tourists. One of the most
important reforms to increase revenue in the short term is to be able to check tax assessments and audits
against third-party sources. To this end, the Government has issued a Government Regulation for the
implementation of Article 35A of Law 28/2007, and a Minister of Finance decree on the sharing of data
between DG Tax and DG Customs, all of this to facilitate the sharing of third party information for
improved tax compliance. Another milestone in the reform, is DGT is also stabilizing and upgrading its
existing core tax system, SIDJP, and gradually replacing the outdated, off-line tax system, SIPMOD, which
is currently still operating in more than 150 tax offices, and integrating them into SIDJP. After the
integration is completed, all tax offices will have access to an integrated, centralized registration system and
taxpayer accounts. In addition, tax offices will be able to assess taxpayer compliance using specialized
benchmarking tools.

     114. DGT is continuing to enhance the regulatory environment to support the modernization and
efficiency of the tax system. The issuance of three priority regulations is included in the INSTANSI DPL
as benchmark actions. A new MoF regulation is designed to allow oil and gas production sharing contractors
to pay income tax in kind to reduce oil imports and transaction costs in the sector (supporting Government
Regulation No. 79/2010 regarding the income tax to increase the share of oil and gas production for
domestic use). Strengthening the regulations regarding taxes and duties on the export and import of goods
to and from the many Free Trade Zones and Free Ports is designed to control the use to legitimate
transactions while the regulation on the Taxpayer Identification Number and Taxable Entrepreneurs is
designed to improve the reliability of the system, where there are currently often multiple and duplicate
identifiers.

   115. Moving forward, DGT needs to realign all strategic reform initiatives and update its
medium-term strategic plan to obtain commitment from DGT top management. Besides implementing
PINTAR, DGT is also carrying out a major bureaucracy reform, which is part of the ministry-wide initiative.


                                                                                                             47
In addition, DGT is currently reviewing and considering for restructuring its organization structure. These
major initiatives as well as other donor-supported activities and “quick wins? require realignment with the
existing and to-be-updated DGT Strategic Plan to obtain top management commitment and ensure
availability of resources.

    A.2. Policy Area II: Poverty Reduction

    116. To further accelerate the pace of poverty reduction, the Government is pursuing key reforms
of its national poverty reduction programs. These reforms include institutionalizing governance
structures to improve the overall coordination and implementation of poverty reduction programs;
developing systems for M&E program delivery and effectiveness, and assessment of the programs;
developing a national targeting system to ensure that program benefits reach the intended poor and
vulnerable beneficiaries; and empowering local governments, communities and service providers to deliver
quality services as an effective approach to leverage local knowledge to identify obstacles to development
while building capacity for coordinated action. INSTANSI DPL will support the Government’s reform
objective by improving governance and institutional accountability through the strengthening of M&E
systems, enhancing the targeting of the poor, improving household targeted poverty reduction programs that
have been prioritized by the Government, and improving community based poverty reduction programs.

    Reform Aim: Improve governance and institutional accountability

     117. The Government has re-organized the institutional arrangements for the governance and
oversight of the national poverty alleviation programs to support an ambitious reform agenda. In
2010, the President elevated oversight of the poverty strategy to the National Team for the Acceleration of
Poverty Reduction (TNP2K), which is chaired by the Vice-President. The key objectives of TNP2K are to:
(i) design and oversee a large-scale program of social assistance and poverty reduction; (ii) consolidate,
simplify, and improve the efficiency of existing programs; and (iii) identify important but troubled social
assistance programs and resolve their implementation problems. TNP2K is supported by a Secretariat that is
responsible for drafting policies (with a priority on social assistance reform), establishing a national
targeting system, and integrating monitoring and evaluation activities. The Secretariat includes six working
groups that function as internal ‘think tanks’ focusing on: (i) Cluster I; (ii) health fee waivers for the poor
(Jamkesmas); (iii) Cluster II; (iv) Cluster III; (v) targeting, and; (vi) M&E. The mandate of TNP2K and its
Secretariat extends for the full duration of the current administration, until the end of 2014.

     118. The M&E working group under TNP2K is spearheading efforts to develop an integrated
M&E framework for major poverty reduction programs. Program M&E functions have typically been
carried out individually by the respective implementing agencies. However, neither the extent of M&E
activities, nor the quality has been consistent. As a result, the Government is highly reliant on monitoring
and evaluation activities carried out by research institutions and development agencies. The M&E working
group serves as the focal point within the Government that provides high-quality and up-to-date information
about the performance of the key national poverty reduction programs. Its development of an M&E
framework will support decisions by TNP2K concerning program mix, scale and budget allocations while,
at the same time, improving public accountability over the use of public resources.

    Reform Aim: Improve poverty measurements and targeting of the poor

   119. One of the key reforms to improve the integration and effectiveness of social assistance
programs is the establishment of a national targeting system for household poverty reduction
programs. Previously, household poverty reduction programs used different targeting approaches and relied
on separate recipient databases. This leads to duplication of efforts, inconsistency in application, and
dampened program impact. There is also the need for a sensitive poverty measurement and targeting of the
poor that consider the different gender features and impact of poverty at intra-household level, which could


                                                                                                            48
provide information on women’s and men’s different access and control over resources, including benefits
from anti poverty and social protection program. To address these issues, a targeting working group was
established in the Secretariat of TNP2K. The working group has been tasked with creating and maintaining a
national targeting system that will be housed in the TNP2K Secretariat.

    120. TNP2K has successfully created a national registry of poor and vulnerable households that
can be used to improve the targeting of social assistance programs. This action was one of the priority
reforms identified in the Government’s medium-term development plan and subsequent Presidential
Instructions. To prepare for the reform, the Central Bureau of Indonesia (BPS) conducted a large-scale
assessment of 25 million households (PPLS11), or just over 40 percent of all Indonesian households during
July-August 2011. Households to be assessed were identified using a mix of census-based pre-listed
households, community referrals, and updating of existing lists. Proxy-means test (PMT) models were
developed to estimate household consumption and applied to the PPLS11 data as a basis for the registry of
about 25 million poor and vulnerable households. In January 2012, the TNP2K Secretariat delivered the
registry to the Vice-President who, in turn, issued instructions stipulating that program beneficiary lists for
Cluster 1 programs (Rice for the Poor - RASKIN, Conditional Cash Transfer - PKH, Scholarship for the
Poor - BSM and Health Fee Waiver for the Poor - Jamkesmas) must be extracted from the unified database
by the TNP2K Secretariat, using eligibility criteria identified by the implementing agencies. Subsequently,
the TNP2K has signed MoUs with the Coordinating Ministry of Peoples Welfare, the Ministry of Health, the
Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Social Affairs, whereby the referred ministries agreed
to use the unified database held by the TNP2K Secretariat to select the beneficiaries of the Raskin,
Jamkesmas, BSM and PKH programs, respectively.

     121. There is good reason to believe that the creation of a national registry represents a significant
advance in targeting poor households for social assistance in Indonesia. The initial 2005 list of the poor
(PSE05) was constructed hastily by the BPS using a simple scoring system to classify households within
poverty categories. The quality of the scoring was limited by the need to quickly apply it before a planned
fuel price increase. More problematically, the households to be assessed were largely selected by sub-
village heads on the basis of unknown and subjective criteria, meaning that many poor households were
excluded from the list and many non-poor households included. It has been estimated that over 50 percent of
the target population for the list were excluded. The 2008 update of this list (PPLS08) used international-
standard PMT models to assess households, but mainly revisited the 2005 list, meaning that many excluded
poor remained off the list. In 2011, however, over 70 percent of the households assessed came from a new
listing of potentially poor households, drawn from information in the 2010 Population Census, meaning all
households in Indonesia had a chance of being included. Also, the new registry was created using new and
advanced PMT models that were developed and tested by the TNP2K Secretariat and the Bank.

     122. Implementing agencies have begun to use the national registry to improve the targeting
performance of national social assistance programs. Beneficiary lists for RASKIN program, a reissuance
of Jamkesmas (health fee waiver) cards and the PKH expansion were extracted from the registry.
Discussions between the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) and TNP2K have resulted in
an agreement to use the new data to target any household-targeted emergency and/or crisis response
programs. Broader demand for targeting assistance is rapidly growing: to date, the TNP2K Secretariat has
received over 25 requests from local governments and agencies to use the unified database. The Targeting
Working Group in the TNP2K Secretariat has been actively recruiting a larger team, which is an important
institutional development for the management and implementation of the emerging national targeting
system.

    123. The TNP2K Secretariat is also preparing an integrated complaints and grievances process
that will help in updating the national registry. A clear process for addressing complaints and grievances
that quickly resolves disputes is a critical component of National Targeting System. The most common
complaints are usually related to poor households being excluded from a program, which would only


                                                                                                            49
become known after program beneficiary lists are extracted and applies. Therefore, the targeting unit in the
National Team’s Secretariat plans to develop a coordinated process for each program and ensuring that
eligible households that receive one social assistance program can also receive other social assistance
programs. Towards establishing a coordinated grievance and complaint resolution system, the TNP2K
Secretariat is currently preparing a pilot of complaint and grievances mechanism for the PKH program.

    124. Proposed revisions for the poverty measurement methodology will be submitted for the
consideration of the next administration. The Government has taken a series of preparatory steps towards
the revision of the methodology, which were included as previous prior actions for the DPL-7. BPS has
completed national poverty line simulations using the alternative measurement methodologies. The TNP2K
Secretariat has also conducted a series of consultations in BPS and key government stakeholders to identify
a poverty measurement methodology for consideration, which included universities, NGOs and key line
ministries. Given the sensitivity of the debate on poverty levels and how these are calculated, the
Government has made a decision not to move forward with adopting a revised methodology, but
recommends that the change be undertaken by the next administration upon entry into office in order to de-
politicize the debate concerning poverty measurement. Nevertheless, the decision by the Government not to
revise the poverty measurement methodology will not affect progress towards meeting its poverty reduction
targets, as the baseline and target are based on the current methodology, and will be the metric used to
measure success. Also, even though the GoI has opted not to implement measurement reforms during the
current administration, the test models indicate that the improvements would not have resulted in major
changes in identification of the poor.

    Reform Aim: Improve household-targeted poverty reduction programs

    125. The Government is committed to reforming and integrating its array of household-based
social assistance programs. To address the current fragmentation of household programs, the Government
announced its intent to move towards developing an integrated family-based social assistance system (RPJM
2010-14). Reforms are not only needed across programs, but also within individual programs to improve
their effectiveness. Several priority programs are the focus of current reform efforts including: the
household-based conditional cash transfer program (PKH), health fee waivers for the poor (Jamkesmas), and
scholarships for the poor. At the same time, much remains to be learned about the other social assistance
programs in order to support future reforms agendas.

    126. A program providing health fee waivers to poor households is part of the Government’s
overall commitment to enroll the entire population in a public health insurance scheme. The
Government will implement a new national social security system over the course of the next four years that
will radically change the social protection paradigm. The legal basis for these changes are the national
social security law (SJSN law), enacted in 2004, and the recently enacted law on administrators (BPJS Law),
enacted in November 2011. The new social protection program will cover all Indonesians for five benefits,
namely health, pensions, old-age savings, death benefits and worker accident.

    127. The Government is reviewing the design and financial sustainability of the national health
insurance program targeting poor households. The review is part of an overall review of the social
security and safety net programs coordinated by the Coordinating Ministry for People’s Welfare and for
which a new Social Assistance Commission has been established. Once the review is completed, the
Government will assess how to scale up the programs to eventually achieve universal coverage, while
maintaining financial sustainability. The programs would need to be designed to support the substantial
proportion of poor and near-poor households that need assistance, many of whom live in rural and remote
areas, and are self-employed people or working in the informal sector. There is little information about the
benefits package and its likely impact on the health and financial security of the uninsured. There is also
limited understanding regarding the infrastructure and human resources needed to assure effective access to
the promised benefits and the measures to ensure quality and efficiency. The ambition to achieve universal


                                                                                                         50
health care coverage is indeed an ambitious and long-term reform agenda, extending far beyond the DPL
timeframe. The Government has set its objective to achieve universal health insurance coverage (UHC)
incrementally by 2019. This decision subsequently has raised questions regarding institutional arrangement
for Jamkesmas program and the sustainability of the UHC program. In that regard, the TNP2K Secretariat
completed a review of new institutional arrangements for the delivery of Jamkesmas, taking into account
actuarial cost estimates and various scenarios for achieving universal health insurance coverage. The new
institutional arrangements for the national social health insurance consequently involve two existing social
health insurance programs beside the Jamkesmas program. Although the Government has initiated the
development of the new arrangement, the complexity of merging these health plans which have different
operation systems, benefit packages and target population groups, requires additional time. Therefore the
schedule for the finalization of the new institutional arrangement for the Jamkesmas program has changed to
a new schedule in 2013.

    128. The Government is also focusing on reforming programs that provide scholarship to students
from poor households. These scholarship programs exist at all public schools across all levels of education
and provide currently enrolled students from poor households with an annual cash transfer in one lump sum
installment. The funds are intended for use on education fees and other non-fee costs of attending school,
such as transportation to school and uniforms, and thereby aim to remove barriers to access to education.
BSM is actually not a unified program, but rather consists of 10 largely independent scholarship programs,
with implementation responsibilities delineated by type and level of education, and lack of a central
coordinating unit. While the program shows potential, the design and implementation of the program
undermines its effectiveness. Attention is needed to pursue reforms to coordinate the programs and improve
their impact.

    129. A review of the scholarship programs indicates reforms are needed to improve the delivery
and effectiveness. The program review, conducted by the World Bank as part of the social assistance public
expenditure and program review, found that although the scholarships programs are national in reach, they
reach few students and perform suboptimally in identifying poor students. Also, the programs tend not to
target those who are unfamiliar with the school system and its administrators. One major difficulty is that
participation in the programs does not help address difficult and costly transition years — between
elementary and junior secondary, and again between junior and senior secondary — when the overwhelming
majority of dropouts occur. Finally, support operations like M&E are weak because these functions have
been partly delegated to schools, which are also the main agency in charge of delivering scholarship funds to
beneficiaries.

     130. The TNP2K Secretariat is working together with the Ministry of Education and Culture to
reform its scholarship programs. Reviews of the design and performance of the scholarship programs
have been used by the TNP2K Secretariat’s Cluster 1 Working Group to identify actions for a program
reform strategy. This strategy has been used as the basis for engaging with the Ministry and specific units
responsible for the implementation of individual scholarship programs. Several advances have been made in
initiating reform actions, including a pilot to use the national registry to target new entrants to junior
secondary school (SMP) who have been excluded from the BSM program in the past. Due to budget
limitations, however, the pilot is currently restricted to targeting the poorest 5-10 percent of households

    131. At the same time the Government will examine more closely the performance of Raskin, the
subsidized rice distribution program. Raskin is the longest-serving of the permanent social assistance
programs, and aims to help households fulfill their food needs and reduce their financial burden through the
provision of subsidized rice. The program typically accounts for over half of total expenditures on social
assistance, estimated at 54 percent in 2010. There is much room for improvement in the performance of the
program. Although Bulog documents state that almost enough rice was procured in 2010 (but not in
previous years), all the Raskin rice eventually available on the ground implies that slightly less than half of
the promised 14 kilograms was available to eligible households. Further sharing or redistribution (at the


                                                                                                            51
village level) to non-eligible households meant that targeted households only received between 3 and 4
kilograms. Given the size of the program and ongoing food security concerns, there is growing interest in
reforming the program in order to improve its ability to protect poor and vulnerable households.

     132. The National Team Secretariat, therefore, is also working together with the Coordinating
Ministry of Social Welfare (Menko Kesra) to improve Raskin’s performance. Reforms began with three
actions: i) applying new quotas that are closer in-line with current poverty rates, ii) extracting beneficiary
names and addresses from the national registry, and iii) publicly posting the name of program beneficiaries.
The TNP2K Secretariat has also initiated a pilot project with Menko Kesra that will distribute cards directly
to beneficiaries containing clear information on the amounts to which they are entitled. The aim of the pilot
is to improve program transparency and accountability in order to increase benefit levels actually received
by beneficiary households.

    Reform Aim: Improve community-based poverty reduction programs

     133. As a national program and pillar of the Government’s Cluster 2 poverty reduction strategy,
the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM) is at a critical juncture. While PNPM
continues to deliver tremendous results in communities, ongoing analysis shows the fragility of some of
PNPM’s institutions, both nationally and locally. The 2011 National PNPM Congress provided a platform
for representatives from communities, local government and various stakeholders to share and discuss with
the senior leadership in the Coordinating Ministry for People’s Welfare, TNP2K, Bappenas, Ministry of
Home Affairs, and Ministry of Public Works what their views and aspirations for the program up to 2014
and beyond. The results of this rigorous analytical work and over 12 years experience with PNPM and its
processor community-driven development programs, are being used to inform the Government’s PNPM
Roadmap, which articulates the strategic direction for PNPM. The Government has finalized the PNPM
Roadmap, which covers strategic directions and action plan for the PNPM. After public consultation and
formal endorsement of the PNPM Roadmap, its implementation by line ministries is expected to start in
early 2013. The Roadmap is expected to help guide the long-term implementation of the PNPM program
and strengthen integration with local governments. Key areas of focus of the PNPM Roadmap include: (a)
integration of multiple PNPM programs at the local level; (b) clarification of roles of facilitators; (c)
strengthening of capacity of local level institutions and clarification of legal framework; (d) adoption of core
PNPM principles in functioning of Local Government; and (e) good governance and downward
accountability." The PNPM Roadmap is also expected to help address gender equality issues, particularly
through the action plans on integration of community empowerment program, the role of Local Government
and good governance. The PNPM-Rural in particular plays a substantial role in addressing gender issues, as
it reaches about 40 million beneficiaries, with about half of which are estimated to be women. The PNPM-
Rural supports a savings and loan group or Revolving Loan Fund (RLF) that is exclusively targeted on
women and has benefitted about 4 million beneficiaries, who are organized in 463,796 groups. Women are
informed about the availability and conditions of the initiative through facilitators at community level.

    134. The Government continues to take steps to strengthen PNPM program’s fiduciary and
management systems. During the preparation of PNPM-Rural IV in 2011, the Government and
development partners agreed to strengthen the program’s: (a) institutional and management capacity; (b)
management information systems (MIS); (c) complaints handling system; (d) formal and informal fiduciary
controls; and (e) quality of facilitation. Progress has been made during the implementation of PNPM-Rural
IV in the strengthening of fiduciary and management arrangements. An MIS Improvement Project, which
includes the development of a more effective and robust complaints handling system to enable effective data
collection, and analysis as well as meaningful reporting to management, is underway. The Government is
introducing service standards for improving management and responsiveness to beneficiaries, particularly in
areas that have experienced major complaints. These service standards have been finalized and
disseminated and now need to be monitored and followed up. The Government's existing complaints
handling system is being improved and expanded with an SMS (text message)-gateway, which is now


                                                                                                             52
operational, and a web based system, which is now being finalized. The web based system will undergo
final user acceptance testing and is expected to be implemented in late 2012.


    B. Participatory Processes and Consultations

     135. Democratic consolidation and decentralization of authority in Indonesia have translated into
a political preference for wide buy-in and participatory, consensus-building approaches to decision-
making, not only in terms of regulatory reforms but also planning and budgeting processes. While
this is believed to have slowed or blunted some reform measures, it is believed to mitigate against
radicalism, steadily improve public participation, and contribute to more democratic, accountable,
professional and responsive governance. This commitment has been formalized and endorsed through
several regulations (e.g. Law No. 25/2004 on National Development Planning and Joint Ministerial Decree
2006 and 2007 on Musrenbang), including those institutionalizing the creation of multi-stakeholder
consultation forums — Musrenbang (Musyawarah Rencana Pembangunan) — at all levels, concerning
several time frames. Musrenbang is the principal process for negotiating, reconciling and harmonizing
differences between the Government and non-government stakeholders, and reaching collective consensus
on development priorities, including regulatory reforms and budgets. While challenges still remain, the
instrument is being increasingly adopted at all government levels.

    136. Beyond the officially recognized participatory processes, various aspects of the reforms
supported by this operation have been subject to extensive specific stakeholders consultations. In the
public financial management and poverty alleviation areas a large number of seminars and workshops have
been undertaken during the past year among different government agencies, as well as between the
administration and other key relevant stakeholders, not only to discuss technical issues but also reach
agreements on policies and reform activities. During the preparation of INSTANSI DPL, a series of policy
discussions was held as part of the ongoing engagement with the core economic ministries, culminating in a
series of half-day meetings with key counterparts in each of the relevant areas or sub-areas. A roadmap of
milestones was then developed, which conforms to the Government’s own reform agenda, as laid out in the
DPL program matrix in Annex 3. This program matrix will continue to be adjusted and refined as progress
continues to be assessed and discussions mature.


    C. The Future Program

     137. An indicative policy program for next year’s DPL operation has been discussed with the
Government in order to help map out the reforms supported under the entire DPL series. This
mapping out of the overall two-year DPL series allows a more strategic consideration of critical subsequent
reforms and provides the basis for judgment on the continuation of the next DPL operation. A total of 8
triggers have been tentatively identified for the next INSTANSI DPL operation. However, these are ideas
that have recently emerged, which will need to be adjusted and refined as progress is made and discussions
evolve. In essence, the Government envisages that future reforms that might be supported by the DPL series
would move beyond the strengthening of the control and compliance framework and systems, although
further improvements are planned in these areas, to enhance the performance orientation of the budget and
PFM and to help strengthen the budget as a tool for meeting many of the other RPJMN targets as the focus
shifts toward enhancing the Quality of Spending. This would help to bring the two pillars of the INSTANSI
DPL closer together, focusing support for PFM and poverty reforms on the quality of public spending and
the delivery of services.

                      VI. OPERATIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES

    A. Monitoring and Evaluation

    A.1. Monitoring

    138. Monitoring the implementation and attainment of the DPL prior actions is done through
regular meetings between GoI and development partners as well as the ongoing engagement with
agencies responsible for different prior actions. GoI has established monitoring committees and/or
technical groups that are responsible for ensuring the implementation of agreed prior actions as well as
progress follow-up. In addition, the DPL benefits from regular joint donor-Government meetings to discuss
interim progress in achieving agreed milestones in the reform agenda (held in April and June 2012 for the
preparation of INSTANSI DPL) and ongoing policy dialogue between the GoI and World Bank teams.
Table 6 below indicates the critical monitoring activities in each policy area.

                        activities

A.2. Evaluation

    139. A results framework has been prepared with a number of indicators to be assessed at the end
of the current DPL programmatic series. The Bank will work closely with the Coordinating Ministry for
Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and other relevant agencies to monitor and assess reform
progress and impacts during the life of the program. In addition to ongoing monitoring of activities, the
Bank prepares an Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) at the end of each series. The ICR,
prepared in consultation with the Government and development partners, is a Bank self-evaluation reporting
tool that highlights the key achievements and results, as well as lessons learned. The ICR for all previous
DPL series (DPLs 1-4, 5-6 and 7-8) show the significant progress that the GOI has made in its reform efforts
since 2004, as well as highlight the role that the DPL has had in supporting that progress, by ensuring the
alignment of support provided by development partners with GoI own reform efforts, promoting synergies
between program support and other Bank instruments, focusing attention from both the Government and
development partners on the most relevant reforms as well as empowering key reform oriented government
officials to advance the implementation of necessary reforms. Monitoring and evaluation will also be
supported by budgetary, legislative and economic data provided by the authorities and verified in official
disclosures, directives and regulations. Baseline and updated data will be provided by the respective
specialized agencies and tracked according to the Monitoring and Results Framework included in Annex 3.




                                                                                                         55
    B. Poverty and Social Impacts and Environmental Aspects

    B.1. Poverty

    140. The INSTANSI DPL policy actions are unlikely to have significant poverty and social
consequences or significant environmental effects, while several actions have the potential to deliver
positive outcomes on poverty over the medium term. The strengthening of public financial management
systems are expected to have significant, if indirect, poverty and social benefits. Improvements in public
financial management will improve the capacity of the Government to provide public goods and services,
which also benefit the poor. The transparency and quality of public spending and the provision of public
services will allow social programs to have a greater impact on targeted populations. With the tax reform
actions the Government plans to reduce tax gaps and introduce new systems and procedures that facilitate
better compliance, thereby contributing to increased revenue collections and generating additional fiscal
resources that can be used in economic development and poverty alleviation efforts. Overall public savings
through better fiscal management will allow the GoI to dedicate more resources to pro-poor programs.

    141. The policy actions aimed at enhancing poverty reduction and strengthening service delivery
should have positive effects over the short and medium term. The National Team for the Acceleration of
Poverty Reduction continues to address the issues of fragmentation and lack of coordination, to improve the
effectiveness of national poverty reduction programs. Improvements in systems for better targeting of
poverty alleviation programs and measurement of poverty are also expected to support the poor by ensuring
that these programs reach the appropriate beneficiaries and by ensuring the availability of more reliable data
and information — including those that are gender-disaggregated — which are needed to make sound policy
decisions. Household-based poverty reduction programs are being strengthened, which will improve the
coverage of health insurance for all families, including the poor, and increase the number of scholarships for
poor students at all education levels. Further, finalizing the PNPM-Mandiri road map for strategic directions
and action plan will help to ensure the program’s ongoing effectiveness and sustainability. Other actions
aim to improve the PNPM programs ability and effectiveness in responding to and addressing concerns
raised by program beneficiaries. Together, these actions are expected to yield positive impacts to the poor
and vulnerable social groups throughout Indonesia.

    B.2. Gender

    142. As equitable development is a major concern for the Government, the DPL also supports
institutional and policy reform aimed towards benefiting women in poor households. The medium term
development plan (RPJMN) outlined the importance of increasing the role of women in development,
particularly women’s leadership in public sector, business community and social organizations. This DPL
program in particular supports the strengthening of a PNPM-Mandiri program, which diligently involves
women during its implementation. The PNPM program places strong emphasis on the promotion of
women’s participation in rural areas in particular, with a number of initiatives to improve gender equity and
increase women’s participation. PNPM-Rural adopted the successful strategy to promote gender equity and
women’s empowerment of KDP, including: (i) economic empowerment by revolving funds and
microfinance programs involving women as members; (ii) political empowerment by ensuring women’s
voices are heard during program development and planning through establishing women’s specific forum;
and (iii) social empowerment by requiring that one of the two village development proposals come from
women’s planning group.

   143. Reform in the area of targeted social assistance will also benefit the poor and vulnerable
females. The National Targeting System (NTS) will be used to target poor households, especially vulnerable
households with certain practical and strategic gender needs such as households with pregnant women or
headed by women. The proposed NTS design and social service data collection survey (PPLS11) will



                                                                                                           56
ensure that such programs can be properly targeted. Furthermore, the analytical research and field
experiments will consider the practical and strategic gender needs on targeting outcomes, such as the legal
status of female-headed households, and the gender impact of holding community meetings in the day or
evening. Hence, improving the effectiveness of targeting will directly benefit this constituency.

    B.3. Environmental

     144. The proposed operation is unlikely to have significant positive or negative effects on the
environment, forests and other natural resources. Policy area 1.1 actions to strengthen public financial
management through the budget formulation and M&E systems and to improve the results orientation and
medium-term view in the budget process will not have negative environmental effects. Policy area 1.2
actions to strengthen budget execution and cash management systems and improve accounting and audit
policies, functions and practices will not have negative environmental effects. Both areas of action are more
likely to have positive social effects in terms of improving governance, transparency and accountability.
Pillar 2 actions to enhance poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts through measurement, targeting of
the poor, improved eligibility criteria and improved institutional arrangements for delivering and expanding
health insurance coverage will not have negative environmental effects. These actions are designed to have
positive social effects in reducing poverty and increasing insurance coverage.


    C. Fiduciary Aspects, Disbursement and Auditing


   145. Public financial management is a central policy area that is supported by the proposed DPL
operation. Annexes 5 and 7 provide a detailed discussion on the state of public financial management in the
country. The Fiduciary Assessment for Indonesia has been carried out and the Fiduciary Risk is rated as
Moderate. This discussion and the conclusions therein are appropriate for the proposed INSTANSI DPL.
    146. In summary, significant strides have been made in recent years in the way Indonesia’s public
finances are managed and in increasing transparency and independent oversight. In the last three
years, progress has been made in the area of budget execution, with the development of a unified budget and
a Treasury Single Account (TSA) to strengthen the comprehensiveness and control over spending and cash
management. In addition, there have been improvements in the coverage of fiscal accounts, accounting
practices, payroll, internal controls and fiscal risk management. Notably, the 2009 audit report was the first
to achieve a qualified audit opinion, as opposed to a disclaimer, with around 40 percent of ministries and
agencies achieving unqualified audit opinions. However, improvements are required in several areas
including refinement in performance-based budgeting, strengthening internal and external audit, improving
spending outturns. Weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually
addressed through the Government’s PFM reform program. Also, key elements of the reforms are supported
by the DPL series, as well as the GFMRAP project and other initiatives supported by development partners.
Furthermore, the Government has also demonstrated increased focus on budget transparency by publishing
the annual budget in a timely manner, through the MoF website.
    147. The borrower is the Republic of Indonesia and this operation is a single-tranche IBRD loan
of USD 300 million. The loan will be made available upon loan effectiveness, as the Bank is satisfied with
the progress achieved by the Borrower in carrying out the Program and with the adequacy of the Borrower’s
macroeconomic policy framework. The Government has confirmed that Indonesia will borrow this amount
as a Variable Spread Loan (VSL) in US dollar currency with an annuity repayment schedule linked to
commitments.
    148. The loan disbursement will follow the standard Bank procedures for Development Policy
Lending. The loan amount will be disbursed into a foreign currency account of the borrower at Bank
Indonesia that forms part of Indonesia’s official foreign exchange reserves. The equivalent rupiah amount
will immediately be transferred to the General Operational Treasury (SBUN) account of the borrower that is


                                                                                                           57
used to finance budget expenditures, as the loan is intended to be used to support the general Government
budget. This arrangement has been followed for the previous DPLs. The borrower, within 30 days, will
provide to the Bank a written confirmation that this transfer has been completed, and provide to the Bank
any other relevant information relating to these matters, including the exchange rate of the conversion from
US dollars to rupiah, that the Bank may reasonably request. Disbursements of the loan will not be linked to
any specific purchases and no procurement requirements have to be satisfied, except that the borrower is
required to comply with the standard negative list of excluded items that may not be financed with Bank
loan proceeds, as defined in Schedule 1 to the loan agreement. If any portion of the loan is used to finance
ineligible expenditures as so defined in the loan agreement, the Bank has the right to require the
Government to promptly, upon notice from IBRD, refund the amount equal to such payment to the Bank.
Amounts refunded to the Bank will be cancelled from the loan.
     149. The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The
country is no longer subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last
subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That
assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements
of Bank Indonesia. The main recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment of an
independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia and the publication of Bank Indonesia’s audited financial
statements. Audited financial statements for Bank Indonesia for 2011 have been reviewed and the audit
report issued by the BPK contained an unqualified opinion. Given that the foreign exchange environment
does not present a significant risk, a separate annual audit will not be needed for this operation.

    D. Risks

     150. Continued strong performance by the Government on its reform agenda and the achievement
of its medium-term objectives are subject to several risks. These can be broken down into the following
categories: political risks; external vulnerabilities; increasing food prices; the risks posed by subsidies;
fiduciary and reputational risks; and institutional capacity risks.

     151. Some recent policymaking outcomes from the administration have tended to be protectionist,
generating concerns that there may be increasing risk of political pressure by vested interests. The risk
of political pressure by vested interests may result in lobbying efforts that could potentially undermine
progress in some reform areas. For example, the issuance of a decree that will eventually eliminate foreign
majority ownership of mines, appears to signify the move away from efficiency and towards serving special
interests. Other controversial policy moves include: the scrapping of direct gubernatorial elections, in what
is the first move to diminish democracy in Indonesia since it embarked on its democratization process in
1998; the banning of rattan exports to protect domestic furniture makers; restrictions on imports of
horticultural products; and the tighter rules on establishing retail and restaurant franchises, in a bid to
promote domestic businesses at the expense of foreign competitors. Overall, this protectionist trend and the
regulatory uncertainty that it creates could potentially expand to other sectors, especially if economic growth
slows as a result of the accelerating global slowdown and also as political tensions build in the run-up to
2014. The DPL program is expected to help put in place a mechanism for stronger GoI coordination and
consultation on key reform areas, thereby providing more regulatory certainty.

    152. The multiplicity of implementing agencies and their varying institutional capacities could
create a challenge in coordinating the DPL reform efforts. The reforms supported by the INSTANSI
DPL are driven by priorities that were developed and articulated formally through dialogue and consensus
within the Government, hence their implementation help further enhance coordination between the relevant
various ministries and agencies. The overall commitment and ownership to reforms also remains strong, and
the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs has performed very well in ensuring consistent and
effective cross-ministerial coordination. The DPL program has also helped strengthen the capacity of




                                                                                                            58
various institutions involved in the DPL program, which is also complemented by other Bank instruments,
including investment projects, technical assistance and AAA.

    153. Significant and rapid shifts in market sentiment could result in sudden, large and potentially
disruptive capital outflows while the external accounts, and growth outlook, remain sensitive to global
commodity prices and demand, particularly from China. Changes in market sentiment may be due to
external factors, such as movements in global risk aversion, which expose Indonesia’s continued economic
vulnerabilities. However, there have been significant improvements in the Indonesian macroeconomic
framework in recent years, which have translated into improved resilience to external shocks. The
Government has also developed a track record in precautionary and proactive measures during the recent
global financial turmoil, which would help limit the impact of turbulence in international markets on
Indonesia. Furthermore, the recent PERISAI DPL, approved in May 2012, plus the parallel facilities from
other development partners, explicitly aims to mitigate GoI financing concerns in the face of a crisis. But, in
addition to financial shocks, recent export declines have highlighted Indonesia's exposure to adverse
movements in global commodity prices and demand. One source of such shocks would be a sharper-than-
expected slowdown in China, which would also have regional spillovers to markets such as Japan, with the
effects feeding through into Indonesia's domestic demand and growth. With the current account moving into
deficit, and portfolio flows remaining volatile, there is therefore a need for continued emphasis on
supporting the performance of FDI.

    154. Highly volatile international oil prices create uncertainty about the Government’s energy
subsidies costs, hampering overall budget spending. The revised 2012 Budget approved by Parliament
provided for the possibility of increasing subsidized fuel prices, if international oil prices were 15 percent
above the level assumed in the budget over a six-month period, combined with cash transfers to the poor.
However, with international oil prices falling, this condition is unlikely to be met in 2012. Fuel subsidy
spending in 2013 remains very high, reflecting continued increases in consumption, and imposing a
substantial opportunity cost in terms of spending on other key development priorities. In the run-up to the
next presidential election in 2014, it is uncertain whether and when the Government will implement a fuel
price hike given that it represents a relatively unpopular policy.

    155. Challenges remain to improve Indonesia’s public financial management. However, in recent
years Indonesia has made significant strides in the way its public finances are managed and in increasing
transparency and independent oversight. In almost all areas of public financial management, changes in the
legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum has shifted towards
implementation of new practices. The Fiduciary Assessment for Indonesia has been carried out and the
Fiduciary Risk is rated as Moderate.

    156. Rises in domestic and international food prices may offset some of the benefits of growth and
divert Government attention from longer term reforms. The GoI is well aware of the risks and
challenges that lie ahead and has taken a number of precautionary and proactive measures in response.
These include the use of trade measures, as in 2008, to mitigate the impact of rising food prices; the use of
budgetary sources to expand social protection program and to intervene in stabilizing food prices; and
issuance of Presidential Decree No. 5/2011 to implement mitigation actions aimed at safeguarding domestic
rice production against extreme weather. For non-food, non-oil commodity prices the opposite dynamics are
present. For example, sharp falls in prices could spill over to domestic consumption and investment.

    main priorities are. Rather, the DPL program needs to be “driven? by the government’s own reform
    agenda and perhaps more importantly, that the pace and scope of reforms be driven by the judgment and
    tactical sense of key reformers regarding what may or may not be bureaucratically or politically feasible
    at a particular point in time. Such an approach is not without its tradeoffs. The pace of reforms may, at
    times, and on certain issues seem more incremental rather than“substantive?. However, this also helps to
    break down the reforms into deliverable segments that maintain the reform momentum and consolidate
    implementation until the timing was right for larger breakthroughs (e.g. as happened with the TSA and
    NSW) Over the long-term, such an approach has the potential to yield, as occurred in Indonesia, genuine
    government ownership of the DPL program, and a robust foundation from which the DPL process can
    be continuously improved and refined.

•   Success lies in following up on the implementation details of the reform process, which is critical
    to the sustainable effectiveness of the reforms. Too often the implementation stage of a DPL
    sponsored reform is overlooked to focus on the next higher level reform—however, the Indonesia DPL
    specifically focused on numerous detailed implementation triggers to ground the reform, make it
    operational and transparent, and therefore successfully effective. As a result, having multiple prior
    actions has been an effective way for the Indonesia DPL to broaden its reform agenda, but more
    importantly, to make concrete steps forward in the reforms initiated and thereby make the reforms
    sustainable in the medium term.

•   Constant collaboration and dialogue between the GoI and the Bank was fundamental to its
    success. In this respect, the Bank’s heavy field presence enabled it to interact frequently with the
    government, not just on the DPL but in other related engagements that supported the DPL policy areas.
    This in turn afforded the Government the ability to appoint high level counterparts to ensure that the
    triggers would be met, as their mandate was not just narrowly focused on the DPL reform triggers but
    also in the broader engagement. As a result, the appointment and socialization of high-ranking
    motivated counterparts, greatly enabled pushing through the triggers and ensuring the loan could be
    delivered.

•   Mapping out a reform program would provide meaningful direction, substantive results, and less
    criticism over trigger selection. In the past DPLs, some reforms, such as the Treasury Single Account,
    had key reforms implemented annually that resulted in a substantial improvement in Government
    operation from DPL1 to DPL4. These “storybook? reforms are also more sustainable, as the reforms
    progressed and were deepened, and the parties involved remained engaged in the DPL reform process.



                                                                                                           73
ICR DPL 5-6:

•   Mapping out a reform program provides meaningful direction and substantive results down the
    road, but a degree of flexibility is still needed, especially to ensure sustained government
    ownership. Compared with the first, the second DPL series was more systematic in adopting a multi-
    year strategic frame for the program, and laying out a basic mapping of the reform program that more
    specifically describes the end goals. While the initial mapping out of a detailed strategy and a multi-year
    agenda under each of the various DPL reform aims allowed a more strategic consideration of what the
    most critical next reform steps might be, ensuring sustained Government commitment to furthering the
    various reform objectives was even more critical. Indeed, institutional and policy reforms are usually
    complicated and involve unpredictable undertakings. Such reforms often need to go through a trial and
    error process, where there may be the occasional dead-ends that require backtracking and finding an
    alternate route. Hence a degree of flexibility should be maintained, so that when the right opportunity
    presents itself, reforms that had otherwise been apparently slow can be supported and advanced more
    rapidly.

•   Continuous DPL dialogue strengthened the Government’s knowledge base, which in turn allowed
    more proactive and swift measures to be taken at a time of crisis. The continued policy dialogue
    under the DPL has strengthened the knowledge base and allowed the Government to move proactively
    and take precautionary measures at the time of crisis. Establishment of the FSSF, for instance, has
    formed the basis for the financial sector safety net and allowed the Government to swiftly address
    systemic risks in the financial system. The Government was also able to proceed quickly in requesting
    for the DDO-DPL, which eventually helped in restoring public confidence and advancing other policy
    reforms. Had the DPL been non-existent, the swift resolution of the financial systemic risks and quick
    delivery of the DDO-DPL at the time of crisis would not have been possible.

•   The reclassification of policy actions — into prior and benchmark actions — allowed a more
    prioritized and programmatic approach. While DPL 5 is very much a continuation of the first DPL
    series’ medium-term institutional efforts, the indicative DPL 5 triggers identified at the preparation of
    DPL 4 were reassessed, then reclassified into prior and benchmark actions that signify progress towards
    longer-term reforms. Indeed, some benchmark actions that may appear incremental at face value are
    actually steps that need to be taken before more substantive reforms can take place. Hence, the
    reclassification of actions allowed more priority and focus over the more critical, key prior actions,
    while still acknowledging the Government’s pace and scope of reform process. This not only helped in
    ensuring a sustained Government ownership, but also in mapping out a more comprehensive, multi-year
    strategic frame for the program.

•   DPLs are only one instrument among many that are available in a multi-faceted engagement, and
    the choice of instrument should be contingent on the issue, the political context and the
    institutional circumstances. The Bank program in Indonesia is one of the largest of any country in
    terms of number of staff and overall resources. Large teams are working closely on a daily basis with
    Government counterparts at often very senior levels on a wide range of issues from public financial
    management and trade and investment, finance, public expenditures and poverty. In this context, the
    DPL is not the only instrument for supporting reform, but rather complementary to other instruments
    such as investment projects, TA and AAA.

Annex 5: TECHNICAL ANNEX ON PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

I. Background and Analytical Underpinnings

The INSTANSI DPL operation sets out to provide general budget support to the Indonesian Government
and will be executed through the Government’s public financial management (PFM) systems. In order to
assess the attendant fiduciary risks with respect to the proceeds of this operation, this annex summarizes the
current state of these systems as well as ongoing reform efforts to further enhance them.

Performance of Indonesia’s public financial management systems was comprehensively measured in 2007,
when a PEFA assessment was conducted for the first time. Results of this assessment reflected a mixed
picture of strengths and weaknesses. Key strengths pertained to transparent and comprehensive budget
documentation, a well defined budget process with both executive and legislative adhering to the schedule, a
budget classification which complied with international standards and a strengthened external audit function.
The first PEFA also highlighted the sound regulatory framework that had been put in place for almost all
PFM areas, major reorganization had taken place at the Ministry of Finance, and advances had been made in
budget preparation, such as instituting a unified budget. Weaknesses, on the other hand, were identified
across dimensions of budget execution such as financial reporting, the high variation between budgets and
outturns, and internal controls.

The 2011 PEFA repeat assessment showed a marked improvement in budget controls and reporting (see the
summary in Annex 6). Notably, the 2009 external audit report was the first to achieve a ‘qualified’ audit
opinion, as opposed to a disclaimer, with around 40 percent of ministries and agencies (K/Ls) achieving an
‘unqualified opinion’. Furthermore, the Government has publicly set an ambitious target for achieving an
unqualified audit opinion for all K/Ls by 2014, with 77 percent achieving this for FY2011. The new
assessment also confirmed that substantive progress has been made, particularly in the area of budget
execution, with the development of a Treasury Single Account to strengthen the comprehensiveness and
control over spending and cash management (with support under previous DPLs). In addition, there have
been improvements in the coverage of fiscal accounts, accounting practices, payroll and internal controls
and fiscal risk management.

However, it is still early to measure improvements in some important areas, for example: the medium-term
expenditure framework and performance orientated budgeting have only recently been introduced and will
require considerable refinement over the next few years; there is an ongoing capacity building effort to
strengthen internal and external audit; the computerized GFMIS (SPAN) that will strengthen financial
management capabilities will be rolled out in 2013; despite the new procurement law and introduction of
eprocurement and new disclosure policies weaknesses remain that often cause lengthy delays; and accrual
accounting is due to be introduced in 2015. In addition, the assessment highlighted the ongoing problems of
the large variation in spending outturns, particularly for capital expenditure, which perhaps reflects the focus
on tightening expenditure controls and compliance at the expense of improving delivery and performance in
the short-term.

Many reforms therefore remain a ‘work in progress’. Nonetheless, both assessments acknowledge the
reform efforts of key stakeholders of the budget process, which have been ongoing since the political
transition in 1998 and especially following the MOF White Paper in 2001. The Government continues to
demonstrate its commitment to the reforms set out in this White Paper, although the timing and sequencing
is evolving around the main pillars of the budget system to reflect the variable capacity constraints and
changing political/policy and economic priorities. However the main objectives have remained the same,
these include: (i) improving the results-orientation in state budget planning and development; (ii)
modernizing budget and treasury management; (iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation of public
expenditures and programs; (iv) improving the public procurement systems; (v) improving Government
accounting and audit functions; and, last but not least, (vi) civil service reforms to improve the quality and


                                                                                                             75
performance of the workforce. This annex also includes reforms in the following areas: (vii) debt
management; (viii) regional public financial management; as well as (xi) governance and anti-corruption.

The commentaries below draw on recent economic and sector work undertaken by the World Bank and
other development partners. Besides the aforementioned PEFA, it takes into consideration the findings of a
joint Bank-Fund mission on Strengthening Budget Management undertaken in June 2008, the September
2008 update of the Fiscal Transparency ROSC (IMF Country Report No. 08/298, Selected Issues;
Indonesia). More recently, insights on latest reform progress were derived from the EC funded evaluation
the PFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund (PFM MDTF) in late 2010, the development of a Medium-Term Strategy
Note for the PFM MDTF and a Bank report on identifying the constraints to budget execution in the
infrastructure sector in 2012.

II. Reform Priorities: Achievements, Challenges & the Way Ahead

1. Improving Results-Orientation in State Budget Planning and Development

As indicated in the PEFA reports, substantial advances have already been made in Indonesia’s budget
preparation process since the passing of the Law on State Finances No. 17/ 2003. For example, the
introduction of a unified budget in 2005, which combined the previously separate recurrent and development
budgets, has had a significant impact on overall budget planning and transparency.

Generally, more work needs to be done to implement Performance Based Budgeting (PBB) and the
Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) in order to ensure that policy orientation and fiscal
sustainability become an integral part of the Indonesian State Budget, as prescribed by Law 17/ 2003.
Following the issuance of a joint MoF and Bappenas manual on PBB and MTEF in June 2009 and pilot
projects with six line ministries, a major breakthrough for PBB/MTEF implementation was the revision of
the program structure in the Government’s planning and budget documents that were conducted throughout
the second half of 2009. The new program structure aligns Government programs with organizational
structures and establishes much clearer lines of accountability for program performance. Along with the new
program structure, line ministries have also formulated targets and indicators, which provide a better basis
for evaluating the performance of programs and activities in the coming years, thus fulfilling a fundamental
prerequisite of PBB. The new programs, targets, and indicators were incorporated in the RPJMN for 2010-
14, and implemented in the FY2011 budget.

The 2011 budget was also the first year of implementing a detailed MTEF process. Ministries prepared
budget estimates for two years following the fiscal year (2012 and 2013) and incorporated them into the
budget documentation presented to Parliament in August (though Parliament will not be appropriating funds
beyond the fiscal year). MoF regulation No. 104/2010 concerning the completion of budget submission or
RKA-KL templates for 2011, contains detailed guidelines for preparing these forward estimates at the level
of components. The Government is aware that this is an exercise that will have to be refined going forward,
and, as described in the previous DPL indicators, new elements, such as the definition of the baseline and
new initiatives were incorporated in the 2012 budget process, ensuring better linkages between planning
(RKP) and budget documents (RKA-KL) and improving the use of the rolling financial estimates.

The Government also recognizes that PBB/MTEF implementation needs to be strengthened further. For the
near term (1 year) there is an ongoing need to improve the quality of program structures and performance
indicators and to fine-tune the existing MTEF and costing system. For the medium term (2-4 years) the
focus of budget reforms should gradually shift towards (i) developing a PBB-driven Monitoring and
Evaluation (M&E) system and related concepts, such as a concept of how performance information could
impact on budget allocations in the future, (ii) enhancing capacity to conduct a range of modern budget
analytical techniques in accordance with PBB and introducing the appropriate change management and
organizational arrangements, and (iii) strengthening the link between budget and bureaucracy reforms, in


                                                                                                         76
particular the link to performance management—the MoF has introduced strategic performance
management based on the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for all
Directorates in the Ministry. Some BSC indicators correspond with PBB indicators, and, while still at an
early stage, the link between PBB and performance management has the potential to provide stronger
managerial incentives for successful program implementation. A joint roadmap to address the above points
and to help plan and sequence budget and planning reforms going forward is currently being developed by
the MoF and Bappenas, with assistance from World Bank advisors.

In terms of legislative oversight, the Parliament’s (DPR) new role in shaping the state budget and in
overseeing budget processes was institutionalized in Law No. 27/2009. According to this law, two new
arrangements were implemented by DPR with regards to budget preparation and oversight procedures in
2009. Firstly, the former Budget Committee became the Budget Board (Badan Anggaran) and a permanent
entity of DPR responsible for the endorsement of the state budget. Secondly, the State or Public Finance
Accountability Board (Badan Akuntabilitas Keuangan Negara) was established as a permanent entity of
DPR to review audit results of state financial reports prepared by the State Audit Agency (BPK). Although
not mandated in the law, preliminary planning has started also for the establishment of a Parliamentary
Budget Office (PBO), which is intended to provide support for the implementation of the budget function of
Parliament through providing data, information, analysis and research needed by the members of Parliament
in their discussions of the annual state budget.

On top of these new institutional arrangements, the DPR needs to continue building: (i) independent support
and research capacity to support legislative budget review; (ii) general capacity development in budget
analysis and oversight including familiarity with PBB and MTEF; and (iii) follow-up of external audit
findings to ensure that the executive is held accountable for transparent and efficient budget execution.
Capacity building of the DPR is thus to remain an important pillar in the reform framework.

2. Improving Budget and Treasury Management

Though significant advances have been made on the budget preparation side, expenditure outturns continue
to deviate significantly from the budget (as highlighted in the PEFA update), and with severe bunching
toward the end of the year. This spending pattern is of concern because project implementation is disrupted
by an adverse cycle, and persistent under-spending on capital expenditure constrains much needed
infrastructure investments. Indonesia remains committed to smoothing budget implementation and execution
through modernization of the treasury system.

The Government Regulation (PP) on budget execution is the only remaining PP to be issued to underpin the
State Treasury Law of 2004 and the State Finance Law of 2003. Finalization and issuance of this new
regulation is currently expected in 2013 and is important because it would provide a firmer legal basis for
recent some lower level regulations that have been issued to help try to overcome spending problems (e.g.
Perpres #53/2010 which regulates on the appointment of Satker [spending unit] officials, Perpres #54/2010
that allows advanced procurement, or simplifying virement—i.e. with the White paper supported by this
DPL) as well as clarifying functions, roles and responsibilities of key officials. It would also provide a
firmer legal basis for using the new automated treasury and budget preparation system (Sistem
Perbendaharaan dan Anggaran Negara, or SPAN) and the new business process improvements envisaged
under SPAN as well as providing authority to the Ministry of Finance to consolidate and report on fiscal
data for the general Government.

SPAN is expected to be rolled out in 2013, having been conceived around 2004. It will replace the multitude
of financial data processing applications currently used by Government institutions. It is a cross-cutting
reform that should increase the timeliness, reliability and transparency of budget disbursement and reporting
as well as improve the capability of managers in the efficient management of public resources. Business
process improvements in the area of budget formulation, budget execution and accounting have recently


                                                                                                          77
been agreed with the business users. The change management and communication aspects related to the
implementation of SPAN are now in place to support implementation. The SPAN turnkey implementation
vendor is continuing to develop the COTS application software while the new Data Center and Data
Recovery Center have been completed.

Nonetheless, challenges for the SPAN implementation remain. These include development of business
processes for managing non-financial performance data, and the strengthening of PUSINTEK’s capability to
serve as a central ICT services provider for SPAN, as well as the rest of the MOF. The capacity building
needs for implementation activities under SPAN are also considerable, and continued advisory services to
help facilitate the implementation of PFM reforms in general, and SPAN in particular, will be necessary.
Also, there is a recognized priority for building the capacity on accounting standards, including migration to
accrual accounting (currently planned for 2015) and related requirements for training of staff, and audit.

Cash management has improved significantly with the continued implementation of the Treasury Single
Account (TSA), and since 2007 the TSA for expenditure management has been made operational in all MoF
Treasury offices. The TSA system was subsequently extended to cover revenue collection bank accounts,
which are now swept daily to the TSA. The MoF and Bank Indonesia have signed an agreement providing
for payment of interest on Government cash balances held in the TSA with Bank Indonesia. Interest is also
collected on cash balances held in petty cash bank accounts of spending units through a system of “pooled?
balances computed daily. However, the periodic census of Government bank accounts continues to report a
number of accounts still outside the coverage of the TSA and the Treasury is continuing to review and
incorporate most of these bank accounts into the TSA in a phased manner.

Cash flow forecasting has been rudimentary and the poor quality of cash forecasts is one of the factors
resulting in year-end bunching of expenditures. The accelerated draw down of Government cash balances in
December perpetuates wasteful procurement practices and also impacts monetary policy. To improve cash
planning in the spending units and improve cash forecasting data, the Treasury issued detailed regulations
on cash forecasting in November 2009 and rolled out a new IT application to assist spending units in
implementing the new regulations in 2010-2011. Training and socialization for all Satker in the
implementation of the new regulations and software is on-going.

A joint WB-IMF assessment of the GoI’s Asset and Liabilities Management (ALM) carried out in mid-2009
indicated that the uncoordinated management of the gross asset-liability portfolio of the Government and
Bank Indonesia could lead to substantial risk to the overall balance sheet. A follow up mission in late 2010
largely reiterated these conclusions and emphasized that the risks need to be mitigated through optimization
of borrowing and better reserve management. The MOF has recently reinvigorated its ALM reform program
with the support of the Australian Government and World Bank.

3. Strengthening Monitoring and Evaluation of Public Expenditures and Programs

To ensure more effective development planning and policy making, an improved capacity to analyze the
efficiency of public spending is essential. Several analytical pieces have been produced in the last few years,
and efforts by Bappenas and the MoF, especially through the trust fund supported IPEA initiative, to
improve the quality of public spending and the delivery of public services. One important aspect going
forward will be the development of a central monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system that would bring
together Government financial and nonfinancial performance information, and so provide a basic framework
and reference tool for more performance-oriented budget analysis and policy-making, in line with the
principles of PBB and MTEF reform. 13
13
   Such a system would not only be crucial for PBB and MTEF reform but would also assist the Ministry of State Apparatus Reform in evaluating the
performance and accountability of government institutions, the Special Working Unit for Delivery of the President (UKP4) by providing a
substantive context by which to evaluate achievement of short-term (bimonthly) physical program outputs, and, the individual line ministries in
efforts to improve their programs, activities, and self-assessment of internal monitoring and evaluation systems.



                                                                                                                                             78
Efforts to develop such an M&E system are already underway, and the objective is to have a fully
functioning M&E system in place for the next RPJMN (2015-19). This will require the establishment of
procedures to retrieve performance data and the design of reporting as well as ensuring that performance
data is measurable and of high-quality. Performance information was, as mentioned above, for the first time
developed by all ministries for their respective programs and activities in the form of outcome and output
indicators in 2009 and implemented with both the RPJMN 2010-14 and FY2011 budget. The quality of this
information is being further reviewed, and a yearly evaluation of the performance information provided by
line ministries should enhance their quality, incrementally over time. A final M&E manual for the line
ministries on how to formulate and report performance information is then, as aligned with the next RPJMN
schedule, envisaged for 2013.

4. Improving the Public Procurement System

The past few years have witnessed improvements in the public procurement environment. Keppres No.
80/2003 provided a national public procurement regulation that meets most of what is generally regarded as
accepted international practice, including basic principles: transparency, open competition, economy and
efficiency. Keppres No. 80/2003 also established the basis for sanctions, complaint-handling and
requirements for certification of users. It also abolished several weak practices such as mandatory
prequalification for all types of procurement and requirements that segregated the national market and
provided preferential treatment to local suppliers/contractors in each province/district. This decree also
paved the way for establishing a regulatory body for public procurement. Perpres No. 106/2007 was signed
in December 2007 establishing an independent agency, the Lembaga Kebijakan Pengadaan Barang/Jasa
Pemerintah (LKPP) or National Public Procurement Agency, that is responsible for sustainable, integrated,
focused and coordinated planning and development of strategies/policies/regulations associated with the
procurement of goods/works/services using public funds. This institution reports directly to the President. In
addition to the chairman, who heads LKPP, and an executive secretary, there are four departments, each
headed by a deputy with responsibilities for: (i) strategy and policy development; (ii) monitoring, evaluation
and information systems; (iii) human resources development; and (iv) legal affairs and settlement of
objections.

While Keppres No. 80/2003 was a welcome development for the country, the public procurement system
still has significant deficiencies in its regulatory and, more importantly, implementation aspects. There has
been slow progress in the development of procurement regulations anchored by a law; slow progress in the
development and use of standard tools in terms of bidding documents and users manuals; collusion and
corruption practices in the bidding process; and concerns over the efficiency of the compliant mechanisms
and sanction measures are still significant. However, the most significant deficiency is the absence of
professional procurement management and weakness in procurement capacity in implementing agencies,
especially at the provincial and district levels.

This is supported by the findings of some analytical tools and reports such as the self-diagnostic assessment
conducted by the Government in 2007 using the base-line indicators (BLIs) tool developed under the World
Bank and OECD Development Assistance Committee Procurement Round Table initiative. The assessment
of the BLIs presents a “snapshot? comparison of the actual system against the international standards or the
“model system? that the BLIs represent. Baseline bench marking of Indonesia’s procurement system in
June 2007 showed it scoring 62.5 percent for the Legislative and Regulatory Framework (PILLAR I), 55
percent for Institutional Framework and Management Capacity (PILLAR II), 59.3 percent for Procurement
Operations and Market Practices (PILLAR III) and 69 percent for Integrity and Transparency of the Public
Procurement System (PILLAR IV) in comparison with recognized international standards. While the
establishment of LKPP should increase the overall score for Pillar II, the assessment indicates that there are




                                                                                                           79
significant areas that need improvement. The LKPP is currently moving on two parallel tracks to reform the
public procurement system: (i) Legislative and Regulatory Framework; and (ii) Public Procurement
Function and Capacity Building.

Legislative and Regulatory Framework: Indonesia’s legal framework for public sector procurement can
best be strengthened by anchoring it with an overarching consolidated and comprehensive national public
sector procurement law at the highest level that: (i) establishes the fundamental principles and procedures
applicable to all public sector procurement; (ii) establishes clear responsibilities for a permanent
procurement management function within implementing agencies; and (iii) amends other laws that refer to
public sector procurement and ensures that such a law has the necessary authority in a decentralized
environment. To achieve that, LKPP has been working on the preparation of a new procurement law and a
new presidential decree. A draft procurement law has been the subject of a public consultation process,
which included Government agencies and international development partners. The draft law proposes a
broader scope for coverage which includes concessions and PPP transactions. It states some main principles
and proposes to further detail these through separate implementation decrees. The Bank has also provided
comments and recommendations on the draft, mainly concerning the need to ensure that all the main
principles that will govern public procurement in the country are clearly stated in the law. Given the need for
further consultations with various stakeholders in order to formulate the important issues more carefully, the
submission of the draft law is being delayed into 2012. Nevertheless, the current Presidential decree on
public procurement No. 54/2010 has been effective since January 2011, introducing many improvements,
the two major of which are the mandatory establishment of Procurement Service Units (ULPs) by 2014 and
the use of e-tendering by 2012. This will be applicable to all implementing agencies. PP 54/2010 was also
updated in 2012, in an effort to help smooth budget implementation.

To maximize the opportunity for reform when preparing a procurement law, it is important to take into
consideration that a number of laws have been enacted since 2000 that impact, or make reference to, public
procurement. These include construction law, state finance, treasury, audit and small-scale business. The
pace of Indonesia’s decentralization reforms has impacted public sector procurement at all levels of
Government, with ministers, governors, and even mayors able to issue decrees, regulations and instructions.
The plethora of regulations is often inconsistent and many regulations do not meet accepted international
practice. Consequently the need for national procurement policies and standards are critical.
Historically, there are no national standard bidding documents that are used regularly by all Government
agencies in the country. Some implementing agencies (such as the Ministry of Public Works) have
developed standard bidding documents for their own use. NPPO (the predecessor of LKPP) has drafted and
piloted seven National Model (Standard) Bidding Documents to cover main types of procurement. LKPP is
now updating these documents and producing other samples. The use of these documents is still not
mandatory and they are being used on a pilot basis. With the support of a trust fund from the MDTF-PFM,
LKPP is planning to review these documents to make them consistent with the new Perpres as well as to
increase harmonization with the standard bidding documents of International Development Partners such as
the World Bank, ADB and JICA.

Public Procurement Function and Capacity Building: There has been growing concerns, both by the
Government and the Development Partners over the pace of projects implementation. Significant delays and
slow disbursement seem to occur throughout the entire PFM cycle. Projects reported delays and difficulties
in budget preparation and approval, budget execution, and implementation/procurement. Specifically, there
are concerns with the organization of the procurement management function as well as the capacity of
procurement committee members. While Keppres No. 80/2003 required certification of all procurement
committee members, the certification process by itself did not support the development of procurement
capacity; while the current ad-hoc nature of managing procurement does not allow for building sustainable
knowledge within implementing agencies.




                                                                                                            80
The LKPP has completed a human resources development (HRD) strategy to professionalize and support the
public procurement sector by developing and facilitating a competency based capacity building process and
creation of professional and dedicated cadre. The strategy identified the following challenges which resonate
with concerns raised by stakeholders: (i) Overall low capacity among officials in handling public
procurement responsibilities, in compliance with Perpres 54 and other relevant procurement legislation
adopted and used by other public agencies; (ii) The large number of public entities that currently undertake
procurement operations, and the difficulties encountered in reaching, serving and supporting all of them;
(iii) Lack of consistency and uniformity in structures and approaches to public procurement activities; (iv)
The ad hoc and part-time nature of procurement assignments in the public service, which prevents any
career progression and retards the overall development of the field of public in procurement; (v) Lack of
geographic representation in the availability of trainers; (vi) Current procurement training is limited to
Perpres 54, and does not include training on the broad principles and practice of procurement, or on the
other procurement laws or guidelines that adopted in other Ministries and agencies; (vii) There is a wide
range of entities involved in procurement training, but they are not yet governed by a set of standards to
preserve quality and consistency in delivery; (viii) Lack of a rational, well considered and selective
approach to the identification of officials that are ready to undertake procurement training and take the
certification exams, resulting in a high failure rate; (ix) High cost of providing procurement training to
officials over longer periods, resulting in inadequate training period; (x) Lack of training and specialization
in procurement in higher education.

In response, the goals of LKPP HR strategy are the following:
Strategic Goal 1: Coordinated and integrated planning for Human Resource Development
Strategic Goal 2: Building professionalism in procurement
Strategic Goal 3: Developing adequate facilities for public procurement training
Strategic Goal 4: Developing effective training materials in public procurement
Strategic Goal 5: Build an effective national network of public procurement trainers
Strategic Goal 6: Ensure that public officials in procurement are properly certified
Strategic Goal 7: Undertake initiatives to be fully responsive in the services and support given to clients
Strategic Goal 8: Enhance the quality of training for officials in public procurement

These strategic objectives will generate lots of tasks that will require significant resources. LKPP has
already issued a decree to create procurement service units at all implementing agencies by 2014. It has also
started work on developing competency based training material. In summary, even though the full strategy
has not been officially and publicly adopted by LKPP, the completion of this strategy and acting on some of
its components is a move, albeit slow, in the right direction

In the meantime, there are several ongoing activities to improve procurement management in implementing
agencies. The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) in MoPW has established a procurement team to
support overall procurement in the DGH. MoF has already established a procurement function with an
Echelon II level manager which is a significant precedent in the country. At the Local Governments’ level,
there are some ongoing activities as around nine provincial governments and 130 Local
Government/municipalities has already established ULPs with varying role and function. Some of these
activities have been supported by the World Bank-funded Local Governments’ projects (ILGRIP and
USDRP) as well as other development partners.

So far, there are several initiatives on this area but progress is still slow. The absence of professional
procurement management in implementing agencies, fragmentation of procurement responsibility and weak
procurement capacity are the most important impediments to improving public procurement in the country.
LKPP should focus its resources on implementation of the human resources strategy that could tackle the
challenges in this area and support the development of training institutions in universities and private sector.
LKPP should also provide support and guidance to the ongoing pilot activities in establishing procurement
teams/units in MoF, DGH and Local Governments to ensure support and success of these pilots. Another


                                                                                                              81
important subject this human resources strategy should address is the approach to strengthen the capacity of
the Government auditing agencies to carry procurement audit.

Corruption, sanctions and independent appeals mechanism: Despite improvements in the public
procurement system, concerns remain over corrupt and collusive practices. While addressing this requires an
overall governance strategy (as addressed further below), there are several important elements in the
procurement system that can support such a strategy, for example an independent complaints mechanism, an
effective sanctions mechanism, and improving transparency in the procurement process through the use of e-
procurement.

Perpres 54/2010 requires the establishment of a complaints handling mechanism. However, this is not set
up independently but within each implementing agency. While it is imperative to develop procedures for an
independent complaints handling mechanism, LKPP should avoid becoming the agency to which these
complaints are addressed but rather develop a system and monitor its efficiency and reliability. The
sanctions mechanism is operated by each implementing agency, in accordance with Perpres 54/2010
requirements. There is no clarity on the effectiveness of this system, which warrants an assessment to be
conducted by LKPP on the effectiveness of the current sanctions mechanisms and possible improvements in
the implementation process.

E-procurement: The Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Communications and Information and the City
of Surabaya have all been at the forefront in the development of e-Government Procurement (e-GP)
technology. The LKPP is currently taking the lead on the implementation of e-GP in Indonesia at a national
and sub-national level. With the requirement for all procurement to be done electronically by 2012, there has
been rapid increase in the number of provinces and Local Governments using e-procurement. Most recent
data indicate that around 31 Provincial Governments and 380 Local Governments have introduced e-
procurement. However the volume of procurement carried through the system and up to which phase the
system is used (i.e bids announcement, bids distribution, bids submission etc…) also varies by location. As
for MoPW, their system seems to be a more comprehensive and centralized one. In 2011, it has handled
most of all planned procurement activities for 2011, with a total of 12,000 contracts and 30,000 registered
bidders. The increased use of e-procurement can be a good measure to increase transparency and efficiency
in the procurement process. However, it will also be critical for Government agencies to agree on a roadmap
for the development of e-GP in the country, setting the roles of the different stakeholders, and the
responsibility for ensuring minimum inter-operability and core data standards for the various e-GP providers
to comply with.

5. Improving Government Accounting and Audit Functions

Accounting and Reporting on Budget Execution

BPK has given a ‘qualified’ opinion on Government financial statements for 2011. This is the third
successive year that government annual financial statements have received a ‘qualified’ opinion after a
‘disclaimer’ status in the previous five years. The major qualifications in the audit report relate to mismatch
between budget classifications and the realizations, problems in assets management and under-recording of
pension funds. BPK also identified some key internal control weaknesses in the Government’s functioning.

There has also been an improvement in the number of line ministries (K/L) receiving favorable opinions
from the external auditors. The number of K/Ls with an unqualified opinion has increased from 7 out of 81
for FY2006, to 67 out of 87 in FY2011, with the number of K/Ls with disclaimers coming down.

Capacity constraints in the line ministries are the biggest challenge. The number of trained accountants in
line ministries and sub national governments is low, and the quality of their work needs improvement. DG
Treasury has a proposal to carry out a needs assessment of accountants in line ministries and also assess the


                                                                                                            82
pipeline of accountants that are coming out of universities to draw a blue print of how the accounting
capacity in the line ministries will be strengthened in the long term. Human resource issues remain the
most critical aspect of the accounting function in the country and MOF needs to pay close attention to
training and capacity building of accounting staff throughout the country.

The annual financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis and there is a plan to move to full accrual
accounting for line ministries and sub-national governments by 2015. Under the State Finance Law of 2003,
full accrual accounting had initially expected to be rolled out in 2009. However, given the implementation
challenges the Government and DPR subsequently agreed to a more gradual transition process, which has
been reflected in the annual budget law since 2008 and includes the revised 2015 target date in the
Government Regulation #71/2010. The accounting standards for accrual accounting have already been
prepared and a Government regulation on these has been issued. Draft accounting policies and chart of
accounts have been prepared and under review. The pilot implementation is expected to start in 2013.

Internal Controls and Internal Audit

Key reform priorities in the area of internal control and internal audit therefore are: (a) roll out of SPAN; (b)
implementation of the COSO control framework and (c) rationalization and strengthening of internal audit
function of the Government.

As mentioned already above, the SPAN turnkey provider has commenced work on configuring the COTS
application software and roll out is targeted for 2012. The new business processes being configured in
SPAN are expected to strengthen internal controls by introducing a formal commitment control system in
the line ministries, ensuring adherence to the budget ceilings, reducing the time lags in processing payments
and budget revisions, and maintaining electronic trails of all modifications to source data. However, the
limited capacity in the MoF and other line ministries, and ownership of the program by the business owner
are key challenges. To address this, the PFM team in the Bank is closely engaged in the process. In
addition, a communications and change management consultant is helping the MoF deal with human
resources challenges through the transition.

Through Government Regulation (PP) No. 60/2008, the Government has adopted COSO as its internal
control framework. The regulation embraces the core principles of the COSO framework in a
comprehensive manner but the key challenge lies in the implementation of the framework. The Government
regulation entrusts BPKP with the role of designing the internal control implementation, by providing
guidance and training to the line ministries on COSO implementation. BPKP has prepared an ambitious road
map for COSO implementation. In FY 2009 and 2010, PP 60/2008 has been socialized to 28 Ministries/
Government Institution, 87 vertical institutions and 345 Local Governments. Training has already been
conducted in 16 ministries and 105 Local Governments. Diagnostic assessment is also currently underway in
13 ministries and 50 Local Governments.

On internal audit, the quality of audit by Inspector Generals (IGs) in line ministries and in Local
Government inspectorates remains sub-optimal with little focus on risk-based audit. A recent mapping
process on the capacity of the government internal audit function in Indonesia based on the Internal Audit
Capability Model (IA-CM) developed by the IIA revealed that 93 percent (25 IGs and 237 Local
Government inspectorates) of the respondents (i) conducted transactional audits for accuracy and
compliance purposes only; (ii) audit plans were not prepared based on stakeholder priorities; and (iii) audit
output was based on the capacity of certain individuals

Lack of trained and skilled auditors and the scale of the country with Local Government inspectorate
auditors needed in over 500 locations makes the task of reforming the internal audit function in the country
challenging. It is important that a central agency assumes the role of coordination of internal audit function
in the country. Presidential instructions (INPRES 4) regulating Government internal audit systems as


                                                                                                              83
required by Article 58 of Government Regulation No. 60/ 2008 have been issued. The next step is
preparation of a strategy for internal audit expected in 2012. Meanwhile, some of the IGs in line ministries,
including the MoF and the MPW, have embarked on a significant modernization of their functions. The IGs
of both the MoF and the MPW have adopted a risk-based approach to internal audit and are engaged in a
review of technical skills of their staff and technical guidance available to them.

External Audit

After a peer review for BPK conducted by the Dutch Court of Auditors in 2009 pointed out that BPK had
made major strides in its mandate, capacity and practices in the last five years, BPK has continued to
maintain that momentum. There has been a significant growth in the budget, the number of staff and the
number of regional offices. 14 The report also identified some areas for improvement, mainly the need to
improve the readability of audit reports and the quality of analysis in the audit. However, the peer review
concluded that BPK was on the right track and had made major improvements in its functioning in the last
five years.

BPK has prepared a new strategic plan for the 2011-15. The new strategic plan reflects both lessons from
the peer review and the vision of the new BPK Board. BPK has also prepared a detailed implementation
plan to support the execution of the strategic plan.

BPK performs financial, performance, and special purpose audits. The audits are undertaken in accordance
with State Finance Auditing Standards (SPKN) which are stipulated in BPK regulation No.1/2007. SPKN
contains professional requirements for auditors, audit quality audit reports, and is binding on BPK and
institutions that conduct state finance audits for or on behalf of BPK. These standards are generally in line
with international standards and have been applied.

BPK has bilateral arrangements with many other SAIs that have helped BPK in procuring specialized skills
in many areas. Its arrangement with NAO Australia, for instance, has helped BPK in acquiring technical
skills in the area of performance audit. The Dutch and Norwegian SAIs are also actively supporting BPK.

BPK has been able to submit the audited financial statements within 5 months of the end of the fiscal year
for the past five years. BPK also submits interim audit reports to the Parliament every six months.

6. Civil Service Reform

In late 2006, the Ministry of Finance initiated the Bureaucracy Reform Initiative (BRI). Through this
initiative it has focused on reforming organizational structures and standard operating procedures (SOP),
and on reforming HRM policies and practices to adhere to the established reform objectives: (i) to create a
clean, professional and accountable state apparatus; and (ii) to create an efficient and effective bureaucracy
so as to provide high quality public services. Ministerial Decree No. 30/KMK.01/2007 outlines the reforms
in detail. A key element of the BRI has been to increase staff pay through an additional allowance, a budget
allocation for which is approved annually by Parliament.15

The BRI has led to many important outcomes in the MoF: professional quality of new staff has improved
and accountability is better enforced including strengthened work discipline; corruption has decreased in
14
  The number of BPK staff has risen from 2,854 in 2004 to 5,556 in 2009. The annual budget for FY10 is Rp 2.02 trillion compared with Rp 234
billion in 2004.
15
  Note: The BRI was deemed so crucial that when approving the extra allocation for the first time in 2006, the Parliament decided to expand the BRI
to the State Audit Institution (BPK) and the Supreme Court on a pilot basis. In 2007, the National committee for Bureaucracy Reform was set up to
coordinate reforms among institutions and provisions were included in Law No. 17/2007 on Long and Mid-Term Planning mandating all 73 central
government institutions to implement BRI before the end of 2011 in support of which MenPAN has issued regulations and voluminous guidelines
related to the reform process.




                                                                                                                                               84
spite of backlashes within DG Customs and within DG Tax; performance of staff has improved and key
performance indicators have been introduced at the level of Echelon 1 units including signed performance
contracts for the responsible managers; and service delivery has been simplified and speeded up within
DG’s with client relations. Below are some of the most important achievements:
• Some 8,000 SOPs have been revised to improve efficiency and to minimize direct non-transparent
    interaction between MoF officials and members of the public.
• Almost 20,000 job descriptions have been revised to better reflect professional requirements, job
    responsibilities and complexities.
• A new grading scheme has been introduced on top of the general grading scheme (17 grades) linked to
    the reformed job descriptions and allocating positions to one of 27 additional grades.
• A new allowance, linked to the new additional grades, has increased take-home pay for MoF officials
    considerably.
• Performance based management has been introduced and KPIs have been defined to the level of echelon
    1 while the cascading down to lower levels is still ongoing.
• Recruitment criteria and processes have been significantly improved and today the MoF only recruits
    PNS candidates that have gone through STAN.
• An Assessment Centre has been created and a large network of assessors established.
• A selection process for promotion based on internally announced vacancies, voluntary applications and
    competitive selection based on merit has been piloted.
• Competency based training is more and more replacing structural training.
• Improved Human Resources Information System (HRIS) is under development.
• Permanent Project Management Units have been established in DG Tax and in DG Treasury.

In April 2009, the Minister of Finance announced the second chapter of BR, with the human capital
development and information system for human resources as key priorities. In connection with previous
reforms, other issues also materialized and more areas were identified as targets for reforms for the second
chapter, such as an inherent redundancy created by overstaffing and low quality of some staff.

More broadly, the Government has commenced the process of implementing an agency by agency reform,
guided by an overarching policy framework set out in a Grand Design for Bureaucracy Reform (BR)for
2010–2025 along with a Road Map for 2010–2014 that were eventually approved in December 2010. The
management structure and processes governing the reform consist of a multi-layered inter-ministerial
management structure under the Vice President’s office. It includes a Steering Committee, the National BR
Team (NBRT), the National BR Management Unit (NBRMU), a quality control entity (QA Team) and an
advisory entity (Independent Team).

Reform proposals of ministries and agencies (K/Ls) are vetted in this system through a complex process.
The format and substance of proposals should reflect the orientation set out in the 9 guidance ‘books’,
approved in January 2011, that provide implementation guidelines for bureaucracy reform and summarize
critical aspects of the reform. As of mid-2012 some 52 (K/Ls), including the MoF have been approved and
have obtained Performance Allowances. This removes the ‘exceptional’ nature of these reforms in the MoF,
which required annual re-approval by the DPR. The goal is still to have all 76 Central Government
institutions implementing BR by 2014. In addition, the Government has decided to extend the BR roll-out to
9 provinces and 99 Local Governments as a pilot project to precede a final roll-out to all government entities
at all three levels of Government (in total there are 33 provinces and 491 cities/districts).

However, while this process has formalized the substantive requirements of K/Ls for participating in the
reform program, it has two overall weaknesses. First, it does not provide a sufficient basis for a ‘reward and
punishment’ model that would ensure the transformation of agencies. Second, it does not address the
systemic regulatory constraints that handicap reform-minded agencies from achieving their objectives.




                                                                                                           85
Nonetheless, the Government is working on these constraints, and a new civil service law has been proposed
by the DPR.

It is important to continue the reform process within the MoF. In line with existing policies and plans, and
building on the progress achieved so far, the MoF is pursuing the second chapter of reforms, which includes
inter alia:
• Strengthening the corporate values to support enhanced professionalism, integrity and accountability;
• Continuing the professionalization of jobs and the competence based training policy;
• Professionalizing HR functions and providing opportunities for professional certification for HR staff
     (for example staff in DG Taxes HR department achieved high-levels of HR certification in 2010);
• Strengthening professional career paths and reform rotation practices to support professionalization,
     capacity building and career management;
• Working towards an open recruitment policy which would strengthen professionalization and allow a
     greater professional mobility;
• Pursuing the development of talent management system to identify and prepare future leaders;
• Decentralizing HRM activities to levels where they would be most efficiently executed including
     necessary supporting restructuring;
• Improving the new grading system and reform the allowance distribution;
• Finalize the HRIS in combination with separate HRIS in the big DGs (DG Tax is due to start its
     development in 2011); and
• Prepare policies and proposals for right-sizing allowing more radical restructuring policies.

7. Debt Management

In recent years, two major initiatives in debt management have been implemented: A clear debt management
strategy, which was publicly announced and a newly created DG for Debt Management, with a risk
management oversight function for both domestic and external debts. A new debt strategy for 2010-14 was
published in 2010 16. By end-2011, the Government debt-to-GDP ratio had declined to below 25 percent
from the peak of over 90 percent in 1999, with only a minimal increase through the exchange rate volatility
and stimulus spending associated with the global financial crisis.

Great advances have been made since 2009 in the quality of the Government’s domestic and external debt
reporting, with the MoF and Bank Indonesia now issuing a joint publication, inconsistencies between
official Indonesian and external sources being reconciled, and the World Bank reviewing with a view to
upgrading its rating of the quality of Indonesian official Government and external debt statistics. The Fiscal
Risk Statement is comprehensive and incorporated in the annual budget documents. The statement considers
financial liabilities, contingent liabilities and potential risks from a range of external and internal factors.

8. Reforming Regional Public Financial Management

Decentralization has provided Sub-national Governments with significant resources and responsibilities.
More than one-third of overall public spending is now executed by Sub-national Governments. This level of
expenditure requires an adequate regulatory framework, together with sufficient PFM capacity at the sub-
national level if it is to be fully effective. In order to address this, in 2005 the Central Government passed
comprehensive legislation on PFM reforms at the sub-national level, with the aim of mirroring reforms
already being implemented at the center. However, the results have been limited due to lack of technical and
human resources that most regions have to implement the reforms. For example, Sub-national Governments
are obliged by law to report certain fiscal and financial information to the Central Government within a clear
16
     See: www.dmo.or.id




                                                                                                             86
timeframe. In reality, many Sub-national Governments struggle to meet their deadlines for submission even
though the number of such submissions has been decreasing.

Current budget allocation and disbursement practices contribute to fiscal discipline at the central level but
they constrain successful financial management at the local level. Allocations to individual sub-national
government units are formally issued after the passage of the Central Government budget in October prior to
the fiscal year in question and commence through derivative regulations (e.g., ministerial decrees). While
this may appear to allow sufficient time for sub-national governments to finalize their budgets, in reality
budget allocations of shared non-tax revenue (oil and gas) are frequently issued close to the beginning, or
first few months, of the fiscal year. The notional allocations are frequently underestimated by the Central
Government and disbursements from the center to the regions are back-loaded towards the end of the fiscal
year. This is because the transfers in the final quarter are based on actual revenues, which are usually higher
than projected revenues.

Sub-national Governments are struggling to spend their increasing budgets and have built up reserves in
recent years for three main reasons. First, Sub-national Governments often underestimate their revenues due
to lack of revenue-management capacity, compounded by the under-budgeting of transfers by the central
Government. Second, the issuance of budget allocations (especially allocation for shared non-tax revenue),
combined with Sub-national Government’s lack of revenue-management capacity, in particular in estimating
potential own source revenue (PAD), often resulted in low quality planning where budget projections are
based on previous year allocation. Hence, in many cases, there are significant revisions in the regional
budget adjustment (APBD Perubahan). Third, delays in the budget approval process and lack of
implementation capacity result in under-spending of budgeted programs by Sub-national Governments.
Fourth, Sub-national Governments may not have the capacity to spend the resources at their disposal when
these resources increase significantly and abruptly. This was the case with the 64 percent increase in DAU
from 2005 to 2006, which led to a significant increase in sub-national government reserves.

Some challenges in addressing the constraints in PFM at the sub-national level include: (i) providing timely
estimates from the sectoral ministries of revenue-sharing transfers; (ii) building the capacity of Sub-national
Governments to better estimate their fiscal resources and manage accumulated reserves; and (iii) improving
and streamlining the budget approval process. The need to streamline the budget approval process in
particular affects Law No. 33/2004, which stipulates that provincial and district budgets must be approved
by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Provincial Government, respectively. This process may be one
factor contributing towards lengthening the budget approval process.

In order to address the financial management issues and challenges at the sub-national level, the Central
Government has implemented several reforms:

Burden-sharing policy

Introduced in 2009, this policy incorporates major subsidies, including fuel subsidies, into the DAU pool
allocation. The policy will increase the accuracy of transfer projections during the full fiscal year, given that
there is a disincentive for the Central Government to under-estimate the oil price assumption, especially in
relation to regional transfers. A more rational oil price assumption will lead to better estimates of revenue-
sharing which, in turn, will help Sub-national Governments to better plan their budgets.

Two actions are needed to optimize this policy. First, the Central Government should establish a system to
regularly monitor quarterly revenue-sharing transfers, as stipulated in Law No. 33/2004. Second, the Central
Government, through the relevant agencies, needs to improve production estimates for revenue-sharing,
especially if back-loaded transfers at the end of the fiscal year persist.

Late budget approval sanctions


                                                                                                              87
Starting from 2008, the Government has applied sanctions to improve the budget approval process. Based on
Government Regulation (PP) No. 56/2005 and MoF Decree No. 46/2006 regarding the Regional Financial
Information System, provincial and district governments have to submit their annual budgets to the MoF
before 31 January of the corresponding fiscal year. Sub-national Governments that miss the deadline by at
least one month will receive a warning letter to submit their budget before 31 March. If a sub-national
government has not submitted its budget by that date, the MoF, in coordination with the MoHA, can
sanction the Sub-national Government by postponing the transfer of its DAU (25 percent of monthly
transfers) until the budget is submitted.

This sanction initiative has resulted in timelier budget submissions. Between 2006 and 2007, 54 percent of
Sub-national Governments approved their budgets after March. In 2008, the year the sanction was
introduced, 87 percent of Sub-national Governments submitted their budgets to the MoF before March. If
the Government wishes to ensure the effectiveness of this reform, the MoF should continue to monitor Sub-
national Government budget submissions.

The MoF can also assist Sub-national Governments in managing reserves and surpluses by strengthening the
regulatory framework for sub-national financial management. In doing so, the MoF should develop
guidelines for regions on the accumulation and use of reserves. These guidelines should help Sub-national
Governments use their reserves more effectively, for example, by: (i) settling outstanding arrears, given that
about 85 percent of Sub-national Governments in arrears could clear these arrears by drawing on reserves;
and (ii) where Sub-national Governments have constant or increasingly high levels of reserves, using them
to increase investment in public infrastructure.

9. Governance and Anti-Corruption

The public has expressed a strong demand for more accountable government, as indicated in the re-election
of the incumbent Government for its strong anti-corruption platform. Shortly following the reelection, the
President responded by creating a special unit called UKP4 (Presidential Working Unit for Supervision and
Management of Development), chaired by the highly respected Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, to reduce
bottlenecks — including governance related issues — in management and development and to expedite
delivery of government programs. Among its priorities is the acceleration of civil service and tax reforms,
and processes are already underway to deliver on this mandate. The Law on Access to Public Information is
passed and declared effective, and the public is hopeful that the provisions of the law will bring about more
transparent and accountable services.

Under the new Corruption Court law, the Special Anti Corruption Court is now created in seven provinces
under the auspices of the Supreme Court, with the plan to replicate it in all provinces and then districts. This
is taking place despite a 2006 Constitutional Court ruling, according to which the Special Court —
previously trying cases investigated and prosecuted by the Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK) — was
considered unconstitutional since it was seen as creating a dual criminal justice process for corruption cases.
The Special Court has thereby maintained its original composition — with ad hoc judges in the judicial
panels - and will try all corruption cases prosecuted by public prosecutors or from the KPK. This however,
raises a different concern: The Supreme Court has to recruit and train highly qualified ad hoc judges
designated in the 7 locations, and there is a fear that the lack of quality in resources may affect the
credibility of the Special Court. The main challenge at the regional level will be to staff these special courts
with qualified staff. A dubious and until now very rare acquittal in a trial conducted by the KPK in the
Bandung regional Special Anti-Corruption Court highlights the weakness of such regional courts.
Previously, the KPK always prosecuted its cases through the Corrupt Crimes Court in Jakarta, which
established a reputation for integrity since it was first established in 2004. However, the 2009 Corrupt
Crimes Court Law provided for the expansion of the specialized court to several provinces and these courts
became operational in 2010. These regional courts have issued numerous acquittals so far.


                                                                                                             88
In terms of corruption investigation, the pace had been slow. Previous high profile cases of corruption
highlighted the challenges in reforming the judicial and law-enforcement systems in Indonesia. These
included allegations of corruption affecting political parties, investigators conspiring with a corrupt tax
auditor, senior police and Attorney General Office (AGO) personnel fabricating evidence against two Anti-
Corruption Commission (KPK) deputy-chairs, and police officials conducting suspicious financial
transactions. Although progress towards the resolution of these cases remains slow, substantial efforts are
being made through targeted engagements at the national level (e.g. through the Attorney General's Office,
the Judicial Commission, the Anti-Corruption Courts and the Anti-Corruption Commission) and at the local
grassroots level.

The selection process for four KPK Commissioners has been completed, with some promising figures
known for personal integrity and anti corruption activism advancing to the final stage of selection by the
parliament. The KPK has declared its commitment to continue prosecuting high level cases and support
reform in key ministries and agencies.

The Constitutional Court, on the other hand, has demonstrated its strong role in resolving political disputes
— which is critical particularly in the disputes laden with money politics at the time of local elections. There
is a strong public expectation that the rulings may reduce the practice of election rigging in local elections.

Last but not least, institutional reform increases its outreach and intensity. Taxation office reform is in place,
following the prosecution and investigation of a number of tax officers, and some ministries (such as
Ministry of National Education and Ministry of Public Works) are developing ways of improving
institutional accountability. Local Governments have made their own initiatives and set examples for good
governance practices.

As the Government has demonstrated its commitment to fight against corruption and to promote reform, the
success of its strategy depends on a combination of both strong enforcement and rigorous institutional
reform. With the creation of a high profile Presidential unit and task force, serious efforts have to be made to
ensure that reforms are sustainable beyond the terms of the ad hoc unit and task force and that
recommendations made by the two are effectively applied.

III. Key Areas for Future Attention

In sum, for the period ahead, the following will be key areas for attention and monitoring for Indonesian
PFM:
• Maintaining the coherence and momentum in PFM reforms;
• Deepening the reforms of the Central Government budgetary systems to strengthen policy orientation
    and medium term planning in budget preparation with a particular focus on improving the quality of
    performance data, fine-tuning the existing MTEF and costing system and developing a PBB/MTEF
    based M&E system;
• Ensuring greater integrity and more effective management of public funds through further extension and
    fine-tuning of the TSA, increasing the quality of cash management, and strengthening PUSINTEK as
    the shared IT services provider;
• Enhancing the Government’s budget analysis capacity, primarily by developing a consolidated M&E
    system that integrates financial and non-financial data in accordance with PBB principles and
    streamlines and consolidates information of the complex M&E environment;
• Improving the public procurement system by developing a consistent legal framework through
    anchoring it in an overarching and consolidated national procurement law that regulates all principles
    and responsibilities in public procurement, by building the procurement management function as well as
    the capacity of procurement committee members based on a comprehensive human resources



                                                                                                               89
    development strategy, and by improving transparency in the procurement process, for example, through
    the development of a national e-procurement system;
•   Ensuring relevant and reliable financial reporting by strengthening human resources in Government
    accounting and reporting, especially at the line ministry level and especially with regards to accrual
    accounting;
•   Strengthening the internal audit function in the country by rolling out the treasury payment system as
    planned, implementing the COSO framework, conducting capacity building for Government
    inspectorate auditors, especially with a view to risk-based audit, and identifying an agency to assume
    coordination of the internal audit function;
•   Detailing and implementing BPK’s strategic plan 2011-1015 for improving the quality of external audit
    reports;
•   Continuing civil service reform in the MoF in the context of the second chapter of the national
    bureaucracy reform initiative;
•   Implementing the new debt management strategy and maintaining the quality of debt reporting
•   Addressing constraints in PFM at the sub-national level by (i) providing timely estimates from the
    sectoral ministries of revenue-sharing transfers; (ii) building the capacity of sub-national governments to
    better estimate their fiscal resources and manage accumulated reserves; and (iii) improving and
    streamlining the budget approval process;
•   Developing a coherent and well-focused strategy for corruption prevention within the state
    administration and ensuring its sustainability beyond the terms of the ad hoc task force.

All these reforms are being actively considered by the Government, and, as indicated further above,
implementation plans are either being developed by the Government or implementation is already
underway. The capacity to centrally monitor these and other reforms has already been established at the
Secretary-General’s office of the MoF (PUSHAKA). However, Indonesia would benefit from a coherent
reform plan or strategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination of PFM reforms. This would also allow
for enhanced monitoring and accountability within the Government and thus provide additional momentum
and direction to reform efforts. As an interim step, the PFM MDTF Medium Term Strategy Note (MTSN),
was presented by the Minister of Finance to senior management and all donors working in this area (not just
contributing donors) at the 2012 Policy Advisory Committee.

Management of Foreign Exchange

The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The country is no longer
subject to the Extended Arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia (BI) was last subject to the transitional
procedures under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy in 2002. That assessment recommended
remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in the audit arrangements of BI. The main
recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment of an independent audit committee at
Bank Indonesia and the publication of Bank Indonesia’s audited financial statements. Audited financial
statements for Bank Indonesia for 2009 by BPK contain an unqualified opinion.

IV. Summary

In recent years, Indonesia has made significant strides in the way its public finances are managed and in
increasing transparency and independent oversight. In almost all areas of PFM, changes in the legal and
regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum has shifted towards implementation of
new PFM practices. Advances have been made in budget preparation with the introduction of MTEF and
PBB, government accounting standards have been formally established and are being adhered to in several
respects to produce comprehensive annual financial statements, and the external audit function has made
significant progress in the last few years. However, internal controls in the execution of budget by spending
agencies need improvement. A Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) to



                                                                                                            90
provide information for budget management at all levels of government is expected to be rolled out in 2013,
while weak controls in budget execution processes have the potential of jeopardizing gains from reforms
introduced in other areas of PFM.

However, weaknesses in financial management and accountability continue to be gradually addressed
through the PFM reform program discussed above, and development partners are actively engaged in this
process. Much remains to be done, and it will take time to realize the full impact of these reforms. But the
trajectory of reform is in the right direction, and, most importantly, the Government continues to
demonstrate high commitment in completing the planned reforms. The reforms when implemented will
further reduce the level of fiduciary risks. Taking this into consideration, the Bank assessment team does not
propose putting in place any additional fiduciary arrangements for this operation.

Annex 6: ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL REVIEW

A broader overview of Indonesia's environmental and social issues is updated annually for the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), which can be
found at http://connectprem.worldbank.org/units/EASPR/cpia/web/CPIA%20Countries%20-%20EAP%20-%20Indonesia.aspx

                                                   OP 8.60 Assessment of Proposed Program Policy Matrix
    2. OP 8.60 (Development Policy Lending) mandates the Bank to determine whether policies supported by the operation are likely to have significant
negative environmental and social effects. For policies with likely significant effects, the Bank summarizes analytic knowledge of these effects and of the
borrower’s systems for reducing adverse effects and enhancing positive effects, also describing how any significant gaps would be addressed before or during
program implementation. In conducting this review, the team consulted Bank guidance on analysis of “likelihood of significant effects,? relying on the (i) Good
Practice Note: Using Poverty and Social Impact Analysis to Support Development Policy Operations; (ii) Assessing the Environmental, Forest, and Other Natural
Resource Aspects of Development Policy Lending – A World Bank Toolkit (2008), (iii) Good Practice Note on Environmental and Natural Resource Aspects of
Development Policy Lending.

In Policy area 1: Strengthening budget formulation and M&E systems should have no likely significant negative effects. Improved budget transparency, forward
planning and monitoring and evaluation should improve effectiveness of spending on development programs to benefit society. Strengthening budget execution
systems should have no likely significant negative effects. Improved budgeting systems, guidelines, auditing, software and training should improve effectiveness
and accountability of spending on development programs to benefit society. Improving tax administration should have no likely significant negative effects.
Improving capacity, modernizing, clarifying information and tax collection rules should increase tax compliance, reduce leakage, and aid law enforcement efforts –
all contributing to improving the rule of law and the perception of fairness in tax payment.

In Policy area 2, enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery efforts by improving poverty measurements and targeting and improving household- targeted
poverty reduction programs should have no likely significant negative effects and probable positive effects through improved targeting of pro poor programs toward
intended beneficiaries. Improving monitoring and grievance handling will improve accountability and responsiveness to intended beneficiaries of government pro
poor programs. No likely significant negative effects are expected from finalizing the plan for the future of the national community empowerment program.
Introducing standards for improving management and responsiveness to beneficiaries, particularly in areas that have experienced major complaints, would send a
positive message about governance and create an incentive for improved performance.

Annex 7: Summary of 2011 PEFA Update

 A repeat assessment of the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) was conducted in
 2011, following a first assessment in 2007. The results showed that Indonesia has made steady progress
 in strengthening the quality of its Public Financial Management (PFM) systems and processes. The
 chart below compares the average PEFA ratings for each of the six main categories of the budget cycle.
 Improvements made in four of the six categories, namely: the comprehensiveness and transparency of
 the budget, policy based budgeting, predictability and control in budget execution, and in accounting,
 recording and reporting.

Summary Comparison of PEFA Ratings: 2007 and 2011




Note: The Chart shows the simple average of the PEFA ratings in each category, with a maximum rating of 4 for an
 ‘A’ and 1 for a ‘D’ and half a point is given for a ‘+’.

Credibility of the Budget
 The assessment in 2011 considers the budget outturns, relative to the budget, for 2007-09, which
 includes the global financial crisis. The crisis increased uncertainty over international commodity prices
 and many governments, including Indonesia, undertook emergency fiscal stimulus measures in 2008.
 These features made fiscal planning even more difficult than normal. However, while the credibility of
 aggregate budget outturns seems to have increased, the composition of spending, relative to the budget,
 has deteriorated as many ministries and agencies (K/Ls) have consistently under spent their budgets
 (even during the stimulus period) while subsidy payments have been volatile as domestic prices have
 been slow to adjust to changes in international prices.

Comprehensiveness and Transparency of the Budget
 The comprehensiveness and transparency of the budget system has generally improved since 2007.
 Changes in management of the Government Treasury, such as establishing a Treasury Single Account,
 the disclosure (and closure) of many off-budget ministry bank accounts and the incorporation of the
 regional development and investment accounts into financial reports and budget documents have
 contributed to increased transparency and a reduction in unreported government operations. The public



                                                                                                             96
 access to budget information has also improved while there has been a steady improvement in the
 coverage and scope of the annual fiscal risk statement, which was first included in the 2008 budget.

(a) Policy Based Budgeting

 Indonesia is only just starting to introduce a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and a move
 towards performance based budgeting (PBB). In 2009, a revision was made to the program structure.
 The new program structure aligns programs with organizational structures and establishes much clearer
 lines of accountability for performance. The new structure have been incorporated in the five year
 national plan (RPJM) for 2010-14, and first implemented in the 2011 budget. The 2011 budget was also
 the first year of implementing a detailed MTEF process, which ministries prepared budget estimates for
 two years following the fiscal year (2012 and 2013).
(b) Predictability and Control in Budget Execution

 There has been little improvement in the indicators for revenue administration, despite ongoing reform
 efforts, and significant challenges remain. A rapid increase in the number of registered taxpayers has
 taken place over the last few years, although weaknesses in the assessment and enforcement processes
 undermine compliance rates, which significantly reduce revenues, and tax arrears remain relatively
 high.
 There have been some significant improvements in budget execution control processes. Improvements
 have been made in the recoding of cash balances and debt, particularly as the Treasury Single Account
 and cash forecasting have continued to be strengthened. New IT systems and procedures have
 strengthened the management of personnel and payroll information at the MDA and regional treasury
 (KPPN) level, although weaknesses remain in reconciling the information at the center and with
 procedures at the SNG level. However, in practice budget execution continues to be plagued by delays
 due to cumbersome and rigid procedures and lengthy procurement processes. Expenditure on goods and
 services and capital expenditures tends to be heavily skewed towards the end of the fiscal year with
 capital expenditure allocations frequently under-spent.
 The Government has adopted COSO as its control framework. This has clarified the roles and
 responsibilities on internal audit. However, the quality of audit by Inspector Generals (IGs) in line
 ministries and in local government remains sub-optimal, with little focus on risk-based audit, even
 though some of the IGs in line ministries, including the MoF and the MPW, have embarked on a
 significant modernization of their functions.
 The external auditor, BPK, has given a ‘qualified’ opinion on government financial statements since
 2009, after a ‘disclaimer’ status in the previous five years. The major qualifications in the audit report
 relate to mismatches between budget classifications and the realizations, problems in assets
 management and under-recording of pension funds. BPK also identified some key internal control
 weaknesses. The number of line ministries with a clean opinion has also increased, from 16 in 2007 to
 34 in 2008 to 53 in 2010. The number of ministries with disclaimers has come down from 33 in 2007 to
 18 in 2008 to 2 in 2010.
(c) Accounting, Recording and Reporting

 The annual financial statements are prepared on an accrual basis and there is a plan to move to full
 accrual accounting for line ministries and sub-national governments by 2015. The accounting standards
 for accrual accounting have already been prepared and a Government regulation on these has recently
 been issued. Draft accounting policies and chart of accounts have been prepared and under review. The
 pilot implementation is expected to start in 2013.




                                                                                                         97
(d) External Scrutiny and Audit

 Parliament (DPR) is developing new roles to help shape and oversee the state budget, though these
 remain largely work in progress. Two new arrangements were implemented by the DPR in 2009.
 Firstly, the former Budget Committee became the Budget Board (Badan Anggaran) and a permanent
 entity responsible for the endorsement of the state budget. Secondly, the State or Public Finance
 Accountability Board (Badan Akuntabilitas Keuangan Negara) was established as a permanent entity to
 review audit reports prepared by the State Audit Agency (BPK).
 A peer review for BPK conducted by the Dutch Court of Auditors in 2009 pointed out that BPK had
 made major strides in its mandate, capacity and practices in the last five years. There has been a
 significant growth in the budget, the number of staff and the number of regional offices. The report also
 identified some areas for improvement, mainly the need to improve the readability of audit reports and
 the quality of analysis in the audit.
 (e) Strategic Allocation of Resources

 Though significant advances have been made on the budget preparation side, in-year expenditures
 continue to deviate from plan. The development of a fully operational MTEF and PBB, with well
 articulated medium term fiscal targets and detailed indicative revenue and expenditure figures at the
 MDA and program level, should help to bolster aggregate fiscal discipline, expenditure prioritization
 and the efficiency of spending—the lack of medium-term certainty seems to be one of the factors that
 reduces the ability of MDAs to enter into multi-year commitments and contracts and hinders much
 needed capital spending.
(f) Efficient Service Delivery

 The limited flexibility to manage and adjust resources during the year may compromise efficient
 service delivery by limiting the ability to respond to changing needs or to adapt to improve program
 performance. While this may be have been an appropriate response in the aftermath of the 1998 crisis
 where weak governance systems contributed to the loss of control, the result is at times excessive risk
 aversion and under-spending. However it should also be noted that much service delivery, for example
 in education and health, is now primarily the responsibility of SNGs, rather than central government,
 and introducing improved controls and accountability while also promoting greater performance
 orientation at this level is likely to be a long-term challenge.
 Nontheless, the move to enhance the performance of the public sector, through PBB and performance
 management, is becoming a priority within Government. As robust expenditure controls and
 compliance mechanisms are being established and then strengthened, the Government’s focus is
 increasingly turning toward improving the delivery of public services and infrastructure to support
 development. This includes both the setting and monitoring of high level objectives as well as
 mechanisms of downward accountability, such as performance reports for MDAs along with greater
 flexibility in managing their programs.
Prospects for Reform Planning and Implementation
 In recent years, Indonesia has made significant strides in the way its public finances are managed and in
 increasing transparency and independent oversight. In almost all areas of the PFM cycle, changes in the
 legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum has shifted towards
 implementation of new PFM practices that strengthen controls while also moving toward a more
 performance and quality orientated system for service delivery.

Annex 9: Debt Sustainability Analysis

Indonesia’s government debt as a share of GDP has fallen steadily over the past decade,
including through the recent global financial crisis. Indeed, Indonesia was the only G20
economy to record a falling debt to GDP ratio between 2008 and the end of 2009, due to its
modest deficits (with an expansion of the deficit to only 1.6 percent of GDP in 2009) and
ongoing growth (especially in nominal terms). This represents a continuation of the trends of the
past decade during which the combination of fiscal conservatism and GDP growth well above,
often negative, ex post real interest rates has contributed to a decline in public debt from around
90 percent in 2000 to below 25 percent. These trends are expected to continue over the medium-
term. In 2012, even with the projected expansion of the deficit, mainly due to higher fiscal
spending on fuel subsidies, the debt to GDP is projected to continue to fall given strong nominal
growth projections.

Baseline projections suggest Indonesia’s debt to GDP ratios should continue falling over
the coming half-decade. The projected fall in the debt to GDP ratio can vary with those
projected by other multilateral agencies, depending in particular on the projected growth in
Indonesia’s GDP deflator which is used. The baseline projection in the table below is based on
the assumption that the GDP deflator will continue to grow faster than CPI inflation, although
the difference between the two growth rates will converge gradually. The assumed continued
stability of the nominal rupiah/USD exchange rate over the medium-term is also supportive of
debt dynamics going forward. The budget deficit is assumed to widen in 2012 before declining,
in line with the near-term projections set out in the Government’s 2013 proposed Budget. It is
then assumed that the primary deficit widens towards 2016 as the government embarks on
greater infrastructure and social investment in line with its medium-term development plans.

Indonesia’s downward debt dynamics appear to be robust to a plausible range of
macroeconomic shocks. In shocks to underlying assumptions based on recent trends, past
shocks and past volatility, the debt projections remain on a downward path. The historical period
used to calculate these shocks includes the last ten years of data, during which there have been a
number of adverse shocks to Indonesia’s exchange rate, for example during the recent global
crisis, although growth has been positive with relatively little variation. Even with a shock of a
10 percent of GDP increases in debt liabilities in 2013, the debt ratio almost comes back down to
its 2011 value by 2017. However, when considering these results, it is worth noting that this debt
sustainability analysis focuses on solvency issues rather than liquidity and roll-over risks, which
may occur even if solvency is solid. As mentioned in the macro round-up while Indonesia’s near-
term financing position is supported by cash reserves from previous over-financing and the still
conservative fiscal deficits it remains sensitive to shifts in financing conditions. This sensitivity
is one of the rationales for putting in place the contingent financing of the PERISAI DPL-DDO
and parallel facilities from other development partners.

   1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
   2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g ) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+g π)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
   denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
   3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
   4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
   5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
   6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
   7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
   8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
   9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

   1/ Government gross debt.
   2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g ) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+g π)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
   denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
   3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
   4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
   5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
   6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
   7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
   8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
   9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.
