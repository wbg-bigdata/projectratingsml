APPRAISAL OF THE SOUTH BANGKOK THERMAL UNIT NO. 4
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
(i)       This report covers the appraisal of a project consisting of a
310 MW oil-fired thermal generating unit required for the expansion of
electricity supply in Thailand. The unit would be the fourth one in
the South Bangkok Generating Station of the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT). A loan to EGAT of US$27.0 million equiva-
lent is proposed. The loan would cover the cost of imported equipment
and engineering services, representing about 96% of the project's foreign
exchange requirements and 63% of its estimated total cost of US$43.1 million
equivalent.
(ii)      The Bank has made five power loans in Thailand.  The first loan
(175-TH) for US$66 million in 1957 helped finance a major hydroelectric
power project (Bhumibol). The next three (333-TH, 406-TH, and 489-TH)
loans totalled US$17.5 million and covered the installation of additional
units at Bhumibol and the strengthening of the main transmission network.
The most recent loan, (655-TH) of February 1970, for US$46.5 million equiv-
alent financed No. 3 Unit (310 MW) at South Bangkok and a 250 MW hydro plant
at the Sirikit Dam. EGAT's projects have been carried out efficiently
and on schedule; procurement procedures are sound and the organization
and management have developed very well.
(iii)     When bids were requested for the South Bangkok No. 3 Unit, the
specifications stipulated that the bidders should include options for the
supply of duplicate facilities for No. 4 Unit. The procurement procedures
were in accordance with the Bank's requirements for international competitive
bidding and were carried out with the Bank's agreement. The Executive Directors
have been kept informed of the status of procurement. EGAT intends to exercise
the option and proposes to place firm orders at the end of October 1971.
(iv)      Load growth through the 1960s has been high by any standard, averag-
ing about 27%, with increases around 30% during the latter part of this period.
For the period 1971 through 1977, growth is expected to average 15.5% per annum.
The installation of the 310 MW unit proposed for financing is the most appropri-
ate solution to meet the forecast demand.
(v)       Total capital investments during the forecast project construction
period are expected to amount to US$380.5 million. They would be financed
approximately 34% by internal cash generation and 66% by borrowing.  Serious
difficulties are not expected in financing this level of investments as the
financial situation of EGAT is expected to remain sound and it has reasonable
prospects of obtaining the additional funds.



- ii -
(vi)      The internal financial rate of return would be about 23%
after assuming a 50% increase in the imported cost of fuel, reflecting
increases in Mid-East crude oil prices.
(vii)     The project would form a suitable basis for a loan of
US$27.0 million equivalent for a term of 20 years including a grace
period of 5 years.

APPRAISAL OF THE SOUTH BANGKOK THERMAL UNIT NO. 4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Thailand has requested a loan of US$27 million
equivalent to help finance a Project consisting of a 310 MW oil-fired
thermal unit, which would be unit No. 4, at the South Bangkok power station,
which is located beside the Chao Phya River about 10 km southeast of the
city of Bangkok. The borrower would be the Electricity Generating Authority
of Thailand (EGAT), a public entity established in 1969 from a merger of
three power agencies.
1.02      The loan would be the Bank's twenty-third to Thailand and its
sixth for projects involving electrical power. The most recent power loan
(655-TH) was made early in 1970 to help finance the Sirikit hydroelectric
power project and thermal unit No. 3 at South Bangkok. Construction of
both projects is proceeding satisfactorily.  When tenders were called for
the No. 3 unit, under international bidding procedures approved by the Bank,
they included an option for an identical fourth unit for South Bangkok.
EGAT intends to take up the option, which it must do by November 1971.
1.03      The Project is estimated to cost US$43.1 million equivalent, of
which the foreign exchange requirements are estimated to be US$28.7 million
equivalent. The loan would finance the foreign exchange requirements of
the Project excluding civil engineering works, and would represent about
63% of the Project's total cost and 13% of EGAT's expansion program for the
period 1972-1976.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission composed
of Messrs. J. Beach, J. Mosconi and K. Stichenwirth, which visited Thailand
in November/December 1970, and has since been updated on the basis of recent
submissions by EGAT.



II. THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
Economic Background
2.01      The Kingdom of Thailand (see Map) is 198,000 square miles in
area, and has a population of approximately 35.5 million, which is increas-
ing at an annual rate of about 3%. The economy grew by about 9% per annum
during 1965/1969, raising the per capita GDP by 30% to about US$166 equiva-
lent in 1969. Agricultural growth averaged about 5% a year in that period,
but other sectors of the economy, taken together, expanded about twice
as fast. The manufacturing and construction industry in particular,
experienced a growth rate of 12.8%.
2.02      These fast rates of growth were achieved with little inflation.
Large increases in exports and rising U.S. military expenditure in Thailand
helped the economy during the period. More recently, however, growth has
become slower, a 6% increase in GDP having been experienced in 1970. The
Third National Economic and Social Development Plan (1972-1976) begins on
October 1, 1971. The Government's past policies for providing adequate
infrastructure including power facilities to meet Thailand's growing needs
are expected to continue during the next Plan period.
2.03      The per capita consumption of electricity in Thailand has been
growing rapidly but it is still low, about 85 kWh, roughly the same as
in India. The bulk of consumption is in the Bangkok area where most of
the country's industry is located. Power usage elsewhere is largely limited
to towns and cities.
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
2.o4      EGAT, the borrower, is a large and very rapidly growing utility.
It was established by the Act of October 31, 1968, which merged three former
public electricity authorities, namely, the Yanhee Electricity Authority
(YEA), the Northeast Electricity Authority (NEEA) and the Lignite Authority
(LA). YEA was established in 1957 as a condition of the first power loan
to Thailand. EGAT was incorporated on May 1, 1969. The purpose of the
Act was to increase the efficiency of electricity supply throughout the
country, and coordinate the generation and transmission systems in the
northern and central areas (formerly YEA), in the northeastern area (formerly
NEEA) and in the southern area (formerly LA).
2.o5      EGAT is now responsible nationally for generation and transmission
in the public power sector. It accounted for 96% of the country's production
of electrical energy in 1969, the remainder being generated by the Provincial
Electricity Authority (PEA) using plant isolated from the national grid (3%),
and by private industrial plant (1%).



-3-
The Mekong Development
2.06      A potential source of power for EGAT in the future would be
from hydro facilities which may be constructed on the Mekong River. The
Mekong River and its tributaries, principally those in Laos, have an enormous
hydroelectric potential. The 135 MW Nam Ngum project on a tributary in Laos,
of which the installation of 30 MW should be completed by the end of this
year, is presently under construction, and is expected to commence supply-
ing power to EGAT in 1972. The Pa Mong multipurpose project on the Mekong
River in the section where it is the border between Thailand and Laos would
have a capacity of about 4.8 million kW. This is a multipurpose project
which has been investigated under the auspices of the Mekong Committee,
an international body representing the four riparian countries of the
Mekong Basin. The earliest date by which power might be available from
Pa Mong would be about 1985. This distant prospect has no impact on EGAT's
present power planning. Moreover EGAT is concerned about the possible
security implications of depending on a single project for a major part of
its power supply.
PEA and the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
2.07      On the distribution side there are two main organizations, both
publicly owned, the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA), which is
responsible for the distribution of power in the Bangkok area, and PEA,
which is responsible for supply in small towns and villages not accessible
to EGAT's transmission system.
2.08      As will be noted from Annex 7, in Fiscal 1970,-  71% of EGAT's
total sales were made to MEA and this proportion is expected to be maintain-
ed over the next several years. In the past MEA has been able to expand the
distribution system at a rate adequate to supply the very rapid increase in
demand and it is expected that it will continue to do so in the future. For
the same year, about 20% of EGAT's total sales were made to PEA and this
proportion is expected to remain reasonably constant. PEA proposes to invest
$75 million in transmission and distribution facilities during the period
1970-77; about 50% of this amount would come from its own resources.
2.09      Like EGAT, both MEA and PEA are statutory bodies.  EGAT reports
to the Ministry of National Development while MEA and PEA are responsible
to the Ministry of the Interior. Although the authorities responsible
for generation and distribution report to different ministries this has
not created problems with regard to sector coordination and planning, chief-
ly because of the close relationship which is maintained by the authorities
concerned.
1/   EGAT's fiscal year ends September 30.

III. THE BORROWER
Organization, Management and Staff
3.01      EGAT's organization is shown in Annex 1. Management is good
and the organization functions well.
3.02      The 1968 Act provides for the establishment of a Board of
Directors for EGAT consisting of a Chairman and not more than ten other
members, including ex-officio, the General Manager. The Council of Ministers
appoints the Chairman and other members of the Board on a four-year basis,
with the exception of the General Manager. The General Manager, who is
appointed by the Board subject to the approval of the Council of Ministers,
administers the affairs of EGAT in accordance with the policies, rules and
regulations laid down by the Board. The Board confines itself to policy
and leaves daily management to the General Manager and his staff.
3.03      Loan Agreement 655-TH stipulates that repeal or material amendment
of the 1968 Act without the prior agreement of the Bank would constitute an
event of default. A similar provision has been included in the Agreement
for the proposed loan.
3.04      At the end of FY 1970 EGAT had a work force of about 5,000 employees,
of whom approximately 14% were university graduates and slightly more were
higher vocational school graduates. An extensive training program exists to
help develop the various skills required by the employees. The number of
employees is about 10% higher than it ought to be due mainly to the transfer
to EGAT of the staff of its predecessors. This surplus is expected to be
eliminated as the result of attrition and system expansion.
Tariffs
3.05      The 1968 Act requires that EGAT's tariffs should cover the following:
(i) all operating expenses including employees' benefits
and bonuses, depreciation and interest;
(ii) amortization in excess of depreciation, and increases in
the cost of replacement of assets;
(iii) allocations to reasonable contingency reserves, and
financing of a substantial portion of the investment
for expansion. (Loan Agreement 655-TH requires a 30%
contribution.)
The provisions of the Act and the way they have been administered have proved
effective in maintaining the sound financial position that has characterized
EGAT's operations.



- 5 -
3.06      EGAT's tariffs are of the standard demand-energy type which are
appropriate for a supplier of bulk power. The average level of tariffs
in 1970 was 30 stangs/kWh (U.S. 1.4¢/kWh). For a bulk supplier of power
this figure is fairly high, the chief reasons being the high duties and
taxes on imported fuel oil (44% of the total cost of fuel) (see Annex 10)
and the surplus of employees.
3.07      During the past decade, the Government's objective has been to
reduce tariffs. It has been found possible to make periodic reductions
in the tariffs of MEA and PEA (i.e. for distribution), which have not
seriously affected the financial viability of these organizations because
tariffs were initially high and efficiencies have improved with increasing
load densities. On the other hand, EGAT (and YEA) have maintained tariffs
practically constant through this period in order to maintain a high level
of internal cash generation to assist in financing the expansion program.
Existing Facilities
3.08      At the end of December 1970, EGAT's generating capacity amounted
to 1,182 MW as follows:
Percentage
of Total
Hydro-electric                      450 MW              38.1
Thermal (oil-fired)                 454 MW              38.4
Thermal (lignite-fired)               72 MW             6.1
Gas Turbines                         165 MW             13.9
Diesel                               41 MW              3.5
1,1512 MW           100.0
With the exception of the 230 kV transmission link between the Bhumibol
hydro station and the principal load center, Bangkok, and a 230 kV ring
around Bangkok, transmission is at 115 kV and, to a lesser extent, 69 kV.
Annex 2 gives details of existing generation and the Map shows the layout
of the main transmission system.
Electricity Supply
3.09      Power consumption in Thailand has grown at a very rapid rate,
averaging about 27% per annum since 1961 with even higher growth rates in
the late 1960's (para. 5.01). As recently as 1967, sales were only 50%
of those in 1970.
3.10      In FY 1970, EGAT sold 3,856 GWh  (22% more than 1969) and
experienced a maximum demand of 748 MW. The system load factor was 62.5%
reflecting the preponderance of industrial load which accounted for about
62% of sales in 1969. Power was generated as follows:



-6 -
GWh             Percentage
Generated           of Total
Hydro                      1,577                38.5
Thermal-steam              2,037                49.7
Thermal-other                481                11.8
Total               4,095               100.0
System losses were approximately 6%; this low percentage is an indication
of the efficiency of the transmission system as well as the fact that the
load is largely concentrated close to the large thermal generating stations.
Future System Expansion
3.11      EGAT is undertaking an extensive expansion program.  Installed
capacity at the end of FY 1970 of 967 MW is planned to increase to 2,907 MW
by the end of FY 1977. Plant presently under construction (see Annex 2)
includes the South Bangkok Thermal Units 2 and 3 of 200 MW and 310 MW capacity
respectively, and the Sirikit hydro station with three 125 MW units. The
Sirikit station and South Bangkok Unit 3 are being financed by Loan 655-TH.
Some preliminary site work has been done on the Quae Yai multipurpose project
(see Map) but start of full construction awaits the outcome of further
geological investigations. The Royal Irrigation Department (RID) is presently
undertaking the construction of the 36 MW Lam Dom Noi hydro project.  On
completion, EGAT will take over the plant and its operation and will assume
the debt service obligations. Annex 2 lists the generating stations under
construction or planned.
3.12      EGAT is undertaking an expansion of its high voltage transmission
system appropriate to the expansion of its generating facilities.
3.13      Through FY 1971-1977, EGAT's total investment excluding interest
during construction is expected to be Baht 9,581 million or US$461 million
equivalent. Generation projects will account for 84% of this investment,
the remainder being for transmission. Since EGAT operates as a bulk supplier,
and the load is largely concentrated in the Bangkok area, the relatively low
investment in transmission is reasonable.

IV. THE PROJECT
Introduction
4.01      Given that there are not many hydroelectric sites of moderate
capacity capable of economic development in Thailand, much of the country's
electric power needs will have to be met by thermal generation, until such
time as demand grows to the point when large projects now being contemplated
on the Mekong River become economically feasible. Indigenous fuel resources
are scarce so that present and planned thermal generation must depend on
imported fuel, at present oil.  Exploration for oil has begun in the Gulf
of Thailand, but it is still too early to assess the prospects.
4.02      The South Bangkok power station was designed accordingly for
high-efficiency base-load service by Black and Veatch International of the
U.S.A., EGAT's consultants for thermal projects. Present plans are for an
ultimate installation of about 1,500 MW in five units. Unit No. 1 (200 MW)
was placed in commission in December 1970; No. 2 (200 MW) and No. 3 (310 MW)
units, presently under construction, are scheduled for start-up in December
1971 and December 1973 respectively.
The Project
14.03     The project proposed for Bank financing would be the South Bangkok
generating Unit No. 4. The unit, which would be identical to Unit No. 3,
would consist of a single oil-fired generating plant, tandem compound,
nominally rated at 310 MW, but capable of continuous overload to 350 MW at
reduced efficiency.  It would operate at steam conditions of 2,250 psi and
1,0000 F with reheat to 1,000 F. The generator would be linked through a
370 MVA transformer to a 230 kV outdoor switchyard from which a direct
comletion woud be made to the 230 kV Bangkok loop.  (see Map)

4.05      The estimated cost of the Project is based on the option prices
obtained for the major equipment and on EGATrs estimates for the civil
works which are an extension of the foundation works and structures under
construction for Nos. 2 and 3 units.  As the bid prices for the major
items of equipment are firm, a price contingency allowance of about 5%
is included for the foreign exchange costs to cover possible increases
in costs of items other than major equipment and fluctuations in exchange
rates. A contingency allowance of 12% is included for possible price
increases in local costs. This should be adequate as costs have been
reasonably stable. No allowance has been made for physical contingencies
for either plant or civil works. The unit and the associated civil struc-
tures are identical to Unit No. 3 and precise requirements are known.
The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$39.5 million equivalent,
excluding duty amounting to US$3.6 million equivalent on imported equipment.
This is equivalent to US$127/kW. The fact that an existing site has been
used and that the proposed unit will utilize a number of existing common
services have contributed to this low unit cost.
Amount of Proposed Loan
4.06      The foreign exchange costs of the proposed project is estimated
at $28.7 million equivalent,  The p:,pf  <         U $27 million equivalent
would cover the estimated foreign exchange coSts of generating plant,
associated equipment and engineering. EGAT proposes to carry out the civil
works which have an estimated foreign exchange cost of US$1.7 million,
with its own forces and without international competitive bidding for the
imported materials. The proposed loan would thus amount to 63% of the
estimated cost of the Project and would cover about 96% of the total foreign
exchange requirements. For the purpose of this report, interest at 7½ per
annum and a commitment charge of 3X4 of 1% have been used.
Engineering, Procurement and Disbursements
4.07      As in the case of South Bangkok Units 1 and 2, the consulting
firm of Black and Veatch have been retained to design and supervise construc-
tion of Units 3 and 4. The consultaln't are s.tisfactory. During negotiations
EGAT agreed that it will continue to enpDloy engineering consultants satisfactory
to the Bank. Field construction is being carried out by EGAT under the super-
vision of the consultants, assisted by EGAT engineering personnel. This
arrangement is satisfactory as the labor force involved would simply continue
with the construction of the proposed Project as the various phases of those
units now under construction are completed.



- 9 -
4.08      When bids were requested for the equipment for No. 3 Unit, the
specifications stipulated that bidders should include options for the supply
of duplicate equipment for No. 4 Unit. The procurement procedures were
in accordance with the Bank's requirements for international competitive
bidding and were carried out with the Bank's agreement.
4.o9      EGAT intends to exercise the options since the prices are almost
certainly lower than could be obtained from new bids in view of recent
increases in the price of equipment. By so doing, EGAT has the additional
advantage of standardization of equipment, simplification of engineering
(for example, new specifications and designs will not be necessary) and
construction, and reductions in cost thereof. It would also reduce the
administrative burden.
4.10      The options are due to expire in November 1971 and EGAT expects
to place firm orders before then. The Project is expected to be commissioned
in December 1975 and to be in full commercial operation by January 1976.
4.11      As noted, procurement of the main items of equipment would be
by exercise of existing options (para. 4.o8). The remaining goods financed
by the loan would be procured on the basis of international competitive
bidding, except for components required to be compatible with existing
equipment, and items of minor cost for which such bidding will be impracti-
cal. The total cost of these components and minor items should not exceed
US$500,000 equivalent. Disbursements would be made for the full foreign
exchange cost of the equipment imported and services provided. No disburse-
ments would be made for expenditure made prior to signing the proposed
loan. Estimated disbursements, by quarters, are given in Annex 8. Any
surplus loan amounts remaining on completion of the project should be
cancelled unless there were good reasons for applying savings to related
works.
Ecological Aspects
4.12      No ecological problems are expected.  Ample supplies of cooling
water are available from the broad Chao Phya River for use in the condensers
of the turbo-generator. As the volume of water required for this purpose
is small in relation to the river flow, marine life would be unaffected
by the warm water discharge from the condensers. Thailand has not yet
established standards for permissible concentration of sulphur dioxide
and other contaminants emitted by industrial plants. However the boilers
for all plant at the South Bangkok site have been specially designed to
provide for a high stack emission velocity (100 ft per second) so that the
plume height will be sufficient to ensure that waste boiler gases will
be sufficiently dispersed to maintain atmospheric contamination below levels
acceptable in other countries which have strict air quality standards.

V. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
The Power Market
5.01      The growth of power consumption in Thailand (Annex 5) has been
very rapid, averaging about 27% per annum since 1961, with annual increases
of around 30% in the late 1960s. This extremely rapid growth reflects the
pace at which the Thai economy has been expanding, aided by the Governmentts
success in encouraging local and foreign investment (with consequential
industrial development and rising standards of living), the growth of
tourism, and the impetus given to the economy by the U.S. military presence.
5.02      In view Qf the very rapid load growth the power market has been
the subject of a number of studies. The most definitive of the studies
undertaken were those by the Moulton Mission (1966) and the Jones Report
(1969) which updated the Moulton Study (Annex 3) both sponsored by AID. 1/
These reports relate market estimates to past and expected growth of national
and regional economic activity.
5.03      EGAT regularly reviews the power market.  It bases its expansion
program and revenue projections on an analysis of system requirements for
ten years using the methodology of the Moulton and Jones reports2/ adjusted
for results of the past three years and taking into account recent trends
in the economy and up-to-date information on industrial growth. The forecast
through 1977 is given in Annex 7, which also shows the projected sales to
MEA, PEA and to industrial users supplied directly by EGAT.
5.04      EGAT's projection indicates that while the unusually high past
rate of growth will not be sustained indefinitely, load growth will continue
to be very substantial. A 21% increase is expected in 1971 tapering off
to 11.5% in 1977 - an average of 15.5% for the period. Demand is expected
to increase from 926 MW in 1971 to 2,116 MW in 1977. It is evident that
forecasts in a dynamic economy are subject to substantial uncertainties;
however, for the period covered, the market forecast is reasonable as a
basis for planning investment.
Capability of Meeting the Demand
5.05      Annexes 4 and 6 giv,e the estimated demand and system capability
data. Following the commissioning of the Project the situation during 1976
on the main system, which does not include the isolated southern area of
the country with its small demand, would be:

Installed capacity                                     2,390
System demand                             1,808
Provision for maintenance shutdowns          310       2,118
Reserve                                                  272
Reserve as percentage of capacity                         11.4%
In view of the nature of the market development in Thailand where there are
no large seasonal variations in demand and hence no period of the year which
can be safely allocated to maintenance of plant, this reserve, together
with a provision for maintenance shutdown of the largest unit in the system,
is reasonable, given the possibility of failure of large generating units
and that load growth could be larger than estimated.
5.06      The generating capacity which the Project would provide is
necessary to meet the market conditions expected at about the time it
would come into service in 1975 and maintain a prudent level of reserves.
There is no realistic alternative method of providing this or equivalent
generating capacity by then. Only gas-turbine or diesel units could be
installed in time, but neither type would normally be used for the base
load service to which the new steam unit would be assigned due, inter alia,
to their high fuel costs. Further, the cost per kW installed for these
many small units would be of the same order as that for the project and
they therefore do not represent a practical alternative.
Estimated Internal Financial Rate of Return
5.07      The internal financial rate of return on the Project is the dis-
count rate at which the present worth of its cost, including operating
charges but excluding duties, taxes and depreciation, is equal to the present
worth of the net revenues to be obtained over its life. The calculation
includes cost savings realized from the displacement of less efficient
generating plant. (Annex 9)
5.o8      The return should be about 23% after assuming a 50% increase in
the imported cost of fuel, reflecting the recent increases in Mid-East
crude-oil prices. Should the load growth prove to be only 90% of the level
estimated, the internal financial rate of return would fall to about 22%.
The internal economic return would undoubtedly be higher.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
6.01      EGAT was formed from a merger of three utilities, YEA, the
most important and largest in terms of assets, NE3A and LA, (para.2.04).
on May 1, 1969 and now accounts for about 90% of the electricity
produced in Thailand. YEA itself was established as a condition of
the Bank's first power loan in Thailand; during the years it was the
major generating and transmission entity; its operations and financial
performance were satisfactory. The rapid acquisition of fixed assets,
a consequence of the sustained growth of the electric power market
(para. 5.01), has been, and continues to be the most notable feature
of EGAT's operations.  These assets amounted to some US$356 million
equivalent at the end of FY 1970 and are expected to more than double
by FY 1976.
Accounting and Audit
6.02      EGAT's system of accounts follows the U.S. Federal Power
Commission's regulations. The accounts are administered effectively
and annual statements have been prepared within 90 days of the end of
the fiscal year as the 1968 Act stipulates.
6.03      The Act also requires the appointment of auditors to audit
the accounts each year. Since 1966 an independent accounting firm,
Coopers & Lybrand (UK), has been appointed by EGAT, and its predecessor
YEA, to assist the Government Audit Council which actually makes the
audit. This arrangement has been satisfactory and in agreement with
the provisions of the previous Bank loan. The relevant covenant will
be repeated in the proposed loan.
Present Position
6.04      The first complete fiscal year of EGAT's operations was Ff
1970 (October 1, 1969 - September 30, 1970).  The financial data given
in Annexes 10 to 16, indicate that the Authority is in a sound con-
dition. The return on average net fixed assets in operation was 7.8%
in FY 1970 and the debt/equity ratio 59:41. Current assets to current
liabilities exclusive of current maturities showed a ratio of about
1.7:1.Total intere.it was covered 1.9 times by operating income, and
the debt service coverage by internal sources amounted to 1.5.

Total Capitalization                       6 609           l00.0%
6.06      The major part of Government investments, amounting to about
36% of the FY 1970 capitalization, comprise the net worth of the
assets of YEA, NEEA and LA which were transferred to EGAT. These
investments, largely in the form of non-repayable contributions, were
made before Y3A was formed, but were increased more recently by
contributions to cover the local currency costs of the Yanhee (Bhumibol)
project and the first North Bangkok thermal unit.
6.07      The long-term debt, a detailed breakdown of which is shown
in Annex 16, is about 59% of total capitalization.  In the past, 3GAT
and its predecessors were able to obtain funds on comparatively
favorable terms; only one loan, namely Loan 655-TH, wis at an interest
rate as high as 7%.  The terms of 3GAT's borrouing are:
IBRD Loans            15-25 years, 5.7% to 7% interest;
Government Loans      12-50 years, 3% to 6% interest;
Bank of Thailand      15 years, 5.5% interest;

- 15 -
6.09     During the Project construction period internal cash generation,
as noted, is expected to finance about 34% of capital investment and
increase in working capital. The proposed Bank loan and the balance
of Loan 655-TH account for 16% with the Government expected to lend a
further 11% by way of deferred customs duties on imported capital equip-
ment. The draw down of a recently contracted US$19 million ADB loan
for EGAT's Transmission and Substation Expansion Program will provide
about 5%. EGAT expects to obtain about 11% of its borrowings through
suppliers' credits. The planned Quae Yai hydroelectric project will
naed substantial foreign financing which, together with loans for other
projects, will provide 23%. While the new loans and credits are pre-
sently not defined, no serious difficulties are foreseen in securing
them.
Revenues and Expenses
6.10     The projected revenues are based on estimated annual increases
of units sold, ranging from 21% in FY 1971 to 11.5% in 1977, as described
in para. 5.0. Average revenue per unit sold is expected to decrease
from 29 stang to 27 stang during this period, reflecting higher sales
in the lower tariff brackets.
6.11     The most significant operating cost, accounting for about 50%
of the total costs including depreciation, is that of fuel which is
higher in Thailand than in neighbouring countries in Southeast Asia
due to heavy duties and taxes. The basic price for fuel oil is about
US 3"O per million Btu, on which taxes and duties equivalent to US 26¢
per million Btu, i.e. over 50% of the basic price (see Annex 10) are
levied. The total price of 58¢ per million Btu is used in the financial
projections. Estimated expenses do not include provision for the in-
crease which is to occur in fuel oil prices as a result of the new
contracts signed in 1971 between the oil-producing countries and the
major oil companies, since the Thai Government has indicated that it
would lower duties and taxes on imported oil to a com.pensating extent.
EGAT's other operating costs are projected in accordance with past
experience.
Level of Self-Financing
6.12     Loan 655-TH stipulated that tariffs should be set so that at
least 30% of EGATts investment requirements over any 4-year period
would be financed internally. By taking the actual results of 1970 and
three future years (1971-73) the internal contribution for the four
years averages 29.2% (see Annex 11, page 3); the successive periods are
close to or over the 30% limit (see Annex 11). During this appraisal,
the implications of changing to a rate-of-return criterion for tariffs
were examined but it was concluded that the present criterion should
be kept because it conforms most closely with the criteria outlined in
the 1968 Act (para. 3.05). The present criterion could be translated



- 16 -
into a rate of return covenant, but the 30% target would require that
the present rate of return of about 9% be increased to about 12% in
future years (Annex 10). This high return might be difficult for the
Government to accept as a basis of performance. Consequently, the
principle of the covenant in Loan 655-TH will be retained in the po-
posed loan. It was agreed during negotiations that the test on EGAT's
performance will in future, be made on the basis of any four-year
period consisting of one actual year plus the immediately succeeding
three forecast years.
Debt Control
6.13      An undertaking contained in Loan 655-TH provided that the
Borrowier would not incur new debt in excess of US$20 million in any
given year without Bank approval.  However, in 1970 the Bank agreed
to waive the covenant in that year because EGAT's investments in the
expansion program were and will continue to be larger than foreseen.
A new debt-service covenant is therefore proposed to replace the
existing one. It stipulates that EGAT will not incur additional debt
unless maximum total future debt service on debt drawn-down is covered
at least 1.4 times by internal cash generation after deducting bonus
payments (see para. 6.15) and income tax, if any. Internal cash
generation would be assessed from the fiscal year before the one in
which such debt was incurred or any later l?-month period terminating
before the debt was incurred, whichever was the greater. Agreement
to this was reached during negotiations. The covenant to Loan 655-TH
requiring Bank concurrence for borrowing on 5-year (medium term) or
shorter terms in excess of US$5 million outstanding, will be repeated
in the proposed loan so as to protect EGAT's liquidity.
Income Tax
6.1L      The Government agreed under Loan 655-TH to exempt EGAT from
paying income tax during the period 1970-1976 unless its debt/equity
ratio fell below 1.2:1 - that is, until the total debt outstanding
became less than 54.5% of the total capitalization - and to review the
tax situation before the end of 1976.  The background is explained in
Annex 10. It is only in 1977 that the Company would become liable and
an appropriate provision has been made in the income statement.
Employee Bonus Payments
6.15      Bonuses are obligatorily paid annually to management and
staff in all State Enterprises.  About 7% of the net profit has to be
set aside for this purpose - 2% for the management and 5%, up to a
maximum of the equivalent of h months' salary, for the staff. The
incentive provided gives, of course, every employee a personal interest
in the efficiency and profitability of the Enterprise. Management
and staff bonus payments increase from Baht 13 million to Baht 41 million
during the project period, absorbing some 2/ of annual cash flows.

Financial Rates of Return
6.16      Over the period to 1977, the rate of return on average net
fixed assets in operation is estimated to vary between 8.6% and 12%,
rising during the first years and receding slightly later (Annex 10).
As noted in paragraph 6.09, these earnings should permit EGAT to finance
almost 34% of its investments out of internal cash generation. This
level is satisfactory, especially considering that EGAT and YEA have in
the past demonstrated their ability to raise the funds for the remaining
requirements on the domestic (Government) and foreign market. The debt/
equity ratio, starting from 59/41, is expected to improve to 55/45 in
1977. Debt service is expected to be covered between 1.5 and 1.7 times
by internal sources during the forecast period and total interest would
be covered between 2.2 and 2.4 times by operating income. These ratios
are satisfactory.

VII.  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations in September 1971, agreement was
reached on the following points:
(a) the provision that the EGAT Act should not
be materially changed without the Bank's
prior concurrence will be continued (para.
3.03);
(b) qualified and experienced engineering con-
sultants and contractors will continue to be
employed upon terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank (para. 4.07);
(c) annual audits will continue to be made under
arrangements satisfactory to the Bank (para.
6.03);
(d) tariffs should be set to cover all operating
costs, depreciation, interest chargeable
against revenues, amortization in excess of
depreciation, if applicable, welfare and bonus
payments, income tax remittance, if any, and
to provide an average of 30% of the cost of
expansion (including interest during construction)
during any future 4-year period consisting of
one actual and three forecast years (para. 6.12);
(e) no debt will be incurred without Bank concurrence
unless internal cash generation in the previous
fiscal year or any other twelve-month period
before the debt is incurred, whichever is higher,
exceeds l.h times maximum future debt service
requirements computed on the basis of debt drawn-
down (para. 6.13);
(r) borrowings on the basis of five years or shorter
terms, including overdrafts, will continue not
to exceed the amount outstanding of US$5 million
equivalent without the Bank's prior concurrence
(Sara. 6.13).

LnterraJ. Financial Rate of Return
The method followied tu deti.rmine the internal financial rate
of return on the project consists of di:counting the net cost/benefit stream
attributable to the project to finc the rate at which the present value of
the stream becomes zero. In the calculation, the following elements have
been taken into consideration:
Costs
(i)  capital investments in the project, net of all duties and taxes;
(ii)  operating and maintenance costs (excluding depreciation) together
with the cost of fuel net of all taxes and duties;
(ii;)  it was assumed that the unit would be base-loaded to the extent
possible as soon as it came on line (75% plant factor) and
would so remain for the first five years of its life. Thereafter,
because of the introduction of even more efficient generating
facilities, plant factors have been reduced in stages to 55%
for the last ten ydars uf the plant's assumed 30-year life.
It has also been assumed that the unit heat rate would increase
progressively from an assumed 9000 BTUs per IJh after commission-
ing to 10,000 BTUs per k!4h towards the end of the plant's life;
(iv)  the return was calculated on the basis of (a) fuel costs at
Us$0.48 per million BTU's exclusive of duties and taxes. This
represents an increase of 5G% over present fuel costs, reflect-
ing the prospecti-e increase in Mid-East crude oil prices,
(b) a load growth of only 90% of the level estimated.
Benefits
(i) fuel savings in Fiscal years 1976 and 1977.  These were
determined from a reduction of klihs generated by less efficient
generating units at the prevailing unit fuel costs. After Fiscal
1977, all units generated by the project were assumed to repre-
sent new sales (after deducting units used in auxiliaries and
losses in the transmission system);
(ii)  revenues on sales, attributable to the project, calculated at
tariffs expected to be realized at the time the facility is
expected to be commissioned (28 stangs in 1976 and 27 stangs
thereafter).
Return
The equalizing discount rate based on the estimated load
growth is about 23% and with the lower load growth is 22%.

Notes on Income Statements
1. Fuel Cost
The price of fuel oil for EGAT consists of the following elements:
Import price plus oil
companies' cost and
profit margin ........... 23 stang/liter       = US 32¢/1 million btu
Excise tax .................  10 stang/liter) 4h% of the
Business tax ...............  1 stang/liter) general
Rent for Government-                           price for
owned refinery   .......... 7 stang/liter) EGAT
General price for EGAT ..... E1 stang/liter       = US 58¢/l million btu
The financial projections include this price since increases in the
import price can be absorbed by compensatory lowering of taxes, to which
the Government has agreed.
The price of lignite is determined by the annual cost of the EGAT-owned
lignite mines adjusted for sales of lignite to industries and for domestic
purposes.
2. Purchased Power
With the completion of the Nam Ngum project in Laos (fiscal year 1972),
EGAT plans to import between 30 GWh and 400 GWh per year during the period
fiscal 1972 through fiscal 1977. The price for the energy has yet to be
negotiated, but calculations carried out by EGAT indicate it to be 9.h
stang/kWh; this price, therefore, has been included in the financial pro-
jections.
3. Operation, Maintenance and Administration
The forecast of operation, maintenance and administration expenses is based
on a detailed analysis carried out by EGAT of the number and qualification
of staff employed at the end of fiscal year 1970 and of the level of ex-
penditures other than salaries and wages.

5.   Income Tax
According to their Acts, EGAT and its predecessors were required
to turn over their total net profits to the Government. Since
none of the entities in fact finanuially was in a position to
live up to this stipulation, the Government decreed in 1965 that
all State Enterprises should pa3 instead the equivalent of the
corporate income tax which amounts to about 25% of the net profit.
Even this tax, however, was not paid, and eventually accumulated
to Baht 204.8 million in EGAT's books by the end of fiscal year
1969. During negotiations for Loan 655-TH the Government agreed
to convert the deferred tax amount into a 6%, 15-year loan with
amortization starting in fiscal year 1973 and to exempt EGAT
from paying income tax to the Government during the period
1970-1976 unless its debt/equity ratio fell below 1:1.2 (e.g.
total debt outstanding would become less than 54.5% of the
total capitalization). At the same time the Government committed
itself to review EGAT's income tax gituation and arrive at a
permanent solution before the end of fiscal 1976 since with the
present level of revenues, EGAT would not be able to maintain its
financial position and comply with the financial covenants of
IERD loans if it had to pay income tax. To reflect the present
situationj the fluanoial projectiona show income tax assessment in
1977.

Notes on the gbrecast Sources and Applications
of Funds Statements
1. Forecast External Sources
EGAT's future needs for extern4l sources are estimated to be covered
as follows:
(i) the proposed IBRD loan of US$25.0 million equivalent
assumed to be at 7.25% for a term of 20 years including
5 years of grace;
(ii) the major portion of the Loan 655-TH draw-down; the
total loan was made for US$h6.5 million, bears interest
at the rate of 7% and is for a 20-year term including
5 years of grace;
(iii) a Government contribution of Baht 198 million to finance
partially the transfer of the Lam Dom Noi 1 and 2 assets
from the Royal Irrigation Department to EGAT;
(iv) the recently contracted US$19 million loan from ADB at
7.5% for a term of 22 years including 4 years of grace.
The loan has been raised to help finance 3GAT's Trans-
mission and Substation Expansion Program;
(v) assumed foreign currency loans for Quae Yai (US$45
million) at 7.5% for a 25-year term including a 5-years
grace period;
(vi) two recently contracted export loans from Austrian
Banks to help finance construction of the Surat Thani
thermal power plant. The total amount borrowed comes
to US$5.5 million at 6% for a term of 111. years in-
cluding 3 years of grace;
(vii) a series of annual loans, partly committed, which the
Government advances to cover payment of import duties.
These are assumed to be at 6% with 10 years repayment
after h years of grace, terms which apply at present;
(viii) a series of export and suppliers' credits, partly con-
tracted, at 4',% to 7% for terms of 12 to 20 years;
(ix) a series of additional loans as needed to balance the
projected financial requirements. These were assumed
to be at 7.5%.

2.  Contributions to Investment
EGAT's tariffs should be set at levels which provide, after
covering all annual costs including amortization in excess of
depreciation, an average of 30% of the investment cost over
a sliding 4 consecutive year period, comprising the last actual
and three future years. The financial projections show that
this target is expected to be met during the forecast period as
follows:
1970/73   1971/74   1972/75   1973/76   197h/77
