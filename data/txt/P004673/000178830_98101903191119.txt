REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ELECTRICITY GENERhATTG AUTHORITY OF THAIL,AND
1.        I submit the followiing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) with the
guarantee of the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$ 27 million
to help finance a project for the addition of a hth thermal unit to the
South Bangkok Generating Station of EGAT.   The lean would have a term of
20 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 71S% per annum.
PART I - INTP.ODUCTION
2.        The Bank has extended 22 loans but no IDA credits to Thailand.
Total Bank lending mounts to $393.9 million equivalent, of which $32.2
million has been cancelled.   The greater part of Bank assistance to Thai-
land has been for transportation ($154 million), irrigation ($69 million),
power ($64 million), and for a multipurpose power/irrigation project ($66
million).   Other loans have been made for education and industry.   A sum-
mary statement of Bank loans to Thailand is at Annex I.    Generally, Bank-
financed projects have been carried out well, particularly in the power
sector.   As a result of unsatisfactory bidding for tools and scientific
equipment when these items were first tendered, the Closing Date of Loan
471-TH (Vocational Education Project) has been postponed a second time to
allow for rebidding;   the first postponement was necessary due to delays
in appointing experts under bilateral assistance.   The Closing Date of
Loan 455-TH (Second Highway Project) has recently been postponed to allow
the Department of Highways to settle contractor's claims and to continue
paying for the services of engineering advisers pending the Bank's consid-
eration of a proposed fifth highway loan.   The Third and Fourth Highway
Projects being financed under Loans 535-TH and 626-TH are proceeding satis-
factorily.   Construction of the Sirikit Dam Project (Loan 514-TH) is on
schedule.  There have been no significant disbursements under Loan 65-TH
(South Bangkok Unit No. 3 and Sirikit Dam Units No. 1 and 2) pending the
shipment of equipment.   Disbursements under Loan 702-TH (Third Bangkok
Port Project) of August, 1970, have been slow to begin due to delays in
awarding the main civil works contract;   the contract is expected to be
let this month.
3.        Kasetsart University and the Government have been invited to
negotiate a proposed loan for the expansion and improvement of the
University's facilities but a date has not yet been agreed.     Appraisal
of the fifth highway project is now being completed.   Consideration of
these two projects by the Executive Directors is dependcnt on the Govern-



- 2 -
ment obtaining legislative authority to continue borrowing from the Bank
(as distinct from guaranteeing Bank loans, which presents no problem).
This legislation is unlikely to be enacted by Parliament before the end
of this year. A teleccamunications project, for which ADB may provide
part of the financing required, is expected to be appraised in March 1972.
4.        Thailand became a member of IFC in 1956.   IFC has made two
equity investments in the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand
(IFCT).   The first for $193,108 was made in 1964 when the Bank and IFC
assisted in the reorganization and strengthening of IFCT and the second
in February, 1971, when IFC exercised its rights to a new'r share issue for
$191,388.   IFC continues to hold all its shares in IFCT.   In 1959, IFC
made a loan of $300,000 to Concrete Products and Aggregate, Ltd. which
has since been sold and in 1969 IFC participated in the expansion program
of the Siam Cement Group of companies.   The six companies in the Group
are Thailand's largest producers of building materials.   IFC's investment
took the form of an $18 million long-term loan and an equity participation
of about 'P4 million.  IFC has since sold loan and equity participations
totalling about $15.9 million, and $223,500 has been repaid.   Currently,
IFC has no projects under active consideration in Thailand, although pre-
liminary consideration is being given to a steel project.   However, in the
longer term the prospects for new IFC investments appear to be moderately
good.
PA-T II - THE ECOIONMY
5.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Thailand" (EAP-15a, dated August 20, 1970) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on September 4, 1970.   An economic mission visited Thailand in
July and August 1971 and reviewed the draft Third National Economic and
Social Development Plan (1972-1976) which began on October 1, 1971.   At
the same time, sectoral missions assessed the current situation and pros-
pects in agriculture, tourism and in the Northeast region.   The mission's
report is expected to be ready for distribution in December, 1971. Country
data are at Annex II.
Recent Economic Developments
6.        During the 1960's Thailand achieved rapid economic growth, com-
bined with surpluses in the balance of payments and a remarkable degree of
price stability.   Agricultural production increased in response to increas-
ing external demand.   There was a rapid expansion of manufacturing mainly
for the domestic market, largely due to a dynamic private sector and from
1965 construction and services in particular were further stimulated by the
high level of US military expenditures.   GDP increased by over 8 percent
annually between 1960 and 1969, reaching a per capita level of about $180
at present.
7.        A period of adjustment to distinctly slower growth of foreign
exchange receipts began in 1969.   External demand for Thailand's main
export, rice, weakened;   prices fell, and sales abroad remained at around



one million tons. As a consequence, the income of rice farmers who are
the vast majority of the Thai people, was reduced considerably. Simul-
taneously, US military spending in the country declined gradually from
$254 million in 1968 to an estimated $167 million in 1971.  The slowdown
in actual and expected income growth due to these two factors led after
some lag to a levelling off in private investment in 1970.  As a result
some unemployment has appeared in urban areas.  GDP growth is estimated
at 6 percent in 1970 and is expected to be similar in 1971.  Import growth
which had been rapid until 1969, declined sharply in 1970 under the effect
of slower investment and production growth.  But, this decline was not
enough to prevent a further widening of the current account deficit to
$327 million in 1970, compared to $108 million three years earlier. Foreign
exchange reserves declined from V150 million in June 1968 to about ',800
million in June 1971.
8.        Thailand's traditionally cautious fiscal and monetary policies
have come under pressure in recent years.  Substantial increases in ex-
penditures on external and domestic security, as well as on development,
have been accompanied by slower growth of revenue and non-expansionary
borrowing, so that the cash deficit financed by borrowing from the banking
system increased considerably in 1971.  Nevertheless, Thailand continued
to enjoy remarkable price stability, thanks to expanding production and
imports.
9.        While the Government has taken a number of remedial measures,
such as an increase in import duties and other indirect taxes and the
removal of rice export taxes, fundamental problems of economic and social
development remain to be solved.  These are the focus of the Third Plan,
which began on October 1, 1971.
Third Five-Year Economic and Social Development Plan
10.       The major objective of the Third Plan is to achieve average GDP
growth of 7 percent.    The basic strategy is to diversify and accelerate ex-
ports of agricultural commodities and manufactured goods.  To reach this
target, major policy measures to stimulate diversification and export growth
are required, and the Government would have to deal more effectively than
in the past with the required structural changes.
11.       The major constraint to economic development over the next five
years will probably be the balance of payments.  Given the structure of
the current account and the expected further decline in US military expendi-
tures, exports will have to increase at more than twice the rate of imports
to prevent an unduly sharp increase in the current account deficit.
12.       Nevertheless,the current account deficit is likely to increase
considerably during the Third Plan period.   Only a small part of the
deficit can be financed by further drawdown on external reserves;  thus a
large increase in net capital inflow is required if development is not to
be disrupted.    In the past, Thailand relied heavily on private capital



particularly suppliersI credits, to finance most of the foreign exchange
requirements of industrial investment and part of the infrastructural
needs. Ifhile the Plan expects a further considerable increase in private
credit, a slowdown in the growth of suppliers' credits seems to be called
for within the framework of a more selective investment promotion policy.
13.       Although Thailand has achieved a remarkable rate of national
savings at about 22 percent of GDP, primarily generated in the private sec-
tor, there are not enough channels to mobilize private savings for public
investment. Improvements are required in the revenue system on grounds
of economic efficiency and social equity. The collection of customs,
income and business taxes is lax and, if improved, could significantly
raise revenues even at existing rates. For revenue purposes a number of
excise taxes and import duties might be raised; and the Cabinet is present-
ly considering new property and inheritance tax measures.
i4.       Although some 80 percent of the labor force is engaged in agri-
culture, it accounts for only about 30 percent of GD? - a measure of the
imbalance in incomes between agriculture and the rest of the economy. From
1960 to 1969, the growth rate of agricultural output averaged nearly 9i
percent annually, largely through the cultivation of additional land areas.
Rice, accounting for 31.2 percent of agricultural output in 1969, is the
dormiinant commodity and Thailand's major export.  Unfavorable world markets
for rice have sharply reduced export volume and prices.  Because of the
unfavorable prospects for rice exports, the strategy for agricultural de-
veloprnent in the Third Plan calls for the diversification of agriculture
towards ccrmnodities with more favorable export potential.  The target of
the Plan is to increase the value of agricultural exports by some 33 per-
cent. Maize alone, which developed rapidly in the 1960's, is expected to
account for about one-third of the projected increase and together with
rubber and tapioca would account for about two-thirds.
15.       The export targets mentioned above emphasize the necessity of
developing rainfed agriculture if the goals of the Plan are to be achieved.
Multiple cropping under rainfed conditions has great potential; the crop
season can be stretched out to take advantage of early rains and residual
soil moisture after the main crop has been harvested. More important,
however, is the need to increase crop productivity. Past increases in
production have been obtained through the extension of cultivated areas
with only minimal improvement in yields. Further encroachment on the large
forest areas which are available will probably continue; but without
higher yields, incomes of farmers wrill continue to be depressed. There
are pressing needs for quality seeds which are responsive to fertilizers,
and for a price policy which provides incentives to use fertilizer.   There
is also an urgent need to improve the marketing system, particularly for
food grains. Up-country drying and storage facilities are inadequate and
thus reduce prices to farmers - particularly at harvest time. Inadequate
port facilities are an obstacle to efficient export marketing.
16.       The manufacturing sector, which enjoys considerable protection,
is mainly oriented towards import substitution.   The rapid growth rate of



value added of nearly 11 percent annually during 1960-1969 slowed down to
7.5 percent in 1970.   The Plan expects continued growth at an annual
rate of 8 percent and a tripling of industrial exports from a low base
to pl65 million by 1976.   Major increases would come from a number of
industries concentrating on exports, including fruit and vegetable canning,
watch parts, wood products, as well as some industries, such as textiles
and cement, which produce both for the domestic and export markets.  The
planned production and export targets seem feasible if adequate export
incentives are provided and if measures are taken to raise efficiency by
reducing tariff protection.
17.       Distance from markets, both domestic and foreign, unfavorable
soil condition and problems of security have all held back development in
the Northeast, where per capita income is one-half of the national average
and only one-third of that of the Central Region (including metropolitan
Bangkok). Over the last 18 months considerable bilateral assistance and
Government resources have been devoted to the preparation of a Northeast
regional development plan.    The extent to which the Northeast plan dill
form the basis for Government policy and investment in the Northeast has
not yet been decided.   It is now recognized that a concentrated effort
to raise per capita income in the Northeast will require more than the
creation of infrastructure and the elimination of obvious marketing
bottlenecks.   In support of the national policy to diversify and increase
exports, emphasis is expected to be given to increasing production and
improving the quality of kenaf, cassava and ground nuts.  However, the
development of agro-business and manufacturing based on the region's own
resources will also be required.
18.       Family planning has made encowraging progress in Thailand. Although
it was unofficially initiated only some years ago, acceptance rates in
Bangkok and the provinces are already high.  Family planning is now offi-
cial policy of the Government and the Plan aims at reducing the population
growqth rate fron 3.1 percent in 1970 to 2.5 percent in 1976.  This target,
while ambitious, appears attainable provided the family planning program
receives the wholehearted support of the Government and the relatively
modest funds required.
19.       External gross capital requirements, official and private, are
estimated at $2h80 million in 1972-1976, compared to about $1740 million
in 1967-1971.   To avoid a heavy debt service burden, efforts are needed
to increase steeply the official capital inflow.  Major bilateral donors
(as well as the Asian Development Bank) are willing to consider increasing
lending to Thailand.   However, a major constraint to achieving the
considerably higher level of official capital inflows required to maintain
an adequate level of growth is the shortage of suitable projects designed
to implement the strategy of the Third Plan.  A great deal of effort will
be required to prepare projects in priority sectors such as agriculture
(together with supporting services and infrastructure) and education,
and possibly mining, industrial estates, urban development and provincial
water supplies.   Preparation of suitable projects will take time, partic-
ularly in the case -f rainfed agriculture, in -ibich the Bank is seeking
ways to assist Thailand.   In the meantLme, the main emphasis of Bank



- 6 -
lending in the next year or so will continue to be on lnfrastructure pro-
jects where there is a justifiable need for Bank assistance.
20.       Notwithstanding some deterioration in the balance of payments
and the prospective increase in debt service as a proportion of export
earnings, Thailand has a considerable margin of creditworthiness.   The
debt service burden can be mitigated if Thailand takes in time the necessary
measures to diversify and accelerate export growth and is able to increase
the share of official capital in overall external financing.



Part III - THE PROJECT
A. Sector Background
21.      In 1969 three public electricity authorities, the Yanhee ELectric-
ity Authority, the Northeast Electricity Authority and the Lignite kathor-
ity were merged to form the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand
(BIAT) with national responsibility for generating and transmitting power.
EGAT now accounts for 96% of Tha-land's electrical energy production.
Distribution is the responsibility of two publicly owned organizations,
the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial ELectricity
Authority (PEA). MEA services the Bangkok area while PEA is responsible
for distribution outside Bangkok, and, in areas not accessible to EGAT's
transmission, also generates electrical energy (30 of national production);
the remaining 1% is generated by private industrial plant.  In FY 19711/
71% of EDATIs total sales were made to MEA, reflecting the importance of
the Bangkok market, and 20% to PEA with the balance going to large individual
consumers; these percentages are likely to be maintained over the next
several years.  While EGAT comes under the Ministry of National Development
and MEA and PEA under the finistry of Interior, the authorities maintain a
close relationship and sector coordination and planning are satisfactory.
22.      As of December 1970 MAT had a generating capacity of 1,182 MW
of which about 38°% were hydro-electric and some 62%O thermal (oil, lignite,
gas and diesel). Although Thailand has an abundant supply of water the
number of hydro-electric sites of moderate capacity is limited and given
the scarcity of indigenous fuel resources, other than low grade lignite,
Thailand will have to depend, at least in the short term, on imported fuel,
at present oil. Oil exploration has begun in the Gulf of Thailand but it
is too early to assess the prospects. A potential source of power for
Thailand in the future would be hydro-facilities on the Mekong river and
its tributaries. An agreement has recently been signed between EGAT and
Electricite du Laos for sales cf power to EGAT from the Nam Ngum project
in Laos which is expected to begin operations in 1972. The large multi-
purpose projects on the Mlekong River, such as Pa Mong near Vientiane, which
are being studied under the auspices of the Mekong Committee, are sufficiently
far in the future to have no impact on Thailand's present power planning.
23.      The growth of power consumption has been rapid, averaging about
27% annually since 1961 with increases of about 30% in recent years, reflect-
ing the fast growth of the economy. With the present slowdown in the Thai
economy, the unusually high rate of growth of power consumption is unlikely
to be sustained in the short tem. Nonetheless, BGAT forecasts a 21%
increase in 1971 tapering off to 11.5' in 1977, an average of 15-5t0J for
the period. Demand is expected to increase from 926 t1W in 1971 to 2116 NW
in 1977.
1/ EGAT's fiscal year ends September 30.



- 8 -
EGAT regularly review#Js the power marl:et and bases its expansion program on
an analysis of system recquirements for ten years taking into account recent
results and trends in the economy and up-to-date information on industrial
development. Despite the uncertainties inherent in demand projections for
a rapidly evolving economy, EGAT's forecast of market requirements for the
period covered is reasonable as a basis for planning investment.
24.       In FY 1970 EGAT sold 3,856 gwqh, 50% more than in 1967, with a
maximum demand of 748 MU.  Sales are forecast to increase to 10,610 gwh
by 1977. The bulk of consumption is expected to continue to be in the
Greater Bangkok area wqhere most of the country's industry is located.
Power consumption for industrial uses increased at an average rate of 43%
between 1964 and 1969, and in 1970 represented about 62% of all power sales.
As a consequence, system load factor in 1970 was about 62.5%. About 60%
of the Bangkok population has access to electricity compared with about
17% of the population as a wqhole and 11% in the rural areas. The pace of
rural electrification has been generally slow and average per capita con-
sumption is low, about 85 kw7h. The Government plans to give rural elect-
rification greater attention in the Third Plan; it has recently initiated
a study to determine the sectoral priority, costs and methods of linking
electrification to an overall program of rural development.
25.       In order to meet system requirements betwieen 1971 and 1976 EGAT,
MEA and PEA plan to invest about $544 million in additional generating,
transmission and distribution facilities. EGAT plans to increase its
installed capacity from 1182 MoJ to 2542 MJ by the addition of 510 MET of
hydro capacity and 850 Yiw of thermal capacity at a cost of about 1337
million. The main hydro sources are units 1, 2 and 3 at the Sirikit Dam
with a total capacity of 375 MW- iwhich are now under construction.  The
main thermal source is the South Bangkok Station where units 2 and 3 (total
510 M-nW) are under construction and unit No. 4 (310 MU) which is to be financed
by the proposed loan. EGAT also plans to invest about $60 million in ext-
ensions and improvements of its transmission facilities.  During the same
period MEA and PEA together propose to invest about $145 million for trans-
mission and distribution facilities and a small amount for power generation.
About 37/% is expected to be financed from the three authorities' o-vm re-
sources and consumers' contributions and the balance of 63% from Government
loans and contributions (18%) and foreign loans and credits (45%).
26.       The statutes of the three authorities include identical pro-
visions that revenues should cover:
(i)  operating expenses, depreciation, interest and
bonuses for management and employees;
(ii)  amortization of debt in excess of depreciation;
(iii)  a substantial portion of the cost of expansion and the
provision for reasonable reserves.



- 9 -
2?.      These provisions have in general been conservatively applied and
for the sector as a w1hole, the piesent rate of return on net fixed assets
in operation is between 85 arid 10%.
B.  Project Aspects
The Borrower
28.      The project would be carried out by EGAT, which was established
in May 1969. The Board of Directors is appointed by the Council of Ministers
and consists of a Chairman and not more than ten other members. The General
Manager is appointed by the Board, subject to the approval of the Council of
Ministers. The management is good and the organization functions well.
At the end of FY 1970, EGAT had a work force of about 5,000 employees, of
whom approximately 14 percent were university graduates and slightly more
were graduates of vocational schools. The number of employees is about 10
percent higher than actual requirements because of the merger with YEA,
NEEA and LA. The staff surplus is expected to disappear as a result of
attrition and system expansion.
29.      The Bank has made five loans totalling $130 million to EGAT and
its predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority. Loan 175-TH of 1957
for $66 million helped finance the construction of the Bhumiphol Dam, a
multi-purpose project. Loan 333-TH of 1963 for $6.6 million helped finance
transmission facilities; Loan 406-TH of 1965 provided $6 million for the
installation of additional generating units at the Bhumiphol Dain, cons-
truction of transmission lines and the ex.pansion of substation facilities.
Loan 489-TH of 1967 provided $5 million to assist in financing additional
units at the Bhumiphol Dam, the construction of 450 km of transmission
lines and the installation of two transformers and equipment in Bangkok;
Loan 655-TH of 1970 was for $46.5 million and assisted in financing gener-
ating equipment to be installed at the Sirikit Dam (a multipurpose power
and irrigation project, partly financed under Loan 514-TH of 1967), a 310
Wr steam generating unit at the South Bangkok Thermal Station and 250 Km
of transmission lines.  The first three loans are fully disbursed and as at
September 30, 197T about ")6 million had been disbursed from Loan 655-TH.
South Bangkok Thermal Unit Mo. 4
30.      The project is the acquisition and installation of a 310 IIWJ oil-
fired thermal unit, Unit No. 4, at the South Bangkok power station located
about 10 km southeast of Bangkcok on the Chao Phya River, together with
related equipment and engineering and consultant services. The location
of the project is shown on the attached map. The South Bangkok power
station was designed for high-efficiency base-load service by EGAT's
consultants for thermal projects. Present plans are for the installation
of five units with a total capacity of 1,500 IMJ at this station.  Unit
No. 1 (200 INJ) was commissioned in December 1970 and Unit No. 2 (200 IN)
and Unit No. 3 (310 MW) are expected to come into operation in December
1971 and 1973, respectively. The timing of the installation of Unit No. 5
is being kept under review in the light of the demand for energy.



- 10 -
31.       Unit No. 4 would be identical to Unit No. 3, which wTas financed
under Loan 655-TH, and would be linked to the 230 KV Bangkok transmission
loop through extensions to the outdoor swTitchyard. Installation of Unit
No. 4 wdhich would involve the extension of foundations and structures
under construction for Units 2 and 3 iwould be carried out by EGAT with
the assistance of EGAT's consultants. Tle project is expected to be
commissioned in December 1975 and to be in full commercial operation by
January 1976.
Proiject Costs and Financing
32.       The total cost of the project is estimated at the equivalent
of $43.1 million, including duties amounting to $3.6 million. Cost esti-
mates are based on firm option prices obtained for the major items of
equipment (see para 34 below) and on FGAT's estimates for the civil works.
A contingency allowance of about 5% is included in the foreign exchange cost
estimate to cover possible increases in the costs of items other than major
equipment and fluctuations in exchange rates5 a 12% contingency is included
for possible increases in local costs.  Because the 4th Unit will be instal-
led at an existing site and wvill utilize a number of existing common ser-
vices the resulting unit cost is low at $127/KW.
33.       The foreign exchange costs of the project are estimated at
$28.7 million.  The proposed loan of $27 million would finance 96/ of
the foreign exchange costs and 63% of total project costs. EGAT proposes
to carry out the civil works which have an estimated foreign exchange cost
of $1.7 million with its own forces and without international competitive
bidding. Together with the balance of Loan 655-TH, the Bank iwould be
financing about 16% of EGAT's planned construction expenditures during
the project construction period 1972-1976. The balance of the funds re-
quired will come from internal cash generation (34%0), government loans
by way of deferred payments of duties (11%) and other loans and credits
(39%). The main features of the proposed loan are summarized in Annex
III.
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       Uhen EGAT requested bids for the major items of equipment for
Unit No. 3 it required bidders to include options for the supply of
identical equipment for Unit No. 4. The procurement procedures were in
accordance Tith the Bank's reouirements for international competitive
bidding and were carried out with the Bank's agreement.   EGAT holds an
option from Japanese suppliers, denominated in Yen, for the supply of
the 4th generating unit and iTith US suppliers for the unit control equip-
ment.  EGAT proposes to exercise the options which expire in lNovember 1971,
since the option prices would be lowTer than could be obtained from a new
round of bidding given recent trends in equipment prices. In addition
EGAT would benefit from standardization of equipment and the simplification
and consequential economies in engineering and construction. Procurement
of equipment other than the main generating and control equipment will be
on the basis of international competitive bidding except for minor components
required to be compatible iwith equipment now in use or on order for which the
total cost should not exceed $0.5 million.   Disbursements would be made
for the full foreign exchange cost of equipment imported and services



- ll -
provided. No disbursements w;ould be made for expenditures made before
the signLng of the propo3ed loan.
EDGAT's Fnancial Position
35.       EGAT's financial situation is sound. At the end of FY 1970,
EGAT's fixed assets amounted to about $356 million equivalent; these are
expected to more than double to about $870 million by the end of FY 1977.
During this period EGAT's debt/equity ratio is expected to improve from
59/L1 to 55/45 and the return on net fixed assets in operation to increase
from 7.8% to about 12% in 1975 and decline to 8.9%o in 1977 as the result
of commissioning of new plant in 1976 and 1977.
36.       Under Loan 655-TH EGAT agreed that tariffs wqould be set so
that at least 30% of its estimated investment costs could be financed
internally. This requirement would be retained for the proposed loan.
Although for the period 1970-1973 EGAT would fall just short of this
target, it is expected to contribute about 34% from internal sources
ever the period 1971-1977 and for that reason no adjustment in tariffs
is suggested. The debt limitation covenant under Loan 655-TH provided
that BGA? would not incur new debt in any year in excess of $20 million
equivalent without the Banks approval. However, in view of EGAT's siz-
able investment program and resulting borrowing needs this covenant would
be replaced by a requirement that BI'AT will not incur additional debt
unless maxinum total future debt service on debt drawn dow;n, together with
the debt to be incurred, is covered at least 1.4, times by internal cash
generation.  For the next five years debt service is expected to be cover-
ed betwzeen 1.5 and 1.7 times. Loan 655-TH provides that borrowings with
a tern of 5 years or shorter may not exceed the amount outstanding of
$5 million equivalent, without the prior approval of the Bank. This
requirement wqould be retained in the prorosed loan.
37.       mAT1s accounts are audited by the Govperrment Audit Council
.with the assistance of an irndependent accounting firm.
Projectustificad Rate of R-eturn
38.       The project forms part of BGAT's investment program for the
period 1971-1977 which is designed to meet the rising demand for elect-
ricity as discussed in the Sector Background section of this report and
provide a reasonable level of reserve capacity for the system. The ad-
ditional capacity to be provided by the project is needed to meet the
forecast market requiremerts at about the time it would come into service
in early 1976. There is no practical alternative method of providing this
or equivalent generating capacity by then. Only gas turbines or diesel
units could be installed in tine but neither would be suitable for base
load service, to wdhich the 4th Unit will be assignedQdue among other con-
siderations to their high operating costs. Following the commissioning
of the project in 1976 the systemcapability,excluding the small isolated
Southern area, would total 2,390 ?PJ against a system demand of 1,808 14W
leaving a provision for maintenance shut dow,n of 310 14 and a reserve of



- 12 -
272 MW, about 1l.k% of capacity. As there are no large seasonal vari-
ations in demand and hence no period which can safely be allocated to
maintenance, the reserve capacity together with the provision for main-
tenance shut down of the largest unit is reasonable.
39.        The internal financial rate of return on the project taking
into account cost savings realized from displacement of less efficient
generating plant, is about 23% after assuming a 50% increase in the cost
of imported fuel. If load groith should be only 90% of the level fore-
cast the rate of return would still be 22%.
40.        A detailed appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of the South
Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4L, Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand"
(PU75a, dated September 24, 1971) is being distributed separately.
Ecological Aspects
41.        No ecological problems are expected.  Ample supplies of cooling
water are available from the Chao Fhya River for use in the condensers of
the turbo-generator. As the volume of water required for this purpose is
small in relation to the total river flow, marine life would be unaffected
by the warm water discharge from the condensers. Although Thailand has not
yet established standards for contaminants emitted from industrial plants,
the boilers for all plants at the South Bangkok site have been especially
designed to provide for a high stack emission velocity (100 ft/second) so
that the plume height will be sufficient to ensure that waste boiler gases
will be sufficiently dispersed to maintain atmospheric contamination below
levels acceptable in other countries which have strict air quality stand-
ards.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand, the draft Guarantee Agreement between
the Kingdom of Thailand and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.  The draft agreements conform to the
normal pattern for loans for electric powier projects.
43.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
44.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
