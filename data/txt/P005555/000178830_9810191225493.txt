REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a Regional Electrification Project for the
Government of Syria. The Project is the first stage of the recently approved
ten-year (1978-1987) National Rural Electrification Plan aimed at extending
service from Etablissement Public d'Electricite (EPE) to all villages with
100 or more population. The Project consists of about 5,000 km of 20-kV and
380/220-V distribution lines and related equipment, about 70 MVA of distribu-
tion transformer capacity, and technical assistance, to serve approximately
900,000 people in 1,200 villages in 11 of the country's 14 mohafazat (admin-
istrative districts). Total cost of the Project is estimated at US$157.1
million of which US$74.2 million would be foreign exchange costs.
ii.       A Bank loan of US$40 million to EPE is proposed to cover 54% of the
foreign exchange cost of the Project. The remaining 46% would be covered by
a USAID loan through the Government. Local costs would be provided by the
Government and EPE. This loan would be the Bank's third loan for power
in Syria. The first was made in 1974 for the first 150-MW steam electric
Mehardeh unit. A second loan was made in 1975 for the second 150-MW unit at
Mehardeh. Both projects are progressing satisfactorily.
iii.      The project would extend electric service from the national grid
to several rural regions not yet supplied with central station electricity.
Project engineering and management will be by USAID-financed consultants
to be engaged before March 31, 1978. The consultants would also assist EPE
in developing adequate extension policies for new customer services in the
National Rural Electrification Plan. They would also develop detailed con-
struction schedules to be reviewed periodically by EPE with the Bank in
connection with project reporting requirements.
iv.       Contracts for the supply of equipment and materials financed from
the Bank loan would be awarded through international competitive bidding
(ICB). Because of wide geographical dispersion of project facilities and the
labor intensive nature of the work, it is unlikely that foreign contractors
would be interested in bidding on contracts for installation and erection.
Nevertheless these would be awarded through international competitive bidding
(ICB), except for about 20% to be done by EPE's own service crews (mostly
service drops and customer connections). Minor quantities of standard distri-
bution equipment and materials not to exceed a sum total of US$1,000,000 would
be procured under international shopping.
v.        The EPE interconnected system makes up almost the entire public
power sector in Syria. The recent rapid expansion of the transmission network
has virtually eliminated all previously isolated systems. The average annual
load growth rate for 1973-1976 was 20%/a. Load growth is estimated at 25%/a



- ii -
for 1976-1982, most of it coning from rapid development of Government industry
and agriculture. Peaking capacity is adequate up to 1985. An additional
steam electric generating station (2 x 150-1lW at Banias) is scheduled for 1982
to keep up with energy demands. In addition to the Project facilities, the
1977-1982 construction program also includes 1,900 km of 230-kV lines, 2,000
MVA of substation capacity, 2,800 km of 66-kV transmission, and 8,000 km of
urban and rural distribution lines.
vi.        EPE's accounting system is inadequate for an electric utility and
the first Bank loan to EPE (Loan 986-SYR) financed consultants (Arthur Young &
Co.) to study the accounting problems, and a uniform utility accounting system
was recommended. The recommended accounting system would be implemented
beginning July 1, 1978. EPE contracted an independent audit firm as agreed
in Loan 1144-SYR to audit the 1974 and 1975 financial statements. EPE has
appointed the sXme firm to audit the 1976 and 1977 financial statements and
the previous covenant regarding auditing arrangements would be repeated in
the proposed loan. Pre-1973 municipal accounts owed to EPE remain on the
balance sheet along with a large amount of overdue accounts receivable from
Government-owned organizations and the public sector. Agreement has been
reached with the Government to eliminate the debts and arrears and reduce
receivables to no more than 90 days billing by December 31, 1978.
vii.      Covenants in Loans 986-SYR and 1144-SYR provided that the Thawra
hydroelectric assets be transferred to EPE in the year in which generation
reached 1,000 GWh; this occurred in 1976. However, subsequent agreement was
reached to postpone the transfer of these assets to EPE to 1978 to allow
time to establish a reasonable value for these assets and to develop adequate
revaluation procedures. A rate of return of 9% on revalued assets as of 1978
was also included in the covenants of Loans 986-SYR and 1144-SYR. During
negotiations for the proposecl loan, the Bank agreed, at the request of the
Syrian Government, to defer implementation of the 9% rate of returni require-
ment until 1981. In the meantime the Government would pay EPE a cash contri-
bution to compensate it for the loss of revenue through deferring the 9%
requirement. In 1978, the subsidy would be 100% of the difference between
EPE's revenues from 1977 tariffs and the amount EPE would have obtained had
it raised its tariffs to a le!vel necessary to obtain a 9% rate of return. In
1979 such subsidy will not be more than 70% of the difference between 1977 and
required tariff levels; in 1980 no more than 40%. In 1981 and thereafter, EPE
would be required to earn 9% without the recourse to cash subsidies from the
Government.
viii.     EPE's construction program for 1978-1982 is estimated at LS 4.3 bil-
lion (US$1.1 billion). With annual revaluation of assets to reflect the
recommended procedure for revaluing assets based on replacement costs, and
to include effects of inflation, increases in tariffs will be required in
1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982.  The estimated earnings of EPE would provide
27% of the construction program from internal cash generation, 8% would be
financed by Government operating subsidy, an estimated 29% would be financed
by long term borrowings, Government equity contributions would amount to 35%,
and customer contributions would provide the remaining 1%. The Syrian economy
is severely strained, and will be under pressure to reduce the large outlay



- iii -
for Government grants to all sectors. Agreement was reached with the Govern-
ment that it will supply or cause to be supplied to EPE, under arrangements
acceptable to the Bank, all necessary funds to carry out EPE's 1978-1982
construction program.
ix.       The estimated rate of return on investment for the Project is 8.5%.
This is based upon an average revenue per kWh of 0.24 LS, the current tariff
paid by the customers of the isolated systems, which was used as a proxy for
the measurable benefits.
x.        Subject to agreement on the issues set forth in this report, the
Project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$40 million to EPE, on standard terms
for Syria -- 17 years including 4 years of grace. The establishment and ade-
quate staffing of a Project Unit and the appointment of consultants to start
implementing the recommended utility accounting system (including revaluation
of assets) and related organizational changes are conditions of loan effec-
tiveness.






SYRIA
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Syria on behalf of the Etablissement Public
d'Electricite (EPE) has asked the Bank to finance a Regional Electrification
Project which constitutes the first phase of Syria's ten-year National Rural
Electrification Plan. The Project consists of about 5,000 km of 20-kV and
380/220 volt distribution lines, about 70 MVA of distribution transformer
capacity, and technical assistance, to serve approximately 900,000 people in
1,200 villages in 11 of the country's 14 mohafazat (administrative districts).
The total estimated cost is US$157.1 million comprising a foreign exchange
component of US$74.2 million and US$82.9 million of local currency costs. The
foreign costs would be financed by a proposed Bank loan of US$40 million and
a USAID loan of US$34.2  million. The Government and EPE would cover the local
currency costs to coiaplete the Project's financing plan.
1.02      The proposed loan would represent the third Bank lending operation
for power in Syria. The first loan (986-SYR) was made in 1974 for the first
stage (150-M4W) of the Mehardeh steam electric generating plant, with co-
financing by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development. The second loan
(1144-SYR) made in 1975 financed a second 150-MW unit at Mehardeh. Both
projects are progressing satisfactorily. The first unit is expected to go on
line in 1978, and the second in 1979. Loan 1144-SYR also financed additional
substation capacity to allow better utilization of Thawra hydro generation.
1.03      EPE is making progress in changing from a Government agency to
an autonomous entity. Although slowly, gains have been made through the
institution-building components of the two previous Bank loans. The transi-
tion for the transfer of full responsibility to EPE for its own efficiency
has still some time to go.
1.04      The Project has been prepared following a feasibility study by
SOFRELEC (France) and an appraisal mission in May/June 1977 by Messrs. A. Roa
(Engineer), W.G. Hamlet (Financial Analyst), and I.I. Elwan (Economist). Mr.
W.F. Kupper (Engineer) also participated in the appraisal mission, as well
as Mr. E. Chittleburgh (Training Advisor) who contributed the sections on
training.
II. THE POWER AND ENGERY SECTOR
A. Power and Energy Resources
2.01      Oil, gas and hydropower are Syria's main indigenous energy resources.
Crude oil reserves amount to about 1,200 million tons, of which about one
quarter could be economically recovered under present technology and prices.
Oil exploration and development is progressing satisfactorily. Production of



- 2 -
crude oil reached 10.5 million tons in 1976. The oil production target for
1976-1980 is set at 52 million tons. Local processing of crude oil is also
being increased from 2.7 million tons/a (Homs refinery) to 8.7 million tons/a
with the start-up of a new refinery at Banias scheduled for 1978.
2.02      The Euphrates river is Syria's most important source of hydropower
and irrigation, comprising 88% of the country's water resources. Development
of the Euphrates Basin started with the construction of the Thawra Dam and
hydropower station near Tabqa, completed with USSR assistance in 1974.  In-
stalled generating capacity at Thawra is 8 x 100 M4W, and available annual
generation is expected to be 2,360 GWh until 1980. After 1980, water will be
pumped out of the reservoir for irrigation in increasing amounts every year,
thereby reducing the available energy by about 40 GWh/a. Aside from Thawra,
no other significant hydro development has been identified. A preliminary
study evaluated the merits of constructing a dam and a power station on the
Khabour river (a Euphrates tributary). However, up to the present, firm plans
have not been formulated.
2.03      Gas has been discovered in the Northeast near Souedie and in Jbesse,
directly to the South. Proven reserves are estimated at 14,000 million m3
(6,000 million m3 associated gas and 8,000 million m3 non-associated). Recover-
able reserves are estimated at up to 80,000 million m3. Gas has been produced
in association with crude oil in the Souedie fields since 1967. Although at
present this gas is flared, in the future most of it will be used for produc-
tion of petrochemicals and power generation. As part of an overall power
development study, SOFRELEC is currently conducting a gas utilization study
under the Second Mehardeh Project to help establish guidelines for optimum
utilization of gas resources. Preliminary results of the study support es-
tablishing a gas transmission network to supply petrochemical industries in
Western Syria in preference to power generation uses at the fields themselves.
No data is available on consumption of non-commercial fuels (animal dung,
waste wood, etc.). The UN World Energy Supply Statistics 1/ for 1971-1975
show 477 kilogram coal equivalent (kgce) as the per capita apparent consump-
tion of commercial fuels for Syria in 1975. Figures shown for comparable
neighboring countries are: Jordan, 408 kgce, and Turkey, 630 kgce. Heavy
fuel oil and light distillate (diesel) are the main fuels used at present
for generation of electricity. Some non-associated gas is also used for
power generation at the Souedie fields.
B. The Power and Energy Sector
History
2.04      Up to 1951 the electric power sector was in the hands of private,
local and foreign electric utility companies. Despite the fact that all pri-
vate holdings were nationalized in 1951, the sector lacked organization and
remained fragmented. It was not until 1965 that the sector was consolidated
1/   United Nations, New York, 1977.



under EPE. At first EPE was under the control of the Ministry of Petroleum,
Electricity, and Industrial Projects. In 1974 EPE was made an agency of the
then newly created Ministry of Electricity under Decree No. 94 of that year.
Organization
2.05      The Ministry of Electricity is still in the process of consolida-
tion. In principle, the Minister would be assisted by two Deputy Ministers,
one for Technical Affairs and the other for Legal and Financial. So far only
the Technical Affairs section of the Ministry is fully operational, although
still short of being completely organized and staffed. The Deputy Minister
for Technical Affairs serves as a close link to EPE, following EPE activities
on a day-to-day basis. Under this Deputy Ministry come training and research
departments still in their infancy. A construction company for transmission
and distribution Lines and substations is planned also under the Deputy
Minister for Technical Affairs, but no definite timetable has yet been estab-
lished. Recommendations by Arthur Young & Co. (AYC), US, the consultants for
the Management Study financed by the Bank under Loan 986-SYR, are aimed at
establishing a more effective relationship between the Ministry and EPE
(para. 4.02).
Existing Facilities
2.06      For all practical purposes, EPE represents the whole electric sector
in Syria (Annex 1) since continued extension of EPE's transmission and distri-
bution lines has progressively integrated most isolated loads. The average
annual growth of total sales for the EPE interconnected system for 1966-1976
was 15.4%/a. The 1976 peak demand was 327 MW and the total generation 1,459
GWh. Sales were 1,259 GWh, made up as follows: Domestic and Commercial, 500
GWh (40%); Private Industry, 350 GWh (28%); Government Industry and Services,
394 GWh (31%), and Irrigation, 15 GWh (1%). Average past growth rate for the
first three categories for 1966-1976 were: 13.5%/a, 17.5%/a, and 17.2%/a
respectively. Irrigation loads began in 1974 with 7 GWh and reached 15 GWh
(more than double) in 1976. Estimates for 1977 are 428 MW peak demand and
1,914 GWh generation. System expansion and development has been primarily
aimed at meeting the industrial load growth. Effective installed capacity in
the interconnected system in 1977 is 1,275 MW (Annex 2) not including captive
industrial plants (about 100 MW, mostly pipeline pumping). Taking into account
dry years, maintenance requirements, and other applicable contingencies, the
available generation is about 3,802 GWh (Annex 3). For 1977, hydropower is
expected to cover 85% of the total generation while steam 11%, and combustion
turbines and diesel sets for the remaining 4%. Additions of substation capac-
ity (mostly financed from Loan 1144-SYR) during 1977 will allow better utiliza-
tion of the available Thawra energy. In 1978, hydro generation is expected to
reach 89% of the total, with steam generation making up the rest. Recently-
completed construction increased the length of 230-kV lines to about 1,800 km.
The system also has about 1,500 km of 66-kV, 4,000 km of 20-kV lines, and
11,500 km of low voltage distribution lines. Standard low voltage distribution
is 3-phase, 4-wire, 380/220 V (except for older circuits, rated 127/220 V).



- 4 -
Rated frequency is 50 Hz. In 1976, the number of consumers in EPE's inter-
connected system reached 783,186 including 232,469 Latakia and Tartous
consumers transferred in bulk to the central system. Map IBRD 13059R shows
the EPE interconnected system.
Access to Electricity
2.07      Approximately 47% of the population had access to electricity in
1975 with an average per capita consumption of 160 kWh/a. This compares with
164 kWh/a in Jordan and 331 kWh/a in Turkey. The intense system expansion in
progress is aimed at making electricity available to 65% of the population by
1980.  Meanwhile, the average per capita consumption was estimated to have
increased to 250 kWh/capita in 1977. According to the 1970 11ousing Census,
84% of the urban population and 10% of rural population had access to elec-
tricity. The mission estimates these figures are now 80% and 20% respectively,
due to internal migration and continuing expansion of electric service to the
rural areas.
Training
2.08      The Ministry of Electricity and EPE are conscious of the need to
train additional manpower to keep up with system expansion plans. A signif-
icant step toward meeting those needs is the construction of a specialized
training center, "Institut Moyene d'Electromecanique", being established at
Adraa northwest of Damascus with Bank financial assistance (Loans 986/1144-
SYR). When fully operational in 1978, the Institute will be the focal point
of all sector training activities for lower and middle level technical and
administrative EPE personnel. The Institute is fully described in Annex 4.
USAID and other international agencies also assist in training programs for
higher level sector personnel, providing overseas training and wider choice
of subject matter than the Adraa training center. To improve manpower plan-
ning and personnel development in EPE, the Project includes 2 man-years of
consultant services to assist EPE's Assistant General Director for Engineer-
ing and Planning (also in charge of manpower development) in establishing
suitable policies for personnel selection and training.
Tariffs
2.09      EPE's tariffs, shown in Annex 5, differ from one area to another.
Tariffs generally comprise flat kWh rates for domestic and general lighting
connections, declining block kWh rates for smaller industrial and commercial
consumers, and time-of-day kWh rates for the larger industrial connections.
Average rates by class of customer are:
LS/kWh    USJ/kWh
Residential and Commercial                  0.192       4.86
LV Industrial                               0.130       3.29
HV Industrial                               0.055       1.39



-5-
Under Loan 986-SYR, EPE engaged Overseas Consultancy Services (OCS), UK, in
1975 to develop new tariffs based on marginal-cost pricing. A final report
has been received and recommendations and action to be taken for implementing
them have been discussed between EPE and the Bank.
Sector Finances
2.10      The present five-year development plan (1976-1980) allocates about
11% of the total plan to the electricity sector. The Government arranges the
external financing for the official development plan, through an agency of the
Ministry of Finance, the "Caisse de la Dette Publique" (CDP). CDP then assumes
responsibility for any resulting debt service and is also required to provide
all local funds as may be necessary for the Plan. This policy is expected to
be continued (para. 5.08). The EPE construction program (1978-1982) would be
financed by loans from the World Bank and the Arab Fund, and aid agreements
with the Federal Republic of Germany, USAID and other countries. Government
grants to EPE for the program would amount to 35%. EPE would finance 29% by
long term borrowings and 27% by internal cash generation and 8% would be
financed by Government subsidy (para. 5.13). Customer contributions would
amount to 1%.
C. The Development Program
2.11      Electric power for industry and irrigation figures prominently in
the Government's fourth Five-Year Plan (1976-1980). EPE had been committed to
a large expansion program to keep up with the new loads projected by the State
Planning Commission (Annexes 6 and 7). Government projections, however, have
been consistently over-optimistic in recent times. Start-up of several large
industrial loads have failed to materialize year after year since 1974. The
pattern was again followed in 1977: EPE had estimated 49% load growth, against
24% actually achieved. Recent cutbacks in Government industrial expansion
plans have resulted in downward revision of estimated load growth rates. Cur-
rent figures submitted by EPE during negotiations (Annex 8) show an estimated
average annual load growth of 18%/a for 1977-1982, compared to the 25%/a aver-
age load growth rate estimated earlier for 1976-1982. Following the Government
cutbacks, EPE is also reducing its development program, as far as practicable.
The modified EPE generation expansion program out to 1985 is shown in Annex 9.
Only plants committed or under construction, difficult to re-schedule due to
long construction lead-times, were retained in the program. Annex 10 shows the
projected energy balance. The new investment figures for 1978-1982 submitted
by EPE during negotiations (Annex 11) along with the modified load forecast add
up to LS 4,345 million (US$1,100.0 million). The investment program includes
also expansion of transmission and distribution capacity as needed by balanced
system development. Provided the Government maintains and fulfills the planned
investment committed to the electric sector (para. 2.10), EPE would be able to
carry out the needed system expansion, although, not without project management
assistance from consultants as is currently the case in Mehardeh (para. 3.10).



-6-
Generation Expansion
2.12       Aside from Mehardeh, planned for start-up in 1979, only one addi-
tional generating plant is included in current 1977-1985 EPE expansion plans.
This new thermal power station (2 x 150 M4W) is scheduled to start-up in 1983 at a
site near the Banias refinery on the Mediterranean.
Transmission Expansion
2.13       New 230-kV lines (1,900 km) and substation capacity (2,000 MVA) will
be added in 1977-1982 to ensure adequate transmission capacity, facilitate
economic dispatching of hydro and thermal generation, and eliminate existing
bottlenecks in substation capacity primarily at Aleppo. Ongoing expansion
of the 66-kV system (2,800 kni) is aimed at supporting plans for the expansion
of urban and rural distribution systems (13,000 km). Interconnections with
Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq are being studied for EPE by SOFRELEC under
Loan 1144-SYR.  A final repor t favoring regional interconnection was submitted
in January 1978.
Distribution
2.14       Undervoltages and frequent outages will be eliminated in planned
rehabilitation and reinforcing of existing distribution in Damascus and other
large urban centers. Ongoing rural electrification started in 1975 and extend-
ing to 1980 is aimed at connecting up some 800 villages near existing 20-kV
lines. All other construction will be within the recently approved ten-year
(1978-1987) National Rural Electrification Plan to connect the remaining
non-electrified villages withL 100 or more population.  It will be carried out
in three stages (1978-1981, 1982-1984, and 1985-1987), at a cost of about
US$522 million (in constant 1977 US dollars). In the Plan, electrification
construction priority was established in order of economic merit through a
feasibility report prepared by SOFRELEC under Bank financing (Loan 1144-SYR).
The Project covers the higher ranking 1,200 villages and is the first stage
of the Plan.
III.  THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01       The Project would extend electric service from the national grid to
about 900,000 inhabitants of the rural regions across the country. Adequate
supply of electricity would be made available for the first time to 150,000
rural households along with health care, education, communications, and other
infrastructure as part of the Government's drive for increasing agro-indus-
trial activity and improving the quality of life of rural Syria. The Bank's



- 7 -
institution building efforts initiated during the First and Second Mehardeh
Thermal Projects would be continued through technical assistance to improve
EPE's manpower development and training, and to develop adequate extension
policies for new customer services in the National Rural Electrification Plan
through the project consultants.
B. Description
3.02      The Project consists of about 5,000 km of 20-kV and 380/220 volt
distribution lines and related equipment, about 70 MVA of 20/0.4-kV distribu-
tion transformer capacity, street lighting, and 31 man-years of consulting
services for design engineering and project management. A training component
would provide two man-years of technical assistance to strengthen EPE's
capabilities in manpower planning and development. The Project facilities
would be located in 11 of Syria's 14 mohafazat (administrative districts) as
shown in Map IBRD 13060R.
C. Status of Engineering
3.03      Under the Second Mehardeh Project (Loan 1144-SYR), SOFRELEC completed
a feasibility study covering electrification of all rural areas in Syria,
arranged in order of economic merit. SOFRELEC also developed a preliminary
design, cost estimates, and technical specifications. Based on this informa-
tion, US engineering consultants .to be engaged by EPE with USAID financing
would develop detailed design and prepare bidding documents for the Project.
The USAID-financed consultants would also provide project management and
supervision, as well as revise the preliminary design -- which now appears
over-dimensioned, particularly for the 380/220-V system -- with the thought of
introducing cost reduction through design improvements consistent with inter-
national practices. The consultants would also assist EPE in developing
adequate extension policies for new consumer connections in the National Rural
Electrification Plan. To keep the Project on schedule, the consultants should
be engaged and start work as early as possible. The Bank has sent draft Terus
of Reference (Annex 12) to EPE and USAID. Appointment of the consultants
would be a condition of Bank loan effectiveness.
D. Cost Estimates
3.04      The estimated cost of the Project is US$157.1 million, of which
US$74.2 million would be in foreign exchange. The estimates are summarized
below, excluding interest during construction but including import taxes and
duties levied by the Government on EPE.

/1   Includes 0.3 million fcr technical assistance in manpower development
and planning.
3.05      The project cost is based on estimates developed by SOFRELEC and
reviewed jointly with EPE and the mission. The resultant average cost per
connection -- about US$1,050, based on 150,000 connections and including
import duties -- is not unreasonable, given the terrain difficulties expected
and the wide geographical dispersion of the project facilities. However, the
mission believes that there :is room for cost effective design improvements
(para. 3.03). Development of project costs is shown in Annex 13; the foreign
currency portion includes US$>9.6 million foreign exchange content of the local
expenditures. Import duties were estimated at 38% in line with data presented
by SOFRELEC in the preliminary feasibility report. Physical contingency was
assumed at 10% for both loca:L and foreign components to account for uncertain-
ties in material quantities and terrain difficulties. Price escalation was
estimated by the mission to be applicable to this type of project in Syria as
follows:

Materials                 Erection)

1980-1981                         7%                          8%



- 9 -
E. Financing
3.06      The proposed loan to EPE of US$40 million, together with parallel
USAID financing, would cover all foreign exchange costs of the Project. Bank
financing would be used primarily for the high voltage lines (20-kV) and dis-
tribution transformers, while the USAID funds would cover engineering consul-
tants' cost, most of the low voltage lines (380/220-V), and street lighting.
The proposed Bank loan would carry standard terms for Syria -- 17 years
including 4 years' grace. Local costs would be provided by the Government and
EPE. The Government would make its own contribution as equity increases to
EPE's capital. Interest during construction on the Bank loan (US$4.6 million)
is also expected to be covered by the Government and EPE.
F. Implementation
Responsibility
3.07      EPE would be responsible for project implementation assisted by con-
sultants. The consultants would also provide construction management for the
Project. EPE has established a Project Unit within the Rural Electrification
Department -- along the lines suggested in the May 1977 SOFRELEC report, the
Project Unit Manager participated in loan negotiations. Adequate staffing of
the Project Unit would be a condition of loan effectiveness. Within EPE the
Project Unit would coordinate with the ongoing transmission and substation
expansion program (para. 2.13) to ensure the timely completion of all 66-kV
lines and 66/20-kV substations related to the Project. The Bank reached
agreement with EPE to have EPE complete and place in operation all 66-kV lines
and substations needed to supply the Project, not later than December 31, 1980.
One year lead-time (1978) would be necessary for development of detailed
engineering bid processing and contracts' award. Construction would start in
1979 and be completed by the end of 1981.
Project Monitoring and Statistical Data
3.08      At present there is no comprehensive data acquisition program for
EPE's rural electrification statistics. Adequate statistical data is indis-
pensable for gauging the socio-economic impact of rural electrification and
for future planning. The Bank obtained agreement from EPE to monitor the
performance of the National Rural Electrification Plan along the lines shown
in Annex 12, Attachment I.
Construction Schedule and Implementation
3.09      The project facilities would be installed in the period 1979-1981.
Completed portions of the Project would be progressively energized from sub-
stations existing or under construction (para. 3.07). An estimated schedule



- 10 -
of activities is shown in Annex 14.  Close coordination of deliveries of
materials and equipment and field construction activities is essential. As
part of project management services, the consultants would develop detailed
construction schedules and suitable monitoring devices, including specifically
critical path schedules. EP]E has agreed to review these schedules periodic-
ally in connection with project reporting arrangements, and to inform the Bank
of action taken or to be taken to make sure the schedules are observed.
Risks
3.10      With project management being provided by consultants, no special
risks are foreseen in the implementation of the Project. This arrangement is
being used successfully in the first and second Mehardeh Projects, Loans 986/
1144-SYR, through SOFRELEC. No difficulties are foreseen in achieving the
75,000 customer connections estimated for the first three years. As in the
past, adequate arrangements would be made by EPE to assist financing of new
consumer connections if necessary.
G.  Procurement and Disbursements
3.11      Disbursement of the Bank loan would be for the c.i.f. cost of
imported items, for 100% of the foreign exchange cost of foreign consultants
and 70% of the total costs of other consultants for technical assistance in
manpower development, and for 35% of EPE's total expenditures for installation
and erection. The estimated disbursements from the proposed loan are shown in
Annex 15. The proposed closing date is June 30, 1982. Contracts for supply-
ing equipment and materials to be financed from the proposed Bank loan would
be awarded under international competitive bidding (ICB). Items would be
grouped to the extent practicable to form sizeable bid packages to permit bulk
procurement. Since no Syrian manufacturers are likely to submit bids, no
provision for local preference is necessary. Minor quantities of standard
distribution equipment and materials needed to match and line up new construc-
tion with existing facilities would be procured under "international shopping"
after inviting quotations from at least three manufacturers. Total cost of
contracts awarded under international shopping would not exceed US$1,000,000
equivalent. No retroactive financing is anticipated. Loan funds would be
completely disbursed for the Project.
3.12      Because of the widely scattered geographical distribution of the
project facilities and the labor intensive nature of the work, it is unlikely
that foreign contractors wou:Ld be interested in bidding for the installation
contracts. Nevertheless, these contracts would be awarded under international
competitive bidding (ICB). About 20% of the installation work, mostly service
drops and customer connections, would be done by EPE's own service crews.
Bid packages would be grouped by voltage levels -- one group for 20-kV lines
and distribution transformers (US$6.2 million), and the other for 380/220-V
work and street lighting (US$21.2 million). Each group could be awarded as a
single contract or in two or more subgroups to allow flexibility and promote



- 11 -
competition thereby favoring lower costs and prompt execution of the Project.
In the case of state-owned contracting companies, which under their charters
are exempt from normal supervision by the employer and from posting bid or
performance bonds, the Bank reached agreement with the Government and EPE to
make all contractors subject to supervision by the Project consultants on
behalf of EPE, and to require bidders to show the costs of bid and perform-
ance bonds separately in their bids, and to deduct the cost of such bid and
performance bonds before comparing and evaluating bids.
H. Environmental Impact
3.13      The work consists of extension of distribution lines in rural areas.
Therefore, following conventional practices there would be no significant
environmental impact.
IV. THE PROJECT ENTITY
A. Background
Ilistory
4.01      EPE was established in 1965 by Decree No. 8 to consolidate and
assume overall responsibility for the entire electric power sector in Syria.
Previously, the sector had been fragmented into several local and foreign
electric utility companies nationalized in 1951.
B. Organization and Management
Organization
4.02      As a result of the management consultants' report (financed under
Loan 986-SYR) by Arthur Young and Co., EPE is in the process of being reorga-
nized to improve managerial performance with introduction of up-to-date
electric utility accounting practices and broadened delegation of authority.
The new organization has been approved by EPE and the Ministry of Electricity
and is awaiting final Government approval shortly. To allow immediate imple-
mentation of urgently needed key reforms, the transition to the new EPE orga-
nization should take as short a time as possible. Accordingly the Government
agreed to revise EPE's organizational structure not later than December 31,
1978.



- 12 -
Management and Staff
4.03       The Board of Direc:tors is the highest authority in EPE and is pre-
sided over by the Minister of Electricity, or his Deputy for Technical Affairs.
A management advisory committee made up of EPE senior staff advises the General
Director on day-to-day decisions. The General Director is appointed by the
Prime Minister and serves also as a member of the Board of Directors. Other
Board members are appointed dlirectly by the Ministry of Electricity. All
appointments are for indefinite periods. Under the new organization, day-to-
day management will be in the hands of the General Director, as it is now, but
with increased delegation of authority to the next lower echelon:  a Deputy
General Director and five Assistant General Directors (see Annex 16).
4.04       EPE has about 13,000 employees, with a projection of 21,036 by 1980
(Annex 17). The projected increases are acceptable in view of the accelerated
development pLanned for EPE. At the request of EPE, the Project includes the
services of a manpower development advisor -- 24 man-months, US$200,000 -- to
work closely with the Assistant General Director for Planning and Engineering
(also in charge of manpower development) to draw up long range plans for per-
sonnel selection, training, and development. The present General Director
and members oi- his staff soon to fill the newly created Assistant General
Director posit:ions are all well trained, capable professionals. The proposed
reorganization should provide EPE with appropriate management in the face of
quickly expanding activities.
Training
4.05       Intensive training for Mehardeh power plant personnel is currently
being carried out with the help of the training center temporarily operating
at Hameh Power Station. Once the permanent buildings are completed, all
Institute act:ivities will be moved to Adraa (para. 2.08). EPE personnel will
have priority in the use of t:he facilities. Advanced training is also carried
on overseas under other programs.
C. Operations
4.06       All repair and rehabilitation work on power stations damaged during
the 1973 hosti lities has been completed.  Recently-added 230-kV lines and
substations have made it possible for the system to take up most of the avail-
able Thawra hydro generation, allowing shutdown of costly combustion turbine
generation. With the addition of Mehardeh, scheduled for 1978-1979, generat-
ing capabiliti es will be ampl]e to meet system energy needs up to 1982.  Because
of the large amount of generation installed at Thawra (8 x 100 MW), system
peaking capaci ty will not need reinforcing until 1985. System operation and
control are well coordinated through a central dispatch unit.
4.07       Good physical progress is being maintained in both the First and
Second Mehardeh Projects with the strong support from SOFRELEC. Other current
transmission, substation, and distribution construction projects although



- 13 -
directly under EPE project management are also provided with varying amounts
of external technical assistance from the donor countries (USSR and the
Democratic Republic of Germany). Because of the heavy project management load
already being carried out by EPE staff, project management by consultants has
been recommended for the Project (para. 3.03).
4.08      A new accounting system better suited to electric utility practices
than the existing system is to be implemented with the help of consultants.
Billing is already partially done with modern electronic data processing (EDP)
equipment and plans are underway to computerize eventually all billing and
accounting. Except for Government services, collection policies are effec-
tive. Most arrears are related to Government-owned industries and other offi-
cial dependencies. Quality of service is acceptable with minor problems of
unscheduled outages and undervoltages occurring from time to time in Damascus
and other older urban areas. However, corrective measures are underway (para.
2.14).
V. FINANCE
A. Past Performance and Present Position
Reorganization of Accounts
5.01      The present accounting records are kept in a number of centers
(Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, Latakia, etc.) where the levels of accounting skills
and methods vary considerably. Returns are sent only annually to the head
office in Damascus and the consolidated accounts are not produced until four
to six months after the close of the fiscal year. This makes it difficult
for the head office to control the accounting functions and to ensure the com-
pleteness and consistency of the consolidated accounts. Decree No. 21 issued
March 19, 1974 by the Ministry of Finance provides for a new uniform account-
ing system for all public establishments and national companies. EPE was
granted a postponement of adopting the new system until 1978. Consultants
were appointed under the first Mehardeh loan to study the accounting problems
and recommend a suitable utility type accounting system. A system expected
to satisfy the requirements of the Ministry of Finance, has been proposed by
AYC by making certain adjustments to the utility uniform systems of accounts
reports. The management of EPE and the Bank have agreed on the proposed
accounting system. Consultants would be appointed by EPE to implement the
recommended utility accounting system, including revaluation of assets, along
with the related organizational changes (see para. 4.02). Government and EPE
agreed to appoint the consultants and to begin the implementation of the new
accounting system by June 30, 1978, in view of the importance of their action
to improvement of EPE's organization, the appointment of consultants would be
a condition of loan effectiveness.

Balance Sheet
5.02      EPE's 1972-1976 balance sheets are shown in Annex 18.  Gross fixed
assets are stated at their 19368 values, the year when the accounts were con-
solidated for the 5 main cities. Smaller systems were brought in at the value
at which they were appraised on acquisition. New assets are included at cost
plus interest charged to construction. Asset values, including interest during
construction, should be restated in 1979 according to procedures to be agreed
for revaluing of assets as stated in para. 5.01.
5.03      Little construction was completed in 1972-1973.  Substantial work
was undertaken in 1974 on EPE.'s general distribution and combustion turbine
installations, resulting in a 373% increase in gross assets by the end of 1976
over 1972 on the basis of the revalued asset figures developed by the mission.
5.04      Consumers' outstancling electricity accounts reflect an overall aver-
age of 153 days at the end of 1976; the amounts unpaid are mostly accounts due
from Government-owned organizations, and from the public sector. Pre-1973
mrunicipal accounts amounting to LS 4.4 million are debts due from municipali-
ties of various small towns and villages, and are still outstanding. In 1975,
during negotiation of the second loan (1144-SYR), the Government stated that
arrangements had been made for settling past debts of municipalities and Gov-
ernment agencies for electricity supplied to them by EPE and for encouraging
prompt payment of electricity bills by them in the future. On August 1, 1977,
Presidential Resolution No. 110 established a Plenipotentiary Committee for
the settlement of inter-agency arrears. On August 17, 1977, the Prime Minister
issued instructions on the procedures to be adopted by the Committee and
directed that its work should be completed by January 31, 1978; this date was
subsequently extended to July 31, 1978. In connection with the proposed loan,
Government agreed that receivables should be reduced to no more than 90 days
billings by December 31, 1978, and that after that date receivables would not
be permitted to exceed 90 days billings.
5.05      The debt equity ratio for 1976 is shown as 12:88, reflecting the
treatment of interest-free funds advanced by the Government as equity (para.
5.18). Long-term debts increased from LS 46 million in 1972 to LS 194 million
in 1976 reflecting the Bank loans for HIehardeh, the Abu Dhabi Fund Credit,
the Kuwait Fund Loan and the promissory notes signed for financing the combus-
tion turbines.
Income Statements
5.06      EPE's income statements (Annex 19) show that net operating revenues
decreased from LS 20.4 million in 1972 to LS 9.5 million in 1976, with losses
of LS 28.3 million in 1974 and LS 18.1 million in 1975.  The decreases resulted
from restricted sales and the increased costs of generation from diesel and
combustion turbines installed to replace the steam capacity lost during the
war. EPE 's average sales prices for electricity increased from LS 0.121/kWh
in 1972 to LS 0.127/kWh (USd3.2/kWh) in 1976.



- 15 -
5.07      Under Loans 986-SYR and 1144-SYR, EPE agreed to maintain its overall
average electricity rates at a level not less than the rates existing as of
May 31, 1973 until December 31, 1977, and from that date EPE should earn a
return of not less than 9% on revalued average net fixed assets in operation
including the Thawra Hydroelectric assets (but see paragraph 5.11). The
impact of additional costs and lost revenues resulted in the rate of return
dropping from 12.5% in 1973 to the losses in 1974 and 1975 and a return of
only 1.6% in 1976.
B. Future Performance
Construction Program
5.08      The cost of EPE's construction program (para. 2.11) is estimated at
LS 4.3 billion for 1978-1982. Gross fixed assets (revalued) will amount to an
estimated LS 7 billion by 1982 (US$1.8 billion). The program as approved by
the Government represents a strong commitment on the Government's part to the
expansion of EPE. In addition to the standard covenant to guarantee funds to
complete the Project, the Government agreed to supply or cause to be supplied
to EPE, under arrangements acceptable to the Bank, all necessary funds to
carry out the expansion program as presently planned.
Future Operating Results
5.09      EPE's lack of action of gradually increasing tariffs to offset
restricted sales and increased costs of generation (para. 5.06 and 5.07)
resulted in net operating losses in 1974 and 1975. Electricity generated by
the Thawra Hydroelectric facilities eased substantially the operating costs
for 1976 and resulted in a small net operating profit. On the basis of pre-
sent forecasts of sales and available generation, and estimates of operating
costs, the overall average sales price of electricity must be increased from
the present estimated average of LS 0.134/kWh to approximately LS 0.233/kWnh by
January 1, 1981, to earn a 9% rate of return on average net fixed assets in
service, including the Thawra Hydroelectric assets (see para. 5.11). Under
Loan 1144-SYR EPE is required to revalue its assets on revaluation principles
to be agreed between EPE and the Bank. Since actual revaluation can be
implemented only in conjunction with the installation of the new accounting
system (para. 5.01), which will require time, revalued assets would be used
for rate of return calculations starting in 1979 (para. 5.11).
5.10      Operating expenses are primarily depreciation and labor; labor costs
are increasing substantially due to the expansion program of EPE requiring
trained operators and additional employees. Inflation is estimated to increase
labor costs at an annual rate of 8%. At the present time EPE enjoys the bene-
fits of below-world-market fuel prices resulting from the Government's national
policies for pricing the indigenous oil resources. To avoid financial losses
that could result from possible future changes in the Government's fuel pricing
policies, the new tariffs from the tariff study (para. 2.09) should provide for
automatic adjustments of rates to reflect any increases in the fuel prices, as
was stated in the Terms of Reference for the Tariff Study under Loan 986-SYR.



- 16 -
Rate of Return Covenant
5.11      Loan 1144-SYR provided that EPE should earn a 9% rate of return on
its net fixed assets starting in 1978. However, during loan negotiations for
the proposed loan, the GovernLment informed the Bank that, while it was not
averse to the principle of inLcreasing tariffs in due course, it was not ready
at this time to commit itself to any specific increase in 1978. Following an
analysis of the financial implications of the Government's position both at
the level of the sector and at the level of the Government's budget, it was
agreed that EPE's attainment of a 9% rate of return calculated on the basis of
its revenues from electricity tariffs would be deferred until 1981. Until
then, the shortfall in EPE's revenues would be made up by a Government subsidy.
During 1978, the Government will make a cash contribution to EPE equal to the
full difference of EPE's revenues from the 1977 tariffs and the amount that
EPE would have obtained had it raised its tariffs to a level necessary to
obtain a 9% return on its net fixed assets in operation. In 1979 the cash
contribution should not exceed 70% of the difference between revenues that
would have been generated if the 1977 tariffs still applied, and revenues that
would have been obtained had EPE applied tariffs sufficient to generate a 9%
return on properly revalued net fixed assets in operation. In 1980 the cash
contribution would not exceed 40% and in 1981 EPE would be required to set
tariffs at a level sufficient to generate a 9% return without recourse to any
subsidy. Moreover, it was agreed that EPE will prepare a satisfactory pro-
gressive rate structure for Ihousehold electricity consumption by defining the
first block of consumption thiat should benefit from the lowest rates. EPE's
proposal will be completed by September 30, 1978, and implemented no later
than January 1, 1979. EPE has also agreed to prepare, before September 30
each year, a review, satisfa,-tory to the Government, made on the basis of
realistic forecasts which shall demonstrate the adequacy of its electricity
tariffs to enable it to meet its rate of return covenant in the succeeding
year. A copy of this review will be sent to the Bank upon its completion.
The covenant as now modified will permit EPE to finance approximately 13% of
its construction costs from net internal cash generation in 1978, when the
subsidy will be 100% of the rate deficiency, and 45% in 1981, the first year
when there will be no subsidy.
Financing Plan and Funds Statement
5.12      EPE's sources and applications of funds statements for 1978-1982
are shown in Annex 21. They assume a Bank loan of US$40 million at 8% over
17 years with a 4 year grace period for the Project. Also assumed is USAID
financing of US$34.2 million at 2% over 40 years with a 10 year grace period.
Existing foreign currency promissory notes and Bank loans for Mehardeh amount
to US$133.2 million. Government grants equivalent to US$392 million are
required for the financing of the 1978-1982 construction program. EPE is in
the course of negotiating loans to cover 97% of the foreign exchange costs
of the Banias generation project. These loans, totalling LS 689.1 million,
would be from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, the Arab Fund for Development,
the Abu Dhabi Fund, the Saudi Fund and the Islamic Bank. The financing plan
is summarized as follows:

5.13      The plan shows that EPE would be able to finance through internally
generated funds 27% of its construction program for 1978 through 1982. The
financing plan, which assumes tariff increases effective January 1, 1979, 1980,
1981 and 1982 is estimated to provide net cash from internal resources amount-
ing to US$310.4 million. The rate increases, although large, reflect the fact
that electricity tariffs have not changed substantially since 1973 and infla-
tion in these years has been high. At the present rate of exchange the aver-
age retail electricity tariffs would amount to 3.6 USJ/kWh in 1978 and 4.0
USJ/kWh in 1979, which would not be considered excessively high for these
years, compared to approximately 7 USJ in Jordan and Turkey in 1978. Allow-
ing for an estimated 8% annual inflation rate from 1980-1982 the real price
trend of electricity prices would be only about 6%/a increase reflecting the
cost of debt service on the construction program.



- 18 -
5.14      The 1978-1982 consitruction program is much greater than ever before
undertaken in the electricity sector. Syria has given priority to the devel-
opment of the electricity sector to restore the facilities lost in the war
and to develop the economy by providing this essential source of energy. The
financing plan assumes that 35% of the construction program would be financed
by Government grants (US$392.4 million).
5.15      Governmient capital contributions to EPE are interest-free but are
termed "development loans" under Syrian Law. Since the bulk of the contribu-
tions are unlikely ever to be repaid in view of EPE's continuing need for
expansion, the Government's capital contributions are treated as increases in
equity in the balance sheet and for the purposes of the debt service covenant.
Forecast Balance Sheets
5.16      The most significant change in the forecast balance sheets during
the 1978-1982 period is the rate of growth of fixed assets in operation from
LS 1.4 billion in 1977 to LS 5.2 billion by 1982 (7.1 billion, as revalued by
the mission). There is also a substantial increase in the long-term debt of
EPE which increases from LS 399.6 million in 1977 to LS 1,471.8 million by
1982. This reflects the financing of EPE's expansion program from sources
other than the Government. Tlhe debt equity ratio remains about constant at
20:80 for 1978-1982 and indicates low borrowings, but the classification of
government contributions as equity distorts the ratio. The estimated debt
service coverage for the period 1978-1982 is approximately 3.8.
5.17      The total accounts receivable from consumers as of 1976 is rather
large.  Pending Government action (para. 5.04), however, it is assumed that
the overall level of electricity accounts owed by consumers will fall from the
present 153 days to no more than 90 days by the end of 1982. Inventory levels
reflect the normal expansion of materials required to sustain the enlarged
operations of EPE.
C. Accounts and Audits
Accounts
5.18       Foreign exchange funds for EPE's projects included in the official
development plan are provided through CDP (see para. 2.10). Foreign long-term
debts are shown in EPE's balance sheet separately only if a promissory note
has been issued to the lender,. All other long-term debt is included under the
heading of "Government Construction Grants". This is the Government current
or CDP account; no interest is paid on these amounts.
Audit
5.19       EPE's financial statements for 1974 and 1975 have been audited by
the firm of Talal Abu-Ghazeleh (Kuwait) who are acceptable to the Bank. This
firm has been appointed auditors for the 1976 and 1977 accounts.



- 19 -
D. Insurance
5.20      Insurance of EPE's major assets against the usual hazards of fire,
explosion, third party, etc. is effected through the Syrian Insurance Company,
the sole Government insurance agency. Although the present insurance is
considered to be adequate, EPE has agreed to review its general insurance
practices with the assistance of qualified consultants (probably insurance
underwriters) to determine any changes to existing coverages and related
inspection and safety aspects necessary to comply with sound public utility
practice, and to submit the results of such a review by June 30, 1979, to the
Bank to enable it to comment on any recommended changes.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Load Forecast
6.01      The load forecast for the Project facilities and the ten-year rural
electrification plan are the same, since the Project constitutes the first
phase of the plan. The forecast comprises the demand for electricity for
rural domestic use, public lighting, small commercial enterprises and street
lighting (Annex 22, Attachments 2, 3 and 4). The potential power demand for
agro-industries is not addressed because of the absence of a development plan
for the sector from which future loads can be extracted. Meanwhile, private
irrigation pumping in Syria depends primarily on diesel fuel as a source of
energy. This dependency stems from the prevailing pricing policy which under-
values energy resources relative to their respective opportunity costs to the
economy. If the price of diesel fuel is not increased to reflect its scarcity
relative to the residual oil used by EPE generating plants, there would be no
financial incentive for private irrigation pumping to switch to electricity.
Since there are no indications that an increase in diesel prices will be
forthcoming, at least until the power development study (para. 2.03) is com-
pleted, the load forecast does not include private irrigation pumping as a
component (public irrigation pumping is included in the forecast of demand
faced by EPE's system). In view of the impact of irrigation pumping on the
Project, the Government was asked during negotiations to discuss the power
study and the changes required for the implementation of a comprehensive fuel
pricing policy. However, since data on which to base pricing policy for the
entire energy sector is still insufficient to enable the Government to form
any decisions on pricing policy, after reviewing the consultant's report on
the energy sector and after collecting the data required for policy formula-
tion, the Government is expected to initiate action to gradually achieve a
more efficient allocation of energy resources through pricing over the next
five years.
6.02      The forecast of demand for the Project is based on three parameters
or averages that are determined from samples because of the absence of compre-
hensive village statistics (Annex 22, Attachment 1). These parameters are:



- 20 -
(a) initial rate of connections;
(b) initial consumption level, and
(c) the rate of growth of demand.
6.03      The initial rate of connection refers to the number of subscribers
that are provided service in the first year of electrification, once the
village is electrified. The initial connection rate for the Project is set at
50%, except for the villages in the Mohafazat of Aleppo and Idlib with a rate
of 48% and the Mohafazat of I)eraa and Soueda with a rate of 38% (Annex 22,
paras. 3 and 4).
6.04      The initial consumption level refers to the average consumption per
subscriber in the first year of electrification. There are differences between
the consumption level of the publicly supplied villages and the villages sup-
plied by isolated systems. However, the consumption data of the forecast is
that of the publicly suppliecl villages because they are more indicative of the
consumption patterns of the consumers supplied from the centralized grid. The
average consumption level assumed is 300 kWh/year/connection or 50 kWh/year/
capita (Annex 22, paras. 5, 6, 7).
6.05      The following varying pattern of growth over the 30 years was assumed
in deriving the load forecast for the Project:
Years              1     2      3     4      5      6     7      8     9      10-30
Rate of Growth
in %             55    35   27.5  22.5  20.0  19.0  18.0  17.0  16.0           14.0
To facilitate the analysis an equivalent constant rate of growth of 18.2%/a
was used. The constant annuaL growth rate was selected such that it would
yield a present value of the benefit stream equal to the present value of the
benefit stream for varying ratles of growth. The scenario for load growth is
supported by the experience cif other developing nations where the growth rate
in countries with less than 10 years of electricity services is 31.3%, while
it is 17.0% in countries with, more than 10 years of service (Annex 22, paras.
8, 9, 10).
B. Least Cost Alternative
6.06       Since the Project will extend electricity to 1,200 villages, the
comparison of alternatives for each village included in the Project is vir-
tually impossible. Instead, the comparison will be formulated in terms of a
break-even relationship between the two alternatives (isolated system versus
connection to the central gricl). The relationship will be a function of the
distance of a village with 500 inhabitants from the nearest source of centrally
supplied power such as a substation or another electrified village (Annex 24,
para. 1.02).



- 21 -
6.07      The distance at which the cost associated with the two alternatives
break even for a village of 500 inhabitants is 18.2 km. This implies that, if
the distance between a village of 500 inhabitants and the nearest source of
centrally supplied electricty is more than 18.2 km, the least-cost alternative
for its electrification would be through local generation. The break-even
distance would increase as the population of the village increases.
6.08      Since, (a) the distance between any of the villages in the Project
and the nearest source of centrally supplied electricty is about 11.2 kilo-
meters, and (b) 90% of the villages in the Project have a population greater
than 500 inhabitants, it is possible to conclude that the Project is the least-
cost alternative to electrifying 1,200 villages.
C. Return on Investment
6.09      The return on investment is calculated for both the Project and the
ten-year Rural Electrification Plan.  These are presented in turn below.
I.  Return on the Project
6.10      The return on investment in the Project is 8.5%.  It is based on a
proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay 0.24 LS/kWh (US$0.06/kWh) which is
currently being paid by the rural customers supplied by the isolated systems.
A cost of 0.14 LS/kWh (US$0.035/kWh) is charged to the Project for each kWh
delivered to the end users. This represents the cost incurred by EPE in gen-
erating and transmitting the power consumed by the rural customer (Annex 23
and Annex 25, para. 3). The return on the investment is more sensitive to
changes in the tariff level than to changes in the cost of producing the power.
A decrease of 13% in the tariff level (a reduction of the tariff from 0.24
LS/kWh to 0.21 LS/kWh) reduces the rate of return on the Project to 6.1%,
while an increase of 13% in the cost of the power delivered to the rural
customer lowers the rate of return to 7.1% (Annex 24, para. 11).
6.11      The rate of 8.5% constitutes the minimum return on investment because
electricity tariffs in Syria are heavily subsidized. The rate of return would
also increase if private irrigation pumping would be connected to the public
grid. At the moment, Syria's private irrigation pumping uses diesel as its
principal energy source because its price is heavily subsidized. The subsidy
is of such a magnitude that, relative to the prevailing undervalued electricity
tariff, it would be financially unattractive to switch to electricity. If
energy resources are priced to reflect their respective opportunity cost to
the economy and since irrigation pumping can be accommodated in off-peak
periods, the benefits associated with the Project will be substantially
increased because of the increased use of electricity for private irrigation
pumping. Electrically driven irrigation pumping need only be charged energy
cost and no capacity cost because there is excess available capacity during
off-peak periods and marginal cost pricing dictates that such consumers should



- 22 -
not pay capacity cost. The consultants (SOFRELEC) for the power development
study are presently assessing the impact of increased fuel prices on the
development of the subsector, including irrigation pumping. It is expected
that after review of the study and the collection of additional necessary
data on the energy sector, the Government will initiate steps to achieve over
the next five years a more efficient allocation of energy resources among the
energy subsectors.
II. Return on the Rural Electrification Plan
6.12      The return on investment in the ten-year rural electrification plan
is 4.5%. This is based on an average revenue of 0.24 LS/kWh and a cost of
0.14 LS/kWh for each kWh produced by EPE and delivered to the rural customer.
Since the villages with relatively large benefits were included in the first
phase, the rate of return on the Project is higher than that on the plan.
The rate of return on the plan is low because the prevailing tariffs do not
cover the economic cost of the resources used in producing electricity.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOM4ENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following principal
issues;
(a)  EPE agreed to complete and place in operation all 66-kV lines and
66/20-kV substations needed to supply the Project, not later than
December 31, 1980 (para. 3.07);
(b)  EPE agreed to monitor performance of the National Rural Electrifi-
cation Plan along guLidelines suggested by the Bank (para. 3.08);
(c)  EPE agreed to review critical path schedules periodically in con-
nection with project reporting arrangements, and inform the Bank
of action taken or to be taken to ensure the schedules are observed
(para. 3.09);
(d)  EPE agreed to require all contractors to submit to supervision by
the project consultants on behalf of EPE; and all bidders to show
the cost of bid and performance bonds separately in their bids
(para. 3.11);
(e)  EPE agreed to revise its organization structure not later than
December 31, 1978 (para. 4.02);
(f)  EPE agreed to reduce accounts receivable from the sale of elec-
tricity to no more than 90 days by December 31, 1978 (para. 5.04);



- 23 -
(g) the Government agreed to supply or cause to be supplied to EPE,
under arrangements acceptable to the Bank, all necessary funds to
carry out the expansion program as presently planned (para. 5.08);
(h) EPE agreed to maintain the 9% rate of return covenant previously
agreed in Loan 1144-SYR including cash subsidies from the Govern-
ment in 1978, 1979 and 1980 (para. 5.11); and
(i) EPE agreed to review its present insurance practices and submit
the results to the Bank by June 30, 1979 (para. 5.20).
7.02      The Project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$40 million to the
Etablissement Public d'Electricite with the Guarantee of the Government of
Syria. The standard terms for Bank loans to Syria of 17 years including four
years of grace are appropriate. The loan could become effective within six
months of loan signing; engagement of project consultants (para. 3.03) and
adequate initial staff of the Project Unit (para. 3.07); the engagement of
accounting consultants and the beginning of the new accounting system (para.
5.01) would be conditions of effectiveness.

REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Intermediate Institute at Adraa
1.        In December 1975, by Presidential decree, an Intermediate Institute
of Electro-mechanical Engineering was established at Adraa on the northern
outskirts of Damascus. The need for such a specialized Institute arose from
the shortage of suitably qualified technicians and skilled workers entering
the labor market from the technical education system administered by the
Ministry of Education. In addition, much of the job-related training required
to enable staff to perform effectively in thermal generating plants, substa-
tions, dispatch centers, etc., cannot be obtained in the school system.
2.        When fully operational during 1978, the Intermediate Institute will
have a capacity of 390 trainees and will produce an annual output of 580
skilled workers, technicians and supervisors. Of these, approximately half
will be newly-recruited staff, while the remainder will be existing staff
benefiting from re-training as part of a comprehensive career development
program.
3.        The Institute will form the focal point of all future staff develop-
ment in EPE, and will offer training programs in:
(a) thermal power station operation;
(b) system control, measurement, instrumentation, protection,
dispatching;
(c) high and low tension distribution;
(d) administration and management; and
(e) accountancy and financial administration.
4.        Courses for new staff joining EPE with a Diploma of Industrial
Studies (Baccalaureat Technique) will be of two years duration. There will be
three intakes of 75 per year. Following a 20-week common syllabus in which
the theory of three-phase systems, electrical machines, thermodynamics and
mathematics are thoroughly covered, the trainees will be separated into the
following specializations, based on preference and aptitude:

(i) thermal power plant;
(ii) system control and protection;
(iii) transmission and distribution.
The exact numbers entering each category being finally determined by the man-
power planners in EPE. Each specialized course will consist of three stages
of study in the Institute (5()% of which time will be devoted to practical
work) interspersed with periods of attachment to power stations, substations,
dispatch centers or distribution teams as appropriate.
5.        New staff entering EPE with a general secondary education (Bac-
calaureat) will follow a program consisting of four stages of study at the
Institute totalling 80 weeks, interspersed with periods of up to 8 weeks
attached to the financial/accounting sections in EPE. The syllabus, aimed
at producing competent staff in these areas, will concentrate on economics,
financial analysis, commercial principles, management, office machinery, data
processing and accounting procedures. There will be three entries per year,
each of 25 trainees.
6.        New staff holding a school certificate of preparatory studies (Brevet)
will all be trained for techn:ical positions as skilled workers. Consequently,
their program will be shorter (one year) and contain more practical than theo-
retical content. Preventive maintenance skills, fault-location and correction,
house wiring installation, cable-joining as well as basic metal-working skills
will be taught. Three entries are planned each year, each of 30 trainees.
7.        Up-grading courses, aimed at improving the performance of existing
staff (who have mostly received no specialized training) will represent an
important part of the Institute's work. EPE's present work force suffers
from low morale resulting fromi poor personnel policies and the almost complete
absence of a career-development policy through which able workers can have
access to training leading to promotion. It is planned to conduct seven-week
courses in all the specializations described above, catering for an annual
through-put of 100 trainees.
8.        The creation of the Institute has been a joint effort between the
Government, which has financecl the construction costs, the Bank, which has
included US$1.0 million for training equipment including a thermal power
plant simulator in previous loans, and French technical assistance, which has
provided expatriate instructors to establish the courses, as well as training
in France for Syrian instructors.
9.        The relationship between the Institute and the country's education
system is shown on page 3 of this Annex.

SYRIA
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference for
Consulting Services for
Engineeringw Design and Project Management
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Etablissement Public d'Electricite (EPE) is responsible for the
supply of public service electricity throughout Syria.
1.02      These terms of reference outline the purpose and scope of consulting
services required by EPE for a Regional Electrification Project. The Project
is part of a ten-year National Rural Electrification Plan recently approved to
provide central station electricity by 1987 to all villages with 100 or more
population.
II. GENERAL
2.01      The National Rural Electrification Plan covers about 5,000 villages
all over the country. Total poulation to be covered by the Plan is about
3,800,000 taking into account a 3%/a rate of population growth.
2.02      The Plan was formulated following a feasibility report by Consultants
(SOFRELEC, France) with World Bank financing. The Plan is programmed to be
carried out in three stages: 1978-1981, 1982-1984, and 1985-1987, at a
total estimated cost of $522 million (in constant 1977 US dollars).
2.03      The Project is the first stage (1978-1981) of the Plan.  It will
extend central station service to approximately 1,200 villages, at an esti-
mated cost of US$157 million (including price escalation).
III. OBJECTIVE
3.01      The Consultant would assist EPE in preparing bid documents and
specifications and completing engineering designs based on material quantities
and cost estimates developed during project appraisal. The Consultants would
encourage maximum participation of EPE's personnel in all aspects of the



- 45 -
ANNEX 12
Page 2 of 5
consultants' work, through a Project unit to be established within EPE's Rural
Electrification Department specifically for this purpose.
3.02      In addition to the engineering, supervision, and management services,
the Consultant would also assist EPE in developing adequate service extension
policies for new customer services within the National Rural Electrification
Plan.
3.03      Close work with the Consultant on the Project i.s expected to
strengthen EPE's Rural Electrification Department and develop the skills of
local personnel to contribute increasingly to the planning and execution of
subsequent stages in the Plan.
IV. SCOPE OF WORK
4.01      USAID will f-inance the US dollar cost of the engineering consulting
service contract for the Phase I Program (1978-1981). During joint discus-
sions in Damascus attended by EPE, IBRD, and USAID, it was agreed that a
single consultant would be used for services covering the total Phase I
Program, including the medium tension and low-extension distribution systems.
This not only will reduce the complexity of contract management by EPE, but
will ensure appropriate coordination design and construction functions,
smooth the construction consumable procurement process for both IBRD and
USAID.
4.02      The contract will be a host-country contract, and include the
following:
A.   Design Review and Bid Preparation
1.   Review the low-tension distribution design, and recommend cost-
effective alternatives, if any. Of particular importance during
the design review stage is the study of SOFRELEC's low-tension
distribution design recommendations. It is possible that some
significant reduction in per-village costs can be realized if
a single-phase system based on appropriate international
standards is utilized in some villages rather than the three-
phase system recommended by SOFRELEC. If another alternative
is defined by the USAID financed consultant and is acceptable
to EPE and IBRD, it is possible that more than the projected
1,200 villages could be electrified by the Project.
2.   Recommend a final list of villages to be electrified during
the Phase I Program.
3.   Based on 1 and 2 above, prepare final system design and complete
equipment and materials take-off and cost estimates.



- 46 -
ANNEX 12
Page 3 of 5
4.   Prepare detailed implementation schedule for overall Phase I
Program.
5.   Review completed and planned high tension distribution system
(230-kV lines, 230/66-kV substations, 66-kV transmission and
66/20-kV substations) to verify technical adequacy and avail-
ability for providing power to the Project.
6.   Prepare equipment and materiel IFB's for Phase I of the Program
(IBRD and AID-finaLnced), assist EPE in the bid evaluation of
supplier bids, ancl recommend award to EPE. Documents for IBRD
financed procurement will be in accordance with the latest
World Bank Group "Guidelines for Procurement".
7.   Advise EPE on preparation of construction contract IFB's for
the Phase I Program, assist EPE in the analysis and verification
of bids, and recommend awards.
B.   Construction Management and Supervision
1.   Assist EPE in identification of suitable storage space for
imported construction consumables.
2.   Establish and implement an inventory control system for equip-
ment and materiel receipt, storage, and issuance to construction
contractors.
3.   Establish a Phase I Program accounting system compatible with
EPE's overall accounting system being installed following
recommendations by the Management Consultant financed by the
IBRD.
4.   Supervise construction of Phase I Program works.
5.   Assist EPE in preparation of Project Completion Report to
fulfill IBRD requirements.
C.   Strengthening EPE's Rural Electrification Department
I.   Assist EPE in deve:Loping effective policies for extension of
services to new customers in the National Rural Electrifica-
tion Plan, compatible with acceptable technical, financial,
and socioeconomic criteria.
2.   Make optimum use of human and material resources allocated by
EPE for the Project. through the Project Unit in EPE's Rural
Electrification Department. The Consultant shall encourage
maximum possible participation by EPE personnel in all Project
activities under the Consultant.

3.   Assist EPE in developing and establishing a monitoring system
to measure and analyze the performance of the National Rural
Electrification Plan along the lines suggested in Attachment 1.
V. CONTRACT PERFORMANCE
5.01      The Consultant shall work under the general direction of EPE
through a counterpart Project unit specifically established for this Project.
EPE shall also assist the Consultant to obtain copies of all studies and
reports required for the performance of the Consultants' services.
5.02      The Consultant shall submit a quarterly report to the EPE not later
than the 15th of the following month. The quarterly reports shall contain
information on the Consultants' activities, listing all personnel employed
on the Project during the quarter and the functions they performed. The
report shall indicate progress during the quarter toward achieving contract
objectives, point out any difficulties or impediments, and recommend suitable
remedies.
5.03      As part of Project management and supervision services, the Con-
sultant shall develop detailed construction schedules and suitable monitoring
devices including specifically critical path schedules. The Consultant shall
review these schedules periodically in connection wtih quarterly reports and
recommend steps to ensure keeping the Project on schedule.
5.04      Within a year after start of construction the consultant shall
submit to EPE recommendations for the establishment of an information system
to gather and process data to evaluate the performance of the National Rural
Electrification Plan.
5.05      Within three months of completion of construction the Consultant
shall submit to EPE a report summarizing the Project's history, construction
costs, results achieved, problems encountered, and lessons learned which
may be useful to EPE.
VI. TIMING
6.01      These services are expected to be required over a period of approxi-
mately four years, starting in early 1978 with revision of the preliminary
design and ending in late 1981, after testing and placing in commercial
operation of major facilit-ies being provided and installed under the Project.

REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Guidelines for Mlonitoring the National Rural Electrification Progran
General
1.        EPE's National Rural Electrification Program is the first major
step in rural electrification in Syria. It is essential that a monitoring
system be developed to gather extensive data during the execution of the
first stage (1979-81) in order that the experience gained can be used in
EPE's continuing program.
2.        These guidelines have been prepared to serve as the basis for dis-
cussions in the development by EPE and its consultants of an appropriate
monitoring system.
3.        It would seem desirable that the data system be designed to collect
the information on a geographical basis using the power system configuration,
i.e., data would be gathered for each village, then village data would be
totalled by distribution substations, and finally substation data would be
totalled by bulk supply point or possibly districts. The loads connected
directly to 20-kV feeders would be grouped with the feeder village loads. This
would readily permit comparing system area inputs with sales, developing aver-
age supply costs, etc. However, the finally selected system would depend on
EPE's particular requirements. Similarly, it is obvious that the monitoring
system should be designed for computer use in view of the volume of detailed
data and the desirability of processing it for various purposes.
Load Data
4.        To provide data on rate of load development for different regions
under varying economic conditions, as the villages are electrified the fol-
lowing data should be collected by village (data should also be collected for
the villages already electrified, to the extent possible);
(i) The growth in number of consumers, demand (kWh and kW) and
revenue per consumer (including, if possible, statistical
analysis of individual consumer growth) since each village
was electrified. Consumers would be classified as follows:

Other
(ii)  The growth of total village demand (kWh and kW) and revenues.
(iii) The uses to which electricity is put by each category of con-
sumer, indicating information on the types and numbers of
appliances installed.
(iv)  Information on taxes paid by consumers as part of the electricity
bills.
(v) How revenues change over time (for instance does the system load
factor and load factor per consumer category improve)?
(vi)  Types and number of dwellings and the numbers connected to
"tnetworks".
(vii) Trends in socio-economic factors such as:
Population growth
Migratory flow
Household incomes (giving the range as well
as the average)
Average number of people per dwelling.
(viii) Details of village infrastructure (e.g. roads, water
supply, schools, health centers).
(ix)  Details of any new economic activities (commercial, industrial
or agricultural) which have developed since the electrification
of the village.
(x)  The projected demand (kWh and kW), revenue and costs over the
next 15-20 years, and justification of the projections.
Cost Data
5.        A costing system should be developed so that the following data ca-
be compiled:
(i) Statistical information on transformers, feeder lengths,
capacities, etc.

Page 3 of 3
(ii) 66- and 20-kV facility costs by substation, area, line feeder,
etc. giving the investment costs for spec-ific load areas.
(iii) Individual village distribution costs and average connection
costs for the various consumer categories.
(iv) Purchased power costs for the various areas.
(v) Operating and maintenance costs prorated by village and by
other block load.

ANNEX 13

SYRIA
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Basic Assumptions used in Development of Project Costs
1.        Installation and erection of the project facilities would be by local
contractors (80%) and EPE's own service crews (20%).
2.        Wood pole construction would be used in areas of difficult access
(about 50% of the total) where use of concrete poles would be less practical.
Concrete poles for the rest of the project would be pre-stressed concrete (in
some cases also spun).
3.        A single distribution transformer would serve one village.  The
transformer would incorporate HV and LV protection and a LV distribution board.
4.        About half of the 380/220 V conductors would be weatherproof (ser-
vice drops and conductor protection).
5.        Account was taken of the probability that procurement through tied
financing (USAID) would make costs for some items higher by 20-30% over similar
procurement under international competitive bidding (ICB).
6.        Overall project costs are not unreasonable given the widely dis-
persed project areas and terrain difficulties.

SYRIA
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Main Assumptions for the Financial Forecasts 1977-1982
The independent auditors (Talal Abu-Ghazaleh & Co.) have not com-
pleted the 1976 audit as of this date. The final audit report could change
the financial data shown as actual. EPE has not closed its books for 1977;
the accounts are subject to final closing and to adjustments.
Balance Sheet
1.  Gross Fixed Assets:  Carried at "Book Value" through 1978 and revalued
from 1979-1982. Consultants recommended revaluation
based on "replacement" costs. For proforma pur-
poses the electric assets in service as of 1978 were
revalued on indexes of cost based on original instal-
lation dates. Assets installed after 1978 are
revalued annually by 8% estimated to be the annual
inflation rate for costing replacement. Actual
revaluing procedures will be implemented by the
consultants in establishing the recommended
utility accounting system for EPE.
2.  Depreciation:         The applied depreciation is for rate making purposes
as opposed to the rates fixed by law, which are on
the high side. The applied annual rates are:
Building 3%
Hydro generating facilities 3.5%
Thermal plants 4%
Combustion turbines 6.6%
Diesel generating units 4.5%
Transmission and distribution 3.5%
General Plant 3.2%
3. Accounts Receivable: As of the end of 1976 the receivables averaged 160
days, this is reduced to about 90 days as of the end
of 1982 assuming that the Government will pay promptly
their accounts.

ANNEX 20
Page 2
4.  Inventories:           Annual increases from 1972-1977 reflect the frequent
maintenance requirements of the diesel and combustior
turbines. The increase in 1980 is attributed to the
required spare parts and inventories necessary to
the operation of the Mehardeh power plant going into
operations.
5.  Accounts Payable:    Assumed at 2 months fuel costs and approximately I
month's local construction costs.
6.  Equity from            Assuming that the Thawra hydro assets will be trans-
Government:           ferred as Government's equity contributions.
7.  Construction Grants: From the budgets approved by the Government of Syria,
includes "grants in kind" and cash grants which are
reported net of EPE repayments.
8.  Long-Term Debt:        Includes outstanding loans signed, loans to be
signed, and loans being negotiated for the Banias
Power Station.
Inzome Statements
9.  Electricity Sales:   See Annex 8.
1IO  Electricity           Assumes tariffs increase effective January 1, 1979,
Revenues:             1980, 1981 and 1982 in accordance with the agreement
reached during negotiations (para. 5.11). Assets
are revalued in 1979 and require annual revaluation
1980-1982 due to inflation.
11, Personnel Costs:       Staffing is estimated to increase from the present
13,000 employees to approximately 22,000 employees
in 1982; revenues from sales per employee is expected
to increase from the present 16,000 LS to 43,200 LS
in 1982. Average salary increases are estimated at
8X annually from 1978-1982.
12, Fuel Costs:            Calculated on the expected requirements for each
station (Annex 10) at the existing fuel prices
established by the Government of Syria. A "ratchet"
clause for fuel adjustments will be incorporated in
the tariff proposals of OCS for automatic fuel cost
adjustments to reflect the Government's policies of
fueL pricing
13. Income Tax:            No corporate income tax is payable by EPE as from
1973, only minor taxes are applied.

REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Load Forecast for Project and Program
1.        The load forecast [or the ten year rural electrification plan and
the Project are identical for the first three years, since the latter is the
first phase of the former. After the first three years, the load forecast of
the plan includes the load of the villages electrified in the second phase.
Finally the expected load of the villages to be electrified in the third phas-
are added to form the load forecast for the plan. The forecast comprises the
demand for electricity for rural domestic use, public lighting, small commer-
cial enterprises and street lighting. The agro-industries demand is not
addressed because of the lack of a development plan for the sector from which
future loads can be determined. Private irrigation pumping in Syria depends
primarily on diesel as a source of energy. This dependency is caused by the
present pricing policy which undervalues energy sources relative to their
respective opportunity costs to the economy. If the price of diesel fuel is
not increased to reflect the fuel's economic value relative to the value of
the residual oil used by EPE generating plant, there would be no financial
incentive for private irrigation pumping to switch to electricity. Since
there are no indicatiorsthat revaluation of diesel prices will be forthcoming,
at least until the power development study is completed, the load forecast
does not include private irrigation pumping as a component. However, the
load forecast for EPE's system includes the load expected for the public
irrigation pumping projects.
2.        The load forecast is based on three parameters (averages).  These
were determined from samples because of the lack of adequate and comprehensive
village statistics. The parameters are:
(a)  initial rate of comnection;
(b) initial consumption level;
(c) the rate of growth of demand.
Two samples of unequal numbers of villages were used. The first sample con-
sisted of 94 villages individually supplied by local diesel generators. The
second sample consisted of 73 centrally supplied villages. All villages
selected had access to electricity for more than five years (Attachment 1).
Initial Rate of Connection
3.        The initial rate of connection refers to the number of subscribers
that are provided service during the first year of electrification. It was
57% for the centrally supplied villages and 52% for the villages supplied by

isolated systems. The difference is largely attributed to the villages of the
Mohafazah of Damascus with a high connection rate of 90%. The high rate is due
to two factors that are unique to the Mohafazah. These are:
(a) the accessibility of the villages to EPE's service connection
teams because of their proximity to the capital area; and
(b) the per capita income of the inhabitants of the Mohafazah is
higher relative to the other Mohafazat because of the com-
position of its labor force of which 30% are employed in
sectors other than the agriculture sector (public sector,
small industries, etc.).
4.        In determining the initial connection rate for the Project, the
villages in the Mohafazah of Damascus were ignored because of the pronounced
difference between the economic conditions of villages in the Mohafazah rela-
tive to the rest of rural Syria. However, the same villages were included in
determining the initial consumption level used in the forecast (para. 6). The
initial connection rate for all of Syria excluding the Mohafazah of Damascus
ranged from 30% to 50%. To compensate for possible sampling errors, a 50%
average initial rate of connection was used for all the Mohafazat with the
exception of Aleppo and Adlib with a rate of 48% and Deraa and Soueda with a
rate of 38%.
Average Initial Level of Consumption
5.        The initial consumption level refers to the average consumption per
subscrib-er in the first year of electrification. The consumption for the vil-
lages supplied from the public grid was higher than that of the villages sup-
plied by the isolated systems. The former had an average consumption level of
611 kWh/year, while the latter had an average consumption of 415 kWh/year (At-
tachment 1). The difference is primarily attributed to the inability of the
isolated systems to expand their respective capacities to meet the growth in
their respective demands.
6.        The average consumption data used in the forecast is that of the
publicly supplied villages because they are more indicative of the consumption
patterns of consumers supplied from the centralized grid. However, the aver-
age of these villages was high (611 kWh/year) because the sample included
the Mohafazah of Damascus. Consequently, two averages were used in the fore-
cast, one for the villages of the Mohafazah of Damascus to be electrified by
the Project and the other for the rest of the Mohafazat. Furthermore, the
average initial consumption, with the exception of the Mohafazah of Damascus,
was reduced by about 30% from 413 kWh to 300 kWh per year. This, it was felt,
would cushion against any cross regional differences that might not have been
detected in the statistical analysis.
The Average Rate of Growth of Demand
7.        The rate of growth of demand denotes the average yearly rate at which
demand for electricity increases over a 30 year period. The data collected
supports the following growth scenario:

8.         The yearly rate of growth for each of the first seven years is based
on the experience of the Syrian villages electrified since 1968.  The forecast
of the growth rate of 14% per year for the rest of the period is based on the
growth experiences of the rural areas in industrialized nations.  The higher
rate assumed for Syria is justified because, although the rural population in
industrialized countries and in Syria are growing at an annual rate of 1%, the
development of the rural areas in Syria is at the take off stage while that of
the industrialized countries has already reached a relatively steady state of
economic growth.
9.         An 18.2% rate of exponential rate of growth of rural demand for
electricity yields the same forecast as that of the varying growth rates. The
use of a single rate of growith facilitates load forecasting. The uniform rate
(18.2%) is not inconsistent with the average rates of growth experienced in
other countries. Table II below presents some of the rates that were observed
in other developing countries.

Summary of Assumptions Relating to the Forecast
10.       The assumptions used in developing the forecast of the load associated
with the Project and the ten-years rural electrification plan are:
(a) An average initial subscription rate in the first year of
electrification of 50% for all the regions with the exception
of Deraa and Soueda with a rate of 38% and Aleppo and Idlib
with a rate of 48%.

(b) An initial consumption per capita of approximately 50 kWh/capita/
year for all the regions except Damascus where the level was set
at 100 kWh/capita/year.
(c) A rate of growth over the life of the Project or plan of 18.2%
per year.
(d) An average number of 6 persons per connection.
The load forecast associated with the low voltage customers in Syria is pre-
sented in Attachment 2. Attachments 3 and 4 summarize the forecast of demand
for the Project and the plan respectively.

SYRIA
REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
The Incremental Cost of Power Delivered to the Rural Distribution System
1.        The Project is the first phase of Syria's ten-year rural electrifi-
cation plan. It will supply 1,200 villages with electricity by expanding the
rural distribution network. Henceforth, this network will be referred to as
the rural system. In order to calculate the return on the investment, the
rural system is assumed to be independent from the rest of Syria's power pro-
duction system. Furthermore, the rural system is assumed to purchase power
from EPE at the 66/20-kV substation level at a marginal cost based tariff
(Annex 26), that is, a tarifE which reflects the opportunity cost to the
economy of the incremental resources allocated to the production of the power
demanded by the rural customer.  This annex is devoted to the determination
of that tariff.
2.        The incremental cost per kWh delivered to the rural system consists
of three components:
(a) a capacity cost for generation;
(b) a capacity cost for transmission; and
(c) an energy cost of generation.
The incremental cost derived is not intended as a tariff to be paid by the
beneficiaries but instead it is an approximation of the economic value of each
kWh demanded at the 66/20-kV substation.
Incremental Capacity Cost for Generation
3.        The incremental capacity cost for generation is based on EPE's gen-
eration development program between 1977 and 1982 (Attachment 1). The program
consists of six projects, two of which involve the construction of steam plant-
at Mehardeh (2 x 150 MW) and Banias (2 x 150 MIW). The other four are conver-
sions, after rehabilitation, of the plants at Kattineh (2 x 15 MW and 3 x 30
MW), Lameh (2 x 15 MW), Damascus (I x 15 MW) and Aleppo (1 x 5 MW) to residual
oil instead of diesel fuel.
4.        The conversion of the plants is an economic decision that has an
impact on both the size of future plants and the cost of operating the system.
This will in turn alter incremental cost associated with the development plan.
Since the converted plants will run on cheaper fuel, making possible their use
for meeting base loads, the conversion cost is included in the estimation of
the capacity cost.

5.        Fuel savings will accrue between 1977-1985 from the economic dis-
patching of plant. Savings are estimated from the expected contribution of
each plant to the total yearly generation (Attachment 3). The magnitude of
these savings is equal to the difference between the economic costs of fuel
used in operating the system with the existing plants unconverted and without
the two new steam plants and the fuel cost of operating the system with the
proposed expansion program. Savings in fuel are principally attributed to
the substitution of the steam plants for the diesel fueled combustion turbines
currently in operation. The turbines were installed after the last Middle
East war because the time required for their installation is shorter than that
for steam plants. The yearly fuel saving constitutes a benefit whose present
value is deducted from the cost of the development program (Attachment 4).
6.        The generation development program cost of 1,589.3 LS millions
(US$409.82 M) is spread between 1977 and 1982. Only the undisbursed outlays
(1977-1981) for Mehardeh are included in that cost. Since marginal cost
pricing is a forward-looking approach that addresses future rather than past
costs, the disbursed segment of MIehardeh's capital cost prior to 1977 is
created as historical costs and not considered in estimating the capacity
cost. The capital cost of Banias is included to compensate for the exclu-
sion of Mehardeh's disbursed costs from the cost of the program. This is
despite the fact that Banias will only contribute to the total generation
of 1982 and that the same contribution could otherwise be met by operating
some of the existing smaller plants for longer periods of time.
7.        The incremental cost for generation is 160.3 LS per kW/year.  It is
equal to the annuitized ratio of the present values of the net cost of the
program (net of the discounted stream of fuel saving) and the sum of the in-
cremental demand for each year. It includes a yearly maintenance cost for
generation of 1% of the capital cost of the program (Atitachment 5).
Incremental Capacity Cost for Transmission
8.        The capital expenditure program for transmission consists of the
cost of the 230-kV and the 66-kV network and the dispatch center (Attachment
2). These are discounted to their 1977 equivalent value and the sum is allo-
cated according to the peak responsibility imposed on the system by each of
EPE's customer classes. Customer classes are classified according to the
voltage level of their demand (230-kV, 66-kV, 20-kV, 20.-kV/LV and LV). Peak
responsibility is determined from the load factor for each voltage level
and the forecast of incremental energy demanded (Attachment 6).
9.        Assigning cost responsibilities are more difficult in the case of
transmission than in generation because of the lumpiness of transmission in-
vestments. Lumpiness in generation is less severe because matching generation
and demand can be accomplished to the nearest increment of capacity available
for the plant selected. On the other hand, transmission is characterized by
lumpy initial investments (poles, substations, and minimum capacity of wires)
which are required at the initial stage of operation and remain in service for

ANNEX 23

several years (at least 10 years) before the network's capacity is fully taxed.
Thus, the following were determined before allocating the cost responsibilities
among customer classes:
(a) length of time in which the network will be used before its
capacity is fully absorbed; and
(b) the maximum capacity that will be imposed on the network by
the end of the time horizon considered in the determination
of the tariff.
10.       Of Syria's transmission investment program between 1977 and 1985,
more than 50% of the investment (62% for 230-kV and 57% for 66-kV) will be
undertaken after 1980 (Attachment 2). Meanwhile, the capacity cost is being
determined for the years between 1977 and 1980. Assuming that the network
will be fully utilized in 12 years, the proportion charged to the period under
consideration must recover 25% of the capital cost (3 years/12 years). How-
ever, since certain minimum facilities must be erected in order to transmit
power, 40% instead of 25% of the capital cost will be used in determining the
capacity cost.
11.       Only 20% of the development cost of the 230/66-kV substation are
allocated to the higher voltage consumers because of their minimal use of the
facility. That is, the 230-kV customers are allocated 20% of the cost of the
230/66-kV substations and 80% are assigned to the 66-kV customers. Meanwhile,
both the 230/66-kV and 66/2C1-kV substations are used by the 66-kV customers,
consequently 20% of their cost are assigned to that customer class.
12.       Forty percent of the cost of the dispatch center is considered rele-
vant to the tariff period considered. The sum is allocated equally between
the 230-kV and 66-kV customers. For the calculation of the transmission
charge including maintenance cost see Attachment 7.
13.       The incremental cost of transmission at each level is allocated
according to the peak responsibility of each customer class (Attachment 6).
The results are summarized in Table I below:

14.       The incremental capacity cost for generation and transmission for
power delivered to the 66/20-kV substation is equal to the sum of the incre-
mental capacity cost of generation (160 LS/kW/year), the incremental capacity
cost of transmission at the 230-kV level (18.0 LS/kW/year), the incremental
capacity cost at the 66-kV level (23.5 LS/kW/year) and the incremental capac-
ity cost at the 66/200-kV substation (40.1 LS/kW/year). The sum is equal
to 241.60 LS/kW/year (Attachment 8). The sum of 9,422,400 LS/year is the
required contribution of the rural system to the capital costs of the period
considered (Attachment 6). This sum is equal to the product of the incre-
mental capacity cost for generation and transmission (241.60 LS/kW/year) and
the peak responsibility of the rural system (39 MW). The incremental capacity
cost per kWh delivered to the rural system is 0.10 LS/kWh (9,422,400 LS/95 GWh).
Average Energy Cost of Generation
15.       The incremental generation cost is estimated from the schedule of
the yearly economic dispatching of plant (Attachment 3). The schedule gives
a hypothetical contribution of each plant to the total generation required
including systems losses. The yearly fuel cost is valued at 1977 border
prices. The hydro energy is assigned a value per kWh equal to the next
higher fuel cost in the mix which is flare gas (79.0 LS/1000 kg).
16.       The average energy cost per kWh produced between 1978 and 1982 is
0.04 LS. It is equal to the ratio of the present value of the yearly fuel
outlays and the sum of the present value of the total yiearly kWh produced
(Attachment 9).
17.       Therefore, the cost per kWh delivered to the 66/20-kV system is
equal to 0.14 LS kWh which is the sum of the capacity cost of 0.10 LS/kWh and
the average cost of energy of 0.04 LS/kWh.

The 230-kV and 66-kV networks will continue expanding up until 1983 with substantial outlays in 1980 and 1982.  All
network are designed with the aim of transporting electricity for at least from 10-15 years. Consequently, both
networks in Syria are considered to be of sufficient capacity in order to accommodate the load growth for at most
12 years. Meanwhile, since the initital investment is lumpy and must be undertaken irrespective of the magnitude of
the system peak in the first few years relative to the peak capacity of the network, 40% of the cost of the networks
(lines and substations) will be attributed to the period considered for mc-pricing which is 1978-1982.
In addition, the cost of the substation is allocated between the 230-kV. Customers and the 66-kV customers in
the ratio of 20X to the former to 80% to the latter. Similarly, the recalculated cost of the 66/20-kV substations
(cost of 66/20-kV substations and 0.8 of the cost of the (230/66-kV substation) will be divided between the customers
of the 66-kV network and the 20-kV network. The proportion used will be 20% for the higher voltage network and
80% for the lower voltage network.
The cost of the dispatch center will be allocated between the customers of the 66-kV and the 230-kV. Yet, only
40% of the cost of the dispatch center will be attributed to the period considered for mc-pricing.

Least Cost Alternative
1.        There are two basic alternatives for supplying a village with
electricity:
(a) local generation; and
(b) connection to the central supply grid.
In the comparison of these alternatives, the distribution network within the
village is not considered because it is identical for both alternatives.
2.        Since the project will extend electricity to 1,200 villages, the
comparison of alternatives for each of the villages included in the Project is
not feasible. Instead, the approach adopted in this annex is to derive, using
a small village of 500 inhabitants, the relationship between the two alterna-
tives. The length of the 20-kV lines used is the principal cost determinant
for the centrally supplied alternative.  The analysis will determine the
length of the 20-kV line (break-even distance) which equates the present
values of the cost stream of each alternative. The break-even distance will
be used to draw conclusions about the villages included in the Project, bear-
ing in mind that the break-even distance increases as the village population
increases.
3.        The analysis extends over a period of 30 years, consequently the two
alternatives involve upgrading, replacement and expansion of facilities to
meet the forecast demand (Attachment 2). Other assumptions that affect the
results are summarized in Attachment 1. The cost streams associated with each
alternative are presented in Attachment 3.
4.        The break-even distance between the two alternatives is 18.3 km.
This leads to the conclusion that the Project is the least cost alternative'
for electrifying the 1,200 villages because:
(a) the distance between any of the villages in the Project and
the nearest source of centrally supplied electricity is
about 11.2 kilometers; and
(b) 90% of the villages in the Project have a population greater
than 500 inhabitants.

Calculation of the Break-even
distance between the two alternatives
The sum of the present value associated with the isolated system are = 1,259,000 LS
The sum of the present value associated with the central grid are    =   358,500 LS
The sum of the present value associated with the erection of 1 km
of 20--kV line     =    49,200 LS
The distance at which the cost associated with the two alternatives break-even
for a village of 500 inhabitants can be determined from the following equation:
1,259,000 LS = 358,500 LS + X (49,200 LS) where X is equal to
the distance between the village and the nearest source of centrally
supplied electricity. Therefore, the distance at which the two
alternatives will break-even is:
X = (1,259,900 - 358,500 LS/49,200 LS/km
X = 18.3 km
Based on the assumption used in the comparison of the two alternatives and the
magnitude of the break-even distance derived, it is possible to conclude
that the Project is the least cost alternative to electrifying 1,200 villages
in Syria.  This is because of the following fact:
(a) The distance between any of the villages in the Project and the
nearest source of centrally supplied electricity is about
11.2 kilometers; and
(b) 90% of the villages in the Project have a population greater than
500 inhabitants.

REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Return on Investment
The return on investment is calculated for both the Project and
Syria's ten-year rural electrification plan.
I. Return on Project
1.        The rate of return on an investment refers to the discount rate
which equates the present values of the benefit and the cost streams defined
over the expected life of the project being financed. In this appraisal, only
the pecuniary segments of the benefits and costs will be considered in the
rate of return analysis. There are several identifiable benefits and costs
that are not quantifiable and consequently are not included in the analysis.
2.        Since the project extends electric service to rural areas, the
present value of the non-quantifiable benefits of the Project such as decreased
rural migration, employment creation potential and improved quality of life,
should be greater than the present value of its non-measurable costs. Thus,
the calculated return on investment represent the minimum expected return
from implementing Syria's rural electrification program.
A. Costs
3.        Costs are divided iinto two categories:
(a)  Project costs which refer to the costs that are imposed on
EPE as a result of the construction and maintenance of the
project; and
(b)  Power systems costs which denote the costs that are incurred
by EPE in supplying the rural distribution system with power.
Both costs are expressed in 1977 constant prices.
Project Costs
4.        The project costs include the initial capital outlays distributed
over four years (1978-1980) and the operation and maintenance costs. Project
costs are expressed net of price contingencies or import duties and taxes.
The operations and maintenance cost is assumed to be 2% of the yearly capital
outlay. The Project's local costs of capital and labor are not expressed in
efficiency prices because conversion factors were not available for Syria at
the time of the analysis.

ANNEX 25
Page 2 of 4
System Costs
5.        EPE's system is artificially separated from the rural distribution
system for the purpose of rate of return analysis. The latter will henceforth
be referred to as the rural system. The rural system is assumed to purchase
power from EPE at marginal cost based tariff. The tariiEf includes the costs
of generation and high and medium tension transmission of power to the 66/22-
kV substation (Annex 24, paras 1, 2, 17).
B. Benefits
6.        The measurable benefits are divided into two categories:
(a) the revenue attributable to the project from the sale of
power; and
(b) the savings accrued to the economy resulting from the
implementation of the project.
The Revenue Associated with the Project
7.        The existing tariff of 0.21 LS/kWh (US$ 0.53) for electricity sup-
plied to the domestic customers from the public grid consists of two parts:
a flat rate for consumption of 0.19 LS/kWh (US$0.048) and a fixed system
expansion tax of .02 LS/kWh (US$0.005). The analysis assumes an average
revenue of 0.24 LS/kWh (US$0.06) as a proxy for the consumers willingness
to pay. This is justified because of two reasons:
(a) At present, the customers of the isolated systems pay a tariff
of 0.24 LS/kWh and there are strong indicaticons that their
consumption at that rate would be higher if the constraints
imposed by the limited capacities of the diesel generators
are removed; and
(b) The 0.24 LS/kWh represents a 14% economic increase in the
1979 rate relative to the rate charged in 1977. The increase
is justified because the prevailing tariff is below the
economic cost of producing electricity and the Bank will
seek to have that gap closed through a tariff covenant
(para. 5.10).
The impact on the rate of return of using the prevailing tariff of 0.21 LS/kWh
as a proxy for benefits will be assessed in the sensitivity analysis (para. 12).

Fuel Savings
8.        The fuel saved by absorbing the isolated systems into the public
grid constitutes a project benefit. It is estimated by determining the
proportion of the rural population which is served by the isolated systems.
Then based on both an average number of inhabitants and an average consumption
rate per connection, the yearly supply of electricity required by the isolated
systems is approximated (see Attachment 1).
9.        The net fuel saving associated with the project is equal to the
difference between the economic value of the diesel used and the economic
value of the alternate fuel consumed by the public system in order to deliver
the same amount of power. In the analysis, the estimated fuel saving is a
gross rather than a net stream, because the cost of the fuel used by the
central system was not subtracted from the savings. However, this has no
impact on the rate of return because the value of the alternate fuel used
by the public system is incluaded in the mc-based tariff charged to the Proj-
ect for the power delivered to the rural system.
Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
10.       The return on the Project is equal to 8.5%.  This rate is based
on an average revenue of 0.24 LS/kWh and an incremental cost of 0.14/kWh
for the power delivered to the rural system (Attachments 2 and 3).
11.       If an average revenue of 0.21/kWh instead of 0.24/kWh is used as a
proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay, which represents a decrease of
13%, the rate of return decreases to 6.1% (Attachments 3 and 4). If the
cost of 0.14 LS/kWh paid by the rural system increases by 13%, the return
on investment decreases to 7.3%. This demonstrates that the rate of return
on the Project is more sensitive to changes in the average revenue than to
changes in the cost of power delivered to the rural system. Changes in fuel
savings and operations and maintenance had no significant impact on the rate
of return.
12.       When the existing tariff of 0.21 LS/kWh is used as a proxy for con-
sumers' willingness to pay, the return of 6.1% indicates that electricty is
priced below the value of the resources used in its production. If an average
revenue of 0.24 LS/kWh is used instead, the magnitude of the distortion would
be lessened but the return of 8.5% would support the same conclusion. The
return on investment would be 11.3%, if a 22% increase in the average revenues
is implemented to meet the financial assumptions of para. 5.12.
13.       The rate of 8.5% represents the minimum return on investment because
the possible use of the rural network for agro-industries and private irriga-
tion pumping was not included in the load forecast. Syria's private irriga-
tion pumping is dependent on diesel for its source of energy. This is because
the price of diesel is subsidized to an extent that even at the prevailing
electricity tariffs, it would be financially unattractive to switch to elec-
tricity.



- 99 -
ANNEX 25
Page 4 or 4
14.       Proper allocation of energy resource among competing ends in Syria
would dictate an integrated energy pricing plan that reflects the opportunity
cost of these resources to the economy. The new prices would induce a switch
from diesel to electric power in irrigation pumping because of relatively
lower electricity prices because of two reasons: (a) the border price for
the residual oil used by most of EPE generating plants is lower than the
border price for diesel; and (b) private irrigation pumping can be accom-
modated during off-peak periods and need only pay energy cost for its power
consumption. In addition, an implementable agro-industries' development plan
is required, before the rural distribution network is to be fully utilized.
If the impact of these plans (energy pricing and agro-irndustries development),
are integrated into the load forecast the return on investment would be
substantially higher than 8.5%.
HI.  Return on the Ten-Year Rural Electrification Plan
15.       The cost of the plan extends over eleven years; the cost of the
Project constitutes the outlays for the first four years. Similar to Project
analysis, the plan is charged a mc-based tariff for the electricity delivered
to the rural system of 0.14 LS/kWh. The yearly operations and maintenance
costs are assumed to be equal to 2% of the total capital outlays. An average
revenue of 0.24 LS/kWh is used as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to
pay.
Rate of Return on Program and Sensitivity Analysis
16.       The rate of return on the program is equal to 4.5%.  It is less than
the return on the Project because of two reasons: (a) in the formulation of
the electrification plan, villages were allocated to the three phases of the
plan according to the magnitude of their expected benefits. Thus the villages
in the first phase have the highest benefits relative to the cost whilst phase
three includes the villages with the lowest benefits; (b) and neither the
0.24 LS/kWh nor the 0.21 LS/kWh cover the economic cost of the resources used
in producing the electricity. For example, if the average revenue per kWh is
increased by 22% required to achieve EPE's financial objectives, the rate of
return increases to 7.3% (Attachment 5).

REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
Estimation of Economic Value of Fuel Savings
1.        The estimation of the economic value of the fuel saving associated
with the Project is a gross concept in that the economic value of the alter-
nate fuel used by EPE to deliver the same amount of electricity is not deducted
from the value of the diesel saved. The number of villages that are dependent
on local diesel generators for electricity, their total population and the
date for their absorption in the public grid are presented in Table 1.
2.        The estimation is based on the following assumptions:
(a)  The average number of inhabitants per connection is about
6 persons.
(b)  The average consumption of electricity per capita is 65 kWh
per year.
(c)  The average fuel consumption of diesel generators is 0.28
kilograms/kWh.
(d)  The border price of diesel (prevailing in 1977) is 0.475 LS
per kilogram.
