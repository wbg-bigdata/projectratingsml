REGIONAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:         Etablissement Public d'Electricite (EPE)
Guarantor:        Syrian Arab Republic
Amount:           US$40 million equivalent
Terms:            17 years including 4 years of grace, at interest rate
of 7.45 percent per annum.
Project           The Project is a first stage of the Ten-Year National Rural
Description:    Electrification Plan aimed at providing electricity service
to all villages with at least 100 population by 1987. The
project would consist of about 5,000 km of 20-kv transmis-
sion and 380/220-volt distribution lines and related equip-
ment, about 70 MVA of distribution transformer capacity and
33 man-years of consulting services. The project would
serve approximately 900,000 rural population in 1,200 vil-
lages in 11 out of the 14 Mohafazats (administrative dis-
tricts) in Syria. No particular project risks are presently
envisaged; however, the project is contingent on the comple-
tion of the related 66-kV transmission lines and 66/20-kV sub-
stations included in EPE's 1977-82 construction program.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO ETABLISSEMENT PUBLIC D'ELECTRICITE (EPE)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE SYRIAN ARAB REPUBLIC
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Bank
loan of US$40 million equivalent to the Etablissement Public d'Electricite
(EPE) with the guarantee of the Syrian Arab Republic to help finance a Regional
Electrification project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4
years of grace, with interest at 7.45 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects for
Syria" (no. 806-SYR, dated October 31, 1975) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on November 12, 1975. This section is based on the findings of a
Basic Economic Mission which visited Syria in April 1977, and whose report is
in the final stage of preparation. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since attaining independence in 1946, Syria has had several changes
in regime which resulted in a shift of power from groups of landowners,
traders, and industrialists to a rising class of officers, technicians, and
civil servants, as well as a shift of the economy from an essentially laissez-
faire system to a largely publicly-owned and centrally regulated one. The
Ba'ath Socialist Party, the ruling party since 1963, provided substantial
continuity of emphasis on economic and social development policies which have,
by and large, prevailed in spite of internal Government changes and tensions
within the Middle East. During the 1960s an agrarian reform was carried out,
with redistribution of land to a large number of formerly landless peasants;
also large segments of the industrial, finance and trade sectors were national-
ized. In November 1970 General Assad became President of the Republic; his
regime has been characterized by a balance of firmness and conciliation in
domestic policies, economic pragmatism, a concerted search for a better
defined role for the private sector in a centrally regulated economy, as
well as diversification of foreign economic relations. These aims have been
pursued gradually and, in spite of continued political uncertainty in the
Middle East, substantial reorientation of economic policies and diversifica-
tion of production have been achieved.
4.        The Government's attention to economic and financial matters has led
to a sustained on-going effort in conceptualizing objectives, identifying con-
straints, and formulating alternative strategies. As a result, an increasingly
pragmatic assessment of economic policies has been taking place within the Gov-
ernment (and the ruling Ba'ath Party). The cabinet formed in August 1976 has
as one of its key tasks the implementation of new economic policy directives,



-2-
strengthening of economic management, and tightening of controls over invest-
ment decisions in the public sector. The Prime Minister, General Khleifawi, a
former head of the Economic Committee of the Ba'ath Party, and Prime Minister
in the first cabinet formed after President Assad's accession to power,
defined shortly after the change in cabinet the principles which henceforth
are to guide Syrian economic policies. The Prime Minister's program, while
re-affirming the Ba'ath Party's commitment to general socialist principles and
the dominant role to be played by the public sector, called for improvements
in management of the public sector and attempted to define a role for the
private sector (including the specification of activities open to private
investment, exclusively or jointly with the public sector, and the provision
of the necessary safeguards and incentives to stimulate private investment).
The program also called for the formulation of a wages and price policy,
review of the economic planning system, transformation of the existing Indus-
trial Bank into a genuine industrial development finance institution, and
changes in interest rate policies to promote greater consistency with interest
rates charged in neighbouring countries and to stimulate domestic savings.
5.        The 1973 petroleum price increase, which boosted Syria's own petro-
leum export earnings, and the sharp rise in Arab grants following the October
1974 Rabat agreement, augmented financial resource availability in the short
run, leading to revisions of the Third Plan (1971-75) and sharp increases in
public investments. However, adverse financial developments, rooted in the
high investment rates of 1974-75 and external developments, including the
discontinuation of oil transit by Iraq, a'decline in Arab aid and the impact
of the Lebanese civil war, put unexpected financial constraints on investment
and growth, and delayed the finalization of the Fourth (1976-80) Plan to early
1977. For 1976-80, the Plan called for: real growth of 12 percent yearly in
GDP; increases in real terms of 7 percent per annum in exports; and a domestic
savings/GDP ratio of about 23 percent. With the constraints on resource avail-
ability that have emerged, the Government however has decided not to implement
the Plan fully and in fact to limit its investment program for 1977-80 mainly
to ongoing projects. Further revisions of the public investment program for
1978-80 are underway with a view to take account more appropriately of finan-
cial and other constraints.
6.        The strategy underlying the current investment strategy places
particular emphasis on industrialization, with investment in agriculture
remaining substantial. The industrial development strategy stresses import-
substitution in consumer goods, and a substantial expansion of resource-based
industries, such as cotton textiles, cement and fertilizers. Significant
exports of manufactured goods by 1980 -- particularly textiles and fertilizers
-- is a primary objective of the Government's investment program in the manu-
facturing sector. In agriculture, the Government's overall objectives are
the same as those in the previous Plan: self-sufficiency in major domestic
food needs, meeting the raw material requirements of industry, and provision
of a production surplus for export. Rational land and water use, the stabili-
zation of annual fluctuations in output and the improvement in consumer diets



-3-
through an increase in protein supply are further objectives. The strategy to
achieve these objectives includes expansion of irrigated agriculture, intensi-
fication of crop production and achievement of a better balance and comple-
mentarity between crop and livestock production.
7.        Economic growth during 1971-75 is estimated at close to the 8 per-
cent target level, and growth in 1976 was also around 8 percent. Public
investment during 1971-75 reached about 70 percent of the original Plan
target, with about 55 percent of the total outlays being made in the last
two years of the Plan period, largely as a result of greater availability of
financial resources. The elasticity of savings with respect to GDP fell to
1.0, compared to a target of 1.8, reflecting a shortfall in the public savings
effort, particularly in recent years. A substantial number of manufacturing
projects, including those in fertilizers and steel rolling, came on stream
during the Plan period, thus diversifying the structure of industrial output.
Particularly heavy expenditures were made in industry, energy and fuel in
1974 and 1975, as a large number of projects were commenced. Investments
in irrigation and agriculture appear to have remained stagnant in real terms
during the Plan period and fell substantially short of the target and the
Plan's overall achievement rate. Nonetheless, the Euphrates basin investments
were substantial and if the serious technical problems faced so far are
overcome, may lead to higher growth and stability in the production of the
agricultural sector in the future. Progress in the fields of transport and
communications kept pace with the overall implementation rate of the Plan.
Investments in social services reached a high proportion of planned alloca-
tions, although substantial needs remain in education, health and urban
services.
8.         In response to the several economic and political factors which
came into play in the last few years (temporary slow-down in Arab aid, loss
of transit revenues and concessionary crude oil supplies from Iraq, military
expenditures in Lebanon, and the inflow of refugees from Lebanon), the rate
of economic growth slowed down from 11 percent in 1975 to almost 8 percent in
1976. The budget deficit continued to increase from SL 3.1 billion in 1975
to SL 4.5 billion in 1976, and is expected to amount to SL 6.0 billion in 1977
implying government savings of zero. The balance of payments, reflecting
similar trends, moved from a current account surplus of SL 280 million in 1975
to a deficit of over SL 3.1 billion in 1976, and external reserves fell in
1976 by SL 1.4 billion. Data for 1977 are not available, but economic growth
is thought to have been around 6 percent (agriculture, 4 percent; industry,
10 percent).
9.         The Government, faced with the reduced availability of economic
resources, has been making efforts at austerity, and has introduced a number
of policies designed to meet the financial stringency, and to redress the
structural disequilibrium which has evolved in the balance of payments, as
a result of the changed pattern of resource availability and usage in the
last four or five years. With slow but increasing effectiveness, the Govern-
ment has reassessed the economic situation; as a result, the Fourth Five-Year
Plan, which was approved in April 1977, was severely curtailed (para. 5).



More formal development planning has been temporarily suspended, wisely, for
immediate efforts at rational investment decision-making. To meet the finan-
cial stringencies, current expenditures under the 1977 budge- have been held
to 1976 levels, and public investment has temporarily been restricted only
to on-going projects. Simultaneously, the Government has been conducting a
wide-scale review of economic profitability of the various on-go:Lng projects,
as well as of the new projects that had been proposed in the Five-Year Plan.
10.       Increasingly aware of the needs to improve the economy"s performance,
the Government has begun to take measures to relieve constraints on the coun-
try's development. Following the years of financial ease (up to early 1976),
fiscal performance needs to be improved, if development is to proceed without
interruption and without entailing potentially serious inflationalry and public
debt management problems. This will require continuation of the efforts begun
in 1977 to improve domestic resource mobilization and tighten control of
expenditures. Efforts which are underway in the Ministry of Finance to reform
the tax system and to improve the Ministry's budgetary and control functions
need to be increased. In addition, action must be taken to increase the effi-
ciency of economic enterprises and their contribution to the budget through
improved management, including introduction of sound accounting practices (for
which a law was passed in 1974) and control, as well as improved efficiency
in production and introduction of cost-related pricing. The State Planning
Commission is presently studying capacity utilization in agriculture, industry
and transport with a view towards finding means of increasing growth through
improved utilization of existing capacity rather than new investments. The
Government has also sought UNDP assistance in planning, and the Bank is con-
sidering how best to respond to a Government request for assistance in project
indentification, preparation and implementation. While these efforts are
expected to have only a small impact in the years immediately ahead, they
are likely to yield considerable fruits in the long run.
11.       The shortage of skilled manpower may cause bottlenecks in project
implementation.  The uneven spatial distribution of employment is also likely
to pose problems as a large proportion of public investment in agriculture and
industry is to take place in the Northeast, where the population density is
much lower than in the Western Coastal belt. Measures will be required to
attract population and to provide sufficient skilled manpower to the Northeast
region.  The overall manpower situation and the difficulties currently en-
countered in fostering an efficient public administration and public economic
sector are exacerbated by emigration of trained technicians and skilled
labor abroad and the outflow of trained manpower from the public sector to
the private sector as a result of wide wage differentials. To alleviate
the shortages the Government will provide extensive training facilities for
augmenting the supply of skilled manpower. It may however have to revamp
the structure of incentives so as to enable the public sector to attract and
retain an efficient cadre of administrators, technicians and other skilled



- 5 -
workers. In the past emigration to neighboring labor-deficit countries and to
some extent low labor force participation rates among females have contributed
to reduced requirement for employment creation through public investment.
While the Government is fully committed to increasing productive employment
opportunities, there is an urgent need to formulate a coherent employment
strategy consistent with the current and future investment strategy.
12.       Perhaps the most significant obstacle to long-run economic and social
progress in Syria is the absence of effective planning and administrative
institutions. Administrative problems are too complex and deep-rooted to be
amenable to even medium-term solutions. There is, nevertheless, an urgent
need to implement a wide-ranging administrative reform to tackle the wide
variety of existing administrative problems so as to develop administrative
capacities and capabilities, particularly in the formulation and execution
of development plans, programs and projects.
13.       Syria's economic prospects depend heavily on the availability of
financial resources and also on absorptive capacity in the various sectors.
Considering these constraints, a reduced investment program will be imple-
mented during the 1977-80 period. This new level of investment would be
consonant with the Government's concern for improving the quality of invest-
ments. Tentative Bank projections indicate that such investment would be
sufficient to generate real GDP growth in the neighborhood of 6 to 7 percent
per year in the early 1980's. The sources of growth in the late 1970's are
likely to be the manufacturing and construction sectors, with agricultural
production stabilized at higher levels, rather than mining and commerce which
were the leading growth sectors during the Third Plan.
14.       On Bank assumptions, the requirements of a growing aggregate demand
would entail an increase in the current account deficit from $800 million
in 1976 to $1,030 million in 1980. The Government is expected to implement
measures to improve domestic resource mobilization, following the studies
currently underway, so as to narrow the savings-investment gap, and thereby
the resource gap.
15.       At the end of 1977, external public debt outstanding and disbursed,
excluding military debt, was estimated to be around $1,776 million (31 percent
of GDP) of which 80 percent was held by Governments (28 percent, OPEC; and
47 percent, centrally planned economies), and only 4 percent by multilateral
organizations (exclusively the World Bank Group). On Bank assumptions, gross
external capital requirements during 1978-80 will be $3.2 billion. As a
result, Syria's debt service ratio is expected to rise from 9.6 percent in
1976 to 16 percent by 1980, and 23 percent by 1985. If assumptions for
1980-85 are simply extrapolated beyond, the debt service ratio is expected
to be 26 percent by 1990. The Bank Group's share in total public debt out-
standing and disbursed is projected to increase to 4.2 percent and in total
debt service payments to 3 percent in 1980. Subject to continued prudent
debt management, to which the Government started giving priority in 1977,
Syria remains creditworthy for Bank lending.



-6-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SYRIA
16.       Syria has to date received four IDA credits totalling US$47.3 mil-
lion and ten loans totalling US$319.1 million (including one loan of US$12.5
million on Third Window terms), net of cancellations. Although Syria is a
member of the Corporation, IFC has made no investments. At the end of 1976
the Bank Group accounted for 14 percent of Syria's total outstanding public
debt; by 1980 it is expected to account for 10 percent of total outstanding
public debt and 7 percent of public debt service obligations. Annex I con-
tains a summary statement of IDA credits and Bank loans as of February 24,
1978.
17.       Project implementation has generally suffered substantial delays
due largely to circumstances beyond Syria's control. The 1973 hostilities
brought works to a standstill and diverted the country's resources first to
military, then to reconstruction tasks; the unsettled conditions in the region
and weaknesses in the administrative system caused project implementation to
slow down. The above developments were compounded by the high rate of world
inflation and generated considerable cost overruns in most projects. As a
result, the scope of the Damascus Water Supply and Mehardeh Power Projects
had to be revised and additional financing secured. In the case of the Balikh
Project, the Government obtained a $50 million loan from the Government of
Iran and has undertaken to provide the Bank with a new financing plan for the
project as soon as the current reassessment of the development program of the
Euphrates Valley is completed. In the case of the Second Highway Project,
the Government obtained a $45.9 million loan from USAID to finance one of
the components originally included in the project and has decided to upgrade
the project roads to four lane standards. Disbursements of Bank loans had
reached, as of September 1977, 60 percent of appraisal estimates and 95
percent of revised estimates. The Government has however been requested by
the Bank to deal with problems of project implementation, which still calls
for improvement.
18.       Lending for infrastructure accounted for over two-thirds of Bank
Group. lending to Syria thus far. It aimed at fostering well designed sector
policies and strengthening various public institutions in charge of power,
water supply, highways and telecommunications. The objective of lending for
irrigation development (Balikh Project) was to help increase and stabilize
agricultural production and farmers' incomes which are subject to wide fluc-
tuations under rainfed conditions. The livestock development project for
which a loan was approved in FY77 provides for fundamental improvements in
feed and flock management policy as well as credit to sheep farmers, most of
whom are among Syria's poor nomadic population, with an aim to increasing and
stabilizing incomes in the sheep subsector throughout Syria. Due to delays
in selecting and appointing consultants, this loan has not yet become effec-
tive. Effectiveness of the loan for Aleppo Water Supply has also suffered
from delays in implementing tariff increases, which have now been
introduced; effectiveness is expected in the near future.



-7-
19.       A diversification of lending operations in Syria is envisaged
through a gradual shift of emphasis away from infrastructure projects, toward
quicker yielding projects in the directly productive (agricultural and indus-
trial) sectors with export or import substitution potential. However, project
preparation according to Bank standards remains a serious constraint in these
sectors. Bank lending in coming years is therefore bound to apply to a number
of infrastructure projects with a high economic and social priority (e.g. edu-
cation and the provision of basic urban services, such as water supply). A
Third Highway project has been recently appraised and negotiations are sched-
uled to begin in Washington shortly; it will include the construction and/or
upgrading of high priority sections of Syria's main highways. Also recently
appraised was an irrigation/drainage project providing for the rehabilitation
of salt-affected lands in the lower Euphrates area. Projects under prepara-
tion include agro-industry (cotton seed processing), rainfed agriculture
(integrated development in the northeastern region), and water supply and
sewerage facilities (for Damascus, Hama, Homs).
20.       The lending activities described above would help to improve project
preparation and implementation, especially in those sectors in which the Bank
has not been previously involved, and strengthen sector policies and institu-
tions. The proposed operations will include significant technical assistance
and training components to achieve the above objectives.
PART III - POWER SECTOR IN SYRIA
21.       Up to 1951 the Electric Power Sector was in the hands of private,
local and foreign electric utility companies. Although all private holdings
were nationalized in 1951, the sector lacked organization and remained frag-
mented. In 1965 the sector was consolidated under Etablissement Public
d'Electricite (EPE). In 1974, EPE was made an agency of the then rawly
created Ministry of Electricity. The relationship between EPE and the Min-
istry requires more effective organization than is currently the case and has
been reviewed by Arthur Young & Company, the consultant for the management
study financed by the Bank under Loan 986-SYR. The recommendations of this
study have been approved by EPE and the Ministry of Electricity and are
awaiting final approval by the Government for implementation (see below
para. 33).
22.       For all practical purposes, EPE represents the whole power sector
in Syria since continued expansion of EPE's transmission and distribution
lines has progressively integrated most isolated loads. The average annual
growth of total sales for the EPE interconnected system for 1966-76 exceeded
15 percent per annum. The 1976 peak demand was 327 MW and total generation
was 1,459 GWh. The peak demand for 1977 is estimated at 428 MW and the total
generation at 1,914 GWh, with installed capacity of 1,275 MW and average
generation capability of about 3,802 GWh. The distribution of electricity



- 8 -
sales in 1976 was as follows: households and commercial - 40 percent; Govern-
ment industry and services - 31 percent; private industry - 28 percent; and
irrigation - 1 percent. Particularly rapid growth of demand is expected in
irrigation (85 percent per annum) and other rural uses (78 percent per annum).
By 1982, the distribution of electricity sales is estimated to be as follows:
household and commercial 22 percent; Government industry and services 52
percent; private industry 13 percent; and irrigation 13 percent.
23.       System expansion and development so far has been primarily aimed at
meeting the industrial load growth.  For 1977, following commissioning of the
Thawra hydroelectric units (8 x 100 MW), hydropower is expected to cover
85 percent of the total generation while steam will account for 11 percent,
and combustion turbines and diesel sets for the remaining 4 percent. In 1978,
hydrogeneration is expected to reach 89 percent of the total due to better
utilization of the available Thawra energy, with steam generation making up
the rest. Recently completed construction increased the length of 230-kV
transmission lines to about 1,800 km. The system also has about 1,500 km of
66-kV, 4,000 km of 20-kV lines, and 11,500 of low voltage distribution lines.
The proportion of the population with access to electricity was estimated at
50 percent in 1977 (with an average per capita consumption of about 250/kWh
per annum) and is expected to be at least 65 percent in 1980 fol:Lowing the
implementation of several projects including the proposed project. The
proportion of rural population with access to electricity is expected to
increase substantially from about 20 percent in 1977 to about 70 percent in
1987.
24.       The power sector figures prominently in the Government's Five-Year
Plan and EPE is committed to a large expansion program to keep up with a pro-
jected growth in load of about 18 percent per annum between 1977-82. Total
cost of the 1977-82 power development program is estimated at about US$1.1
billion. The major investments would include expansion of the Mehardeh thermal
plant (2 x 150 MW); Banias thermal power station (2 x 150 MW) scheduled for
operation in 1983; about 1,900 km of 230-kV transmission lines and correspond-
ing substation capacity; and 2,800 km of 66-kV transmission lines aimed at
supporting plans for some 13,000 km of future urban and rural distribution
systems also included in the current expansion program. These investments are
expected to be financed by Government grants of US$392.4 million (35 percent),
internally generated funds of US$310.4 million (27 percent), Government
operating subsidy of US$86.5 million (8 percent), long-term borrowings of
US$324.6 million (29 percent) including existing loans of US$75.9 million, and
customers' contributions of US$14.3 million (1 percent).
25.       Several constraints presently hinder the performance of the power
sector in Syria. Firstly, EPE has still to become a full-fledged, autonomous
efficiently managed electric utility. Gains are slowly being made in this
direction. Arrangements are presently underway to modernize EPE's accounting
system and the Bank agreed with the Government and EPE during negotiations
on a plan to eliminate the debts and arrears due to EPE from Government
agencies (para 37). In addition, EPE is expected to institute reasonable
tariff increases over the next several years to strengthen EPE's financial
viability (para. 36). Secondly, EPE lacks the skilled staff to implement the



- 9 -
system expansion plans and to maintain adequately existing equipment. To
alleviate this need, a specialized training center, "Institut Moyen d'Electro-
mecanique" is being constructed in Adraa (see para. 34). The institute would
be fully operational in 1978.
26.       The proposed loan would represent the third Bank lending operation
for power in Syria. The first loan (986-SYR) cofinanced by the Kuwait Fund
was made in 1974 for the first stage (150-MW) of the Mehardeh Steam electric
generating plant, and was later amended, increasing the loan amount by US$8.6
million to meet the cost of the enlarged project scope. The second loan
(1144-SYR) was made in 1975 to finance the second 150-MW unit at Mehardeh.
Physical implementation of both projects have proceeded satisfactorily with
the first unit expected to become operational in 1978. However, managerial
and financial problems persist due to delays in changing over to a new account-
ing system and implementing the organizational improvements which were pro-
posed by the management consultants. In addition the Government has been slow
in approving tariff increases necessary to ensure EPE's financial autonomy.
To expedite the resolution of these problems, agreement was reached during
negotiations with EPE and the Government on a timetable for increasing EPE's
tariffs, as well as implementing a utility accounting system and the necessary
organizational changes (paras. 33, 36 and 38).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The staff report entitled "Syria - Regional Electrification Project"
(No. 17417-_SYR) dated March 2, 1978 has been distributed separately. The pro-
posed project was prepared by EPE and the consulting firm SOFRELEC and was
appraised in May/June 1977. Negotiations were held in Washington between
January 24 and February 3, 1978 and the delegation from EPE and the Government
was led by Mr. R. Idriss, General Director of EPE.
Project Objectives and Description
28.       The project is the first stage of a ten-year National Rural Electri-
fication Program aimed at providing electricity service from the National Grid
to all villages with at least 100 population by 1987. The project would pro-
vide electricity service to 900,000 inhabitants in 11 out of the 14 Mohafazat
(administrative districts) in Syria, including about 150,000 rural households
for whom adequate supply of electricity would be made available for the first
time. The project would also serve health care, education and communication
centers as well as infrastructure services such as water supply and industries
as part of the Government's drive to increase agro-industrial activity and to
improve the quality of life in rural Syria. Specifically, the project would
consist of the following:
(a) constructing about 5,000 km of 20-kV and 380/220 volt
distribution lines and installing related equipment;



- 10 -
(b) providing about 70 MVA of 20/0.4-kV distribution transformer
capacity and street lighting equipment; and
(c) technical assistance to strengthen EPE's capabilities
in manpower planning and development.
Project Execution
29.       Under the Second Mehardeh Project (Loan 1144-SYR) SOFRELEC completed
a feasibility study including preliminary design, cost estimates and technical
specifications on electrification of all rural areas in Syria.  Based on the
SOFRELEC study, US engineering consultants to be engaged by EPE with USAID
financing would develop detailed designs and prepare bidding documents for the
project. As an integral part of this work, the consultants are expected to
revise the preliminary designs of the 380/220-V system which presently appear
over-dimensioned, to make them more cost effective. The appointment of project
consultants would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Sections 3.02(a) and
7.01(a) of the Loan Agreement).
30.       EPE would be responsible for project implementation assisted by the
USAID-finaiced consultants who would provide project management and supervi-
sion.  The consultants would also assist EPE in developing adequate extension
policies for new consumer connections in the National Rural Electrification
Plan which EPE would be required to monitor as a condition of the proposed
loan (Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement). The Bank has sent the draft Terms
of Reference for the consultants to EPE and USAID. The consultants would
prepare detailed construction schedules and develop critical path schedules
to facilitate project implementation. EPE would be required to review these
schedules and report periodically to the Bank on the progress of project
implementation (Section 3.04(d) of the Loan Agreement). The Government and
EPE established a Project Unit within the Rural Electrification Department
(Section 3.01(c) of the Loan Agreement) and appointed a Project Unit Director
prior to negotiations for the proposed loan. Adequate staffing of the unit
has been made a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 7.01(c) of the Loan
Agreement). Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Project Unit
would coordinate the on-going transmission and expansion program to syn-
chronize the construction of the 66-kV lines and 66/20-kV substations needed
to supply the project and being implemented with development assistance from
the Democratic Republic of Germany (Section 3.01(b) of the Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing Plan
31.       The estimated cost of the project including contingencies but ex-
cluding import duties is US$135.8 million, of which US$74.2 million (or 55
percent) would be in foreign exchange. The cost of 20-kV distribution works
including transformers is estimated at about US$18.9 million including about
US$13.1 million in foreign exchange, and the cost of the 380/220-V distribution
system and related equipment is estimated at US$64.9 million including US$35.7
million in foreign exchange. Physical and price contingencies are estimated
at US$8.8 million and US$38.6 million respectively. Physical contingencies



- 11 -
were assumed at 10 percent for both local and foreign components. Price con-
tingencies were estimated at 7.5 percent between 1977-79 and 7 percent between
1980-81 for equipment and materials and 9 percent and 8 percent respectively
for comparable periods for civil works.
32.       The proposed Bank loan of US$40 million to be made directly to EPE
would amount to about 30 percent of total project costs and about 54 percent
of the foreign exchange costs. The proposed Bank loan would meet the full
foreign exchange cost of 20-kV transmission lines, including 20/0.4 kV distri-
bution transformers and 24 percent of the foreign exchange cost of the 380/
220-V distribution lines. The proposed Bank loan would also be used to finance
the full foreign exchange costs for installation and erection and the technical
assistance to EPE for manpower planning and development. A USAID loan of
US$34.2 million was provided to the Government at an interest rate of 2 per-
cent per annum for 40 years including a 10 year grace period and will be
on-lent to EPE. The USAID funds would be used to finance the full foreign
exchange cost for engineering services and 76 percent of the foreign exchange
cost of the 380/220-V distribution lines and related equipment. The full
local currency costs of the project would be met partly from EPE's internally
generated funds, and partly through Government grants.
ManaRement and StaffinR of EPE
33.       The Board of Directors is the highest authority in EPE and is pre-
sided over by the Minister of Electricity, or his Deputy for Technical Affairs.
A management advisory committee composed of EPE senior staff advises the
General Director on day-to-day decisions. The General Director is appointed
by the Prime Minister and serves also as a member of the Board of Directors.
Other Board members are appointed directly by the Ministry of Electricity.
All appointments are for indefinite periods. EPE is to be reorganized along
the lines proposed in a study prepared by Arthur Young and Co., Management
Consultants, and financed under Loan 986-SYR. Under the new organization
day-to-day management authority would reside with the General Director as at
present; however, there would be increased delegation of authority to a Deputy
General Director and five Assistant General Directors for Operations, Engineer-
ing and Planning, Financial Affairs and General Services, Regional and Com-
mercial Affairs, and Projects and Rural Electrification. During negotiations
the Bank agreed with the Government and EPE on a timetable for implementing
the Management Consultant's recommendations affecting EPE's organizational
structure, no later than December 31, 1978. Appointment of consultants to
start implementing the recommended organizational changes has been made a
condition of loan effectiveness (Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement;
and Sections 4.07 and 7.01(b) of the Loan Agreement).
34.       EPE's labor costs are expected to increase substantially between
1977-82 due to inflation, estimated at 8 percent per annum, and to its expan-
sion program requiring trained operators and additional employees. EPE has
now about 13,000 employees, with a projected increase to about 21,000 by 1980.
The increase is acceptable in view of the accelerated development planned for
EPE. At the request of EPE, the Project includes the services of a manpower



- 12 -
development advisor to prepare long-range plans for personnel selection,
training, and development. Intensive training for the Mehardeh power plant
personnel is currently being carried out in temporary facilities at Hameh
Power Station. Once the permanent buildings are completed, all internal
training activities will be moved to the institute at Adraa (see para. 25).
Financial Performance of EPE
35.       EPE's net operating revenues decreased from LS 20.4 million in 1972
to LS 9.5 million in 1976 with losses of LS 28.3 million in 1974 and LS 18.1
million in 1975. The decreases resulted from restricted sales and increased
cost of generation from diesel and combustion turbines installed to replace
the steam capacity lost during the 1973 War.
36.       Under the existing Loan Agreements and the proposed loan , EPE was
required (through December 31, 1977) to maintain its average electricity rates
at levels not below those existing as of May 31, 1973. During negotiations,
agreement, similar to that concluded under the Second Power Project (1144-SYR),
was reached that EPE would obtain revenues from the supply of electricity
sufficient to yield an annual return of not less than 9 percent on revalued
average net fixed assets in operation (Sections 5.04 of the Loan Agreement and
3.02 of the Guarantee Agreement). However, the Government requested that the
9 percent requirement should be partially waived until 1980, to minimize the
inflationary impact of a precipitous increase in tariff during this period of
steep increase in EPE's fixed assets and of general reappraisal of the Govern-
ment's investment and pricing policies. It was therefore agreed that between
1978-80 EPE could earn the required 9 percent rate of return from a combina-
tion of tariff increases and direct Government cash contributions to meet any
shortfall in EPE's net income not derived from tariff revenues. During 1978,
the cash contribution may be equal to the full difference of EPE's revenues
from the 1977 tariffs and the amount that EPE would have obtained had it
raised its tariffs to a level necessary to obtain a 9 percent return on its
net fixed assets in operation. On a similar basis, the Government cash
contribution would cover no more than 70 percent of the shortfall in EPE's
net income in 1979 and no more than 40 percent in 1980. EPE would increase
tariffs in 1979 and 1980 to supplement the Government contribution and earn
a 9 percent rate of return. In 1981 and for subsequent years, EPE would be
required to meet the entirety of the 9 percent rate of return from tariff
revenues. In addition, it was agreed that EPE will prepare a satisfactory
progressive rate structure for household electricity consumption by defining
the first block of consumption that should benefit from the lowest rates.
EPE's proposal will be completed by September 30, 1978, and implemented no
later than January 1, 1979. The Bank's agreement to the Government's request
to waive partially the rate of return requirement was predicated on the fact
that EPE's net fixed assets have been rising steadily to replace capacity
lost during the 1973 war while electricity sales have lagged because of
delays in restoring industrial production. It was therefore felt that a
gradual increase in tariffs over a three-year period would be necessary to
enable the Government to continue with its efforts to reorganize the indus-
trial and energy sectors as well as to allow sufficient time for EPE's



- 13 -
expected load growth to materialize. Asset revaluation will be required
annually, starting in 1979. Although somewhat lesser increases will be needed
through 1982, EPE would have to nearly double its average selling price by
1982. On this basis, EPE should be able to finance about 27 percent of the
1977-88 investment program (see para 24) from internally generated funds.
37.       Between 1977 and 1982 EPE's gross fixed assets in operation are esti-
mated to increase from LS 1.4 billion to LS 5.2 billion (about LS 7.1 billion
after revaluation). Even though EPE's long-term debt will increase from about
LS 400 million in 1977 to about LS 1.4 million in 1982, EPE's debt equity ratio
will remain fairly constant at about 20:80 between 1978-1982, because of sub-
stantial Government contribution to EPE's equity, offsetting foreign borrowing
in EPE's capital structure. Under previous Agreements with the Bank, EPE
agreed not to incur additional debt without the Bank's agreement unless its
debt service coverage ratio with reference to maximum debt service including
the debt service on the debt to be incurred was at least 1.5. This will remain
a covenant of the proposed Loan Agreement (Section 5.05 of the Loan Agreement).
EPE's receivables have currently accumulated to excessive levels (over 150
days' billing) with most of the accounts due from Government entities and
the municipalities. EPE's plan for reducing its accounts receivables was dis-
cussed during negotiations. It was agreed that EPE would eliminate all the
old debts and arrears due from Government entities and municipalities and
would reduce all its receivables to 90 days billing maximum by December 31,
1978. In addition, EPE would ensure that its accounts receivable shall
thereafter not exceed that limit (Section 5.06 of the Loan Agreement).
38.       Presently, EPE's accounting records are kept in several centers and
sent annually to the Head Office in Damascus. Consequently, control is lack-
ing over accounting functions to ensure completeness and consistency necessary
for the efficient management of EPE as well as the development of an appro-
priate tariff base. During negotiations agreement was reached that EPE would
engage consultants to begin implementation of the proposed accounting system
developed for EPE by Arthur Young & Co. (Section 5.01(b) of the Loan Agree-
ment), including revaluation of assets employing methodology acceptable to the
Bank, by June 30, 1978. The appointment of the consultants has been made a
condition of loan effectiveness (Sections 3.02(b) and 7.01(b) of the Loan
Agreement).
Audit
39.       EPE's financial statements for 1974 and 1975 were audited by the
firm of Jalal Abu-Ghazebeh (Kuwait) who are acceptable to the Bank and are
preparing the audits for the 1976 and 1977 accounts.
Insurance
40.       Insurance of EPE's major assets is adequate.  However, because of
the large additions of major planned investments some of which are nearing
completion, EPE agreed during negotiation to undertake, with the assistance of
i



- 14 -
underwriters, a review of its insurance practices. The review would determine
whether any changes related to inspection and safety aspects are needed in
existing coverage to comply with sound utility practices. EPE has agreed to
submit the results of the review to the Bank for comment by June 30, 1979
(Section 4.03(b) of the Loan Agreement).
Disbursement
41.       Disbursement of the Bank loan would be for 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of distribution equipment and materials, foreign consultants,
and of technical assistance for manpower development, 70 percent of the
expenditures for local consultants, and for 35 percent of EPE's total expendi-
tures for the installation and erection contracts. Disbursements are estimated
at US$15 million in 1979, US$16 million in 1980 and US$9 million in 1981. No
retroactive financing is anticipated. The proposed closing date is June 30,
1982.
Procurement
42.       Contracts for supplying equipment and materials to be financed from
the proposed Bank loan would be awarded under international competitive bid-
ding (ICB). Since no Syrian manufacturers are likely to submit bids, no pro-
vision for local preference is necessary. Bid packages would be grouped by
voltage levels: one group for 20-kV lines and distribution transformers
(US$6.2 million), and the other for 380/220-V distribution system and street
lighting (US$21.2 million). Each group could be awarded as a single contract
or in two or more subgroups to allow flexibility and promote competition
thereby favoring lower costs and prompt execution of the project. To ensure
equality for all bidders in the evaluation and comparison of bids, it was
agreed during negotiations that bidders required to deposit bid bonds, or to
secure their contracts by means of performance bonds or bank guarantee shall
show separately the cost of such bonds or guarantee which will be deducted
during comparison with bids submitted by bidders (Government-owned construc-
tion firms) who are exempted from depositing such bonds or guarantees. Minor
quantities of standard distribution equipment and materials needed to match
and line up new construction with existing facilities would be procured under
"international shopping" after inviting quotations from at least three manufac-
turers. Total cost of contracts awarded under international shopping would
not exceed US$1,000,000 equivalent. Installation and erection contracts would
also be awarded under international competitive bidding, except for about 20
percent, to be done by EPE's own service crews (mostly installation of service
drops and customer connections). The interest of foreign contractors in these
contracts is likely to be limited because of the wide geographical dispersion
of project facilities; local contractors however would be capable of carrying
out installation and erection works for the project if no foreign bids are
received, as is the case with on-going projects in the sector.
Project Justification
43. (a) Demand. The project would help meet part of the expected
demand for electricity in the villages to be generated by



- 15 -
implementation of the National Rural Electrification Plan.
The long-term average growth rate in demand under the Plan
has been estimated at 18.2 percent per annum. The project
which constitutes the first phase of the Plan, would achieve
initial connection rate of 50 percent during the first year
of electrification for most villages served under the project
with complete coverage during the project implementation
period (1977-82). Since implementation of the plan would
generate considerable load for EPE, it would also contribute
to correcting part of the imbalance which currently exists
between generation and distribution capacity due to slower
growth in power demand than had been expected following the
1973 war.
(b) Least Cost Alternative. A break even analysis indicates
that a village of at least 500 inhabitants could economically
be supplied with electricity at a maximum distance of 18.2
kilometers from the central grid, beyond which local genera-
tion becomes more economical. The project constitutes the
least cost alternative for the electrification of 1,200 vil-
lages 90 percent of which have over 500 inhabitants each and
the distance between any of the villages and the nearest
source of centrally supplied electricity is about 11.2 kilo-
meters.
(c) Economic Analysis. The return on investment in the project
is 8.5 percent based on an average revenue of 0.24 LS/kWh
which represents the current cost per kWh paid by the rural
customers served by isolated system. If a tariff of 0.21
LS/kWh is used the rate of return would decrease to 6.1 per-
cent. The rate of 8.5 percent constitutes the minimum return
on investment for the project, because: (a) at present,
electricity prices in Syria are heavily subsidized; (b) the
load forecast does not include the possible use of power for
private irrigation pumping which uses highly subsidized diesel
fuel as its principal energy source, thereby making the use of
electricity financially unattractive even with the prevailing
low tariffs and distorting the allocation of resources within
the energy sector. During negotiations the Bank was informed
that increasing electricity tariffs is being considered by the
Government only as a first step in the Government's effort to
rationalize prices within the energy sector; and (c) the
analysis does not take into consideration the non-quantifiable
benefits of rural access to electricity service and secondary
benefits resulting from the positive impact that the avail-
ability of power would have on small scale industries and handi-
crafts in rural areas and on stemming the flow of rural-urban
migration.



- 16 -
Project Risks
44.       With project management and implementation being initially provided
by consultants no special implementation risks are foreseen. However, the
project is contingent on the completion of the related 66-kV transmission
lines and 66/20-kV substations included in EPE's 1977-82 construction program
(see para 27 above). Although EPE's 1977-82 investment program appears large
and the possibility of some delay exists, the implementation risks associated
with the project per se are minimal since the project is independent of the
execution of the generating capacity in the program as presently envisaged.
Moreover, the entire foreign exchange requirements of the project are being
met by the proposed Bank and USAID loans while the local currency needs would
be met by the Government and EPE.
45.       The project's impact on the environment is negligible as it consists
entirely of power distribution facilities and house connections.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and EPE, the draft
Guarantee between the Syrian Arab Republic and the Bank, the draft Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of.a draft resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed separately. Special conditions of the
project are listed in Section III of Annex III. In addition to the features
of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements which are referred to in the text and
listed in Section III of Annex III, the Bank's loan would be declared
effective only after the Government and EPE have met all the conditions
precedent to the first disbursement under the USAID loan.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Credit 298 - Second Highway Project; US$13.8 million Credit of April 17, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: February 2, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Project implementation started in 1975 after an initial delay due to
the unfavorable political situation in the region. In July 1975, after several
contracts had been awarded, the Government decided to upgrade the project
roads to four-lane standards. Economic studies indicated the upgrading to be
economically justified. The Association agreed to the upgraded roads after
reviewing final cost estimates, based on detailed engineering. Government has
called bids for the additional works on the Homs-Tartous road and is presently
negotiating addenda to the contracts with the contractors for the construction
of the Damascus-Lebanese border road. Agreement for financing of construction
of the Damascus-Jordanian border road has been reached between the Government
and USAID. This section will, therefore, be deleted from the project. The
Government has requested to reallocate IDA funds for the construction of the
Damascus-Lebanese border road and Tall Kalakh section of Homs Tartous road, to
four-lane standards. The rest of the works will be financed by the Saudi and
Kuwait Funds. Amendment to credit agreement is being prepared.
Credit 401 - Damascus Water Supply Project; US$15 million Credit of June 22,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: February 20, 1974; Closing Date: December 31,
1978
Initial delays in project implementation of about two years were
caused by the unfavorable political situation in the region. A revision of
the project description was required as a result of considerable cost overruns
and was approved by the Board on May 28, 1975. This permitted work to proceed
on an urgent phase of distribution. Work is now proceeding in accordance with
the contract schedule with about 50 percent of the works completed to date. No
further delays are anticipated. Consultants have begun the pollution control
studies for Damascus, HomB and Hama.
Credit 469/Loan 975 - Balikh Irrigation Project; US$10 million Credit and
US$63 million Loan of April 10, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: September 12,
1974; Closing Date:   June 30, 1982
After initial delays during the procurement stage, progress on the
works being implemented by Syrian Government organizations for the development

progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

of the first 10,000 ha has been slow due to technical and managerial difficul-
ties. The Bank agreed with the Ministry of Euphrates request to continue
financing the full foreign exchange component of the four contracts so far
awarded for the development of the 10,000 ha, provided that the Government
will have recruited consultants for supervision of construction of ongoing
works and for the review of design of hydraulic structures in gypsiferous
soils by February 28, 1978 as stipulated in the Loan Agreement. 'The Govern-
ment has decided to postpone implementation of the remaining part of the
project until completion of the ongoing revision of the overall Balikh Basin
development. The financing plan for the whole project will be submitted
after completion of this study. Settlement in the Balikh area is still
under study by the Government.
Consultants have completed the feasibility studies for a drainage/
irrigation project for rehabilitation of salt-affected lands in the Lower
Euphbrates area; tender documents for drainage works on the right bank are
expected to be completed by September 1978.
Loan 986 - Mehardeh Power Prolect; US$25 million Loan of May 23, 1974 and
Supplementary Loan of US$8.6 million of June 4, 1975; Dates of Effectiveness:
January 30, 1975 and January 19, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project consists of the first 150-MW unit of new steam-electric
power station at Mehardeh; eight 230-kV substations, consultant services and
training. The project is co-financed by a US$33 million loan from Kuwait
Fund, including a second portion of US$15 million to cover the considerable
cost overruns. Although main contracts were awarded about five months late
and a further delay of about two months was caused due to a temporary lack of
cement, physical progress is satisfactory and the final delay is expected to
be minimal. Institutional progress is expected to remain slow due to lack of
experienced personnel and the time required to train intermediate executive
staff.
Loan 1144 - Second Mehardeh Power Project; US$72 million Loan of July 18, 1975;
Date of Effectiveness: January 19, 1976; Closing Date: June 30. 1980
The project comprises a second 150-MW steam generating unit at
Mehardeh, construction of six and extension of two 230-kV substations, a new
office building, organization and accounting studies and training. Construc-
tion of the power plant is progressing satisfactorily although a delay of
about two months occurred due to a temporary lack of cement; the final delay
is expected to be minimal. Construction of the new head office building has
been delayed by about one year because the Government is reconsidering its
size. Institutional progress is expected to remain slow due to lack of expe-
rienced personnel and the time required to train intermediate executive staff.

Loan 1241 - Second Damascus Water Supply Project; US$35 million Loan of
June 9, 1976; Date of Effectiveness: January 31, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
The project, which is co-financed by the Arab Fund and USAID,
provides for the supply components of Damascus' water system and for training.
Work is proceeding on schedule on the contract for the tunnel, underground
cutoff and supply reservoir, which are financed by the Bank. A close coor-
dination of the works financed by the various donors under this project and
of the works financed under the first project will be required to permit the
timely link-up of the various components of the supply and distribution system
and to minimize expected delays in implementation of the project components
financed by other donors.
Loan 1261 - Telecommunications Project, US$28 million Loan of June 9, 1976;
Date of Effectiveness: March 15, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project consists of the most urgent works of the telecommunica-
tions investment program for the period 1976-78, including the installation of
telephone connections, trunk exchanges and teleprinters; and expansion of long
distance and international facilities; and a training center. Procurement is
well underway on a number of contracts.
Loans 1311/1312T - First Livestock Development Project; US$5 million Loan and
US$12.5 million Third Window Loan of July 22, 1976; Date of Effectiveness:
; Closing Date:  December 31, 1982
This loan has not yet become effective due to delays in the selec-
tion and appointment of consultants. Even though agreement in principle has
been reached with the Syrian Government regarding the recruitment of con-
sultants, a fifth postponement of the effective date was recently approved
in order to allow for the completion of the selection procedure and for
mobilization of necessary personnel. The project provides for a strengthening
of the organizational framework for feed policies and animal health services
as well as credit to sheep farmers and cooperatives.
Loan 1458 - Aleppo Water Supply Project; US$50 million Loan of June 30, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness:                    ; Closing Date:  December 31, 1982
The project consists of constructing a 75 Km transmission line and
associated pumping facilities from Lake Assad to Aleppo, treatment plant ex-
pansion and extension and improvements to existing trunk distribution system.
Engineering services for improvements of the sewer systems in Aleppo and
Latakia and technical assistance to the State Planning Office and public con-
struction enterprises. Loan effectiveness has so far been postponed due to
delay in selecting and appointing consultants and in implementing tariff
increases, which have now been introduced. Effectiveness is expected in the
near future.

Loan 1480 - First Education Project; US$20 million Loan of September 14, 1977;
Date of Effectiveness: February 9, 1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1982
The project provides for the construction, furnishing and equipping
of five primary teacher training colleges, an intermediate teacher training
institute, three intermediate technical institutes and two vocational training
complexes. The project also provides for the preparation of curricula for the
technical institutes, the establishment of suitable mechanism for coordinating
vocational training and technical education, the development of craft programs
and the provision for 33 man-years of fellowships and overseas training.
Project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.
