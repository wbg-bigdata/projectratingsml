F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
To assist GOY in promoting groundwater conservation in farming areas and increasing surface
and groundwater availability through: (i) improving irrigation water use efficiency, increasing
farmer returns to water and creating the conditions to allow them to reduce groundwater
pumping from aquifers towards sustainable levels; (ii) improving recharge and protection of
watersheds in order to increase surface and groundwater availability through the improvement of
small to medium spate irrigation schemes, bank protection works, terrace and other water
                                                     ii
harvesting structures; and (iii) supporting the groundwater management framework and
institutions that will have the incentive and capacity to manage local water resources in a
sustainable manner.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.       Yemen is a predominantly rural country with 68% of its total population of 24.1 million
living in rural areas where irrigated agriculture remains the main economic activity, source of
income and employment. Yemen is a water-scarce country and groundwater resources are
declining rapidly. The depletion of groundwater directly impacts poverty, employment and social
order. 1 Hence, the conservation of the groundwater resources, improvement of surface spate
irrigation systems, and support for the watershed areas is a national top priority. The
Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project (GSCP) was designed to test innovative solutions to
the critical groundwater and surface water problems in Yemen. The problem of unsustainable
groundwater extraction has been caused by the rapid increase in groundwater irrigation,
compounded by dwindling rates of recharge due to degradation of watersheds. The root cause is
a weak management framework ill-adapted to ensuring sustainable extraction levels, efficient
water use, and watershed protection.
2.       To address this issue, the Government of Yemen (GOY) made determined efforts in
improving water resources and irrigation management in a coordinated manner. The GOY
legislated the Water Law in 2002 and approved the National Water Strategy and Investment
Program (NWSSIP) in 2005 to define the principal policies and action plans for water resources
management. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) of GOY identified the rural
population as the poorest and most vulnerable segment of society and highlighted the growing
water shortage as a principal challenge to be met if poverty is to be reduced. The PRSP
underlined the fact that the alarming rate of groundwater mining in the country is creating a high
risk of impoverishment of rural communities and an acceleration of rural-urban migration.
3.      The Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of 2002 targeted “environmental
sustainability? and underlined the vital role that water resources play in keeping Yemen’s
economy profitable and sustainable. Improvement of water resources management was a CAS
priority. The CAS points to the needs for urgent action on water resources management in rural
areas and, in particular, investments in order to reduce aquifer depletion and improve watershed
management, with a focus on the most stressed agricultural areas. In respond to this, the Bank
prepared its Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy (CWRAS) in 2005 to produce an
operational plan for Bank involvement in the water sector.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
4.       The objective of the project was to assist the GOY in promoting groundwater
conservation in farming areas and increasing surface and groundwater availability through: (i)
improving irrigation water use efficiency, thus increasing farmer returns to water and creating
the conditions that would allow them to reduce groundwater pumping from aquifers towards
sustainable levels; (ii) improving recharge and protection of watersheds in order to increase
surface and groundwater availability through the improvement of small to medium spate
irrigation schemes, bank protection works, terraces and other water harvesting structures; and



1
    Per capita availability of water in Yemen is 115 m3 per year. In the MENA region, its availability is 1,250 m3,
    while for the world, the average is 7,500 m3. This already low availability of water will gradually be reduced to 65
    m3 per year by 2031, which may create an unsustainable situation.

                                                            1
(iii) supporting the groundwater management framework and institutions that will have the
incentive and capacity to manage local water resources in a sustainable manner.
5.      Key indicators were: (i) evidence of water savings during conveyance and application;
(ii) areas where farmers have adopted efficient on-farm water management practices as those
advised by the Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS); (iii) evidence that the irrigated area has not
expanded where farmers have contracted not to expand it; (iv) evidence of the increased area of
the watershed protection and recharge enhancement in the project area; (v) evidence of farmers’
participation in community-based water management; and (vi) establishment of water monitoring
programs.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
6.         The PDO and key indicators were not changed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
7.      The GSCP targeted all levels of farmers utilizing groundwater for irrigation in rural
communities where critical groundwater depletion was occurring and where there was an urgent
national priority to mitigate this adverse tendency. It was envisaged that some 7,000 farm
families would benefit from improved conveyance of water, and an additional 700 families from
localized on-farm irrigation systems. The project targeted irrigation modernization based not
only on the economic conditions and needs of the farmers, but also on prospects for making a
difference in improving irrigation efficiency and reducing overdraft of groundwater resources,
and the local population’s willingness to participate. 2 In addition, 5,746 families would benefit
from spate irrigation improvements, 8,350 from water harvesting works, and 17,000 from
rehabilitation and construction of on-farm water storage tanks.
8.       The non-quantifiable benefits of the project are environmental and institutional. The
environmental benefits include those arising from reducing the pace with which the aquifers
have been being depleted. The institutional benefits would derive from strengthening key
institutions in the irrigation sector. One significant benefit would consist of strengthening
community groups’ abilities to sustainably manage water. Among public institutions, the project
would: (i) strengthen on-farm water monitoring capacities of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Irrigation (MAI) field units (FUs); (ii) create the IAS which would represent a permanent
extension and monitoring service within the MAI’s FUs; (iii) strengthen the General Directorate
of Irrigation (GDI, today the Water Sector of MAI) and the Central Water Monitoring Unit
(CWMU) for irrigation policy formulation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity; and
(iv) strengthen the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA)‘s field presence, and the
Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE)’s policy formulation capacity.




2
     Incremental production benefits are expected from improved conveyance and on-farm irrigation systems, and
     from improved on-farm soil, water and crop management. This, in addition to increasing crop yields per cubic
     meter of water, would reduce pumping and labor costs. There would also be incremental production from the
     water harvesting structures, spate irrigation and terrace rehabilitation, which in turn shall improve agricultural
     production and enhance soil conservation and groundwater recharge.

                                                            2
1.5 Original Components
9.     The GSCP comprised the following three components:
10.     Component 1: Modernization and Improvement of Groundwater Irrigation Systems
(Base cost US$15.47 million) to provide for the supply and installation of buried polyvinyl
chloride (PVC) and over-ground galvanized iron pipes to improve water conveyance and
distribution efficiency, reducing losses from existing tubewells to and on farms. It would also
provide localized on-farm irrigation systems (drip, bubbler or sprinkler) for a part of the project
area to further reduce on-farm water losses. Improved irrigation conveyance would cover about
27,000 ha and modernization and improvement of localized on-farm irrigation equipment on
about 1,440 ha. Farmland leveling would be done on a pilot basis.

11.     Component 2: Improvement of Spate Irrigation, Water Harvesting and Soil
Conservation (Base cost US$12.02 million) would provide gabion baskets and other materials
for the selective improvement of traditional small and medium spate schemes within identified
wadis to improve conveyance, diversion efficiency, and groundwater recharge, associated with
wadi bank protection for villages. It would also include rehabilitation of terraces to conserve
soils from erosion and water harvesting structures, and to divert run-off water for irrigation and
recharge the groundwater. This would involve: (a) small and medium-scale spate irrigation
improvement and rehabilitation in the wadis through the rehabilitation and construction of small
and medium spate systems, and wadi bank protection structures. Canal structures would also be
constructed or rehabilitated; and (b) Improving water harvesting and soil conservation in the
uplands through the construction and/or rehabilitation of terrace walls and water harvesting
structures, erosion control structures, wadi bank protection including vegetative measures, and
improving water storage and groundwater recharge through the construction or rehabilitation of
on-farm water storage tanks, open pits and underground cisterns to collect rainwater for human
and animal consumption, irrigation and recharge.

12.     Component 3: Institutional Strengthening of Water Institutions (Base cost US$16.39
million) to provide implementation support, M&E activities, and capacity building through
training and facilities to institutions involved in the GSCP including:
(a) Capacity building (equipment, vehicles, materials, office buildings, technical assistance,
training, project management and incremental operating costs) for: (i) the project coordination
unit (PCU) within the MAI and Cooperative and Agriculture Credit Bank (CACB) for project
coordination, and FUs within 10 MAI provincial offices for implementation of physical works
and coordination with stakeholders; (ii) the MAI and GDI including its CWMU to improve
irrigation water use monitoring and other irrigation-related technical aspects; (iii) NWRA for
carrying out water resources assessment, monitoring and management, and public information
and awareness campaigns on groundwater management and conservation; and (iv) MWE for
enhancing water policy formulation.
(b) Capacity building and technical assistance for local communities in project areas including:
(i) establishment of the IAS within the FUs (the IAS would provide advice on on-farm water,
soil and crop management as well as to communicating lessons learned from farmers); and (ii)
strengthening the capacity of water user group (WUGs) to raise awareness about groundwater
saving and to assist the FUs in monitoring and managing the irrigated areas and groundwater use.



                                                3
(c) Communication material and information-sharing program for community sensitization
activities, including women and children.

1.6 Revised Components
13.    Components were not changed.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
14.    A grant of US$1.078 million from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) was
approved for the Community Water Management Project (CWMP) in June 2005. The JSDF
grant was to assist the recipient in developing replaceable models or sustainable self-
management of local water resources by poor farming families in areas where groundwater is
becoming increasingly scarce. The CWMP was implemented in parallel with the GSCP and
provided valuable experience in organizing WUAs for local water resources management.
15.    Additional IDA financing of US$15 million was approved on September 11, 2008 The
additional financing was originally approved on July 1, 2008 as a credit amounting to US$15
million, which was immediately cancelled, and an IDA grant of US$15 million was approved on
September 11, 2008 as Yemen had been included in the IDA grant financing countries. The grant
would co-finance the scaling up of the GSCP successful activities which would cost US$21.15
million for: (i) increasing the project intervention areas under improved conveyance systems
from 27,000 ha to about 44,500 ha, and under localized on-farm irrigation system modernization
by 1,000 ha (from 1,440 ha to 2,440 ha) under the Component 1 (US$14.65 million); (ii)
improvement of spate irrigation, water harvesting and soil conservation under Component 2
(US$3.38 million); and (iii) institutional strengthening of public water institutions and WUGs
under Component 3 (US$0.62 million). In addition, US$0.5 million was budgeted for
contingencies and US$2 million for recurrent budget support to be financed entirely by the GOY.
16.    As part of water harvesting works, the construction of new on-farm water storage tanks
and rehabilitation of the existing tanks for supplementary irrigation have provided drinking water
for more than 34,000 families, which was not originally intended.
17.    On January 13, 2009 the Bank agreed to extend the closing date of the project by two
years until October 31, 2011. A revised implementation schedule was agreed and incorporated in
the Memorandum of Understanding of the Bank’s supervision mission in November 2009.
During the last implementation year, as a result of the political turmoil in the country in 2011,
most of the project activities were halted for an extended period of time. Since a number of
contracts (works and goods) amounting to US$6.6 million needed additional time to be
completed, on July 13, 2011 the project was restructured for extending the closing date from
October 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
18.     In May 2005 a Quality at Entry (QAE7) Panel analyzed GSCP design rating it as
“Satisfactory? with a comment that the project strategically aimed at the proper, somewhat
unglamorous goal, but was facing high risks of failure nonetheless. This was mainly due to
complexity of overcoming such an urgent threat within Yemen's loose social and political
context. The panel rated “Satisfactory? six of the eight assessment dimensions and the Bank
Inputs and Processes. However, it rated Environmental Aspects and Implementation
                                                4
Arrangements dimensions as “Moderately Satisfactory?. The report also noted that the GSCP
“appears to be a case where a hands-on sector management, a competent and committed project
team, and a country unit willing to make a concrete physical factor – impending water shortage –
a central pivot of the country strategy, have come together. Whether even with all this focus on
this threat, the problem can be solved, is another question. The country and project teams lacked
the normal instruments with which a society may react to scarcity, such as incentives in terms of
higher prices on the scarce goods, and compulsion in terms either of enforced public law, or
through community ownership, allocation, and rationing of the resource.?
19.      Since the political capacity was not present in Yemeni society to enforce such disciplines
through national laws, the project team chose to rely mainly on the attractiveness of modern
irrigation methods, which also happen to be strongly water-saving, and on the appeal of water
user groups (WUGs) and associations, which could rest on tribal traditions, to compensate for the
lack of other tools, such as appropriate pricing of diesel fuel and a strong regulatory
environment. Complementing the approach, the project design introduced the tripartite
agreement (among beneficiary farmers, project field units, and local or village associations),
whereby beneficiary farmers committed not to increase irrigated area with the saved water.
However, the risk of other farmers, non-project free riders, stepping in to use up the local water
savings, undermined the ultimate goal to minimize aquifer depletion. The PAD also included a
full account of lessons learned from the previous project, the Land and Water Conservation
Project (LWCP).

2.2 Implementation
20.     Expansion of modern irrigation systems among conservative farmers in rural Yemen
required significant efforts during the early stage of the project implementation. Explaining the
benefits of piped conveyance and localized on-farm irrigation systems at the demonstration farm
by IAS 3 teams together with agriculture extension specialist from the department of agriculture
in the governorate. JSDF supported Community-based Water Management Project also
contributed to expand the knowledge of irrigation modernization and groundwater resources
management among Yemeni farmers. The demonstration farms proved significant saving of
pumping hours (groundwater abstraction), fuel, and labor, and an increase of crop yields. As a
result, demand for irrigation modernization increased abruptly and the implementation of
Component 1 made great progress in 2007, which resulted in the approval of the additional
financing for this project in 2008.
21.     During the implementation, the project faced significant delays in designing of 35 spate
diversion weirs by an international consulting firm under Component 2. Despite repeated follow-
up, the consultant failed to deliver the required design on time by October 2006. The consultant



3
    The IAS has been effectively developed and farmers request for even more support from IAS. Almost all
    participating farmers have honored their commitment not to expand their irrigated area. The project provided a
    good demonstration effect of sustainable improvement of irrigation systems which are being replicated by non-
    project farmers. Subsidies and demonstrations of the new irrigation technologies for piped conveyance and
    localized irrigation generated substantial demand, exceeding what the project could provide. Involvement of
    farmers in WUAs has facilitated project implementation and improved awareness of the dangers of groundwater
    depletion.


                                                         5
finally submitted 34 schemes (1 dropped) by mid-2011. The 20 diversion schemes were
completed by the end of the project, 13 schemes have been transferred to the Water Sector
Support Project (WSSP) for implementation and 1 scheme was found economically not feasible.
22.      Political unrest from February 2011 to February 2012 disrupted project activities.
Stockpiles of pipes and other materials were looted and burned, and in a few places, vehicles and
office furniture were destroyed and stolen. One soil testing laboratory was burned. Total losses
were estimated at just over one million dollars. The Bank suspended disbursements for all
activities in Yemen from July 28, 2011 to January 20, 2012. Lack of payment led to the
withdrawal of some civil works contractors. 4
23.     Capable management of the PCU and FUs contributed greatly to effective project
implementation. While the Bank policies did not allow payment of incentives from loan or grant
funds, arrangements were made to pay incentives, field allowances, out of the Revolving Fund
created from the farmers’ share of costs. This took some time, but it did make it possible to
recruit, motivate and retain capable staff, which would have been difficult or impossible
otherwise.
24.     Beneficiary participation in the implementation and quality of results was improved by
amending the Development Credit Agreement to allow implementation of small works costing
less than US$10,000 through Community Contracts. The land leveling activity was dropped
because the cost of equipment was too high and the Government was reluctant to carry it out, as
the demand from farmers was lacking.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
25.     M&E Design. Overall M&E system was well designed with selected adequate indicators
to track project outputs and outcomes. Given that the PDO was conceived in conventional terms
of irrigation efficiency, and given the monitoring technology available when the project was
designed, measurement of reduced pumping by farmers and increased productivity in relation to
the amounts pumped were adequate indicators for Component 1, as were area coverage and
groundwater levels affected by recharge for Component 2. The indicators for Component 3 of
farmer participation and establishment of water monitoring programs were well designed to
show the project progress toward the goal of establishing local water management system,
although not adequate to show the sustainability of the results in terms of stabilization of
groundwater levels over time.

26.     M&E Implementation. The M&E activities were carried out satisfactorily in general,
especially under Components 1 and 2, despite difficult security situations in the country
throughout project implementation. Implementation units were established with adequate
staffing, training and supervision. Beginning with farmer requests, a database tracked
information about farmers taking part in Component 1. Detailed data was collected on water
pumping at 100 demonstration farms, and flow meters installed on another five hundred wells.
Separate monitoring wells were also established near project sites, with data collected and put
into a database. Considerable attention was paid to data quality. Information was collected on the
number of WUGs and WUAs formed. The satellite monitoring technology and ET measurement


4
    During the unrest, shortage and high prices of diesel led to less pumping and loss of access to markets in some
    areas, reducing farmer incomes by over 50% in four FUs: Northern, Dhamar, Taiz, and Lahej.

                                                         6
were introduced to the project M&E to monitor the real water saving, and additional satellite data
on water consumption was collected and analyzed under GSCP grant.

27.     M&E Utilization. Periodic M&E reports were produced and consolidated at the central
project management level. The baseline survey was carried out and regularly updated, and
reliable information was generated and put to use. Estimates of water saved by farmers were
used to monitor progress towards the PDO, including the decision about Additional Financing to
achieve higher targets. Significant efforts were made in collecting water saving data from
demonstration farms as well as monitoring wells; analysis of the data was done mainly for the
deduced amount of groundwater abstraction, although not much on stabilization of groundwater
tables. The results of water saving data were explained to beneficiary farmers on “Field Days? in
the demonstration farms.

28.     Methodological Soundness of M&E. The project carefully monitored information on
participating farmers in Component 1 and on implementation progress generally. Monitoring of
pumping provides a valid source of information to confirm reduced ground water abstraction by
project farmers. Monitoring focused on cooperating farmers, and there was no monitoring of
changes in water use by neighboring farmers. There are important methodological challenges in
trying to assess trends in groundwater depletion, and its relationship to changes in water use by
farmers. The 2011 Report “Groundwater Monitoring in Yemen-Data Analysis? prepared by
NWRA contains some useful analysis, but was not consistently followed up to analyze trends in
more depth over a longer period of time. Satellite image analysis confirmed that there was almost
no expansion of irrigation areas by the project farmers.

29.    M&E Sustainability. Various arrangements for continuing monitoring are in place or are
under consideration. As a Bank’s follow-on project of the GSCP, the WSSP will continually
support the CWMU’s M&E operation, including analysis and utilization of water monitoring
systems. It was also confirmed that the issue that had prevented NWRA from accessing WSSP
funds have been resolved. At ICR, CWMU and NWRA were considering how to continue the
systematic analysis of groundwater levels data collected under the GSCP, especially conduct a
cumulative and comparative analysis 5 (which was not carried out due to lack of the government
budget), that would take advantage of the longer time series in the CWMU database, the
dedicated monitoring wells installed and monitoring equipment provided by the GSCP, together
with the data from NWRA, and would be possibly taken over by the follow-up WSSP project if
approved, and the Government would eventually fund such activities from its national budget to
make them sustainable.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
30.    The environmental category of the project is B (partial assessment). The project was
expected to have significant positive environmental impacts in terms of water and soil
conservation. However, some potential negative impacts were expected under Components 1 and



5
    It should be noted that the dispersed location of GSCP activities and small scale relative to overall water
    abstraction, as well as the complexity of aquifer systems and multiple factors affecting depletion, make
    establishing causal relationships between project interventions and changes in groundwater levels a challenge.


                                                         7
2 requiring the Environmental Assessment and Integrated Pest Management. The Environmental
Management Plan (EMP) was prepared in January 2003 and disclosed both in country and in the
Infoshop on March 2003. The EMP included: (i) the prevention of general construction impacts
through the insertion of environmental clauses in the tender documents, and (ii) the prevention of
site-specific impacts through the use of simplified impact analysis at the design stage to develop
site-specific environmental actions.
31.    Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01): An environmental field analysis (EFA) was to
be carried out for construction of medium spate diversion structures and canals and pit
excavations for water retention under Component 2. The findings of the EFAs were: (i) no
adverse impacts are likely to be found on the physical, biological, and social environments as a
consequence of the construction of medium spate diversion works, canals, and pit excavations
for water retention; (ii) no negative impact has been observed during or after implementation of
works; (iii) positive impacts are observed in terms of groundwater recharge, desertification
control and improvement in vegetative cover; and (iv) a decrease of stagnant water can be
observed as a results of the construction.
32.     Pest Management (OP 4.09): The project carried out an integrated pest management
(IPM) action plan including (i) training of trainers; (ii) IPM demonstrations; (iii) public
awareness campaign; and (iv) groundwater quality analysis. Adequate resources and staff were
put in place for IPM training and implementation. As a result, the project has trained a total of
1,251 farmers, and five IPM Plans were adopted in four Governorates (Hadramaut, Hodeidah,
Dhamar and Lahej).
33.     Physical Cultural Resources (OP 4.11): The EMP recommended precautionary measures
to prevent any damage to cultural objects. It was reported that only one cultural site discovered
in Haksar, in the Dhamar governorate. According to the EMP, it was promptly notified the
General Authority for Antiquities, Museums, and Manuscripts and appropriate measures were
taken to avoid any disturbance of the cultural property. No further discovery was made
thereafter.
34. Procurement - Works and goods were procured in accordance with the respective
procedures approved by the Bank. The Procurement Plan was revised and updated from time to
time and Bank’s approval was provided as necessary. Principal items procured under the project
were civil works (buildings and storage hangers); equipment (vehicles, heavy equipment, office
and technical equipment); material (PVC/polyethylene/ galvanized iron pipes and fittings and
localized on-farm irrigation systems); and services (technical assistance and training).
35. To ensure a greater involvement of the communities, the concept of "community contracts"
was adopted under the GSCP in September 2005 as an implementation procedure for small
works under spate improvement and water harvesting works. This procedure allowed for
contracts with a value not exceeding US$10,000 per contract using fixed unit rates approved by
IDA and valid for one year. These rates were revised annually. In some cases, when some
communities/WUGs were not willing to implement works costing less than US$10,000 on this
basis, the FU Director resorted to a competitive bidding procedure for implementing such works
by calling quotations.
36. In general, the GSCP has sustained adequate capacity at the PCU level throughout the life
of the project. The PCU had conducted the procurement activities according to the agreed
procedures without any major noncompliance issue. During the implementation period, a total of
3,394 contracts for procurement of Goods, Consultancy Services and Training, and Works were
                                                8
signed. However, there were some problems during the implementation of contracts that are not
related to procurement but had a direct impact on its process. Some contracts were not completed
or cancelled due to different reasons such as site disputes, poor design and lack of capacity in
contract management. 6 The last batch of additional pipes was not delivered before the closing
date of the IDA grant due to security problem in the country, which was eventually paid from the
Revolving Fund, instead of IDA grant.
37.      Financial Management (FM) – The PCU maintained FM arrangements adequately during
most of the project life. The FM staff was qualified enough to carry out the FM tasks
appropriately and implement adequate internal control procedures complying with the acceptable
FM Manual. The GSCP has a well-functioning automated accounting system following the cash
basis of accounting and connected with FUs in the governorates. The system was transferred to
National Irrigation Program 7 (NIP) which can benefit from such success and utilize the system in
those FUs. During the project life, all withdrawal applications were smoothly processed except
during the political and security crisis that affected Yemen in 2011 and led the Bank to suspend
the disbursements across the Yemen portfolio from July 28, 2011 to January 20, 2012. All audit
reports were timely submitted to the Bank with unqualified (clean) opinion. In the management
letters, none of the issues flagged by the external auditors was so material and no accountability
issues have been identified.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
38.     In order to smooth the arrangements for the project’s operational phase, the GSCP was
merged with the NIP after closure. However, a significant number of GSCP staff (293) are
without any position under NIP at the time of ICR preparation. Since NIP was designed to cover
the whole country, it is necessary to establish several more FUs in governorates without these
units, besides the three priority basins where the WSSP started working. It is not clear how the
Government is going to maintain the function of the 11 FUs established under the GSCP. Since
NIP is planning to carry out a large number of community contract works requiring intensive
supervision, it is crucial to maintain qualified FU staff in all governorates.
39.     Since mobilizing FUs staff trained under the GSCP is crucial for reconstructing the
country after the political turmoil in 2011/2012, the MAI agreed to use the revolving fund (US$1
million) established under the GSCP and its Agriculture and Fisheries Production Promotion
Fund (AFPPF – YR500 million) for expanding irrigation modernization to be carried out by FUs
(other than Dhamar, Sana’a and Amran basins covered by the WSSP). The Government might
also seek additional financing for the WSSP (after making substantial progress in WSSP
disbursement) and possible co-financing from Saudi Fund (which announced a financial support
for Yemen in late May 2012 amounting to $3.25 billion).
40.    There is no major sustainability issue expected with regard to the modern irrigation
systems developed under Component 1 since they belong to private farmers who carefully
operate and maintain their own systems. However, there are clear indications that the
beneficiaries consider the Government to be responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M)


6
    There were significant delays in implementation of civil works, particularly spate diversion works awarded to
    local contractors with inadequate survey and designs, beneficiaries’ non-cooperation to facilitate access of
    contracts to sites, and shortage of diesel.
7
    The NIP is an irrigation agency under the MAI and one of the implementing agencies of the WSSP. The
    Government considers NIP as an official successor of the GSCP.

                                                        9
of project interventions under Component 2. O&M of spate irrigation schemes is supposed to be
carried out by WUAs. While beneficiaries of the small spate irrigation schemes contributed their
share to the project in kind during implementation, those of medium spate irrigation schemes did
not contribute any but local councils advanced such cash contribution with an agreement that the
beneficiary would pay back with installments. So far, no beneficiaries are following this
agreement, which manifest a lack of ownership of these medium spate irrigation schemes and
poses an issue of sustainability for these schemes. This issue needs to be followed up under the
WSSP.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
41.     The project development objective (PDO): “to assist the Government in promoting
groundwater conservation in farming areas and increasing surface water and groundwater
availability? is still a highly relevant priority in Yemen in terms of mitigating the rapidly
emerging freshwater shortage. The PDO is in line with the Government’s National Water Sector
Strategy and Investment Program Update (2008 – 2015) to improve the Yemeni population’s
sustainable and economically efficient use of the nation’s scarce water resources. It is also in line
with the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy for Yemen (April, 2009) for the period of FY2010-
2013 in terms of its strategic objectives (iv) “help manage natural resources scarcity and natural
risks?, especially to slow down the depletion of water resources. The project design and
implementation were consistent with the PDO, including investments to increase irrigation
efficiency, agreements with individual farmers to restrict horizontal expansion of their irrigated
areas, and efforts to establish an institutional framework for community groundwater
management.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
42.     The project has attained the first sub-objective of the PDO “promoting groundwater
conservation in farming areas? through “improving irrigation water use efficiency?, “increasing
farmer returns to water?, and “creating the conditions to allow them to reduce groundwater
pumping from aquifers towards sustainable level?. The amount of water saved by the project
interventions is estimated at 82.8 million cubic meters (MCM) against the target of 76 MCM
(PDO Indicator 1) and 50,868 ha of farmlands are equipped with modern irrigation systems
against the target of 44,500 ha (PDO Indicator 2). Farmers saved money and labor, while getting
higher yields and productivity per unit of groundwater abstracted increased substantially (See
Annex 3) but did not expand irrigation area (PDO Indicator 3) in accordance with the tripartite
agreement. Although the groundwater pumping from aquifers has been reduced by project
farmers, some of the aquifers are being depleted. This is because the project interventions are
scattered over 15 governorates and too small to have tangible impacts on aquifer depletion (See
Table 1 below).
43.    The second objective of the PDO “increasing surface and groundwater availability?
through “improving recharge and protection of watersheds? and “supporting the groundwater
management framework and institutions that will have the incentive and capacity to manage
local water resources in a sustainable manner? has also been mostly attained with delay. The
improvement of small and medium spate irrigation schemes took significant time to complete
them while bank protection works, terraces and other water harvesting structures were carried
out on schedule as a result of introduction of “community contract? arrangements. The areas

                                                 10
covered by the watershed protection and recharge enhancement works reached about 4,940 ha
against the target of 5,640 ha (PDO indicator 4). The project facilitated establishment of a legal
framework (by-law for the Water Law) to manage groundwater effectively and provided expert
training for selected staff from water agencies to increase their capacity to manage local water
resources in a sustainable manner. About 2,580 WUGs (39,000 farmers) were established against
the target of 2,000 WUGs (PDO Indicator 5), 100 demonstration farms were established and 550
flow meters were provided against the targets of 105 and 600 respectively (PDO Indicator 6) to
promote local water resources management. However, the Government did not allocate budget
for CWMU and NWRA to carry out monitoring and data analysis of groundwater, and to
promote effective and sustainable local water resources management by local governments and
communities (See Table 1 below).

3.3 Efficiency
44.     Overall Efficiency of the project is high based on the economic and financial analyses
presented in Annex 3. The total project investment costs were confronted with quantifiable
project benefits resulting from Components 1 and 2. These benefits are accrued by the project
investments in piped irrigation conveyance and localized on-farm irrigation systems under
Component 1; and spate diversions, terrace rehabilitation, wadi bank protection works, and water
harvesting structures under Component 2. Both Components resulted in: (i) increased
productivity in irrigated crops; (ii) reduced costs of production, mainly from less water pumped
from deep aquifers; and (iii) significant water savings, apparently reducing the rate of aquifers
depletion.
45.     According to the analyses, besides saving more than 80 MCM of groundwater per year,
the project investments resulted in: (i) significantly improved levels of family incomes for
project beneficiaries, increasing from 13.8 to 27% 8 over the previous levels; (ii) an economic
rate of return (ERR) of 36.4%; and (iii) a net present value (NPV) of YR 13.7 billion (US$62.3
million) when the overall project cash flow is discounted with a 10% annual rate. The combined
effects of increased value of production on benefited farms together with reduction in production
costs (mainly from the reduction of groundwater pumping by 16%) resulted in a 43% increase of
the pumped water productivity (from YR 53 of net value of production per cubic meter of water
pumped to YR 76).
46.     There are four main reasons for the high ERR obtained by the project, which at appraisal
was estimated at 16.6%: (i) the project’s productive investments (Components 1 and 2) with the
additional financing reached $59 million instead of the budgeted $35 million, increasing
significantly the coverage of project irrigation areas (benefited farms), while the support
Component 3 costs (institutional strengthening and support for the PCU) instead of spending
$18.8 million (representing 35 % of project costs), ended up spending only $14.3 million (19.5
%); (ii) yield increases expected at appraisal were assumed to be 5, 10 and 2% for benefited
areas from piped conveyance, localized irrigation and spate/ water harvesting investments
respectively, ended up being higher: 6, 13 and 3%; (iii) water savings assumed at appraisal to
reach 12 and 30% for piped conveyance and localized irrigation respectively, ended up being 15
and 31%; and (iv) prices of agricultural products have more than doubled in real terms between
2003 (appraisal year) and 2012 (ICR year), making agriculture more profitable than anticipated.
Even though the situation of the aquifers depletion in Yemen continues to be critical, the project
has proven that the critical situation could be mitigated if adequate promotion and effective
enforcing measures are carried out.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
47.    The GSCP has successfully increased the efficiency of agricultural water use as defined
by the PAD, achieving water savings in conveyance and application by introducing piped
conveyance and localized on-farm irrigation systems; enhanced the recharge of groundwater


8
    Expected increases in farmers' income, as a result of project-financed farm investment, ranged from about 13.8%
    to 27% at full development. Increases in family income are greater in on-farm localized irrigation investments (an
    average of 24.5%), followed by spate and water harvesting/soil conservation investments and improved
    conveyance (averaging 21.65% and 16.7% increase respectively).

                                                          12
aquifers by constructing small and medium spate diversions, building and/or rehabilitating
terraces, and building recharge pits and bank protection structures. While most of the physical
targets were attained with some delays and the project attained high efficiency, the overall
outcome is rated as “Moderately Satisfactory?. This is because the project was not able to impact
on the current trend of aquifer depletion in the country and to establish effective and establish
sustainable models for local water resources management by local governments and
communities.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
48.     Many of the farmers assisted by the project are smallholders, who have received
substantial benefits in reduced costs and higher yields. Smaller farmers received a higher rate of
subsidy, which facilitated their inclusion in the project, while subsidies for larger farmers were
limited by an area ceiling. However, it is reported that even with the subsidy some farmers were
unable to come up with the money to cover their cost portion.
49.     From June 2005 to June 2009, about US$1 million was provided from Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF) for the Community-based Water Management Project (CWMP) to
assist in developing replicable models of sustainable self management of local water resources
by poor farming communities in areas where groundwater was becoming increasingly scarce, as
described in more detail in Appendix 9. One of the notable areas of innovation in the CWMP
was the development of separate Women’s WUAs in the context of the gender segregation
prevalent in Yemen. These helped improve awareness of aquifer depletion and opportunities for
more efficient irrigation, as well as engaging in other income earning activities. CWMP thus
demonstrated the feasibility of setting up Women’s WUAs, which could play a useful role in
awareness campaign on groundwater conservation, reporting illegal drilling, expansion of
modern irrigation, and monitoring of groundwater aquifers.
50.     Although CWMP showed the feasibility of developing WUAs for women, these WUAs 9
faced similar sustainability problems to the men’s WUAs, being depend on government funds for
office rents and other expenses, and usually not yet able to provide services sufficient to finance
themselves from member fees or other income, and so at risk of collapse after the project was
over and external funds were no longer available. Except for one group with separate business
activities such as making clothing, the other Women’s WUAs lacked funding to continue after
the project, particularly for renting offices. The follow-up study on CWMP indicated that one is
semi-active and the other inactive. The project also promoted bucket type drip irrigation by
women for home garden vegetable farming to increase nutrition of poor families. However,
within the project, there seems to have been limited interest in these, though this was later taken
up by a USAID project.




9
    One women’s WUA has developed separate business activities such as making clothing and remains sustainable.


                                                        13
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
51.     The most significant institutional development outcome from the project is probably the
establishment of the Irrigation Advisory Service. As discussed in the Beneficiary Impact Survey,
the services of IAS are appreciated, seemed to have had an impact on irrigation practices, and
there is a demand for more services. IAS teams are currently arranged as part of the NIP, and so
their longer-term institutional structure will depend on the outcome of the current review of
alternatives for institutionalizing NIP.
52.     Issuance of the By-Laws to the Water Law in 2011 means there is now a stronger basis
for legal authority of WUAs. Having this available should also allow shifting emphasis from the
regulatory framework to the practical issues of improving the capacity of WUAs to deliver
services that users value, and are willing to contribute to.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
53.    The project contributed to climate change adaptation by promoting awareness of
groundwater depletion among farmers who use 95% of the available water in the country and
provided monitoring equipment for groundwater levels as well as flow meters for irrigation
pumps to control water use by farmers themselves. The project also supported rain water
harvesting infrastructure (terraces, spate diversions, groundwater recharge pits, check dams, etc.)
which can be valuable means to cope with climate change impact in Yemen.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
54.      A beneficiary survey (April-May 2012) carried out interviews with a stratified sample of
100 beneficiaries in five Field Units, 23 non-beneficiaries, and 20 key informants, along with 38
focus group discussions, and system walk-throughs. Annex 5 summarizes findings from the
survey. The survey found very positive evaluations of the project implementation and impact. In
Component 1, for piped conveyance systems, 94% of farmers reported increased incomes, and
80% for localized on-farm irrigation systems. Most farmers (77%) agreed with the cost-sharing
arrangement, but small farmers had cash flow problems that made it difficult to pay before
harvest time. As a sign of their level of interest, 44% of farmers said they would accept half the
current level of subsidy in future cost-sharing. Farmers felt the main benefits were from reduced
labor, increased yields, and water savings, with even stronger impacts for the localized on-farm
irrigation systems. Detailed interviews found that on average farmers saved 46% in pumping
costs, 39% in diesel fuel, and 54% in labor. However, only a few farmers, 4% for piped
conveyance and 9% for localized on-farm irrigation systems, said that the project had a positive
impact on groundwater levels. In relation to sustainability, farmers definitely expected to
maintain the piped and localized on-farm irrigation systems by themselves, and have already
been doing so, although farmers did express concerns about the availability of spare parts. Focus
group discussions found that “particularly with regards the piped conveyance systems
subcomponent, a problem solving partnership has developed with farmers.?
55.     In Component 2, farmers, including small farmers, said they were consulted about site
selection and design of spate works and water harvesting works, and all felt satisfied with the site
selection and design. In many cases, designs followed the traditional structures. Farmers
appreciated the flexibility in making changes in design during construction. Water tanks were
built through community contracts, making the work farmer-driven. In all cases, these works
were expanded by additional contributions from beneficiaries, an indication of local interest and

                                                14
support, which substantially increased the project impact. In spate works, farmer contributions
were in kind. Farmers said their inability to contribute in cash was due to the low returns in spate
agriculture, time constraints on when funds had to be provided, and relatively weak organization
and lack of official status of WUGs. For spate works, 86% of farmers felt their income had been
increased and 83% for water harvesting structures. Farmers expected to contribute labor for
maintenance, but expected the Local Council and GSCP FUs to be at least partly responsible for
maintenance.
56.     In relation to Component 3, beneficiaries felt that Water User Groups (WUGs) had
contributed to implementation, and to improving awareness of water issues, with 72% saying
that WUGs were helpful. In regard to restrictions in the Tripartite Agreement, the majority of
small farmers still agreed with not expanding irrigated land (63%) and not growing qat 69%. For
larger farmers, only 48% agree on non-expansion, and 42% agree on not growing qat. However,
the number disagreeing with the restrictions does also show the need for additional efforts to
regulate groundwater use beyond the Tripartite Agreement. The survey found several interesting
examples of farmers converting qat fields to other crops, as well as communities making rules on
well spacing e.g. 500 meters apart, restricting digging of new wells, and coordinating pumping,
for example through interconnecting pipe networks from different wells. For local agreements to
regulate well drilling, well spacing or pumping time, as well as conflict resolution, farmers felt
this should be done through formal or informal community institutions, not through WUGs.
Farmers appreciated the training from IAS and wanted more of it, with 56% reporting having
made changes in their irrigation practices as a result of IAS training.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Significant
57.     Although beneficiaries are currently supposed to be fully responsible for O&M of small
and medium spate irrigation systems, reports indicate that they lack capacity and are not carrying
out O&M for diversion structures and major canals in medium schemes, which may create a
substantial risk that works built under the GSCP may not sustain benefits for their expected
lifetimes. It appears necessary to provide some government funding to stimulate beneficiaries
mobilization. The Minister of MAI, clarified that in view of the result of his last visit to Wadi
Zabid, he has issued a decree that O&M of these schemes is the responsibility of Tihama
Development Authority and government offices on a temporary basis. This issue will be
followed up under the irrigation sector strategy review of the WSSP.
58.     Although water monitoring and accounting is incomplete and there are important
uncertainties about changes in water balances and groundwater levels, there appears to be a large
risk that, even though GSCP farmers may have substantially reduced their pumping, the larger
goal of controlling groundwater depletion will not be achieved unless a different approach to
intervention is applied that can reduce groundwater consumption at a community scale.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
59.     The Bank preparation team was highly effective in identifying and designing a project
aimed to tackle the most urgent development issue of Yemen which is the most water scarce
country in the world. As mentioned in the Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio (QALP) in
November 2008, the team was right in pursuing major needed policy objectives (i.e. increasing
the price of diesel fuel and reducing the subsidy) on a parallel track, with persistent sector and
country management involvement, rather than as conventional project conditionality. The
creation of the IAS and formal WUAs as federations of WUGs under the project, the provision
of an Inspector General for civil works quality control, and the Tripartite Agreements with
beneficiaries on water usage – have proven timely and valuable.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
60.     The Bank team has worked hard and effectively on many fronts, such as obtaining
substantial foreign grant resources (e.g. JSDF) to strengthen broader aspects of project
implementation; on integrating progress on this project with the increasing number of new
operations in the sector; and specifically working to help scale up the project directly by
designing an Additional Financing to expand the scope of the project. Although Bank missions
requested the PCU and CWMU to carry out hydrological monitoring and analysis, they were not
carried out by the project except for the period when an international expert was mobilized to
carry out this. Since the Bank team solved most problems and attained almost full disbursement
despite difficult security situations in the country, it deserves a “satisfactory" rating.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
61.      Throughout project preparation and implementation, the Bank team was consistent in
promoting the use of modern irrigation systems and more efficient water management by local
stakeholders represented by WUGs and successfully carried out this task. Bank has provided
critical project management support including procurement advice on problematic contracts,
financial management assistance, technical guidance on piped conveyance and localized on-farm
irrigation systems and groundwater monitoring, environmental assessment, and social, poverty
and gender assessment of the project impacts. Bank’s prompt responses to queries from the PCU
and other GOY agencies were appreciated, which significantly contributed to facilitating project
implementation. Overall, Bank Performance is rated as “Satisfactory?.




                                               16
5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
62.    Counterpart funding for infrastructure investments was provided as agreed, although with
some delays. Constraint of local budget for collection and analysis of groundwater data by
CWMU and NWRA had been the major problem throughout project implementation. As a result,
no valuable analysis carried out for measuring the impact of the project on stabilization of the
groundwater aquifers. During the initial stage of project implementation, there were delays in
approvals of imported equipment by the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank of Yemen, and
delays in release of such equipment by customs authorities. Except these, the Government was
generally responsive to issues raised by supervision missions. After a prolonged process of
preparation and discussion, By-Laws to the Water Law to manage groundwater resources in the
country were issued in 2011. Security of the country was unstable throughout project
implementation period due to political conflicts, which became worse in 2011.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
63.     As implementing agency, MAI supported effective implementation of project activities,
even during periods of political unrest. The performance of the PCU and FUs of the MAI is
commendable. The PCU and FUs were very well organized in terms of procurement, inventory
management and FM, which had been computerized and connected through internet. PCU and
FU management kept motivation of their staff high throughout implementation. Despite difficult
security situations in the rural Yemen, PCU and FU staff carried out their tasks without any
major troubles to attain targets assigned to them to improve water resources management. They
reached out to poor farmers living remote mountains who had never received government’s
support before. Beneficiary farmers appreciated their dedicated support throughout project
implementation, in particular valuable advice provided by IAS teams of FUs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
64.     Although the Government was not able to maintain security situation for smooth project
implementation in the country due to political conflicts, the implementing agency, in particular
PCU and FU staff of MAI had dedicated themselves and significantly contributed to surpassing
most of the physical targets. Despite difficult security, social and environmental situations in the
country, they had successfully outreached to poor farmers in remote mountain areas to improve
their livelihoods by properly managing water resources. In consideration of these, overall
Borrower Performance is rated as “Satisfactory?.

6. Lessons Learned
(i) Project Design: At project completion, the GSCP has met most of its objectives based on
    the original PDO indicators and shown that farmers can reduce groundwater abstraction,
    saving water, saving money, and increasing yields and profits. However, the project was
    designed on the assumption that reducing extraction of water from an aquifer and reducing
    losses between the pump and the crop would make more water available for other uses. It

                                                17
       was not specified at the time whether those other uses were intended to be (a) current use by
       other "non-project" farmers in the aquifer, (b) current use by other sectors or (c) future use.
       The project design did not require proper monitoring or accounting for recoverable return
       flows and changes in beneficial and non-beneficial ET. In practice, in GSCP, the focus on
       “water savings? in terms of reducing conveyance and field application “losses? seems to
       have contributed to excessive focus on reducing farmers' water expenditure and on
       increasing water productivity in farming. As a result, the project did not move communities
       toward comprehensive reductions in water consumption and effective management of
       aquifer depletion in local areas. Without a more systemic approach, the spread of more
       “efficient? irrigation technologies may actually have made groundwater use more profitable
       and so risked accelerating rather than reducing groundwater depletion. Indeed satellite
       monitoring indicates that total water consumption from cropped fields in the project areas
       has increased. This is consistent with the understanding in the global literature of
       agricultural water management that was evolving at the time of project implementation. The
       new understanding from global experience and the results of the satellite monitoring
       indicate that the original design was inadequate to overcome aquifer depletion 10 . If
       formulated today, the PDOs would be based on: (a) a clear statement of how the various
       flows involved in irrigation (abstraction, application, consumption through ET, runoff, and
       recharge) would be impacted by the project investments; (b) projected impacts on aquifer
       life; and (c) implications for competing uses of water. Future PDOs for water resources
       management projects should identify possibly conflicting objectives: (a) to improve
       irrigation technology which makes pumping MORE profitable; (b) to allow larger areas to
       be irrigated per unit of water pumped; and (c) to increase agricultural production at the
       expense of water for other high priority uses such as drinking water. They would need to
       build in mechanisms for controlling these conflicting objectives inside and outside the
       project areas as well as after the project. Future PDOs should also acknowledge openly that
       the global experience and technology to monitor these issues are both evolving rapidly and
       should build in flexibility to adapt to new insights and learning during the course of
       implementation.
(ii) Needs for Holistic Groundwater Aquifer Management: As assessed by the QAE7 report,
     the main weakness of project design was that the project’s main instrument governing water
     extraction (the tripartite agreement) was a contract with individual farmers while the
     regulation of extraction needed to be broadened to encompass the entire population of
     stakeholders using the groundwater aquifer. As later became evident, the farmer
     organizations - water user groups and associations (WUGs and WUAs) were not able to act
     as strong self-policing forces in regard to water extraction. In this regard, more efforts need
     to be placed on developing a broader set of local regulatory institutions such as Aquifer

     Under GSCP, satellite-based measurements of changes in ET between 2006 and 2010 were carried out for 487
     project well sites, for a radius of 100-150 meters including project farmers and neighboring fields. Despite some
     uncertainties, these estimates indicate that, particularly at some sites, there has been a net increase in ET from
     cropped areas. This measured difference could be the combined result of several things including higher yields
     that increased transpiration, the small increases in irrigated area and cropping intensity by project farmers,
     changes in water use by neighboring farmers, and other factors. Increased water consumption in irrigated areas
     would reduce the net savings, compared to the estimates calculated from reductions in pumping. However, the
     available data and resources at ICR were not sufficient to make conclusive estimates of the net water balance.

    Management Organizations involving local leaders, local authorities, and other stakeholders
    to holistically manage groundwater aquifers by eliminating free-riders. To realize this, the
    future investment needs to be focused on selected priority critical basins.
(iii) Sustainable O&M for Spate Irrigation Schemes: Policy for O&M of medium scale
      diversion structures and canals should be re-assessed as part of the planned irrigation
      strategy review under NIP, considering government funding for O&M of spate diversion
      weirs and major canals through AFPPF, with WUAs closely involved in planning and
      supervising O&M. It seems unrealistic to expect high beneficiary contribution for spate
      irrigation investments because the anticipated return from spate irrigation is much smaller
      than investment in irrigation modernization. In this regard, it would be more appropriate to
      significantly reduce the rate of beneficiary contribution for medium spate irrigation schemes
      with a condition that the beneficiary will carry out O&M of secondary and tertiary canal
      systems.
(iv) Community Contracts: The implementation of small works by the communities through
     “Community Contracts? was found to be a great success in terms of quality of works and
     creation of the sense of ownership by the communities involved. The infrastructure built by
     them such as terraces, water tank, wadi bank protection, and small spate diversions, etc. also
     significantly contributed to managing water resources for improving livelihood of the
     communities. This arrangement also provided excellent job opportunities to poor rural
     communities in remote mountainous areas. Such activities have been succeeded by the
     WSSP to help increase resilience of the rural communities against climate change impact.
(v) Alternative Livelihoods: The GSCP has helped develop and demonstrate institutional and
    technical methods that can help slow aquifer depletion, but for areas where affordable
    groundwater stocks are being exhausted, assistance should also be provided to help farmers
    cope with the transition to non-irrigated livelihoods. This would include specific support for
    transitions to alternative livelihoods. As part of this, it would be useful to explore win-win
    mechanisms, including buyouts or early retirement of irrigated land, to compensate farmers
    for reducing irrigated area and water consumption. This would need to be done only where
    local regulation was effective enough to limit irrigated area or water consumption, so that
    reductions by one farmer are not simply used by others. Payments might be done on a lease
    basis with payments contingent on continued compliance, which can be monitored by local
    observation and satellite imagery. Win-win compensation levels should be attractively
    higher than the income from irrigated agriculture, which would still be much cheaper than
    the opportunity cost of additional water supply from other sources, such as inter-basin
    transfer or desalination.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies
       (i) Ratings of Project Performance in ISRs
65.     Practically all the IDA supervision missions have rated the performance of the project as
“Satisfactory?. Further, in spite of the unrest in the country during 2011, the GSCP attained most
of its development objectives and resulted in: (i) annual savings of more than 80 MCM of water
from the beneficiaries (about 16 % of what was being used before the project); (ii) an increase in
20 % on beneficiaries’ net farm income; (iii) 43 % average increase on water productivity (from
US$0.24 to US$0.35 per m3 of water pumped); (iv) investments yielding a 36.4 % ERR; and (v)

                                                19
organized WUGs, and public agencies strengthened, in order to better handle the growing water
availability problem in Yemen. Even though the situation of the aquifer depletion continues to be
critical, at least the project has proven that it is possible to improve the situation if adequate
promotion and complementary enforcing measures are taken in the future. This is the most
successful IDA assisted project and, in view of above, the Government strongly recommends
that the IP performance rating may be improved from “Moderately Satisfactory? to
“Satisfactory?.

(ii) Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
66.     The risk rating has been assigned on two counts: (i) Risk of O&M of the diversion
structures; and (ii) the larger goal of controlling groundwater depletion will not be achieved
unless a different approach is adopted that can reduce groundwater consumption at a community
scale. Regarding the Risk of O&M of Diversion Structures, this is a national issue and not only
specific to the GSCP. The Government has taken strong measures to address this problem as
follows:
(i) In 2011, Cabinet Decree No. 112 concerning the Executive By-laws of the Water Law No.
    (33) and its amendments were issued. Article XIV stipulates that “if the percentage of
    members at the general assembly of the water users’ association reaches two thirds of the total
    beneficiaries of the common water source, the decision made by the general assembly shall be
    mandatory for all the beneficiaries of that source.? In conjunction with other existing
    regulations, such as the Local Authority Law, (which can help support enforcement against
    violators); this apparently provides a legal basis for WUA authority to control water and
    infrastructure and mobilize fees from members for the O&M. It should be noted that the scope
    of WUAs under the By-laws covers all users of the water source, not only irrigators. Thus
    WUAs can act as Aquifer Management Organizations. This represents important progress
    strengthening the legal authority of WUAs, which should be widely disseminated and used to
    support development of WUAs, including O&M of spate schemes and community
    groundwater management; and
(ii) The MAI has already issued a decree that O&M of the spate schemes in Wadi Zabid shall be
    responsibility of Tihama Development Authority and the Government offices on a temporary
    basis till institutional set up of existing WUAs and Irrigation Council are evaluated and
    assessed. The Government is considering similar measures for other spate irrigation schemes.
    Further, the dispersed locations of GSCP activities/ interventions, and small scale relative to
    overall water abstractions (project intervention in about 50,000 ha compared to total
    groundwater irrigated areas of over 400,000 ha), as well as the complexity of the aquifers and
    multiple factors (Qat is one of the major factors) affecting depletion, makes establishing
    casual relationship between project interventions and changes in groundwater levels a
    challenge. The GSCP has demonstrated that the farmers can reduce groundwater abstractions,
    saving water, saving money and increasing yields and profits.
67.     The project investments have resulted in significantly improved levels of family incomes
for project beneficiaries and in robust EIRR and NPV of overall project investments as would be
seen from the table below:

68.    In view of above the Government strongly recommends the risk rating be modified from
“Significant? to “Modest?.

                               Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The project development objective (PDO) is to assist the Government in promoting
groundwater conservation in farming areas and increasing surface water and groundwater
availability through: (i) improving irrigation water use efficiency, thus increasing farmer returns
to water and creating the conditions that would allow them to reduce groundwater pumping from
aquifers towards sustainable levels; (ii) improving recharge and protection of watersheds in order
to increase surface water and groundwater availability through the improvement of small to
medium spate irrigation schemes, bank protection works, terraces and other water harvesting
structures; and (iii) supporting the groundwater management framework and institutions that will
have the incentive and capacity to manage water resources in a sustainable manner.
2.      The GSCP has successfully increased the efficiency of agricultural water use by
introducing piped conveyance and localized on-farm irrigation systems; enhanced the recharge of
groundwater aquifers by constructing medium and small spate diversions, building/rehabilitating
terraces, building recharge pits, and building bank protection structures; and introduced less water
consuming crops such as almond and coffee. While most of the major indicators of Component 1
have been attained and those of Component 2 have also been attained with delay, the
achievement of Component 3 is moderately satisfactory because of lack of usable results from
groundwater monitoring, and limited progress towards establishing effective and sustainable
community groundwater management.

Component 1: Modernization and Improvement of Groundwater Systems
3.     This component aimed to reduce the amount of water used for irrigation in the project
areas by increasing conveyance efficiencies from the tube wells to the fields and also by
improving efficiency of localized on-farm irrigation introducing efficient pressurized irrigation
systems (drip, bubbler, and sprinkler). As a result of this intervention, it was expected to reduce
drawdown speed of groundwater tables which have been accelerated by introduction of diesel
engine generated pumps and tube wells over the decade.
4.      As a result of good reputation among farmers, the demand for installation of conveyance
systems is very high. The hike of diesel prices has accelerated expansion of the coverage of
conveyance systems because they reduce a lot of pumping hours. At the end of the project,
48,530 ha of farmlands were covered by improved conveyance groundwater irrigation and 2,338
ha by localized on-farm irrigation (See Table 2.1 below). Increases in water productivity, in
terms of kilograms per cubic meter of water, rose from 24 to 31% for piped conveyance systems
and 57-63% for localized irrigation systems. This served 12,003 beneficiary families, compared
to the appraisal target of 11,770, 2% more than the target. It is estimated that the reduction in
pumped water has reached 83 million m3/year, (original target is 77 million m3/year) at the end
of the GSCP. With the small area covered by modernized systems in any particular location, and
limited analysis of monitoring data, it is difficult to assess impacts in quantitative terms, but
there are anecdotal reports of the rate of drawdown slowing down.
5.      During implementation, “land leveling activity? was cancelled because equipment (laser-
guided grader) cost far beyond the appraisal estimate and the Government was not keen to carry
out this demonstration by purchasing such expensive equipment.

Component 2: Improvement of Spate Irrigation, Water Harvesting, and Soil Conservation
6.       This component aimed to improve spate conveyance, diversion efficiency and
groundwater recharge through building small and medium diversion weirs, to reduce soil erosion
and enhance groundwater recharge through rehabilitation of terraces and construction of water
harvesting structures. At the end of the project, 62 small and medium spate diversion weirs, 141
canal control structures, and 172 wadi bank protections were built (See table 2.2 below). Spate
irrigation systems served 13,356 beneficiary families compared to the appraisal estimate of 5,746,
though much of this increase was because farm size turned out to only average 1.5 ha per family,
compared to the estimate at appraisal of 4 ha per family.

7.      Moreover, 356 km of terraces were rehabilitated, 293 wadi bank protections were carried
out in upland, 24 check dams were built, and 740 water harvesting tanks were constructed (See
Table 2.3 below). Water harvesting works served 12,259 families, compared to the appraisal
estimate of 8,350. On-farm water storage tanks served 34,140 families, compared to an appraisal
estimate of 17,000, in part due to farmer contributions that increased the size of the tanks. Thus,
659 tanks with a capacity of 106,000 m3 were built, compared to the appraisal estimate of 350
tanks with a capacity of 53,500 m3. The IAS teams also established 1,800 WUGs having a total
membership of 27,000 farmers through intensive awareness programs among the farmers in the
benefitted areas. Formation of WUGs/WUAs was a prerequisite for investments under

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening of Water Institutions
8.       This component aimed to prove project implementation support, monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) activities, and institutional and capacity building support. While the PCU was
successfully supported by several consultants who provided on-the-job training to PCU and FUs
staff through project implementation, support for Cooperative Agriculture Credit Bank was
limited to construction of its branch in Al-Dhaleh governorate. Institutional capacity building of
Central Water Monitoring Unit (CWMU) was not fully successful because it was not able to
provide any analytical feedback of groundwater monitoring data at on-farm level. Support to
NWRA was not successful because it provided little analytical feedback to the GSCP. The GSCP
provided significant amount of meteorological and hydro-geological equipment as well as
extensive staff training including overseas training, however NWRAs activities were disrupted
by the security situation, as well as their inability to obtain budget. While MWE staff also
received national and overseas training under the project to enhance water policy formulation, its
impact seems to be marginal.
9.      The Irrigation Advisory Service (IAS) teams of FUs supported by the GSCP established
779 WUGs having a total membership of 12,000 farmers in Component One areas, through
intensive awareness programs among the farmers in the basin. Participation in WUGs was a
prerequisite for provision of subsidized conveyance pipes and on-farm irrigation equipment. IAS
teams explained the benefits of joining the WUGs/WUAs and their roles in promoting the use of
water saving technologies and monitoring of the groundwater tables. IAS activities were highly
evaluated and appreciated by all beneficiaries. There is large demand for their services from
farmers who were not involved in the project.

10.      For farm level water monitoring, 125 automatic groundwater level monitoring units were
install, matching the appraisal target of 125, while another 238 manual sites were established,
plus 25 more under the CWMP. For water quality monitoring, 15 automatic units were installed
compared to a target of 20, as well as 572 sites for manual water quality monitoring, for which
there had been no target. For flow meters, 606 were installed compared to an appraisal target of
1,000. At the basin level, NWRA installed 100 automatic ground water level monitoring units,
the same as targeted, plus six manual sites, along with twenty automatic water quality monitoring
units, the same as targeted.

                             Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
A. Summary
1.       Per capita availability of water in Yemen is 136 m3 per year. In the MENA region, its
availability is 1,250 m3 per year, while for the world, the average is 7,500 m3per year. This
already low availability of water in Yemen will gradually be reduce to 65 m3/year by year 2031
which may create an unsustainable situation for human living. In this fragile context the project
aimed to reduce groundwater use for irrigation, reduce soil erosion, increase crop yield and farm
income, promote cooperation among the water users, and strengthen the institutions dealing with
irrigation services.
2.     In spite of the GSCP, groundwater depletion from the aquifers continues to increase at an
alarming rate because the project has reached only to 5 – 10 % of the farmers using groundwater,
and there is almost no control over the other 90 – 95 % of farmers. The project managed to
introduce water saving improvements to irrigated agriculture that at the same time increases
water productivity and farmers’ income, as well as awareness about the urgent need to reverse
the groundwater depletion. Also, project improvements were introduced in the land under rain
fed and spate irrigation.
3.       The GSCP attained most of its development objectives and resulted in: (i) annual savings
of more than 80 million cubic meters (MCM) of water from the beneficiaries (about 16 % of
what was being used before the project); (ii) an increase in 20 % on beneficiaries’ net farm
income; (iii) 43 % average increase on water productivity (from US$0.24 to US$0.35 per m3 of
water pumped); (iv) investments yielding a 36.4 % economic rate of return (ERR); and (v)
organized WUGs, and public agencies strengthened, in order to better handle the growing water
availability problem in Yemen. Even though the situation of the aquifer depletion continues to be
critical, at least the project has proven that it is possible to improve the situation if adequate
promotion and complementary enforcing measures are taken in the future.

B. Background
4.       The main objective of the project was to (i) improve water use efficiency and increase
farmers return to water through adoption of water saving technologies; (ii) increase surface and
groundwater availability through rehabilitation of small to medium spate irrigation schemes,
terrace rehabilitation, bank protection works and other water and soil conservation activities; and
(iii) establish a groundwater management framework and institution to manage local water
resources sustainably through capacity building of government water institutions and community
groups. The project supported the installation of piped conveyance of groundwater for irrigation
purposes in more than 50,000 ha, and localized on-farm irrigation system with drip, bubbler and
micro-sprinkles in more than 2,200 ha. Also, it supported the construction of new small and
medium spate diversion structures and rehabilitated the existing structures, and conducted
rehabilitation works for wadi bank protection and soil erosion control structures. It also improved

                                                29
terrace systems in a command area of more than 1,800 hectares. The installation of ground water
conveyance systems benefited directly almost 48,500 ha and indirectly thousands more. In the
areas where spate diversion structure and bank protection works were constructed, the farmers’
holdings range from 0.5 to 2.0 ha in the lowlands and 0.3 to 0.5 ha in the uplands.
5.      The benefits of the above mentioned project achievements were quantified in order to
assess the efficiency of the project. Other project benefits from activities like the construction of
new on-farm water storage tanks and rehabilitation of the existing tanks providing drinking water
for more than 34,000 families were not quantified. The project also had positive social impacts
and served to upgrade institutions for better serving the water issues. The project promoted the
formation of WUGs and organized farmers’ workshops, carried out awareness campaigns and
established demonstration works. Today there is an enhanced base for undertaking more
effective actions to handle the urgently needed reduction of groundwater use to bring it to
sustainable levels.

C. Main Assumptions
6.       The project environmental, social, and institutional impacts are difficult to assess. Project
benefits on crop production and in the amount of groundwater water saved and the changes in
water productivity were estimated as they are measurable. The financial impact on agricultural
production and on farmers' income was analyzed with the help of detailed crop and farm models
illustrative of typical farming situations in the main agro-ecological zones. Tables 1 to 24 in the
Appendix (GSCP_ICR_Results Final.xls) show the detailed crop budgets for the most important
crops cultivated in the project areas. Farm models (Tables 25 to 34) represent small and medium
size farmers, with typical cropping patterns, water availability and depth, costs of pumping,
different improved irrigation investments, and the project levels of incentives provided;
reflecting the situation of the benefited farmers. Tables also illustrate the effect of investments on
family income and returns per day of family labor, water usage and productivity of water.
7.      Yields and Land use. The annual data collected from demonstration farms by the project
shows that productivity per ha has increased on average by about 10 % as a result of the
improved conveyance and by 15 % for the localized irrigation installed under the project.
Considering that the demo farms could be better assisted by the project, it was conservatively
assumed for this assessment that crop production increased by 6 %, 13 %, and 3 % under piped
conveyance, localized on-farm improvements, and spate irrigation systems respectively.
Assumptions regarding yield increases and the no-change in the cropping patterns under the
“with? project scenario, were conservative assumptions adopted for avoiding overestimation of
benefits. Given the successful constraint of non-expansion agreements of irrigated areas and the
limitations on the use of saved water, the evaluation assumed no changes or increases in cropped
area under the “with? project scenario for improved conveyance and localized irrigation
investments. Under the spate irrigation systems crop mix was also not changed. Based on field
observations and previous experience, a moderate increase in spate irrigated area was assumed
(about 17.5 %).
8.      Water use efficiency. Based on project's data, piped conveyance of ground water and
localized on-farm irrigation systems are saving around 15% and 32% of water pumped,
respectively. The more than 50,000 ha under the improved conveyance and the more than 2,200
ha with localized irrigation are allowing saving about 80 MCM of water annually. Although the
unit cost of extracting water was expected to decrease under the project scenario compared to the

                                                 30
without project situation, the lack of recharge-extraction balance in the aquifers leads to pumping
needs coming from deeper water tables. Hence, the cost of pumping was assumed to remain
similar per m3 of water under both scenarios.
9.      Prices. Given that the Yemen Rial (YR) is currently determined in the open market and
trade restrictions are low, it was assumed that domestic prices of tradable goods and services are
fairly well aligned with border economic values. Hence, for the purposes of economic analysis
the only adjustment introduced to the market prices was for rural labor. The shadow labor cost
was estimated at 70% of the prevailing market rates. In the case of water, a shadow price of
YR52.80 per m3 could be considered based on a weighted average net returns for water used per
m3 pumped for the crops being cultivated in the project area. Still, for this assessment water was
not valued given that according to the satellite images ET continued to increase in the project’s
area apparently due to intensification of production of non-project farmers in surrounding areas.
10.     Crop and Farm Models. With these assumptions, average crop budget from different
agro climatic zones under the “with? and “without project? scenarios were prepared using
FARMOD software. The 24 crop models for the main crops in different agro-ecological zones,
and 10 farm budget models allowed for estimating the project financial and economic results.
The farm models included: (i) 4 models representing beneficiaries of the piped conveyance of
groundwater; (ii) 4 models for farmers incorporating localized irrigation systems; and (iii) 2
models showing typical farms benefiting from spate improvements and water harvesting
structures. From the analysis of these model budgets and results, it can be concluded that
farmers are having a significant increase averaging about 20 % in their on-farm income, mainly
as a result of the technical assistance and water saving investment financed under the project.
11.     Economic benefits and the related incremental costs were estimated based on the
incremental net revenue derived from the crop models and the aggregate cropped area by the
beneficiaries. Project investment facilitated also improving labor productivity and food security
for these households, being instrumental for poverty alleviation.
12.     Project cost, including farmers' contribution, ended up being US$80.6 million as shown
in Annex 1, of which beneficiaries' contribution was US$15 million (18.7 %), the government
contributing with US$11.32 million (14 %) and the IDA credit and grant financing about
US$54.2 million (67.3 %). Excluded from the economic analysis were: (i) the costs and benefits
of the small on-farm water storage tanks and rehabilitation of the existing water tanks, as the
expected social benefits are difficult to quantify; (ii) the costs and benefits from investments for
digging water pits in wadi beds for groundwater recharge, considering that the environmental
benefits are also difficult to quantify: and (iii) the costs and benefits for strengthening the water
sector institutions (NWRA, MAI and GDI), as their benefit would also be difficult to quantify
and would reach not only direct project beneficiaries, but to the community at large.
13.    Sustainability of project benefits is expected to be likely, given that the increase in water
use efficiencies would have significant effect on their incomes and extend the useful life of
groundwater resources once further measures to enforce norms are in place since investment are
being complemented with improvements in social and human capital through the creation of
WUGs, training, technical assistance, and better access to project technological services. The
combination of improved provision of production related support services, public awareness
campaigns and the continued assistance to mitigate overexploitation of water resources is
expected to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditure in the near future.

D. Economic and Financial Results.
14.     Financial Analysis. The financial analysis aims to assess the impact of the productive
investments undertaken by the project and the benefited farmers. Financial prices at the farm
gate were used in calculation of costs and revenues. Input and output prices were assumed at
2012 constant values, throughout the 20 year time horizon used in the analysis. The financial
discount rate was assumed to be 10%. At the farm level, financial return calculations included
the cost of the incremental on-farm productive investment and recurrent expenditure incurred for
the adoption of the new water management practices and sustainable agricultural production
systems promoted by the IAS. From investment in spate works and rehabilitation of the existing
water harvesting structures, benefits would accrue from a 3% crop yield increase and moderate
expansion (17.5%) in irrigated areas based on improved management of surface water. A
summary of the main results of these farm models are presented in the table below.

15.      Given the reduction of irrigation costs and the level of subsidy provided to the
beneficiaries for the enhancing investments under the project, all representative farms show
significant family income increases and relatively high financial rates of return in spite of the
assumed low levels of productivity increases and no shift in cropping patterns. Expected
increases in farmers' income, as a result of project-financed farm investment, ranged from about
13.8% to 37% at full development. Increases in family income are greater in localized on-farm
irrigation investments (an average of 24.5%), followed by spate and water harvesting/soil
conservation investments and improved conveyance (averaging 21.65% and 16.7 increase
respectively).
16.      Per family day of labor returns, volume of water abstracted and productivity of water are
also derived from the models and shown in Tables 25 to 34 of the Appendix
((GSCP_ICR_Results Final.xls). Under the piped conveyance system, the income per day of
work would increase by 17.5% and productivity of water by 48%. Under the localized on-farm
irrigation subcomponent, labor income would increase by 17.5% and of water productivity by
63.5%.


                                               32
17.      The average financial rate of return (FRR) for the piped conveyance, localized on-farm
irrigation, spate irrigation and water harvesting investment type beneficiaries was calculated
separately for each farm model in both agro-ecological regions (uplands and lowlands). The
average FRR would be more than 100% for improved conveyance, 54.3% for the localized
irrigation beneficiaries, and more than 100% for the spate irrigation and water harvesting
beneficiaries. Localized irrigation produce higher farm income and water productivity increases
but result in lower FRR due to the heavier investment required. Although the incremental yield
per hectare in farms under spate cultivation is negligible compared to the other irrigated land, the
higher level of subsidy in the investment cost (up to 100%) resulted in higher FRR. Spate and
diversion structures serve to reduce soil erosion and control floods, and assures a more even
distribution of water with downstream farmers. Details on these results are in Tables 25 to 34.
18.     Economic Benefits were also calculated on the basis of (i) incremental production from
enhanced returns from irrigated agriculture as more adequate and secure water is delivered to the
fields and improved technology; and (ii) reduced costs of production under irrigation. For the
quantification of the expected increased production and reduced costs, the results obtained from
the crop models were aggregated following the actual cropping pattern of the project benefited
area. Water harvesting and soil conservation subcomponent generate quantifiable benefits in
terms of incremental production. The subcomponent also comprised the following: (iv)
construction of on-farm water storage tanks with an average capacity of 150 m3 for human and
animal drinking, and other household uses, (v) rehabilitation of existing water tanks, and (vi)
construction of traditional water harvesting structures and wadi bed cisterns for groundwater
recharge. These interventions do not generate easily quantifiable benefits, being intended to
provide water for household and/or for recharge the aquifers. In the economic analysis only the
capital investment costs of the interventions that generate quantifiable benefits were considered.
19.     Considering the above mentioned benefits, the overall economic rate of return of the
project was estimated at 36.4%. The analysis was undertaken separately per type of investment
(improved conveyance, localized irrigation, spate and water harvesting). Results are presented in
Tables 35 to 40 in the GSCP ICR_Results Final.xls Appendix, and the summary of results in the
following Table 3. Table 4 shows the overall project economic summary.

20.     Sensitivity Analysis. The project’s ERR is very robust even under the adverse situation
that all agricultural prices could drop from the current levels by 20 %: the ERR of the project
investments would be reduced from 36.4 % to 29.9 %.

                             Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
1.      The study undertook farmers' interviews and focus group discussions in the period April-
May 2012 in five Field Units: Dhamar, Hodeida, Northern -Sana’a, Hadramaut - Seyoun and
Taiz-Ibb. In all 100 beneficiaries were interviewed in addition to 23 non-beneficiaries; 38 focus
group discussions and system walk-throughs were held and 20 key informants were interviewed.
The beneficiaries were selected on the basis of a stratified sample – taking into account small and
large farmers and the different types of facilities developed under the GSCP (piped conveyance
systems; localized irrigation systems; spate irrigation systems and water harvesting).
Component 1
2.      Most farmers agreed with the cost sharing arrangement (77%) However, small farmers,
without supplementary sources of income, found it difficult to pay before the harvest time as
they usually have a cash flow problem. Procedures are assessed as easy by 78% of sampled
farmers, (the design was perceived as satisfactory by 77% of the beneficiary farmers and the
quality of the work was perceived as good by 71% of the beneficiary farmers). From the focus
group discussion it is clear that, particularly with regards the conveyance systems subcomponent,
a problem solving partnership has developed with farmers.
3.     The survey results revealed that 94% of the beneficiary farmers from piped conveyance
systems mentioned that they have realized an increase in income and 80% did so for localized
systems. In this respect the appreciation by small and large farmers is similar.
4.      In the conveyance systems the main benefit realized were reduced labor and increased
crop yields, however, with improved conveyance less wear and tear on the pumping equipment
coming next. In the conveyance systems 75% of the interviewed farmers indicated to have
significantly saved irrigation labor, whereas 25% mentioned that increase in crop productivity to
be above 15% and also 34% of the interviewed farmers mentioned that water savings were more
than 25% on the conveyance system.
5.      The localized systems are more costly but their effect on water savings is also more
pronounced. In case of the bubbler and drip systems, 96% of the interviewed farmers mentioned
that they reduced irrigation labor; 76% of the interviewed farmers' crop production increased
with more than 15% and 68% of interviewed farmers informed that irrigation water use was
reduced by more than 25%. Few farmers (4% of beneficiaries of conveyance and 9% of
beneficiaries of localized systems) viewed that switching over to conveyance and localized
systems had positive significant impact on ground water level
6.      The detailed interviews revealed an average of 46% savings in pumping costs, 39%
saving in diesel consumption, and 54% saving in labor use.
7.      Sustainability appears not to be in doubt. Most of the interviewed farmers see the main
role for themselves in this regard; In case of conveyance systems they would also engage
technicians from the market. In localized systems the backup services of locally available
technicians is (as yet) less than actual demand. The main concern is the availability of spare
parts, which is highlighted by the majority of the interviewed farmers.
8.       In general the appreciation for this program is high as seen not only from the answer of
the beneficiary farmers, but also seen from the waiting lists of farmers to acquire the improved
irrigation systems as discussed in the focus group interviews. In fact 44% of the interviewed
farmers would accept half of the current subsidy in a future cost sharing arrangement.
                                                38
Component 2
9.      Most of the interviewed farmers do not have secondary sources of income (93%) and the
farms are mostly owner-operated (75%). Almost all the beneficiary farmers who participated in
the focus group discussion informed that they were consulted in the selection of the sites and the
development of the design. The involvement of small farmers in the selection of the sites and
development of the designs was even higher (93%) than that of large farmers (67%). In the
sample there was unanimous (100%) satisfaction with both the site selection and the design of
the spate systems among small and large farmers. The discussion with the field engineers of the
Field Units started in an early stage and concerned the selection of the location of structures and
joint visits were made to the proposed sites. In many cases the design closely followed the
traditional infrastructure. There was also a good understanding of actual designs as they emerged
especially in regard to the purpose of the structures (100%) and the maintenance requirements
(78-92%) – with the understanding being higher among small farmers than large farmers. There
has also been a well- appreciated practice of making changes to the designs whilst the work was
on going, especially in the larger spate schemes. This is also necessary as according to 23 % of
small respondents and 44 % of large respondents, there were some objections to the design at
one stage. In general there was a large variety of designs used for all activities taking into
account the local situation.
10.     The common practice in the development of new water tanks was for the beneficiary
group (usually close knit and family related) to take the lead in the development of these
structures, resulting in a large variety of locally adjusted designs. Work in the water tanks was
implemented in the majority of cases of farmers interviewed on the basis of community
contracts. As the standard dimensions under the GSCP for these facilities (150m2) were
considered too small, beneficiary farmers developed, in all cases visited under the assessment,
larger storage facilities with the beneficiary farmers contributing the remainder of the
construction costs themselves.
11.    In contrast in spate irrigation farmers in the group discussions indicated that they were
unable to contribute in cash but instead they could provide labor and building material (stones)
available, whereas the cash contribution was provided by the Local Councils. In the focus group
discussions the inability to contribute in cash were explained by farmers to be attributed to (1)
general low returns in spate based agriculture and the relatively long gestation period of the
investments (2) the time bound nature of the contribution making it difficult to have the cash
ready when required and (3) the relatively weak organization of the Water Users Groups which
is weak in organization and lacking official status. In fact the required cost contribution for the
spate system is comparatively high: with average investment costs ranging between USD 800-
1200/ha, the 15-20% farmer's share of the cost comes to an average of US$ 150-200/ha. This
may be compared to the contribution in the case of piped conveyance, which is on average of 35
% of total costs of around USD 400/ha. This works out to be USD 140/ha.
12.    In focus group discussion and walk through with the beneficiaries the functionality of the
works was assessed under both spate irrigation and water harvesting systems, in. three systems.
In general the participating farmers assess the technical performance of the spate structures
developed under Component 2 as good. The most important drawback is sedimentation, which is
always a major challenge in spate irrigation systems and the encroachment by mesquite
(prosopis juliflora), which is an invasive plant species blocking the water flow in the channels.
In the water harvesting systems farmers indicated that they would have benefitted from more

                                                39
training and guidance in construction as the designs in many cases make much use of the local
conditions but the finishing in some cases can be improved. From the focus group discussion and
walk through in the spate systems it appeared that there is also deferred routine maintenance and
minor unfinished works such as open gabion boxes, scour holes around structures and small-
localized sand deposits.
13.     In general beneficiary farmers who participated in the focus group discussions indicated
that the work under Component 2 had improved their income. 86% of all the beneficiary farmers
under the spate irrigation systems and 83% of all the beneficiary farmers under water harvesting
confirmed this. In spate irrigation systems the water distribution improved: in earlier situation
(prior to the project improvements) large floods might wash out diversion structures, making it
difficult to get the flood water on the land: this particularly affected downstream farmers.
Though the main purpose of the spate irrigation systems was to capture floodwater a large
number of the beneficiary farmers interviewed also indicated that groundwater levels increased
considerably. This is also very much the function of the flood breakers in this subcomponent of
the project.
14.     The development of spate systems reduces wadi banks damage and allows the re-
greening of the areas; similarly the water harvesting activities also have a beneficial impact of
reducing erosion. 64% of the farmers interviewed emphasized this benefit. Other benefits
indicated by many beneficiaries particularly from the rehabilitation of existing water tanks has
been the improved supply of water for drinking and domestic use as well as for livestock. The
rehabilitated water tanks in fact in many cases have improved drinking water as a main purpose.
15.     From the Focus Group Discussion it appears that the WUGs and WUAs are not prepared
with contingencies (bank accounts, equipment) to undertake repairs on the spate and water
harvesting systems. Farmers’ views are that their main contribution in maintenance will be in the
shape of labor. Also in some of the spate system there is only a Water User Group (WUG) in
place, which is very informal in nature. Discussions with the beneficiary farmers showed that
81% do not expect the WUG to take a leading role in maintenance. The majority of small and
large farmers in spate systems are of the view that the responsibility for maintenance lies at least
partly with local council or the GSCP Field Unit. On the other hand, most beneficiary farmers –
especially small farmers - are prepared to maintain the system and contribute to its operation.
Farmers in Component 2 also indicated they would appreciate additional training on basic
construction techniques.
Component 3
16.     The Water Users Groups have been informal in nature – consisting typically of fifteen
farmers. According to the sampled beneficiaries, the WUGs have been very instrumental in the
implementation of the project activities and they also contributed to raising awareness on the
water issues. 72% of the interviewed farmers assessed the WUGs as helpful.
17.      During the fieldwork it appeared that 69% of the small farmers still agree to not growing
qat on their land and 63% still agree on non-expansion; for large farmers this is respectively 42%
and 48%. From this it appears that the regulation of groundwater use needs more efforts than the
tripartite agreements only. There are several examples in the project area where farmers recently
converted qat fields to other crops (peaches and coffee) – in Ibb, Dhamar and Sana’a. There are
examples of farmers putting in place rules on the minimum distance between wells (500 meter),
the development of new wells and on coordinating pumping operations. Local agreements

                                                40
concern conserving water and limiting abstractions were agreed to by 55% and 53% of the
interviewed farmers respectively. These rules are in most cases (80%) enforced through informal
local leadership. The resolution of local conflicts is through informal local leadership, the role of
the WUGs was confined to project activities and raising awareness.
18.     According to the last Progress Report there were eleven WUAs active within the GSCP.
The WUAs assessed during the field survey and focus group discussions consisted of committees
with regular meetings. In some case the WUAs also have their own office. The scope of the
WUAs has gone beyond facilitating project activities but has also concerned the regulation of
water resources – in liaison with the National Water Resources Authority. The WUAs that were
visited also endeavored to provide direct services such as the regulating access to diesel supplies
during the diesel shortage experienced during the political unrest of 2011.
19.    There is much interest from farmers in the services of the IAS, especially in training. The
demand in fact appears far more than the project could offer within constraints of time and
transportation facilities. A limited number (28%) of the farmers attended training directly
including visit to demonstration farms or workshop. A regular ‘complaint’ of farmers was that
they would have like to have more support in this regard and did not see the IAS as frequently as
they would have like to. This reflects on the large needs for the services as provided by IAS.
20.     The appreciation for training was generally positive particularly among farmers using the
localized system, where 78% give it score high, however, only 53% of the beneficiaries using
conveyance systems expressed their appreciation of the training. Of all farmers interviewed in
Component 1, 56% mentioned that they made a modification to their cropping system following
the advice of IAS. In general, the services of the project, in particular the Field Unit, have been
appreciated as 74% of the beneficiary farmers ranked it as excellent.

                    Annex 6. Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results
Since the security situation prevented the ICR Mission from traveling outside of Sana’a, a
workshop was held on Monday, November 5, 2012, attended by WUA leaders, as well as heads
of the FUs. Participants were divided into smaller groups and asked to discuss project results and
lessons. In the first session, two groups of WUA leaders, two groups of FU directors, and one
group from national agencies and Sana’a Basin were asked to discuss what changes there had
been in relation to yields and groundwater use, what happened to saved water, changes in
groundwater depletion and involvement of small farmers. In the second session, groups based on
geographic areas were asked about lessons, positive and negative, concerning community
groundwater management, spate scheme operation and maintenance, expanding installation of
pipes and localized irrigation equipment, and monitoring groundwater. Some key points from the
group reports are shown below:

Impacts
   •   Increases in crop yield, quantity and quality, decreases in weeds and crop diseases, less
       fuel and labor used, and longer life for pumps and engines.
   •   Decreases in water losses and groundwater abstraction, minimizing drawdown, and some
       positive changes in groundwater levels
   •   The irrigation advisory service was successful
   •   Spate irrigation led to increased recharge, which reduced groundwater extraction
   •   Farmers respected the Tripartite agreement not to expand irrigated area

WUAs
   •   Involving WUAs in water resources management was a good step,
   •   There was more understanding that water should be saved for the future
   •   Support should be provided to WUAs to allow them to take responsibilities and insure
       sustainable O&M for structures, enhancing coordination between WUAs and local
       authorities, and allocating some budget for maintenance, e.g. from the AFPPF.
   •   WUAs should be involved in preparation of plans and strategies, as well as in the training
       workshops and water conferences
   •   Continue to provide necessary training to WUAs

Cost-sharing
   •   Due to increasing fuel and agricultural input costs, the farmers’ subsidy for irrigation
       equipment should be increased
   •   Decreasing the contribution of beneficiaries for the construction of spate irrigation and
       water harvesting structures
   •   Increase the amount [maximum value] of community contracts

Monitoring
   •   Involve local community organizations in water monitoring
   •   Outputs of information and data should be available for all, particularly farmers
   •   Identify suitable budget to conduct the water monitoring activities


                                               42
Other
   • The project gave a chance for poor farmers to benefit from the services.
   • Strongly recommend to expand the project components all over the country, and involve
      the local communities in the planning and implementation of changes
   • Involve women in the activities related to water resources management
   • Important to introduce modern irrigation technologies for qat areas
   • Introduce and promote greenhouse technologies

          Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

A. Introduction
This report “Project Implementation Completion Report (ICR)? is produced at the closing of the
Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project (GSCP) on June 30, 2012, which has been financed
by IDA, planned, executed and completed by the Ministry of Agriculture & Irrigation (MAI),
Republic of Yemen. It is a project review from borrower’s perspective and also briefly describes
IDA and Borrower’s performances and IDA-Borrower relationship. It also describes briefly the
political unrest which engulfed the Country during February 2011 to February 2012 and its
impact on the project implementation and achievements.

B. Political Unrest during February 2011-February 2012 and its impact on the Project
1.      While Yemen was trying to address the problems of critical water scarcity, food
insecurity and agricultural production, the political unrest in the country during February 2011 to
February 2012 not only aggravated these critical problems but destroyed the infrastructure
development created and severely affected the implementation of the activities of the GSCP.
Further, the World Bank also imposed suspension of the disbursements for the GSCP which
resulted in stoppage of supplies and many contractors stopped the civil works they were
executing for non-receipt of payments.
2.       The non-availability of diesel and its high price in the black market affected the running
of pumps resulting in loss of agriculture production and created problems in transportation of
produce to the markets during 2011. Before this conflict, the diesel prices were YR 52.5 per liter
(which was increased from YR 35 per liter in 2008-09). Now the official diesel price is YR 100
per liter. The official price of petrol is now YR 125 per liter.
3. The farmers suffered huge financial losses mainly to vegetable crops. The FUs Northern,
Dhamar, Taiz and Lahej have informed that on an average the incomes of farmers have been
reduced by over 50 % due to the conflict.
4. Further, during this conflict, at some places the stores belonging to the project (GSCP) were
looted and burnt (see para 30 of Chapter 8), while at other few places, vehicles and office
furniture were stolen or destroyed.

C. Groundwater Situation in Yemen
5.     It is worth mentioning that Yemen is abstracting over 50 % more than the annual
renewable water supply of 2.5 BCM to meet the present demand of 3.9 BCM of which over 3.2
BCM is the irrigation demand. In some basins the rates of rapid depletion of groundwater up to
6-7 m/year is leading to a situation beyond recovery.
6.     The Yemen’s present population of about 26 million is likely to be doubled in 2031,
which will reduce the present per capita availability of water (110-120 m3/year), which is already
lowest in the World, to about 47 m3 per capita per year in 2031 as against the world average of
7,500 m3 per capita per year and 667 m3 per capita per year in the MENA region.




                                                44
7.     About 74 % of the population lives in rural areas and is dependent on agriculture, which
provides most of rural income. Agriculture as a whole accounts for about 11 % of GDP (2010)
and over 82 % of water use.

D. Project Background
8.      The Groundwater and Soil Conservation Project (GSCP) is a logical follow-on to the
successfully completed Land and Water Conservation Project (LWCP), with improvements in
the groundwater conservation aspects, introduction of a new institution of Irrigation Advisory
Service (IAS), and inclusion of Small and Medium Spate Irrigation Rehabilitation and Improved
Erosion Control and Groundwater recharge on the upland terraces. These measures were
envisaged to result in groundwater recharge and substantial reductions of groundwater
abstraction and increased crop yields. The Project was scheduled to be implemented as a five-
year Sector Investment Credit (SIC), became effective on August 17, 2004 and was to be
completed on October 31, 2009.
9.      Encouraged by the growing response of the beneficiary farmers in the GSCP activities,
the Government requested the Bank in January 2008 to continue its support for the GSCP by
providing additional IDA financing of US$15 million and extend its completion date by two
years to October 31, 2011. The negotiations of this additional financing were held on April 21-
23, 2008 and a grant agreement (No. H-4200 YEM) was signed on October 13, 2008. As a result,
the scope of the GSCP was expanded to cover more areas under improved irrigation systems, to
implement additional spate irrigation schemes, and water harvesting and soil conservation works.
10.     Unfortunately, the unrest in Yemen, during February 2011 to February 2012 had severely
affected the implementation of the project activities. Keeping these factors in view, the World
Bank extended the completion date of the project to June 30, 2012.

E. Project Objectives and Components
          Project Development Objective (PDO)
11.      The objective of the GSCP is to assist the GOY in promoting groundwater conservation
in farming areas and increasing surface and groundwater availability through:
    (i) improving irrigation water use efficiency;
    (ii) improving recharge and protection of watersheds; and
    (iii) supporting the groundwater management framework and institutions: to manage local
         water resources in a sustainable manner.

          Project Components:
12.       The project (Credit and Additional Financing) comprises the following components:
      •   Component 1: Modernization and Improvement of Groundwater Irrigation Systems;

      •   Component 2: Improvement of Spate Irrigation, Water Harvesting and Soil Conservation;
          and

      •   Component 3: Institutional Strengthening of Water institutions.
13.       The details of Project Objectives and Components are furnished in Chapter 2.

                                                 45
F. Elements considered in the Project Design
14.     The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) points to the need for urgent action on water
resources management in rural areas and, in particular, investment in order to reduce aquifer
depletion and improve watershed management, with a focus on the most water stressed
agricultural areas.
15.    In light of the above, the strategic choices that guided the project design are discussed in
paragraph 1.4 of Chapter 1.
16.    The project has promoted sustainable use of groundwater within the framework of the
National Water Strategy.

G. Unique Features of the GSCP:
17.    The GSCP has been designed and implemented with many unique features as discussed
under Chapter3. Some of these main features are
   •   Creation of Irrigation Advisory Service and on-farm water monitoring initiated under the
       project;
   •   Higher subsidy given to small farmers;
   •   Water savings of about 83 MCM annually achieved under the GSCP are about five times
       the total of water savings achieved under LWCP and SBWMP together. This is in
       addition to fuel savings, labor savings and increase in crop yields;
   •   To involve community participation the works costing less than US$ 10,000 each
       awarded to communities for implementation;
   •   Small Holders Bucket Type Drip System has been introduced to encourage rural and
       urban women to develop kitchen gardens for growing vegetables for daily needs of the
       family.

H. Project Organization and Implementation Arrangements
18.    The GSCP has been implemented by the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of the Ministry
of Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) under the overall supervision of a Steering Committee. The
Steering Committee is chaired by the Honorable Minister of Agriculture and Irrigation and
comprises representatives from MAI, MOF, MOPIC, and MWE. The Project Director is the
convener of the Committee and is assisted by an Assistant Convener. The PCU is, to oversee and
coordinate project implementation, procurement, and financial management in the 10 Field Units
(FUs) covering 15 governorates which carry out the project implementation on the ground. These
arrangements are discussed in details in Chapter 4 along with Environmental Management and
Social Assessment. This Chapter also describes that the Borrower has adhered to Social and
Environmental Safeguards.
19.     Chapter 4 also describes the implementation of the actions envisaged under EMP and SA
studies. As explained under this chapter, the Borrower has adhered to Social and Environmental
Safeguards.

I. Progress achieved on various Components against Targets
20.     A summary of the progress of implementation of the project components may be seen
under Chapter 5. This Chapter also describes, for each component, the problems encountered
during the implementation and how these were resolved.
21.    In spite of the adverse security situation in the country, the project has achieved its targets
and the volume of water saved (about 83 MCM) is five times the volume saved under earlier
IDA projects LWCP and SBWMP taken together.

J. Key Performance / Monitoring Indicators
22.     These are discussed in details under Chapter 6. A summary of the key performance
indicators (Implementation Indicators and Impact Indicators) based on pages 3 and 4 of the PAD
is given below:
Implementation indicators:
   (a) number of hectares covered with modernized irrigation through the installation of piped-
       groundwater conveyance and localized irrigation systems:
       Against the appraisal Targets of 46,940 ha, the achievement is 50,868 ha.
   (b) number of hectares covered by improved spate irrigation schemes, soil conserving
       terraces, water harvesting structures, bank protection and other soil and water
       conservation investments:
       Against the appraisal target of benefitting area of 29,455 ha and Incremental area of
       5918 ha, the achievement is 24,881 ha (benefitting area and 5845 ha (incremental area.
   (c) number of participating farmers working within water user groups (WUGs) in project
       areas, respecting covenants not to expand irrigated area, adopting improved water, soil
       and crop management programs at farm level, and sharing project costs; and
       Against a target of 11,700 beneficiary families, the achievement is 12,003 families.
   (d) monitoring programs in place at farm and basin levels for supporting groundwater
       management.
       All the equipment assumed at appraisal for groundwater level monitoring, water quality
       monitoring and flowmeters (revised) have fully been procured and installed and most of
       these are operating.
Impact indicators:
   (e) volume of water saved:
       Against the appraisal target of saving of groundwater of 77 MCM annually, the
       achievement is 83 MCM
   (f) agricultural productivity increases per unit of water use; and
       The agricultural productivity increase for various crops varies from 24-31 % under piped
       conveyance systems and 57-73 % under Localized irrigation systems
   (g) number of families benefiting from the investment.
       Against the appraisal target of 42,796 beneficiary families, the achievement is 59,755
       families.
23.    Based on the analyses of the Project Implementation and Impact Indicators, the
performance of the project is rated very high.

K. Procurement Activities under the Project
24.    Throughout the implementation of the project, the procurement was carried out in a
schematic and organized manner and was strictly as per the World Bank Guidelines. The
Procurement Plans were updated from time to time. During the period from start of the project in
August 2004 until its completion on June 30, 2012, a total of 3,394 contracts for procurement of
Goods, Consultancy Services and Training, and Works were signed.
25.       The table below gives the details of procurement works carried out by the PMU:

26.       The Procurement arrangements are discussed in details in Chapter 8.

L. Financial Management and Project Expenditure:
27.    This is discussed in details in Chapter 9. The PCU is responsible for the GSCP finances
from IDA Credit 3860-YE and Grant H4200-RY.

          Financial Management and Accounting System:
28.    The PCU has an established integrated computerized accounting and management
information system (MIS) in place (linked to all FUs) and the inventory management system
monitors the FUs’ inventory of pipes and equipment and beneficiary contribution. The MIS is
used for the preparation of the project quarterly and annual financial statements and the
preparation of FMRs and Audit Report to be submitted to the Steering Committee and IDA.

          Audit
29.    The PCU submits annual Audit Reports to IDA regularly after it is reviewed and
approved by the Central Organization for Control & Auditing (COCA). The project records and
accounts are also subject to annual audit by a private, qualified and independent Auditor
acceptable to IDA.



                                                                48
30.        Project Expenditure
          IDA Credit 3860-YEM: Against the allocated amount of US$ 41.02 million, the entire
           amount has been disbursed;
          IDA Grant H4200-YEM: Against the allocated amount of US$ 13.93 million, an amount
           of US$ 12.13 million (87 %) has been disbursed up to June 5, 2012.
31. Amendment of Development Credit Agreement (DCA)
      •    The DCA was amended in December 2006, (i) to accommodate the implementation of
           small works each costing less than US$ 10,000 through community contracts and
           opening of revolving funds in the FUs for direct payment to the communities and to be
           replenished by the PCU from its Special Account and (ii) for allowing 100 %
           disbursements of foreign expenditure of the services of the consultants.
32.        Reallocation of funds between categories
      •    Later in 2008, as a result in substantial increase in the cost of modern irrigation systems
           due to global price increase and steep increase in crude oil prices, and to accommodate
           other minor variations in other categories a reallocation notification was issued by the
           World Bank for the Credit (3860-YEM) Agreement as under:

 S                                                Amount as per DCA     Amount after reallocation notification

          (a) Salaries of PCU contractual staff                30,000                                  80,000
          (b) Other operating costs                            60,000                                  60,000

33.    Again in 2011, a minor reallocation in the disbursement figures was approved by the
World Bank to transfer the cost of Gabions (US$ 1.81 million) from category “Goods? to
category “Works? as these Gabions were meant for “Works?.
34.     From the Risk Analyses done under paragraph 9.40 of Chapter 9, it is evident from the
actions taken to mitigate the inherent risks observed during project appraisal that all the risks
have been mitigated and have not negatively affected the pace of project implementation.
Overall it could be concluded that the financial management procedures were being adhered to in
a satisfactory manner.

M. Performance of Implementation Partners
35.     The Performance of the Implementation partners namely IDA and the Borrower
(including all the agencies of the Government associated with the implementation of the project)
has been discussed in details in Chapter 10. The highlights are given below:



                                                         49
       IDA Performance
36.     On an average IDA fielded one Supervision Mission every six months as scheduled.
These missions were led by the competent TTL and usually comprised multi-disciplinary teams
which had been very effective in monitoring all aspects of the project and in providing
constructive suggestions to overcome constraints which confronted the implementation of the
project.
37.     IDA was constructive in addressing the need of the project and sanctioning addition grant
of US$ 15 million to enlarge the scope of the project and to grant extension to its completion
date two times firstly from October 31, 2009 to October 31, 2011 and secondly to June 30, 2012
which greatly helped in completion of the project with a larger scope. In addition IDA was
helpful in the following:
   •   Agreeing to project request for implementation of small works less than US$ 10,000
       under ‘Community Contracts’, and amendment of the DCA to effect these changes;
   •   Timely according NOL to various proposals from the PCU;
   •   Providing guidance, orientation and foreign training to project staff.
   •   Reviewing the quarterly project progress reports, Financial Management Reports and
       updated Procurement Plans and conveying constructive suggestions.
38.     Except for the conflict period, when the World Bank suspended disbursements which
affected the implementation of project activities, the IDA performance, on the whole, during
preparation, appraisal and implementation was satisfactory.

       Borrower’s Performance;
39.     The Borrower almost achieved the full targets of the project. The project’s achievements
were possible as a result of IDA support and hard work and efforts put forth by all the
implementation partners in the Government and the National and International consultants. The
roles of MAI and MOPIC had been constructive. The Project Steering Committee met every
quarter and monitored the project progress and reviewed and approved various proposals in
regard to annual budget, annual procurement plans etc. On the whole the role of Steering
Committee helped the speedy implementation of the project. The Borrower’s procurement and
financial arrangements used for the project were strictly in accordance with World Bank
Guidelines.
40.     The Borrower was regular and prompt in submitting the periodical project progress
reports, FMR, Audit Reports, the action taken reports on the recommendations of Supervision
Missions to IDA and the Steering Committee.
41.     The Borrower’s performance in regard to monitoring of weather stations, wadi flow
stations and water level monitoring of wells and analyses of the data from stations transferred to
MIS system in the CWMU suffered to some extent due to constraint of local budget.
42.  The issue regarding O&M of the Spate Works by the beneficiaries and sustainability of
WUAs are other important issues yet to be resolved by the Borrower.

       IDA-Borrower Relationship
43.     On the whole, cordial relationship was maintained between IDA and Borrower during the
entire project implementation period.
                                               50
N. Economic and Financial Analyses
44     The project generates quantifiable as well as non-quantifiable benefits as a result of the
implementation of the project. The non-quantifiable benefits include, social benefits, institutional,
capacity building benefits and environmental benefits. The non-quantifiable benefits are not
considered in performing the economic analysis of the project.

        Results of economic analysis of Component 1:
45      The value of water saving (reduced pumping), saving in irrigation labor and energy and
the increase in crop productivity as a result of improved on farm water management have been
accounted for in the estimated crop budgets. An increase in crop productivity of 7% and 13% as
a result of installation of piped conveyance system and localized irrigation system respectively
are adopted in the crop budgets. The summary of results of economic analysis for Component 1
with a comparison with the results at appraisal is presented in table below:

        Results of economic analysis of Component 2:
46.      The quantifiable benefits generated as a result of the implementation of spate
improvement and water harvesting subcomponents are manifest in the following forms.
    (i)     Increased productivity on the total benefiting area by 3% as a result of improved
            spate water management on the spate improvements and water harvesting areas; and
    (ii)    Incremental area as a result of the project intervention assumed to represent 17% of
            the benefiting area. Thus the incremental production will be the total net return per ha
            multiplied by the incremental area under both spate improvement /water harvesting
            works.

        Financial analysis/On-farm Investment and Income Analysis:
49.         Five farm models under piped conveyance system and five farm models under the
localized on farm irrigation systems were selected for performing the on-farm investment
analysis. The results are presented in the table below.
50.         It could be concluded that when farmers pay the subsidized cost of the improved
irrigation systems (piped conveyance and the localized irrigation systems); the on-farm
investment is an attractive opportunity. This is because the FIRR for the improved irrigation
systems is > 50% and the payback period is about 2 years.
51.          However, when farmers pay the full cost of the improved irrigation systems (i.e. not
the subsidized cost), the FIRR for the on-farm investment in the piped conveyance system is >
50% and the payback period is 2 to 3 years). Therefore the on-farm investment for the piped
conveyance systems is considered an attractive investment opportunity. However, the on-farm
investment in localized irrigation systems is relatively not attractive. This is because of the high
initial investment cost of the localized systems which are 5–6 times the initial investment costs
of the piped systems as a result of which, the FIRR is 17% for vegetables, 21% for pomegranate
and 32% for onion. If the farmers do not get the localized system at subsidized rate, it is unlikely
for the majority of farmers to go for the localized system at their own cost.
52.          Summary of impacts of on- farm investment in piped conveyance systems and
localized irrigation systems with project subsidy and without project subsidy are presented in the
table below:

O. Sustainability of the benefits of the infrastructure after the project
53.     Sustainability is defined by the ICR guidelines as the "probability of (a project)
maintaining the Achievements generated or expected to be generated in relation to its objective
over the economic life of the project." The sustainability of the benefits of infrastructure after the
project has been discussed in details under Chapter 7 with points of strengths and points of
weaknesses for each activity. In view of the facts given under Chapter 7, the sustainability rating
of the project is considered very high.
54.     However, there are two issues of concern. Traditionally for medium (and large) spate
diversion structures O&M of these structures fall within the responsibility of the government,
which the government now wants to progressively transfer to the users. These are unlikely to be
maintained by the users unless legal/financial support is provided to them. Further, for such large
structures, the beneficiary contributions for the implementation of these structures under the
GSCP have been paid by Local Authorities on their behalf and as such the beneficiaries have not
acquired any sense of ownership in such structures and also towards O&M of these structures.
MAI is seriously considering the issue concerning O&M of these structures and further
implementation of these structures till O&M arrangements are finalized and amending the
bylaws to empower the WUAs.
55.      Another issue of concern is that in high-hazard aquifers, where the decline of
groundwater level is more than 3 meters per year, the long-term sustainability of the agricultural
activities cannot be guaranteed, unless further reductions in abstractions are achieved. NWRA
has to initiate action in such areas as warranted under the Water Law. However, the project has
brought water abstraction closer to the safe yield in these high-hazard areas, which is a
substantial achievement.
56.    Sustainability Risk Analysis has been done under paragraph 7.30 and Table 7.1 of
Chapter 7 and the overall rating is N (Low Risk) as compared to S (Substantial Risk) at the
Appraisal Stage.
       Beneficiary Impact Assessment (BIA) Study
57.     The BIA study has been completed. According to the Draft Final report of this study, the
project impacts on beneficiaries are overall positive. The details of this study are discussed under
Chapter 6. The main conclusions are as under:
   •   The improved irrigation systems have improved Beneficiaries’ income through
       improvement in crop yield, reduced pumping costs, and reduced labor. With the sharp
       increase in diesel price, they need these improved irrigation systems more than before
       and would continue to install these with reduced subsidies or even on their own, but
       sometimes the availability of technicians for installations and of spare parts and fittings
       may be a problem;
   •   They can provide O&M to small spate improvement and water harvesting works for
       which they have shared (20 %) in the cost of construction. However, sharing in the cost
       of construction of medium or large spate diversion works and providing O&M for these
       structures was beyond their capacities and skills. The Government or the Local Councils
       have to take care of these structures;


                                                 53
   •   The beneficiaries feel that the WUGs/WUAs are useful but without any support are not
       sustainable. The WUGs/WUAs can perform better and even provide O&M to large spate
       structures if some support was provided to them;
   •   Most beneficiaries feel that the training provided by the IAS was very helpful in
       increasing their production and income and many were able to modify their cropping
       pattern as advised by the IAS. Many farmers however feel that the IAS should have
       provided training to more farmers and reached more farmers for advising them; and
   •   The beneficiary farmers were happy with the overall working, performance and
       achievements of the project.

P. Satellite Imagery Study:
58.     The main goal of the Satellite Imagery study was inter alia to use satellite imagery
technique to supervise the beneficiaries’ compliance with the covenants, such as non-expansion
of irrigated cropped areas after installation of improved irrigation technologies under the project
and no Qat production in the farms provided with these improved technologies in the four
selected pilot areas. A study was undertaken in 2006 to provide a baseline for the above and a
repeat study was conducted in 2010 to verify the beneficiary compliance with the covenants.
59.     The Study is overall general for the four pilot areas and not specific to the GSCP areas of
intervention. This is very essential to know the impact of the project. The above changes in the
total areas of the four pilot basins do not clearly reflect the impact of the GSCP. The study
clearly indicates that no clear conclusion can be drawn on the impact of the GSCP interventions
on the intensity of irrigation practices. However, the study has made many important general
conclusions/recommendations which are briefly discussed under paragraph 5.13.5 of Chapter 5.

Q. Lessons Learned:
60.     There are many lessons which we have learned from the design and implementation of
the GSCP. Some of these have positive aspects which we can on build on in future for
implementation of similar activities; while some of the lessons may have negative aspects that
arise during implementation which need to be avoided/addressed in future. These are discussed
in detail in Chapter 12 and main lessons are summed up below:
       Lessons with Positive Aspects:
   •   The implementation of small works by the communities through “Community
       Contracts? was a great success and should be encouraged;
   •   The cost-sharing mechanism for improved irrigation systems comprising higher subsidy
       for small farmers should be encouraged for all projects; and
   •   Quality control mechanism for civil works should be strengthened and made independent.
       Lessons with Negative Aspects:
   •   Water Monitoring and compilation and analyses of the monitoring data, so vital activity
       for Yemen, is not being done in a satisfactory manner due to constraint of local budget.
       This needs to be strengthened in future;



                                                54
   •    Before further Spate Diversion Structures are taken up, efforts should be made to resolve
        the issue of O&M of these works by the beneficiaries and WUAs are strengthened to
        sustain themselves to take up this responsibility by making amendments in the Bye-laws
        to the Water Law;
   •    The studies relating to Baseline survey and Survey and designs of Spate structures to be
        implemented under any project should be done before the start of the project as a pre-
        project activity as these studies consume lot of project period delaying the activities; and
   •    NWRA should take immediate steps to address the issues raised in the study “Water
        Resources Assessment of Dhamar Plain? carried out under the GSCP.
61.    The most important lesson we have learned from the implementation of the GSCP is the
understanding between water and culture and environment and which can be improved through
education and awareness. How can we have any hope about the future if we do not learn and act
what is obviously needed today. The following two extracts are very much relevant to our needs
to-day which is to save this precious but scarce and fragile water:
       (1) From Holy Quran: “We made from water every living thing?
       (2) From Book “Water and Stars? by Antoine de Saint-Exupery:
        “Water, you have no taste, no color, no scent, One cannot describe you, But only enjoys
        you without knowing you, You are not something that is needed for life; you are the
        life itself, Your fulfillment of the sense of happiness, that, cannot be explained by
        senses only, With you all the powers from which we have distinct counsels come back
        to us, You are the most precious wealth in the world, and yet you are also the most
        fragile one. So pure, emerge from the womb of the earth.?

R. Preference under Improved Irrigation Systems
62.     The farmers prefer Piped Conveyance Systems to Localized Irrigation Systems based on
their affordability of the investment costs of these two systems. However, if it is analyzed
technically, about 1,500 m3/ha is saved under piped conveyance systems with average
investment of US$ 400/ha; and 4,310 m3/ha is saved under localized irrigation systems with
average investment of US$ 2,500/ha. This works out to 3.75 m3/$ for the piped conveyance
systems and 1.72 m3/$ for the localized irrigation systems.
63.    Under the LWCP, SBWMP and GSCP hardly 15 % of the total groundwater irrigated
area (about 400,000 ha) is covered, and ample area is available for coverage. With the funds
available more and more areas should therefore be covered under piped conveyance systems and
layout designed in such a way that localized irrigation systems can be added later easily. With all
the efforts made under the GSCP, it was not possible to install more than 5 % of the area
(covered by pipe conveyance systems) under localized irrigation systems.

S. Assessment of the Project Exit Strategy:
64.     After its completion on June 30, 2012, the GSCP is likely to be merged with NIP. All its
FUs with their infrastructure, staff and experience will be transferred to NIP. This merger will
ensure continuation of activities in future also. The details of the Exit Strategy are discussed
under Chapter 13.

          Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

The Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) contributed to the Groundwater and Soil
Conservation Project (GSCP) through cofinancing with a grant of about US$1.0 million for
sustainable self-management of local water resources by poor farming communities. The
comments received from JSDF are reflected in the main text of the ICR.




                                          56
                 Annex 9. Community Water Management Project – JSDF
1.     From June 2005 to June 2009, about US$1 million was provided from Japan Social
Development Fund (JSDF) to assist in developing replicable models or sustainable self-
management of local water resources by poor farming communities in areas where groundwater
is becoming increasingly scarce. Objectives were to:
   •   Support community development of Water Users Associations (WUAs) and enable them
       to develop management plans;
   •   Explore the scope for local regulation of groundwater and open up opportunities to
       generate income from water management; and
   •   Support the implementation of local management plans by WUAs.
2.     The project was rated moderately satisfactory. The Community-based Water
Management Project (CWMP) mostly attained its objectives. It developed models for organizing
water users to establish WUAs, which were to be replicated under the ongoing Groundwater and
Soil Conservation Project (GSCP) as well as the newly approved Water Sector Support project in
the other parts of the country. Three men’s WUAs and three women’s WUAs established under
the CWMP did carry out activities including groundwater monitoring, water shortage awareness
campaign, reporting illegal drilling, etc.
3.       Development of WUAs for groundwater was a new activity for Yemen, for which the
project made substantial accomplishments and provided valuable lessons. Development of
groundwater WUAs is particularly challenging, since they lack the routine services provided by
domestic water supply WUAs, or the seasonal maintenance activities that bring together spate
irrigation users. Conditions in rural Yemen make it hard to require mandatory fees from users,
and after the project government agencies were not able to provide strong regulatory
backstopping or technical support for WUAs. While WUAs helped provide access to benefits
during the project, benefits from WUAs were often not as apparent after the project. Despite the
accomplishments of the project, the issue of "sustainable self-management" was not resolved.
WUAs established under the CWMP were financially weak and still needed financial support to
continue their management. Issues affecting WUAs were reviewed by a team of consultants
recruited under the GSCP and courses of actions to establish "sustainable self-management"
were recommended, including the need to provide specific services that would be valued by
farmers and to take a more comprehensive approach to involving local institutions and
authorities in developing groundwater governance. It was also recommended to work together
with the Yemen Women’s Union, which could provide a source of more permanent support for
women’s WUAs. The follow-up support to CWMP WUAs was to be done under the GSCP.


4.     A few CWMP WUAs had income generating activities, from reselling agricultural inputs
and from local crafts. However, most lacked sufficient funds for their operation from fees or
other sources, which limited their activities. As of 2012, two of the six WUAs (including one
women’s WUA) were still very active, primarily due to their non-irrigation activities, two
somewhat active and two inactive. Although the CWMP provided substantial training for WUA
members, continuation of further training of WUA members would be crucial for their
sustainability. In this regard, the Government agreed to establish a special unit for WUAs in the
National Irrigation Program in the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation to promote WUAS
though irrigation advisory services under the WSSP throughout the country. However, as of

                                               57
2012 this had not occurred and needs follow up during the supervision of the Water Sector
Support Project (WSSP). The CWMP emphasized direct involvement of the local population
including direct money flows to beneficiaries who are engaged in water monitoring and
management activities. The CWMP has been closely linked with the GSCP which has provided
PVC pipes and advanced on-farm irrigation equipment for farmers to save water. 11
