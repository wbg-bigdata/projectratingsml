INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for the equivalent of US$5.5
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for the expansion
of domestic and international telecommunication facilities of the Nepal
Telecommunications Board (NTD). The proceeds of the credit would be
relent to the NTB for a term of 20 years, including a five-year grace
period, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Economic Situation and
Prospects of Nepal" (125-NEP) is being distributed separately to the
Executive Directors. The principal findings and conclusions of that report
are summarized below.
3.        Nepal has been classified by the United Nations as one of the
least-developed countries in the world. Its per capita income is estimated
at $70-80 per year; the literacy rate is only about 10 percent. Lack of
dependable statistical data makes difficult a precise assessment of the
recent economic performance. Available statistics should therefore be
considered as indicating no more than orders of magnitude and broad trends.
There is, however, evidence that since 1965 Nepal's real economic growth
per capita has been almost entirely neutralized by population growth, estimated
at 2.2 percent a year. Agriculture accounts for about 70 percent of GDP and
provides employment for about 90 percent of the labor force of which the
great majority are subsistence farmers. The industrial sector is very small
and its contribution to GDP has been marginal.
4.        Serious efforts toward development have been underway only since
the late 1950's. Development expenditures have increased rapidly -- from
NRs 232 million in 1964/65 to NRs 570 million in 1971/72. The great bulk of
the resources available for development have been invested in infrastructure,
particularly roads, power and irrigation facilities. About half of expen-
ditures for development during this period have been financed with external
assistance, notably from India, the United States and China. About 80
percent has been in the form of grants. Nepal's external debt service has
thus remained very low. Gross external reserves have been increasing and
as of September 1972 stood at $117 million, of which about $90 million were
convertible.
5.        In its efforts to formulate and implement development programs
and projects, the Government is faced with unusually severe constraints.



- 2 -
The country is landlocked and the physical resource base is very narrow,
consisting mainly of agricultural land, hardwood forests and abundant water
resources available for both power generation and irrigation. No minerals
in commercial quantities have been discovered. Nepal's internal market is
small and production costs tend to be high. About 60 percent of the popu-
lation live in the Hills 1/ at or near subsistence levels. For lack of trans-
portation facilities, large numbers of communities are virtually isolated
from each other. This lack of transportation underscores the need for
extending and improving the country's telecommunications system (see para-
graph 32).
6.        One of the important constraints on Nepal's economic development
has been the limited capacity of the Government to plan, appraise and imple-
ment development programs and projects. The problem is apparent in most
sectors and its principal elements include poor coordination of closely
related programs; lack of progress reporting and evaluation; defective
project formulation and implementation; and general difficulty in taking
decisions within the Government. Given Nepal's late awakening to the process
of economic development, these problems are not unexpected. While note-
worthy attempts at improvements have been undertaken in the past few years,
much remains to be done and substantial technical assistance will be
required to supplement the limited Nepalese staff that possesses requisite
skills.
7.        Inspite of these constraints, the prospects for increasing
agricultural output, without which little growth is possible, are reasonably
good. Within the agricultural sector, the best possibility over the short
and medium term is increasing the production of foodgrains, particularly
rice, wheat and maize. Preliminary analysis of Nepal's future foodgrain
position indicates that unless timely and effective measures are taken, the
current export surplus (about 300,000 tons of rice per year mainly to India)
may soon turn into a deficit. In the Hills, where no additional land is
available and yields are low, the principal requirement is to increase produc-
tivity by means of improved technology and to restructure agriculture away
from foodgrains toward more suitable horticulture and livestock production.
In the Terai 1/ to the south, foodgrain production can be substantially
increased not only from improved technology but also by expanding the area
under cultivation and making use of the potential for extending irrigation
and for controlled resettlement in cleared forest areas and waste land.
Cultivated land in Nepal amounts to about 1.8 million ha or about 13
percent of the total area of the country. However, only about 120,000
ha are irrigated and all of the systems in operation are designed primarily
1/   The Hills in the central region consist of cluster of rugged mountains
ranging from 1,000-4,00() meters in elevation and cut by the valleys and
gorges of Nepal's major north-south river systems. The Terai is a
narrow plain along the Indian border with elevations up to 1,000
meters (see attached map).



-3-
to provide supplemental water to the wet season rice crop. Few of them
have significant supplies of water during the dry season and double cropping
is therefore very limited. Expansion of irrigated agriculture in areas
where double cropping can be practiced offers the best possibility of
expanding foodgrain production over the medium term. In the longer term,
the output of foodgrain and also cash crops can be increased further by
bringing new land under cultivation in the forested areas of the Terai.
8.        Over-population in the Hills and uncontrolled migration to the
Terai pose serious threats to future development. A greatly expanded
land clearance and resettlement program in the Terai would help to absorb
part of the excess population and, if carefully planned and controlled,
could substantially reduce wasteful destruction of forests and severe
erosion of arable land. Intensive farming of new irrigated land would also
provide a livelihood for migrant farmers as would a program for systematic
and efficient utilization of Nepal's forest resources.
9.        Exploitation of Nepal's forest resources with a view toward
developing exports of timber offers one of the most promising opportunities
for export diversification. The tourism sector, for which the Association
has granted a credit of $4.2 million in March 1972, has expanded very rapid-
ly in recent years and continued growth is quite possible, provided a
program for increasing hotel accommodations and other facilities is
implemented. Most of Nepal's recorded foreign trade (75 percent of exports
and 90 percent of imports) is with India. In addition, because of the
relatively open border, there is substantial unrecorded trade between the
two countries. Total recorded merchandise exports to all countries have
averaged about $40 million over the past several years. Of exports to
India, about 50 percent has been rice. Jute and jute products account for
about 70 percent of exports to third countries.
10.       With a quickening of the pace of the development effort, a major
constraint on further development is Nepal's ability to mobilize resources,
both domestic and foreign. Over the past seven years (1964/65-1971/72),
domestic revenue and total expenditures grew by about 15 percent per year
-- substantially faster than the growth of GDP. Development expenditures
alone more than doubled and increased their share of GDP from 3.9 percent
to 5.7 percent. However, with domestic revenue currently only about 5.2
percent of GDP, Nepal's tax effort remains low. Substantial improvement
will be necessary if development expenditures are to continue growing at a
satisfactory rate.
11.       Although Nepal's absorptive capacity is today limited, her own
efforts, supplemented by technical assistance, will progressively enable
her effectively to utilize an increasing volume of new investment. With
domestic savings at a low level, the need for external resources may be
expected to expand substantially. The outlook for a continued flow of
bilateral grant aid on the scale of the past is uncertain. Nepal's currently
comfortable foreign exchange reserve position is, therefore, unlikely to
be a permanent feature. With limited prospects for earning convertible
currency and, in view of its extreme poverty, Nepal's requirements for
foreign assistance on soft terms could rise rapidly in the future.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATTONS IN NEPAL
12.       The first IDA credit to Nepal in the amount of $1.7 million
equivalent was made in FY 1970 for a telecommuncations project. This was
followed by credits for highways ($2.5 million), tourism ($4.2 million) and
irrigation ($6 million). The proposed credit would bring the total amount of
IDA assistance to Nepal to $19.9 million equivalent. No Bank loan has been
made to Nepal and there are no IFC operations in the country. Annex 2 con-
tains a summary statement of IDA credits as of Mfarch 31, 1973 and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects. It shows that there have been delays in
the implementation of the ongoing projects, which were largely due to
Nepal's limited technical and management capabilities.
13.       Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level
compared to the country's needs for, and total receipts of external assistance.
This is due to the relatively large amounts of assistance given to Nepal by
other donors and the country's limited absorptive capacity, affecting the
rate of project identification, preparation and implementation. Prospective
Bank Group operations in Nepal reflect the country's needs (a) to place
major emphasis upon directly productive sectors, particularly agriculture
and forestry; (b) to give special attention to integrated schemes within the
agricultural sector upon which economic development in Nepal basically
depends; and (c) to continue assistance for the development of infrastructure,
including water supply, feeder roads and other forms of communications, par-
ticularly between the Hills and the Terai.
14.       A mission to appraise a water supply and sewerage project will
visit Nepal during the cu1rrent fiscal year; further missions are scheduled
in the coming months for a number of prospective projects including a
forestry/settlement project, a rural development project and a second high-
way project. In view of the institutional constraints and shortage of
trained personnel in Nepal, the identification, preparation and implementation
of these projects are likely to require more time and effort on the part of
the Bank Group as well as greater inputs of technical assistance, than is
common in other countries. For this reason, technical assistance will be
an important element in many future projects.
PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN NE]PAL
15.       The telecommunications sector in Nepal is still in its infant
stage. Until the first IDA telecommunications credit (166-NEP) was made
to Nepal in November 1969, local telephone services were available only in
the Kathmandu area and Biratnagar in the southeastern part of the country,
and there existed no long-distance network for normal telephone conversation.
In July 1972, the total number of subscribers was still a mere 4,563. The
telephone density at that time was .06 per 100 people, a substantial increase
from .025 per 100 people in 1969. Nonetheless, the density is one of the



lowest in the world and well below the average for developing countries. The
quality of the local telephone service has been showing steady improvement
even though it is still far from being adequate.
16.       Minimum communications -- mainly used for telegraph purposes --
between some 78 centers throughout the country are provided by means of
high frequency (HF) radio stations which operate on a part-time basis. These
stations are overloaded at the main centers and the use of voice transmission
leads to considerable distortion of messages. Even though international
telecommunications services are gradually improving, they are still inadequate
since the land line to India via Birganj is subject to disruption due to
landslides and flooding during the monsoon season and the alternative HF
radio services to India, Pakistan and Bangladesh do not provide adequate
transmission standards for telephone service.
17.       The ongoing project provides for the connection of an additional
4,000 subscribers on automatic and 1,000 subscribers on manual telephone
exchanges. Long distance telephone services will be provided for the first
time in Nepal linking Kathmandu with the main cities including Pokhara,
Birganj, Nepalganj, Bhairawa, and Biratnagar (via Malangwa, Janakpur, Siraha,
Rajbiraj, Dharan). International services will be improved by the intercon-
nection of the Kathmandu-Birganj microwave system with the microwave routes
to Calcutta and Delhi. After initial delays in making the credit effective,
delay in signing an agreement with India for some of the aid provisions and
delays in taking procurement action, this project is now proceedineg satis-
factoril) and completion is expected by December 1974, some 18 monthls behind
schedule.
18.       Until 1969, the telecommunications system was operated by the
Nepal Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Works, Transport and
Communications. In view of the expansion of services as provided under the
first telecommunications credit, the Government, with the support of the
Association, established in 1969 the Nepal Telecommunications Board (NTB)
which since then has been responsible for the provision and operation of
all public domestic and international telecommunications services within
Nepal. NTB operates within an annual budget appropriation; tariff adjustments
are subject to government approval; and recruitment and dismissal of higlh-
level staff are banded by tlie Puiblic Serrvice Commi;ssinT1.
19.       Government is now considering legislation providing for the
conversion of NTB into a corporation. While this proposed conversion is
unlikely to necessitate major changes in the existing organization, it should
result in a greater degree of autonomy in the overall operations of the
entity. Majority ownership would continue to be vested in Government, but
there would be provision for public and employee participation in the ownership
of the Corporation and participation on the Board of Directors. The operation
of the Nepal Telecommunications Corporation (NTC), when created, will be
s-',ject to rules to be issued eby Government and arlicles adopted 'y the
Cornoration.  The GIovernrnent has atreec,' that any proposed rules or articles
will fie made available to thle Qs-noclation for COmmnent hbFc7rc being bro-ught
into force.



-8-
rapidly to becoine quite satisfactory towards the end of this decade. Accord-
ingly, it was agreed in negotiating the proposed credit that a 5 percent
rate of return on average net fixed assets in operation would be required
in FY1975-79, and 10 percent from FY1980 onward. The debt service covenant
of the present agreement, which required NTB to obtain IDA agreement before
contracting new debt unless the debt service coverage exceeds 1.5, has been
repeated under the new credit.
29.       The financing plan assumes an increase in telecommunications
tariffs to provide an increase in total revenues of about 15 percent on
existing revenues effective July 1973. During negotiations, the Government
agreed to a tariff increase scheme which would yield the required revenue
increase.  T-e -Coverrment has also agreed that, during the project period,
telecommunications tariffs may be reduced only with the agreement of the
Association; that funds will not be transferred from NTB during the
construction period without submitting a satisfactory financing plan
acceptable to the Association; and that it will provide short-term financing
to NTB as and w1hen the need arises.
Procurement and Disbursenent
30.       All procurement would be by international c:ompetitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement" except
for additions to the microwave system and extensions to existing telephone
exchanges and those now ieinz insraLiled under the first project.   These
items will cost an estimated US$500,000 ancd should, on the grounds of
compatibility and the economies resulting from the use of existing common
equipment and ancillary facilities, be contracted for with the original
suppliers. There is a 5 percent customs duty preference for goods from
Commonwealth countries, but NTB intends to evaluate all tenders on the basis
of C. I. F. pri rces.
31.       The proposed credit would be disbursed against the C. I. F. cost
of imported equipment and materials and the foreign exchange costs of
services and training. Estimated disbursements from the proposed credit are
shown in AMnnex 3. As the pro-ject is part of a continuing investment program,
it is proposed that any savings be made available, after consultation with
the Association, for the purchase of additional items of the same type.
Benefits
32.       The basic justification for the proposed project is that it would
help provide an essential part of the infrastructure required to facilitate
communications, which in turn should contribute importantly towards economic
development of the country. The present inadequate communication system
seriously hinders production, distribution and marketing. There is also a
need for improved and expanded telecommunication facilities in order to
meet the requirements of administration, health and other social services.
The rate of return on the project based upon expected revenues is 20 percent.
A sensitivity analysis has been carried out, showing that, even with a
combination of unfavorable developments of the main parameters, the rate of
return would not be less than 14 percent.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. The draft agreement conforms to the normal
pattern of credits for telecommunications projects.
34.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
35.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

B.   Projects in Execution 2/
(i)  Credit No. 166  Telecommunications Project; US$1.7 million Credit
of November 10, 1969; Closing Date: July 1, 1974
After initial delays in making the credit effective, delay in
signing an agreement with India for some of the aid provisions and delays
in taking procurement action, this project is now proceeding satisfactorily
and completion is expected by December 1974, some 18 months behind schedule.
As of March 31, 1973, only US$249,000 of this credit remained uncommitted.
(ii) Credit No. 223 Highway Project; US$2.5 million Credit of
December 21, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Difficulties in acquiring land and procuring certain materials
have delayed construction of the five project bridges by up to nine months.
Contractors are now expected to complete construction of all bridges by
about the middle of 1974. Procedures involved in opening letters of credit
with some suppliers and procurement problems with a foreign contractor
delayed the delivery of certain workshop and highway equipment by about
eight months. The bid price for road bridges is about 10 percent above
the cost estimate; however, it is still within the contingency allowed.
The estimated cost of other project elements is the same as appraised.
1/   Not yet effective.
2/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

(iii) Credit No. 291 Tourism Project; US$4.2 million Credit of
March 22, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1975
The Credit was declared effective on November 9, 1972. Due to
delay in meeting the conditions of effectiveness and delays in appointing
qualified architectural, engineering and project management consultants, the
project is almost one year behind schedule. A mission has just returned
from reviewing this project in Nepal, and arrangemenats are being made which
should result in activating the project.
