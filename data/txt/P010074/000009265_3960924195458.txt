NEPAL
SECOND AND THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS
CREDITS 397-NEP & 799-NEP
Highlights
i.        IDA has been involved in the telecommunications sector in Nepal
since November 1969 when the First Telecommunications Project, Credit 166-NEP
for US$1.7 million was approved. Though its completion was delayed, it was
overall successful. A major achievement was the creation of the Nepal Tele-
communications Corporation (NTC) aa a statutory corporation in June 1975. The
Second Project, Credit 397-NEP for US$5.5 million, and the Third Project,
Credit 799-NEP for US$14.5 million, were approved in April 1973 and May 1978,
respectively and are the subject of this Project Complet.ion Report. Both
projects aimed at further physical and institutional development of the tele-
communications sector to improve the availability and quality of local and
long-distance telephone services.
ii.       The two projects were overall successful.  They made significant
contributions to the development of physical facilities ind improving the
quality of the telecommunications services as also towaras the institutional
development of NTC. The completion of both projects was substantially delayed
by about four years. The main contributory factors were: (a) delay in start-
up due to delays in design and procurement; (b) break-down of contract
negotiations with the selected bidder of switching equipment for the Second
Project; (c) decision to adopt digital technology long after the start of the
Third Project; (d) delay in arranging financing for the uncovered balance of
the foreign costs of the digital switching and transmission equipment which
were nearly twice the funds available under the IDA credit for these items;
and (e) delay in commissioning of the switching and transmission equipment by
the turn-key contractor.
iii.      The two projects eventually achieved their physical targets.  The
number of working telephone connections increased by over four times. A back-
bone of high-capacity modern long-distance network has been established which
will assist also in penetration of service into rural areas. The introduction
of automatic subscriber trunk dialing facility between aitomatic exchanges
eliminated the earlier long delays in long-distance call completion due to
lack of circuits and manual operation.  The provision of the satellite earth
station improved significantly the quality of international telephone services
and enabled introduction of modern services like facsimile and data.
iv.       The actual total costs of Second and Third the projects were higher
than estimated at appraisal by 162 and 90Z respectively in terms of Nepalese
Rupee and 1X and 382 in terms of US dollar. The large increases in total
costs in terms of NRs (compared to US dollar) were mainly due to: (a) sub-
stantial devaluation of the Nepalese Rupee during the project implementation
period, and (b) substantial increase in the Third Project costs as a result of
the high cost of the digital switching equipment which was more than double



the appraisal cost estimates. The higher initial cost of digital equipment
would be more than compensated in the long-term by the substantial techno-
economic benefits of digitalization at the network of the very early stage of
its development; also substantial costs would otherwise have had to be
incurred in future in integrating the old technology equipment in a digital
environment. The local cost overruns of the two projects were financed by NTC
through its own funds; the foreign cost overrun of the Third Project was
financed by a foreign commercial bank loan.
v.        NTC's overall financial performance was generally satisfactory
throughout the project period (FY73-86). NTC's annual rates of return were
conaistently above the covenanted levels except for FY75. The debt service
covenant was met consistently except in FY84 and FY85. NTC's financial
position and cash flow situation deteriorated during FY83-85, but recovered
substantially in FY86 and FY87. Audited financial statements were generally
submitted 3-4 months later than the covenanted deadline and accounts
receivable were high.
vi.       Institutionally, NTC has developed from a Covernment Board dependent
on expatriates to fill key management positions into a well-managed public
sector corporation manned entirely by Nepalese. NTC's staff productivity in
terms of staff employed per 1,000 telephones improved from 172 in FY74 to 86
in FY87.  NTC is now much better placed institutionally to effectively and
efficiently develop, operate and manage the telecommunications ser-7ices in
Nepal.  Some institutional deficiencies exist and these are being addressed by
IDA-financed management consultants under the Fourth Telecommunications
Project approved in April 1986.
vii.      Experience with these projects offers following lessons:
(a) the implementation schedules at appraisal were too tight,
considering the level of expertise and quantum cf staff then
available in NTC for implementation;
(b) IDA could have insisted on establishment of a Project Implementation
Unit prior to credit approval;
(c) advance procurement action could have been required before credit
effectiveness which may have reduced or eliminated some of the
causes of delays in implementation, though delays caused by
contractors' or selected bidders' defaults would have remained.
While advance procurement would have reduced the IDA credit
disbursement period and reduced commitment charges, it would not
have reduced the total implementation period;
(d) considering that IDA was well aware of the large shortfall in
foreign funds for financing digital switching equipment, the
critical component of the project, and the general shortage of
foreign currency funds in Nepal, IDA could have played a more



- vi -
substantive role in assisting UHC/N and NW'C in identifying and
firming-up foreign fund sources as it subsequently did under the
Fourth Project; and
(e) IDA could have provided better advice to NTC on the field-proveness
of the selected digital switching equipment and in securing better
guarantees from the contractors.

I. INTRODUCTION
Telecommunications Sector
1.1       The authority for the development, operation aid management of the
telecommunications sector in Nepal is vested in the Ministry of Communications
(MOC). In 1959, His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG/N) established a
Telecommunications Department within the Ministry. In October 1968, the Nepal
Telecommunications Board (NTB) was created and in June 1975, it was converted
into Nepal Telecommunicaticns Corporation (NTC), a fully government owned
public sector corporation.
IDA's Involvement in the Sector
1.2       IDA has been involved in the telecommunications sector in Nepal
since 1969. The first IDA credit to the sector, Credit 166-NEP for US$1.7
million, was approved in November 1969. It provided for expansion of local
telephone facilities in Kathmandu, some HF radio systems for the long-distance
network and a land-line link to India. A major institutional achievement was
the creation of NTC (para 1.1). The project was completed in July 1977, four
years behind schedule. A Project Completion Report was issued in December
1977.
1.3       IDA Credit 397-NEP for US$5.5 million for the Second Telecommunica-
tions Project and Credit 799-NEP for US$14.5 million for the Third Telecom-
munications Project were approved in April 1973 and May 1978 respectively.
These projects supported further development of local telephone facilities in
Kathmandu and other urban areas to meet the growing demand for telephone
connections, installation of VHF and micro-wave systems in the long-distance
network and installation of automatic switching equipment for introduction of
subscriber trunk dialing (STD) service between automatic exchanges. The
Second and Third Projects were completed in December 1983 and December 1987
respectively and are the subject of this combined Project Completion Report
(PCR).
1.4       The PCR is based on data supplied by NTC to the supervision missions
in 1987 and PCR mission in February 1988, and on data collected from the IDA
files, the appraisal and supervision reports and the legal documents relating
to the two projects and the follow-on Fourth Telecommunications Project
(Credit 1588-NEP).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. Second Telecommunications Project
Preparation, Appraisal and Credit Approval
2.1       No specific request from HAG/N for IDA assistance to the telecom-
munications sector is traceable in the IDA files. However, the development
plans for the proposed Second Telecommunications Project were first prepared
by an expatriate staff of the NTB in late 1971. After some discussions with
NTB on the proposed large scale use of HF radio systems vis-a-vis microwave
and UHF/VHF radio systems and introduction of subscriber trunk dialing (STD)
vis-a-vis manual operator dialing facility in the long-distance network, the
Second Project was appraised in September-October i972. The IDA credit for
US$5.5 million was negotiated between March 12 and 16, 1973, and approved by
IDA'S Board of afxecutive Directors on April 26,1973. The credit agreement was
signed on June 20, 1973.
Project Objectives
2.2       The overall project objective was the further development of the
telecommunications facilities started under the First Project.
Project Description
2.3       The main components of the Second Project to be implemented during
FY75-79 were as follows:
(a)  installation of 7 automatic and 3 manual exchanges with 7,350 lines
and 310 lines capacity respectively; expansion of existing 2
automatic exchanges by 1,100 lines; and conversion of 5 manual
exchanges (capacity 850 lines) to automatic with 1,450 lines;
(b) expansion of local cable distribution network and installation of
subscriber terminal equipment to connect about 8,400 new
subscribers;
(c) installation of (i) 2 new microwave radio systems, standby radio
channels on two existing microwave systems and multiplex equipment
on the above systems for 96 speech and 6 VFT channels;
(d) installation of about 250 lines of trunk switching equipment in 6
existing exchanges;
(e) installation of one manual telex exchange with 80 lines capacity and
provision of 90 teleprinters;
(f) installation of one international HF radio station;
(g) provision of vehicles, tools, test equipment and training equipment;



-3-
(h) construction of a new headquarters building for NTS; and
(i) provision of consultancy services.
Project Costs and Financing
2.4       The total costs of the project were estimated at NBR  83.2 million
(US$7.9 million) including foreign costs of NRs 58.2 million (US$5.5 million).
The local costs were to be fully financed by HKG/N and the foreign costs from
the proceeds of the IDA credit.
Covenants
2.5       In addition to standard IDA covenants, the Development Credit
Agreement (DCA) 397-NEP provided for the following:
(a) a subsidiary loan agreement to be signed between HMG/N and NTB
within six months of the date of the DCA [DCA 3.021;
(b) in the event of NTB being converted into a corporation, HIG/N shall
make available to IDA for comment the rules and regulations
specifically applicable to such corporation prior to their adoption
[DCA 4.04(c)];
(c) HMG/N to cause NTB to adopt measures to improve the performance and
productivity of its employees [DCA 4.051;
(d) by July 16, 1973, NTB to adjust its tariffs to increase its
operating revenues by a' least 15% and thereafter not reduce its
tariffs until the completion of the project [DCA 4.06(a)];
(e) ITB to maintain tariffs at a level adequate to assure a minimum rate
of return on average assets in service of at least 5Z in FY75-79 and
1OZ thereafter [DCA 4.06(a)];
(f) ITB to maintain debt service coverage ratio of 1.5 times [DCA
4.07(a)]; and
(g) NTB to submit audit reports within 5 months of the close of the
fiscal year [DCA 4.01].
2.6       The status of compliance with the covenants is discussed in
para. 6.13.

B. Third Telecommunications Project
Preparation, Appraisal and Credit Approval
2.7       No specific HMG/N request for IDA assistance for the Third Project
is traceable in the files but the possibility of IDA assistance for further
de,elopment of telecommunications Zacilities in Nepal was discussed in Nepal
in December 1976 by an IDA supervision mission for the ongoing Second
Project. A Project Brief was issued in February 1977. The project was
prepared by the NTC and was appraised by IDA in November 1977. The IDA Credit
for US$ 14.5 million was negotiated between March 30 and April 5, 1978 and
approved by IDA's Board of Executive Directors on May 11,1978. The credit
agreement was signed on August 22,1978.
Project Objectives
2.8       The principal objectives of the Third Project were defined as
follows:
(a) meet about 70Z of the total demand for telephone connections in
areas already served, and provide telephone exchanges in 21 new
areas and subscriber radio telephone service to 100 rural areas;
(b) automatic long-distance service in all areas served by automatic
exchanges; and
(c)  improve international telecommunications sw-rvices through provision
of a satellite earth station.
Project Description
2.9       The main components of the Third Project to be implemented during
FY79-83 were as follows:
(a) increase in local telephone exchange capacity by 20,600 lines
including provision of 10 new automatic and 11 new manual exchanges,
and conversion of 6 manual exchanges to automatic;
(b) installation of six 12-channel UHF systems, seven 12- channel VHF
systems and associated multiplex equipment;
(c) installation of subscriber radio telephone facilities to serve 100
rural locations;
(d) installation of trunk automatic switching equipment, automatic
message accounting (AMA) and automatic number identification (ANI)
equipment for providing STD service in 19 automatic exchanges areas;
(e)  installation of.a small satellite earth station for international
services; and
(f) installation of a telex exchange to serve about 400 subscribers.



-5-
Pr.ject Costs and Financing
2.10      The total costs of the project were estimated at NRs 306.8 million
(US$25.6 million), including foreign costs of NRs 210.0 million (US$17.5 mil-
lion). The local costs were to be financed in full by NTC from its internal
resources. Of the foreign costs, US$14.5 million were to be financed from the
proceeds of the IDA credit and the balance US$3.0 million (being the estimated
costs of the telex exchange and the satellite earth station) by the Overseas
Development Agency (ODA) of United Kingdom.
Covenants
2.11      Other thar the standard IDA covenants, there were no covenants
specific to the preject in DCA 799-NEP. Under the Project Agreement (PA), the
NTC was required to comply with the following:
(a)  employ engineering consultants for design, detailed engineering,
preparation of technical specification and bid documents, and
evaluation of bids for local and trunk switching equipment, telex
exchange and satellite earth station [PA 2.02];
(b) not later than December 31, 1980, carry out an Economic Study of the
Telecommunications Sector in Nepal (PA 2.08];
(c)  not later than the end of FY79, introduce a commercial accounting
system [PA 4.01(b)];
(d)  submit audit report within six months of the end of each fiscal year
[PA 4.021;
(e)  maintain tariffs at a level adequate to ensure a rate of return of
at least 8% per annum for FY79 and FY80 end 10% per annum for each
year thereafter (PA 4.03(a)];
(f)  commencing not later than July 15, 1979, review the value of its
assets every 12 months and revalue the assets if the value of the
assets is 10% more than their value on July 15, 1977 [PA403(a)]; and
(g)  maintain debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5 times (PA
4.04(a)].
2.11      The status of compliance with the covenants is discussed in
para. 6.13.



III. IMPLEMENTATION
A. Second Telecommunications Project
Credit Effectiveness and Start-up
3.1       There being no specific conditions for credit effectiveness, tie
credit was declared effective on the date specified in the DCA, namely
September 11, 1973.
3.2       An English translation of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement dated
August 15, 1974 between the HMG/N and NTB (over eight months behind the date
specified in the DCA) was received by IDA in September 1974 and found to be
deficient in some respects. However, since it was based on a similar
agreement in respect of IDA Credit 166-NEP for the First Telecommunications
Project which IDA had accepted at that time, IDA did not insist on any
amendments. The revision of tariffs required by July 15, 1973 (DCA 4.06(a)]
was actually implemented in January 1974. On other items relating to the
project start-up, there was little action in 1974 and 1975, primarily because
IDA's expectation of the design work being carried out by available expatriate
staff were belied. The actual first steps in the design of the network were
taken only in 1976 after the required experts and consultants became available
in late 1975.
Revision of Project
3.3       Annex 1 gives a comparison of the physical installations as planned
and those actually completed. There was no substantive revision of the
overall scope of the project. However, some changes in the type and sizes of
telephone exchanges became necessary (Annex 2) due to delay in project start-
up, changes in the demand pattern, the post-appraisal decision to digitalize
the network and combine the procurement of automatic switching equipment for
this and the follow-on Third Project, and the need to provide emergency relief
in some areas. Against 9,550 lines of automatic exchanges proposed at
appraisal, only 5,700 lines were installed under this project and the balance
under the Third Project. On the other hand, against 510 lines of manual
exchanges proposed at appraisal, 3,080 lines were installed, most of which
were subsequently replaced by automatic exchanges under the Third Project as
by that time NTC had decided to reduce manual exchanges in the network to the
minimum. Total increase in the capacity of automatic exchanges under the
Second and Third Projects was 25,450 lines against appraisal estimate of
26,570 lines. Net addition to manual exchanges was only 250 lines under the
two projects though 3,080 lines were first installed under the Second Project
of which 2,830 lines were replaced under the Third Project.
3.4       The transmission equipment was installed substantially as planned.
The long-distance routes on which transmission equipment was installed were
not changed. The reduction in the number of transmission systems (Annex 2)
was because of changes in system configuration.



- 7 -
3.5       Two deletions from the project were (a) headquarters building for
NTC due to the very low priority allotted by HMG/N to such civil works, and
(b) the 600-line PABX for the government agencies which was provided by HMG/N
on its own and NTC's services were requested only for its maintenance. Also,
due to cost over-runs on other project items, the expansion of telex exchange
was postponed to the Third Project. While the changes in the project details
were noted and agreed by the IDA supervision missions, no formal revision of
Schedule 2 of the DCA 397-NEP was issued. The reduced local exchange
installations under the Second Project reduced the benefits forecast at
appraisal from this project. However, the balance lines were installed
simultaneously with similar installations under the Third Project and thus
increased the benefits forecast for that project.
Implementation Schedule
3.6       At appraisal, the project was expected to be completed by July 1979.
However, only 20Z of the physical facilities were completed by that date. A
major portion of the manual exchange expansion was completed in 1980 and 1981
and the transmission network in 1981 and 1982. Installation of the automatic
exchanges in Kathmandu (for which procurement was combined with similar
equipment under the Third Project) was delayed substantially and the exchange
was commissioned in December 1983, completing the project, about four and one-
half years behind schedule.
3.7       The delay is attributed mainly to the following:
(a) staff changes at the senior management level and delay in obtaining
technical assistance for design, detailed engineering and prepara-
tion of technical specifications and bid documents after the
appraisal expectation of these items being carried out by available
expatriate staff did not materialize;
(b) delay in procurement of switching equipment as the supplier
initially selected after international competitive bidding (ICB) was
found during contract negotiations to be unable to comply with the
important technical requirement of signalling; NTC, with IDA
concurrence, decided to cancel that tender and combine procurement
of switching equipment for the Second and the Third projects under
one bid;
(c) delay in commissioning of the exchanges by the supplier.
Project Costs
3.8       Annex 3 indicates the estimated and the actual costs of the
different components of the project. Table 3.1 below suzmmarizes the total
project costs in Nepalese Rupees and US dollars. The exchange rate at
appraisal was US$l=NRs10.56. In conversion of costs to US dollars, annual
exchange variations have been applied which result in proforma exchange rate
of US$l=NRs16.06 for the total project costs.

3.9       The costs of the civil works were underestimated at appraisal.  The
unit costs of the automatic switching equipment and subscriber distribution
network were also underestimated, though the increase in total costs was
compensated by reduction in the equipment procured. Teleprinter machines
which were originally intended to be procured through ICB were procured from
Hong Kong using local currency, whereas some vehicles which were intended to
be procured locally were procured through ICB. The increase in total costs in
terms of NRs is higher than in US$ because of average 52Z reduction in value
of NRs during the project period.
Disbursements
3.10      Annex 4 gives details of the semi-annual cumulative disbursements
and Table 3.2 below gives a comparison of the estimated and actual annual
cumulative disbursements of the credit.

3.11      The credit was closed on December 31, 1982, 30 months after the
scheduled date of June 30, 1980. (SAR indicated credit to oe fully disbursed
by June 30, 1979.) The credit continued to be disbursed daring the grace
period and the last disbursement was made on March 31, 19M3. Since the credit
was approved only in April 1973, and considering that :'nsiderable design and
engineering work had to be undertaken before procurement could commence, the
appraisal estimate of commencement of disbursement during FY74 was
unrealistic. Delay in NTC securing consultants for the design work delayed
procurement and hence the disbursements.
Credit Allocation
3.12      Table 3.3 below indicates the credit allocation and actual dis-
bursement against each category. Annex 5 gives a detailed comparison of
credit allocation (including the unallocated category) and actual disbursement
against each category. Though there were some changes in project scope and
financing of goods, no amendment to credit atlocation was issued. Higher
disbursements against categories I(a), I(b) and II(a) were due to higher unit
costs of equipment and higher value of US dollar against other currencies.
The long-distance switching equipment in category II(b) was combined with
local switching equipment and its costs included in category I(a). In
category III, the procurement of telex exchange was deferred and teleprinters
procured using local currency funds. In category V, vehicles originally
intended to be procured with local funds were procured through ICB using IDA
funds.

Reporting
3.13      NTC did not submit any periodic reports on physical implementation
during 1973-77.  Thereafter, it submitted combined six-monthly reports for the
Second and the Third Projects. For the ongoing Fourth Project, NTC is
submitting quarterly reports.
Procurement
3.14      Due to changes in the top management personnel of NTB and the
inability of the available staff to undertake design and engineering satis-
factory to IDA, technical consultants financed by ODA were appointed and
started work in mid-1976. Orders for the negotiated procurement of switching



- 11 -
equipment for expansion of existing exchanges were placed in February 1976 on
firms in Sweden and India for US$ 602,000 equivalent. Orders for items otLtr
than automatic switching equipment were placed between 1977 and 1979. For
automatic switching equipment, bids were first invit_d in June 1977 and the
suppliEr was selected with IDA's concurrence in August 1978. However,
problems arose during contract negotiations with the selected supplier when he
expressed his inability to meet the important specification requirement of
signalling. It is not clear hot this aspect was overlooked during evaluation
by both NTC and IDA. After consultation with IDA, the bid was declared non-
responsive. NTC considered the various alternatives proposed by IDA and
finally accepted IDA's preferred alternative of combining procurement of
switching equipment for this project with that for the Third Project and the
tender was cancelled. At the same time, in consonance with the general world
trend towards digitalization of telecommunications networks, NTC with full IDA
support decided to procure only digital switching equipment for both projects
instead of the analog type proposed earlier.
3.15      Bids for the digital switching equipment were announced in December
1980 and received in March 1981. There was substantial delay in the evalua-
tion of bids as NTC was evaluating bids for digital equipment for the first
time. The successful bidder selected by NTC was approved by IDA in February
1982. The value of the contract was estimated at approximately US$19.5 mil-
lion equivalent (based on the then currency exchange rates) which was far in
excess of the funds (approximately US$9 million) available under the two IDA
credits for this equipment. Securing the financing for the full contract
price became a major issue. A possible alternative of reducing the quantum of
equipment and the scope of the projects was considered, but not accepted,
because of acute shortage of available facilities vis-a-vis the pending
demand. IDA required the NTC and HMG/N to secure financing for the balance
contract price not covered by the available funds in the two IDA credits
before signing the contract. However, NTC signed the contract on May 28, 1982
before the funding arrangements were in place. Si.:bsequently, HMG/N asiured
IDA that it would cover the balance of US$10.5 million from its own and/or
other sources. With this assurance, IDA approved the contract. HMG/N's share
of firancing was reduced from US$10.5 million to US$7.2 million in June 1984
when additional funds were all3cated to category 1 of Credit 799-NEP to cover
the contract price. HMG/N was unable to provide even these reduced funds and
instead permitted NTC to finance US$2.2 million from its own funds and secure
a commercial bank loan for the balance. It was, however, oixteen months
before the commercial bank loan was secured. During this period, for lack of
assurance of payments, the contractor suspended delivery of equipment and
services, which further delayed the installation of the switching and
transmission equipment.
3.16      In summary, the major causes of delay in completion of the project
were the initial 2-year delay in the start-up of action on procurement, delay
in award of contract for the switching equipment and delay in delivery of
equipment by supplier because of non-availability of funds with NTC to pay for
it.

Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.17      Consultants financed by ODA were appointed in late 1975 for design
and detailed engineering of the switching equipment; expatriate staff financed
through the Colombo Plan held key management positions in NTB/NTC till 1978.
The performance of the consultants and the expatriate staff was satisfac-
tory. The performance of contractors and suppliers was generally satisfactory
except for the turn-key contractor for the digital switching equipment. The
performance of this contractor is discussed in para. 3.32.
B. Third Telecommunications Project
Credit Effectiveness and Start-up
3.18      There were four conditions of effectiveness of the credit, namely
(a) signing of the subsidiary loan agreement between HMC/N and NTC;
(b) tariffs to be increased substantially by July 16, 1978; (c) employment of
consultants for design, preparation of technical specification and bid docu-
ments, and evaluation of bids for major items for the project; and (d) con-
firmation of availability of cofinancing for two project components. The
original effectiveness date (November 20, 1978) was postponed to January 19,
1979 and later to February 28, 1979 because of non-compliance with conditions
(a) and (d) above, and for lack of formal evidence of compliance with (b) and
(c). The credit was declared effective on February 27, 1979.
Revision of Project
3.19      There was no substantive changes in the overall scope of the project
(Annex 1) though there were some changes in the types and sizes of local
exchanges (Annex 2) and in the transmission systems primarily arising out of
the post-appraisal decision on technology supported by IDA to digitalize the
network (para 3.14).
Implementation Schedule
3.20      At appraisal, the project was expected to be completed by December
1983. However, less than 10X of the physical facilities were actually
installed by that date. The project was substantially completed by
December 31, 1987, four years behind schedule, but some facilities in the
digital exchanges are not yet provided because of non-availability of
software. These are now expected to be introduced in the exchanges only in
late 1989 as the supplier has yet to develep the required software.
3.21      Several factors contributed to the substantial delay in project
implemwntation. First, there was delay of nearly two years in the start of
procurement for all items except for small radio systems. For the major items
of switching and transmission equipment, delay was due to the post-appraisaL
decision of NTC to digitalize the telecommunications network in Nepal. There
was also delay in securing the services of consultants for design and detailed
engineering, and preparation of technical specifications and bid documents for
these items.  Second, there was delay in evaluation of bids and selection of
successful bidder. Third, there was delay 4n contract award to the selected



- 13 -
supplier because the funds available under the two IDA credits for these items
were less than half the contract price. IDA insisted that NTC and HMG/N
guarantee availability of the balance of funds from their own or other sources
before signing the contract. Fourth, HMG/N initially assured IDA that it
would cover the shortfall from its own and/or other sources and this assurance
was accepted by IDA; however, when the time came for actual payments to the
contractor, HMG/N could not provide NTC with the necessary foreign funds.
Instead, it authorized NTC to cover the shortfall through its own internal
cash generation and the balance through a commercial bank foreign exchange
loan. While NTC acted expeditiously to obtain a foreign commercial bank loan,
there was delay in HMG/N's guarantee of the loan. For lack of assurance of
payment, the contractor suspended delivery of the hardware and software for
the equipment. Fifth, there were substantial initial problems with the
functioning of the new digital switching equipment due to software defici-
encies particularly in respect of interworking of the first digital exchange
commissioned with the existing crossbar exchange. Sixth, while the aupplier
had contracted for the digital remote line units, it was later found that the
software for these units had not been developed. The hardware for these units
was installed at site but it could not be commissioned for lack of software.
In addition, the software for several facilities to be provided by the new
digital exchanges and for the operation of the auto-manual special services
positions was not available due to development delays.
3.22      Because of the poor functioning of the new digitai exchanges both
internal and in their inter-working with existing exchanges, the quality of
service to subscribers connected to the new exchanges was initially very
poor. Further, because of traffic problems within the exchanges, NTC could
not utilize the fulL capacity of the exchanges for subscriber connections to
meet the pending demand though, in some areas this was also due to non-
availability of cable distribution network due to delay in its construction by
NTC. The malfunctioning of the new digital exchanges also delayed introduc-
tion of STD service for long-distance calls. All these affected NTC's
revenues, prolonged subscriber dissatisfaction with the quality of service
provided by NTC and, in general, eroded public confidence in NTC's ability to
deliver the much-needed telecommunications services.
Projects Costs
3.23      Annex 3 details the estimated and actual costs of individual
components of the project. Table 3.4 below summarizes the total costs in
Nepalese Rupees and US Dollars. The exchange rate at appraisal was
US$1=NRsl2.00. In conversion of costs to US$ equivalent, annual exchange rate
variation. were applied which result in a proforma exchange rate of
US$l=NRs16.60 for the total project costs.

(Decrease)
3.24      The costs of digital switching and transmission equipment were
substantially higher than appraizal estimates which were based on analog type
switching equipment and manual exchanges. The costs of the earth station and
telex exchange procured under bilateral financing were also substantially
higher. These high foreign costs resulted in high customs duties which were
further increased due to imposition of a higher rate of duty than expected at
appraisal. This increase in custom duty was compensated partially by
reduction in local costs of some components due to installation being carried
out by foreign suppliers under turn-key contracts instead of local staff.
Part of the increase in total costs in terms of Nepalese Rupees was due to
average 33% reduction in the value of the rupee against US Dollar.
Disbursements
3.25      Annex 4 gives details of the semi-annual cumulative disbursements of
the IDA credit. Table 3.5 below gives a comparison of the actual annual
disbursements against the appraisal estimates:

3.26      The original closing date June 30, 1984 was extended by a year to
June 30, 1985 and the credit was closed that day.  IDA however continued to
disburse the commicted balance during the grace period which was extended till
the final disbursement an January 22, 1986.  T- delay in disbursement was
mainly due to delayed start-up of procurement civities.

the ODA and Indian Aid grants to HMG/N.  In respect of categories 2 and 3(a),
the total disbursement was US$ 1,142,785 against revised allocation including
proportionate unallocated of US$ 1,008,477.
Reporting
3.29      NTC submitted regular six-monthly progress reports on physical
implementation. For the ongoing Fourth Project, NTC is submitting quarterly
reports.



- 17 -
Procurement
3.30      Due to the delay in securing consultants for design, detailed
engineering and preparation of technical specifications and bid documents for
the digital switching equipment, the bids for this item were invited in
December 1980, nearly 14 months after the credit was signed. There was
subsequent delay in evaluation of bids, selection of supplier, award of
contract, securing financing for the balance of the contract price not covered
by IDA credits, etc. (para. 3.15). For other project items, there was a delay
of nearly two years in the issue of bid invitations but there were no specific
problems thereafter in award of contracts. Delays in procurement of other
items did not materially affect project implementation which was mainly
governed by the installation and commissioning of the digital switching
equipment and transmission equipment.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.31      As provided under the credit, consultants were provided for design,
detailed engineering and preparation of technical specification for (a) the
switching and subscriber trunk dialing equipment, and (b) the satellite earth
station and telex exchange. An expert was provided under the Colombo Plan for
item (a), but his performance was not considered satisfactory by NTC. After
the preparation of the bid document, services of an ITU expert were used for
bid evaluation. For item (b) above, consultants financed by the ODA were
employed whose performance was satisfactory. A firm of local consultants
appointed and financed by the Planning Commission of HMG/N, were employed to
carry out the Economic Study of the Telecommunications Sector in Nepal. The
study was carried out in 1981, and its draft report was reviewed by IDA. For
the level of expertise available in Nepal, the report indicated that the study
was well conducted and the type of data collected and their analysis was
satisfactory. IDA offered substantial comments on how the study and its
results could be further improved.  NTC made some use of the findings of the
study in planning further development of telecommunications services in Nepal
and the IDA appraisal mission for the follow-on Fourth Project also used some
of the data on rural areas.
3.32      While the performance of the suppliers of other project items was
satisfactory, that of the turn-key contractor for the digital exchanges and
transmission systcms, which formed the backbone of the project, left much to
be desired. This affected substantially the implementation of the project
and, initially, the quality of service from the new equipment was poor. The
digital exchanges offered by the supplier in response to the bid invitation
had apparentiy not been fully field-proven at that time. Some software (e.g.
for remote line units, some facilities in the main exchanges and for auto-
manual positions) had apparenitly not been developed before being offered, and
not made available for some years after contract signature. There was a
requirement f field-proven equipment in the bid document but there was a
difference ot opinion between IDA and the NTC in its interpretation during
evaluation. IDA had initially considered the equipment offered by the bidder
selected by NTC for contract award as non-responsive to the field-proven
requirement but subsequently accepted the more loose interpretation applied by
NTC and concurred with NTC's award decision. In retrospect, IDA's initial



- 18 -
reaction proved correct. There were also other deficiencies in the hardware
of the equipment offered, such as inadequate protection against high voltage
which resulted in large number of failures of subscriber cards in the new
exchanges. Hardware and software problems in the equipment also precluded NTC
from loading the first commissioned digital exchange to its full capacity,
causing dissatisfaction to the registered applicants on the waiting list and
loss of revenue to NTC. While some delay in equipment delivery and commission-
ing by the supplier could be attributed to delay by NTC in arranging for
financing, the overall performance of the contractor for the digital switching
equipment must be judged as unsatisfactory.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.1       Annex 6 lists the key performance indicators relating to the overall
operating performance of NTC. The combined project targets of the Second and
the Third projects were generally achieved, though with substantial delays.
In terms of local exchange capacity, 25,450 lines aggregate were installed
under the two projects against the target of 26,570 lines, and 23,920 new
connections were adaed against the aggregate target of 23,233 lines. The
actual number of working lines increased by over three times--from about 7,850
lines at end of First Project to over 25,885 lines on completion of the Third
Project. In addition to the physical growth of the network, the projects
contributed substantially to improvements in the quality of all services-
local, domestic long-distance and international--through introduction of
digital technology in the domestic network and satellite earth station for
international services. NTC installed some new manual exchanges under the
Second Project to meet urgent demands, but these were later replaced by
automatic exchanges. NTC has since taken a policy decision supported by IDA
not to procure any new manual exchanges, though it may %se some recovered
manual exchanges in remote rural areas. The domestic long-distance service
between automatic exchanges was automatized through STD service. In the
international sector, land-lines to India and HF radio circuits to other
countries, all of indifferent quality, were replaced by high-grade satellite
circuits and the number of international circuits increased from 17 to 43.
4.2       No data is available on the improvement in call completion rate as
no such data were earlier maintained by NTC. Under the Fourth Project,
management consultants will propose quality of service parameters for
different services, including levels to be attained and methods and procedures
for their measurements. However, from personal experience of supervision
missions and their discussions with local public, the service quality has
improved significantly in both the local and long-distance networks and on
international calls.  In the cable distribution network, introduction of
better construction methods, improved fault location and clearance procedures,
and the reorganization of the outside plant maintenance department, all with
the assistance of an ITU expert financed by UNDP, have reduced fault incidence
and their duration. As regards international services, due to the multiple
increase in the number of circuits to foreign countries, the delays on
international telephone and telex calls were substantially reduced. In
addition, NTC was able to offer new services like facsimile transmission.



- 19 -
4.3       During project implementation, the supervision missions noted the
delays in utilization of available exchange capacities for connection of new
lines because of archaic and bureaucratic administrative procedures in NTC for
allocation of new lines to waiting applicants and for physical installa-
tions. These were streamlined and would be further improved after the
recommendations of the management consultants employed under the Fourth
Project are implemented.
4.4       In summary, while many internal operational problems remain and
these will be identified and addressed by IDA-financed management consultants
under the Fourth Project, both the availability of facilities and the overall
technical operational performance of NTC were substantially improved under the
two projects.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

5.2       UTC's financial performance was generally good over the project
period. From FY74 to FY77, its actual telephone revenue per line was almost



- 20 -
the same as the appraisal estimates. Between FY78 and FY83, except FY81 and
FY82, the actutl telephone revenue per line was higher than the forecasts.
Though the operating expense per line was consistently higher than the
appraisal estimates, the rate of its increase (9.5Z per annum during FY73 to
FY87) was much smaller than that of telephone revenue (15.1 per annum during
FY73 and FY87). The telephone revenues per line in real terms (1913 prices)
increased from NRs 1,488 in FY73 to NRs 1,753 in FY87 as a result of several
tariff increases (para 6.11), but the cash operating expense per line in real
terms was maintained at the same level of about NRs 1,000 over the same
period.
5.3       The rate of return (on historical cost and after tax before interest
basis) was consistently higher than the covenanted level except for 1975 and
more or less in line with the appraisal estimates despite the fact that NTC
became liable for income taxes from FY78 which was not anticipated at
appraisal. Under the Second Project, NTC was required to maintain a minimum
rate of return (on historical cost basis) of 5% in FY75-79 and 10% there-
after. The actual rate of return increased from 2% in FY75 to 13Z in FY79.
Under the Third Project, NTC was required to revalue its fixed assets and the
covenanted rate was changed to 8Z in FY79 and FY80 and 1OZ thereafter on a
revalued basis. IDA had not required NTC to undertake asset revaluation until
FY84 because the book value costs had been considered as reflecting reasonably
well their replacement costs (para. 6.6'. During FY79-84, the actual rate of
return on historical (and revalued) basis was consistently above the
covenanted level. Revaluation has not been undertaken until now though it
appears to have been necessary from FY85. The actual rate of return (on
historical cost basis) was 16% in FY85, 15% in FY86 and 21X in FY87.
Financial Position
5.4       NTC's financial position had been generally above expectations until
FY82, reflecting reasonable profitability and a slow growth of long-term debt
(and fixed assets) resulting from delays in project implementation. The net
long-term debt-to-equity ratio had been satisfactory and consistently lower
than the appraisal estimate.   At the end of FY82, the ratio was 53/47.  The
current ratio was satisfactory and was 4:1 at the end of FY82. However,
between FY83 and FY85, the net long-term debt-to-equity ratio increased to
about 70% because fixed assets which were financed by long-term debt
increased, much more substantially during this short period of time than in
previous years. The major factor causing the ratio to increase was the cost
of digital switching and transmission equipment, procured during this period
and which was substantially higher than appraisal estimate and the increase in
cost financed by borrowings (para 3.24). While net long term debt increased
by only NRS 117 million in the nine years between FY73 and FY82, it increased
by NRS 181 million only in the years between FY82 and FY85. The current ratio
declined to 0.9:1 at the end of FY85. However, the capital structure and
liquidity position recovered in FY86 and FY87 to a satisfactory level as a
substantial amount of the JICA-funds for a rural project started to be passed
on to NTC in the form of HMG/N's equity contributions. The net long-term
debt-to-equity ratio improved to 42/58 at the end of FY87, and the current
ratio to 1.6:1.



- 21 -
5.5       The level of accounts receivable was much higher than expected
throughout the project period. From FY76 to FY80, it averaged about four
months and reached 147 days in FY81, compared with the appraisal target of 55
days. From FY82 onwards, the trend has been improving, but it was still
equivalent to 111 days in FY87 (para 6.10).
Sources and Uses of Funds
5.6       During FY73-83 (the appraisal estimates are available only up to
FY83), the annual funds requirements, and thus total borrowings, were much
less than expected due to delays in project implementation. For the whole
FY73-83 period, the actual three year average net internal cash generation was
29% of capital expenditures, and local capital expenditures were covered by
internally generated funds. The ratio was comparable to the appraisal
estimate of 30%. However, the internal cash generation ratio declined to 9Z
in FY83, 5% in FY84, 11% in FY85 due to hign level of capital expenditure for
these three years. In FY87, the ratio recovered substantially to 43% as a
result of the tariff increase effective October 1986.
5.7       The debt service coverage ratio had been consistently satisfactory
and above the covenanted level of 1.5 times until FY83. Hcwever, the covenant
.ias not fulfilled in FY84 and FY85 due to increased debt service amount, but
met in FY86 and FY87 as a result of significant increase in the number of
lines connected and the tariff increase in October 1986.
5.8       The actual external financing during FY73-83 consisted of:  IDA
(56%), onlending of -rant funds (27%), subscriber deposit (4%) and HMG/N
(13%), as compared with the appraisal estimates of: IDA (76%), onlending of
grant funds (5%), subscriber deposit (5%) and HMG/N (14%).
Fiscal Impact
5.9       NTC's operations contributed substantially to government revenues.
NTC is required to pay custom duties at 1% for equipment financed by IDA
credit and other concessional funds or 15% for equipment financed by other
foreign sources. IDA credits and other concessionary funds (except the JICA
funds) are onlent from HMG/N to NTC on commercial terms. Also, NTC pays taxes
to the government, currently 40% of net incnme before pension provisions. The
net amount paid by NTC to the government was about NRs. 270 million during
FY79-87.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Organization and Management
6.1       Arising out of the consultants' recommendations under the First
Telecommunications Project (Credit 167-NEP), the Nepal Telecommunications
Board (NTB) was created in October 1969 as a semi-autonomous agency for
development, operation and management of telecommunications in Nepal. In June
1975, legislation was passed converting NTB into a fully government-owned



- 22 -
statutory corporation, NTC. Three expatriate staff financed under the Colombo
Plan continued to man key executive positions in NTC till late 1978 when they
were replaced by Nepalese. W4ile NTC legally came into being in mid-1975,
internal rules and regulations were not issued till 1979. However, that did
not hold up some gradual internal reorganization within NTC, such as creation
of an Internal Audit Section, Training Directerate, International System
Management Unit, Project Implementation Unit, Operation and Maintenance
Department, Regional Offices, etc. Till mid-1987, NTC was divided into three
main units - engineering, business and administration, and finance and
accounts. In late 1987, appreciating the need for splitting the functions of
planning and development from those of operation and maintenance, as also the
need to relieve the General Manager as the Chief Executive Officer of routine
day-to-day management functions, three positions of Deputy General Managers
were created to take charge of (1) Planning and Development, (2) Operation and
Maintenance, and (3) Finance, Business and Personal Administration. The
creation of these positions and other reorganization measures were
organizational changes are in the right direction. It is pertinent to note
that the reorganization was initiated by NTC management on its own without any
external assistance or pressure. NTC has matured considerably between 1973
and 1987, growing from a small Government Board depending on expatriate staff
for key management positions to an independent corporation able to manage its
considerably enhanced responsibilities reasonably well. The management
consultants retained under the Fourth Project are currently reviewing several
institutional issues, such as further organizational improvements, strategic
planning process, human resource development, material management, etc. Their
report is expected in mid 1989 and recommendations will be reviewed with IDA.
Staff, Recruitment and Training
6.2       Under the Third Project, NTC was expected to improve its staff
productivity from 133 staff per 1,000 telephones in 1977 to 78 staff in 1987.
The appraisal estimates and actuals achieved annually are given in Annex 10.
NTC was able to achieve only a modest improvement of 117 staff per 1,000
telephones by 1983, but it improved to 86 staff per *,000 telephones by 1987
(against the Fou!th Project target of 92). Between 1977 and 1987, the staff
employed increased on an average 8.6% per annum against 12.5% per annum
increase in telephone lines.
6.3       NTC does not have difficulty in recruiting staff other than for
higher level technical positions, the latter due to lack of candidates
specifically qualified in telecommunications engineering. For technical
staff, NTC has a problem of retaining trained experienc.ad staff because of
unattractive levels of renumeration and benefits compared to those in the
private sector. These problems persisted through the two projects and
resulted in large proportion of sanctioned technical posts remaining
unfilled.  For example, at the end of 1987, 28Z of the sanctioned posts of
engineers and higher level technicians were unfilled. This problem was noted
by IDA supervision missions, but no specific action was initiated primarily
because the renumeration and benefits in NTC are lirked by government
regulations to those in other state corporations. The issue has now been
referred to management consultants un.er the Fourth Project as part of their
review of human rcsource development in NTC.



- 23 -
6.4       During implementation of the Third Project, NTC established a well-
equipped Telecommunications Training center for technical staff with ITU/UNDP
assistance. The quantum and quality of training in low technology equipment
are adequate for NTC's requirements. For modern high-technology digital
equipment, suppliers were required to provide training in their establishments
and factories abroad to a few NTC senior engineers and provide an instructor
in Nepal to train larger number of technicians in new technology. Appropriate
training equipment such as a model training exchange was also required to be
provided for the NTC's Telecommunications Training Center. On-the-job
training was also received by NTC staff during installation, acceptance
testing and commissioning of new equipment and during the initial period of
maintenance of the equipmenat by contractor's staff. In summary, the training
arrangements for technical staff for the equipment provided under the projects
were adequate and satisfactory. The NTC staff are able to operate and
maintain even the sophisticated digital equipment adequately. While there are
adequate training arrangements in NTC for the technical staff, there are no
provisions for the finance, accounts and administrative staff nor for
refresher training of technical staff in new technology. The management
consultants under the Fourth Project will address these deficiencies.
Accounting
6.5       As covenanted under the Third Project, NTC introduced a commercial
accounting system in 1979. Most accounting processes are done manually, and
regional technical departments tend to be late in informing the account
offices about the status of capital work and inventory. Consequently, delays
in account processing often occur. Though the timeliness of the accounting
system needs to be improved, it produces accurate information and has adequate
internal controls. Computerization of the billing system will be completed
after the management consultants retained under the Fourth Project make
specific recommendations. Such a system will facilitate the timely completion
of NTC's financial statements.
6.6       Under the Third Project, NTC was required to revalue its fixed
assets in operation for the purpose of rate of return calculations. But,
considering that the total book value of NTC's fixed assets in operation had
reflected reasonably well their replacement costs, IDA had not required NTC to
revalue its fixed assets until FY84. The continuous devaluacion of the
Nepalese Rupee, however, has apparently increased the replacement cost of the
imported equipment. Currently, the management consultants retained under the
Fourth Project are assisting NTC in establishing a proper revaluation method.
6.7       Recently, NTC management, which consists mainly of professionals
with engineering background, has placed more emphasis on financial management
and planning. Some evidences are: (a) NTC employed a senior chartered
accountant for the first time in FY87; (b) NTC's FY88 budget presented  o the
Board included financial analysis and forecasts for the future which had never
been done before; and (c) a financial management/planning wing will be newly
established in addition to an accounting wing under the new organizational
structure which is being put into place.



- 24 -
Audit
6.8       NTC has an internal audit department which carries out audits of
procedures and financial records and reports to the management twice a year.
Until FY79, a local auditing firm had been retained as external auditors.
From FY80 onward, two auditing firms based in New Delhi have been serving as
external auditors. NTC's financial statements have been audited in satisfac-
tory manner over the project period. Under the Second Project, NTC had been
required to submit its audited statements to IDA within five months of the
close of each fiscal year, which had not been fulfilled. Under the Third
Project, tne deadline for submission of audited accounts was changed to six
months from FY79.  However, there were still delays of about four to six
months consistently.  Delays are due, first, to the late appointment of the
external auditors, who are appointed by HMG/N for each year and, second, to
internal procedures under which NTC's Board bas to approve draft accounts
before these are sent for audit. Under the Fourth Project, the covenant was
changed to the effect that unaudited accounts should be submitted to IDA
within six months of the end of the fiscal year and correspondirg audit
accounts should be submitted two months thereafter. For both FY86 and FY87,
unaudited accounts were submitted before the deadline, but audited accounts
were still two months late. Recently, NTC started to submit mediumo-term
financial projections to IDA supervision missions, and this information is
well utilized by its management.
Billing and Collection
6.9       Until 1984, NTC's bills, except for telex services, were prepared
manually. The first new digital telephone exchanges were put into service by
mid 1984, and the billing information for the automatic long-distance calls is
now recorded on magnetic tapes which are read by computers. The rest of the
billing system will be computerized after the management consultants make
recommendations by the end of FY88.
6.10      Though the appraisal mission had forecast that the level of accounts
receivable would improve, this did not materialize as discussed in para 5.5.
Especially, collection of bills from government subscribers needs
improvement. While private subscribers generally pay promptly to avoid their
service being cut off, outstanding bills for NTC's services to the government
are quite high. As of the end of FY1986, the accounts receivable for the
government sector were estimated to be about 7 months of billing vis-a-vis two
months for the private sector. This issue has been addressed under the Fourth
Project intensively.
6.11      Under the Fourth Project, HMG/N agreed to settle its overdues
outstanding as of July 1985 (about NRs 14 million) in four installments by
July 1988 and has paid the first three installments so far. In addition, a
special interministerial committee headed by Secretary of MOC and consisting
of representatives from various concerned ministries was established in March
1987 to establish new procedures to reduce government arrears in the future
and is currently working on detailed arrangements with various ministries.
NTC also appointed three accounting officers for following up the status of
HMG/N's overdues in line with IDA's recommendations.  The government arrears
are therefore expected to start to decline from FY88.



- 25 -
Tariffs
6.12      NTC's tariff structure is generally satisfactory.  However,
introduction of peak/off-peak price differentiation for both local and long
distance calls will be necessary to reduce traffic congestion during peak
business hours. A summary of tariff changes during the project period is
given in Annex 11. Under the Second Project, NTC was required to adjust
tariffs by July 1973 so as to increase its gross operating revenues by at
least 15X. This covenant was met in January 1974. Under the Third Project,
RTC was required to effect a major tariff increase by July 1978 as a condition
of effectiveness, and tariffs were raised by about 40Z on average in 1978. In
1983, tariffs on international services (telephone, telegraph and telex) were
raised. In 1984, installation charges and subscriber deposits for telephone
services were increased with IDA's support. International telephone tariffs
were again raised in 1986. However, other basic local and long distance
telephone tariffs had remained unchanged from 1978 to October 1986. In
October 1986, all of the domestic telephone tariffs and domestic telex charges
were raised by about 20% as required under the Fourth Project. At the same
time, long distance call charges were classified by manual and subscriber
trunk dialing services.
Compliance with Covenants
6.13      The status of compliance with the covenants under the IDA Credits
397-NEP and 799-NEP is indicated in Annex 12. In general, HMG/N and NTC
complied with the covenants, except in respect of (a) audit reports which were
delayed by four to six months, (b) completion of Economic Study which was
delayed by about a year, and (c) debt service ratio which was not complied in
1984 and 1985.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.1       Both the projects broadly achieved, though with substantial delays,
the main overall physical objectives relating to expansion of local and long-
distance telecommunications facilities, introduction of STD service in the
long-distance network, improvement of international services and expansion of
telex facilities. However, the specific objectives of providing telephone
exchange facilities in 21 new areas and radio telephone facilicies in 100 new
rural areas as specified under the Third Project were not met. Only 13 new
areas were provided with telephone exchanges and 81 locations provided with
radio telephone facilities. This reduction occurred partially due to the
decision to digitalize the network and the consequent need for its re-
engineering. Regarding satisfaction of telephone demand, only about 40Z of
registered demand was met at end of the Third Project in December 1987 against
the target of 70Z because higher rate of registration of new demand than
forecast at appraisal. The institutional objectives aimed at improving the
managerial and financial performance of the entity were achieved.



- 26 -
Project Spin-off
7.2       There were no specific spin-off activities that could be attributed
to the two projects.
Least-cost Solution
7.3       The development of local and long-distance facilities was based on
correct technical and economic decisions, and followed optimum design and
accepted telecommunications practices. The major change from the planned
development at appraisal was in the adoption of digital technology at a very
early stage of network development in Nepal, a step strongly supported by IDA.
The adoption of digital technology did result in higher initial costs and,
because NTC did not apply strictly the field-proven requirement criteria in
the selection of the equipment and the supplier it caused problems during
project implementation. However, in the long-term it will lead to
considerable economic and technical benefits to the country through savings in
network costs, space requirements (with consequent savings in building costs)
and costs of operation and maintenance. The digital technology will also
enable NTC to introduce enhanced, value-added facilities and services required
by its more sophisticated business customers without major network changes.
Return on Investments
7.4       Given the difficulty in separating the economic benefits of the
Second and Third projects, the economic rate of return was calculated for
NTC's FY74-87 investment program which encompasses both projects. The overall
economic rate of return was 13% (Annex 13). The economic rate of return
estimated at the Second Project's appraisal for the FY74-79 total investment
programs was 18%. The economic rate of return estimated at the Third
Project's appraisal for the FY79-83 total investment program was 17%. The
actual rate and the estimated rate for the Second Project cannot be compared
directly because the cost and benefit streams ior the Second Project's
appraisal were expressed in current terms, which was not appropriate, and
therefore they may have led to higher value than at constant terms which was
used in calculate the actual rate. Nevertheless, the actual rate compares
reasonably with the estimated rates given the project cost overruns and
delays.
7.5       The actual rate of return as calculated understates the economic
benefits of the projects because:
(a) due again to the delay in project implementation, the benefits of
the network extension made possible through program investments have
not all been realized. Full benefits which might be obtained in the
future may be significantly higher than those used in the
calculation;
(b) it does not account for consumer surplus or indirect and external
benefits due to the improved telecommunications network.

VIII. IDA'S PERFORMANCE
Overall Performance
8.1       IDA's performance in supporting the telecommunications sector in
Nepal between 1973 and 1987 was generally satisfactory. It provided adequate
guidance to an infant telecommunications entity in the physical development of
facilities and also for its internal institutional development. It was at
IDA's suggestion to HMG/N that NTB was first created and later converted to
NTC. It was also IDA who first proposed combining the procurement of tele-
phone switching equipment for the two projects when the contract negotiations
for similar equipment for the Second Project fell through and, more important,
suggested procurement of the digital type switching equipment instead of t-te
planned analog type. IDA also interceded with the ODA in arranging for
cofinancing for the satellite earth station and the telex exchange and
consultancy thereof.
8.2       IDA's judgment could be faulted in respect of the forecast imple-
mentation schedules for both projects, neither of which provided for any
slack, particularly considering the inexperience of the executing agency at
that time. (The delays in implementation of the then ongoing Second and Third
Projects were taken into account in designing the implementation schedule for
the Fourth Project during its appraisal). IDA could also have been more
diligent in assessing the type of digital switching equipment offered by the
bidder selected by the NTC after ICB to ensure that the equipment offered met
fully the field-proven criteria in the bid document, that the supplier had
de-eloped fully both the hardware and software of the equipment it was
intending to supply, and that it was in service with other public
telecommunications administrations and was working well before approving the
contract award decision of NTC. IDA could also have assisted HMG/N and NTC
more diligently in securing the foreign funds to finance the cost overruns on
the contract for the digital switching and transmission equipment just as it
did for satellite earth station under the Second Project and for main
equipment items under the follow-on Fourth Project.
8.3       On the other hand, IDA has to be-commended for its significant
contribution to the sector outside the two projects through its assistance and
support to NTC in resisting a proposal by a well-known private telecommunica-
tions operating company for take-over of international telecommunications
operations in Nepal from NTC. The company proposed leasing from NTC the
satellite earth station and the telex exchange for operation and maintenance
for about 10 years. To meet its costs, the company proposed retaining about
851 of the international revenues accruing to Nepal and transferring the
balance 15X to NTC. The company brought strong internal and external govern-
mental and political pressures to bear on NTC management for its agreement to
its (company's) proposal and recommending it to HMG/N. When the issue was
referred to IDA, it strongly supported NTC's position that the local staff
were fully capable of operating and maintaining the international 'Icilities
and that the loss of the bulk of the international revenues (which formed a
substantial part--30X in 1982-of NTC's total revenues) by transfer to the
company would affect seriously NTC's financial position and viability. The



- 28 -
consequent short-fall in internal cash generation would have seriously
jeopardized NTC's ability to finance the development of domestic networks. It
was IDA's strong support to NTC in its opposition to the private company's
proposal that ultimately swayed the HMG/N to decide against the take-over of
the international services by a foreign private company. IDA's stand on this
issue and its confidence in NTC's ability to operate international services
efficiently were proven right by the efficient manner in which NTC has
operated the international services and the substantial growth in
international revenues over the last five years--from NR 16.5 million (30% of
total revenue) in 1982 to NRs 101.7 million (41Z of total revenues) in 1987.
Supervision
8.4       IDA's supervision effort on the two projects including the frequency
of missions during the project implementation period was adequate.
Working Relationship
8.5       IDA staff maintained good working relations with hTC and HMG/N.  NTC
was fully responsive to IDA's requests for information and data on the
projects and operations.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.1       In general, the two projects achieved the basic objective of
establishing an integrated modern telecommunications network in Nepal on which
NTC could further develop adequate and efficient telecommunications services
to meet the -ational needs, both for the "plain old telephone service" for the
general pu lic and enhanced voice and non-voice (e.g. data) services by its
business and government customers. The growth of subscribers lines between
1975 and 1987 averaged 13X per annum which is high compared to that in many
other developing countries. Apart from the multifold expansion of physical
facilities, with the adoption of digital technology, there has been substan-
tial improvement in the quality of local, long-distance and international
services. Furthermore, minor equipment additions at low cost will enable NTC
to provide enhanced, value-added services to its customers as demand arises.
9.2       NTC's overall financial performance was satisfactory throughout the
project period and NTC was able to achieve consistently the covenanted level
of rate of return. However, its financial position and cash flow situation
were weakened during FY83-85 and the level of accounts receivable were high
and remain so.
9.3       Institutionally, the organization has grown from a small government
board dependent on expatriates in top management positio s to a fully
Nepalese-staffed public sector corporation which is fairly well-managed
considering the level of management expertise available in the country. The
overall staff productivity in terms of staff employed per 1,000 telephones
improved from 172 in 1973 to 86 in 1987. The remaining internal technical,
administrative and financial management deficiencies are being addressed by



- 29 -
the IDA-financed management consultants under the follow-on Fourth
Telecoouunications Project (Credit 1588-NEP).
9.4       Experience with these projects offers following lessons:
(a)  the implementation schedules at appraisal were too tight,
considering the level of expertise and quantum of staff then
available in NTC for implementation;
(b)  IDA could have insisted on establishment of a Project Implementation
Unit prior to credit approval;
(c)  advance procurement action could have been required before credit
effectiveness which may have reduced or eliminated some of the
causes of delays in implementation, though delays caused by
contractors' or selected bidders' defaults would have remained.
while advance procurement would have reduced the IDA credit
disbursement period and reduced commitment charges, it would not
have reduced the total implementation period;
(d)  considering that IDA was well aware of the large shortfall in
foreign funds for financing digital switching equipment, the
critical component of the project, and the general shortage of
foreign currency funds in Nepal, IDA could have played a more
substantive role in assisting HMC/N and NTC in identifying and
firming-up foreign fund sources as it subsequently did under the
Fourth Project; and
(e)  IDA could have provided better advice to NTC on the field-proveness
of the selected digital switching equipment and in securing better
guarantees from the contractors.

SECOND AND THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECTS (CREDITS 397-NEP AND 799-NEP)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Return on Investments
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1974 to 2000 when on
average the equipment p-ovided under the projects would have exceeded its
useful life. NTC's 1974-87 investment program included the four IDA projects
and the JICA-fund projects. The overlapping of these projects and the close
relationship between equipment installed under the Second and Third Projects
and the total investment program make any attempt to separate incremental
costs and revenues for the Second and Third IDA projects very arbitrary. The
rate of return calculated in this annex, therefore, for NTC's total 1974-87
investment program. However, the Fourth IDA Project and JICA-fund project are
excluded because both started only in 1986 and no associated operating
costs/benefits are considered to have been realized so far and, therefore, can
be separated.
2.        All costs and benefits streams have been expressed in 1974 prices,
using the inflation rates actually recorded in Nepal. All streams are stated
net of taxes, duties, interest.
3.        Incremental operating costs and benefits associated with the invest-
ment program have been calculated on the basis of the subscribers actually
added to 1987.
4.        The following summarizes the 1974-79 investment program's
incremental cost and benefit streams projected at the appraisal of the Second
Project (Credit 397-NEP). These streams were expressed in current terms. The
benefit streams is adjusted to exclude subscriber deposits which were treated
as revenues at appraisal.
