APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a project in Iceland for the construction
and improvement of sections of two of the main routes (Vesturlandsvegur and
Sudurlandsvegur) radiating from Reykjavik as well as for the provision of
some road maintenance equipment.
ii.       Early settlement in Iceland began in the 9th century around the
fjords, and the population is still mostly concentrated in the coastal
areas. Both the terrain and climate make habitation of the interior un-
attractive and difficult, and some 50% of the population of 200,000 is now
concentrated in the area of the capital city and shipping port of Reykjavik.
iii.      Geography and topography markedly affect the economy of this
largely barren island country. With few natural resources except abundant
water for hydroelectric power and fish in the surrounding ocean, the
economy is characterized by its heavy dependence on fishing and foreign
trade. However, the Government is now encouraging export-oriented manu-
facturing as a means of diversifying and making the economy less affected
by fluctuations in fish catches.
iv.       As a result of the Government's policy to connect even isolated
farm communities with the road system, there is now an extensive network
of some 12,000 km. This system, concentrated mainly in the coastal plains,
developed mostly from tracks and, apart from some 50 km in the Reykjavik
area, is still to gravel standards.
v.        The development of industries around Reykjavik, together with
the gravitation of population to the area, has produced heavy traffic loads
on the main routes near the capital. A Transport Survey, financed by the
Government and carried out by consultants in 1968, gave high priority to
the replacement of these heavily trafficked gravel sections with modern
surfaced highways.
vi.       The project would be the first for the Bank Group in the trans-
portation sector in Iceland. It is based on the Transport Survey findin .s
and comprises the construction and improvement of some 48 km of primary
roads in the vicinity of Reykjavik. In addition, it includes a small
provision for the purchase of selected items of highway maintenance equip-
ment. The estimated cost is about US $7.7 million equivalent, and the
rates of return on the separate road sections vary from 11% to 25%, the
weighted average being 17%. On the assumption that about half of the con-



ii
struction would be executed by local contractors, the foreign exchange
component of the project has been calculated at US $4.1 million, which is
the basis of the proposed loan.
vii.      The Public Roads Administration is the agency responsible for
executing the project, and is staffed by efficient and competent person-
nel. Detailed engineering of the road sections, which is not part of the
project, is being carried out by the Administration with the assistance
of local consultants. The Bank agrees with the Administration's proposal
to retain local consultants for the supervision of construction.
viii.     The construction work will be carried out in two groups of
contracts, each of a size which should attract foreign firms. In order
to enable contractors to mobilize before the onset of winter, the first
group of contracts have been awarded and work is scheduled to start in
October 1970. On the assumption that the proposed loan is signed by the end
of October, retroactive financing of about $150,000 will be required to
cover advance payments to the contractors.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US $4.1 million
equivalent, with a 20 year term, including a four year grace period.
Local costs of the project would be provided by the Government.

APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Iceland has asked the Bank to help finance a
highway project comprising the construction and improvement of about
48 km of primary road and the purchase of highway maintenance equipment.
The proposed project is estimated to cost about IKr 670 million (US $7.7
million equivalent); the proposed loan of US $4.1 million equivalent would
cover the foreign exchange costs.
1.02      This would be the first lending operation by the Bank Group in
the transportation sector in Iceland. The project is based on the findings
of a Transport Survey which was carried out in 1968 by Consultants (KAMPSAX
of Denmark) and financed by the Government of Iceland. The roads included
in the project represent the highest priorities in the Consultant's
recommended highway development program.
1.03      The project originated from a Government request in November
1968, and was the subject of an identification mission in May 1969, and a
preparation mission in December 1969, both made by Mr. A. Bergan
(engineer and subsequently Consultant). This report was prepared by
Messrs. H. Hansen (economist) and J. R. Howard (engineer) who appraised
the project in April-May 1970, and Miss R. Mayes (editor).

2. BACKGROUND
A. The Country and its Economy
2.01      The Republic of Iceland, an island country, lies in the Noith
Atlantic Ocean near the Arctic Circle. Its area of about 100,000 km
(roughly the same size as Korea, Portugal or the State of Virginia),
is mostly barren and difficult for human habitation as well as from a
transport point of view. About 12% of the area is covered by glaciers
and 65% by highland plateaux of volcanic rock, which are almost completely
devoid of vegetation. These areas are largely uninhabitated. About
half of the population of 200,000 lives in Reykjavik, the capital and
economic center of Iceland. The remaining population lives primarily in
villages or agricultural areas along the fjords of the rugged coastline.
2.02      Iceland's economy is characterized by its heavy dependence on
foreign trade in which fishing plays a major role. Exports of goods and
services represented about 40% of GNP in 1968 while imports were equal
to about 50% of GNP. Economic development has, in the past, been signifi-
cantly affected by the fluctuations in fish catches. In 1966, a peak
year, fishing and fish processing accounted for about 20% of GNP and more
than 90% of the exports. The failure of the herring catch in 1967 and
1968 resulted in an economic setback with GNP declining by some 8%. The
downward trend was reversed in 1969, and GNP is expected to increase by
4-5% in 1970. In 1969 GNP per capita was $1,690.
2.03      The Government is conscious of the inherent weakness of the
economy due to its dependence on fishing and is taking steps towards
diversification. The agricultural and mineral potential are, however,
limited. The Government is, therefore, encouraging industry, especially
export-oriented manufacturing based on domestic resources such as cheap
hydroelectric power (e.g., to produce aluminum) and wool.
B. Transport Sector
2.04      General:  Transportation within Iceland is heavily influenced
by four factors: (i) its isolated island nature; (ii) the small population
relative to the size of the country and its concentration in Reykjavik;
(iii) the difficult topography of the country; and (iv) the peculiar
geology of the country (particularly abundant availability of lava as a
construction material). As a result of Iceland's dependence on foreign
trade and its island nature, shipping, both overseas and coastal, has
played a major role in the economy. With more than half the population
concentrated in Reykjavik, domestic goods transport consists largely of
the movement of goods between the capital and the rest of the country. The
scattered location of the remainder of the population and the difficult
topography have result in relatively high transport costs.



2.05      In the past coastal shipping was the dominant mode of domestic
transport. However, since the beginning of this century, advantage has
been taken of the abundant lava supply to construct motorable tracks and
roads. As a result, road transport has now become the main mode of
transport in Iceland, accounting for about 92% of all goods traffic and
about 96% of all passenger traffic (Table 1). There are no railroads.
2.06      Highways:  The road network of about 12,000 km (Table 2 and
Map 1) extends to practically all inhabited places in Iceland with its
greatest concentration along the periphery because of the topographical
problems and population distribution. Although there is no need for any
significant extension of the network, there is a great need for upgrading
the more heavily trafficked roads. The motor vehicle fleet has increased by
about 8% p.a. since 1961 and now numbers about 44,000 units, of which about
85% are passenger cars or jeeps (Table 3). The highway system is descri-
bed in more detail in Chapter 3.
2.07      Ports and Shipping:  With over 90% of the population living
along the coast and with exports of fish products representing about
90% of exports, Iceland's harbors play an important role in the economy.
Most of the some 80 harbors are fishing harbors. Reykjavik is by far
the most important port, both for the export-import trade and for coast-
al shipping. As in the case of roads, the need is now more urgent to
upgrade the more important existing facilities than to expand them.
2.08      Although transport by coastal shipping has been declining
somewhat in recent years in the face of increased competition from road
transport and aviation (particularly for passengers), it is still signifi-
cant, and in many areas coastal shipping is the only means of transport
during the winter. The conclusion of the Transport Survey was that in
view of the transport distances involved and the initial steps being taken
to modernize and rationalize services, coastal shipping could be expected
to continue to play a modest but essential role in goods transport.
2.09      Air Transport:  Air transport is the principal mode of passenger
travel between Iceland and other countries; it is also becoming increasingly
important in domestic passenger transport. Domestic passenger air trans-
port has increased by about 18% p.a. in recent years; in 1969 it carried
some 110,000 passengers. Air freight has been increasing at about the
same rate, but the volume is still an insignificant part of total domestic
freight transport.
2.10      There are about 100 air strips in Iceland, but most of these
are emergency strips used for medical service. Regular or semi-scheduled
service is maintained at about 20 airfields. In line with the Transport
Survey recommendations, air service is concentrating increasingly on a
number of primary airports using bus feeder services.



-4-
C. Transport Coordination
2.11      The Transport Survey carried out by Kampsax consisted of a
review of the existing transport system and recommendations for improve-
ments, including the preparation of a transport investment program for the
years 1969-1976. In view of the rather low traffic volumes on most of the
transport network, the Transport Survey concluded that unnecessary inter-
modal competition should be avoided. It is recommended that a trunk
road system connect the different regional centers, and that a system of
regional and other roads connect these centers with their influence areas.
The Transport Survey recommended transport infrastructure investments of
some IKr 5,100 million ((US $88 million equivalent) according to the rate
of exchange at that time) for the period 1969-1976, of which about IKr
3,400 million was for roads, IKr 1,400 million for ports and IKr 300 million
for airports. The conclusions of the Transport Survey are generally
accepted by the Government, except that the investment program needs to
be stretched out more because of the limited resources available and needs
in other sectors. The Bank agrees with the general recommendations of the
Transport Survey.
2.12      In addition to the Transport Survey, which looked at the total
transport system of Iceland, several regional studies have been or are
being undertaken by the Economic Institute (the Economic Institute is an
agency under the Prime Minister's office, which is responsible for national
economic data and general sector planning and is also a general economic
advisory body), in cooperation with the local authorities and other entities
involved, including the Public Roads Administration (PRA). The studies
cover the more sparsely populated regions with the objective of establish-
ing a minimum cost transport network in line with the development needs
of the regions.
2.13      Since January 1970, in line with the recommendations of the
Transport Survey, the Ministry of Communications has been responsible for
all transport policy and planning and controls the three separate director-
ates concerned with transport -- one each for roads (PRA), harbors and
aviation. For overall sector planning and general economic analysis, the
Ministry draws on the resources of the Economic Institute. The organiza-
tional arrangements adopted are reasonable for Iceland.
3. THE HIGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.01      The public road system consists of some 12,000 km of road
concentrated mostly in the coastal plains, which are the main population
areas. Apart from a 33 km gap in the Southeast, caused by the Vatnajokull
glacier, the network completely rings the island, and some 95% of all
communities and farms are now connected by it.



3.02      Although the network is extensive only approximately 50 km
are paved, and there are many inadequacies. Much of the system is
geometrically unsatisfactory in that gradients are too steep and curves
too sharp. There are also many narrow bridges of low load capacity.
Apart from the newly constructed sections, pavement strengths and sur-
facing are generally inadequate for the prevailing truck axle loads,
particularly during the spring thaw.
3.03      The public road system comprises:
(i) state roads;
(ii) through roads in town and villages;
(iii) motorable mountain tracks; and
(iv) local roads
Items (i), (ii) and (iii) are completely financed by the Central Government;
two-thirds of item (iv) is financed by the Central Government and one-third
by the region. Table 2 shows a breakdown of the road system by surface
type and classification, with changes since 1964. Map 1 shows the extent
of the state roads.
3.04      Prior to 1968 there was no road inventory to indicate the
physical condition and standard of the road system.  Between May 1968
and February 1969, as part of the Transport Survey, an inventory of some
3,000 km of Class I and II roads was prepared. The PRA is continuing the
inventory and has to date satisfactorily completed some 1,000 km of Clasts
III roads.
B. Highway Traffic
3.05      At the end of 1968 there were about 44,000 vehicles in Iceland
compared to 23,000 in 1961. The composition of the vehicle fleet and
growth rate per vehicle are shown in Table 3; of the total, about 50% are
registered in Reykjavik. There are about four inhabitants per vehicle,
which is similar to the other Nordic countries.
3.06      Kampsax estimated in the Transport Survey that road traffic
increased from some 390 million vehicle km in 1961 to 690 million vehicle
km in 1967, an average annual increase of 10%. Cars increased their share
of total vehicle km from 65% to 76% during this period.
3.07      Over the past six years traffic counts have been carried out by
the PRA at some 240 stations throughout the road network. Additional
counts are now taken continuously at ten major rural road intersections
during the summer months, covering the major routes of Classes I and II.
During loan negotiations assurances were obtained that a program of traffic
counts would be continued and expanded.



- 6 -
3.08      The legal vehicular load is 7 tons on a single axle and 11
tons on tandem axles with a gross vehicle weight limit of 27 tons.
Dispensation is, however, given over much of the public road network,
for part of the year, for 10 ton single and 16 ton tandem axles with
a gross vehicle limit of 32 tons. The PRA has powers to introduce
temporary load restrictions during bad conditions which are frequently
applied during the spring thaw and may at times restrict the use of
some roads to light four wheel drive vehicles. Four police teams con-
trolling axle loads operate on the main routes, particularly during the
spring thaw, a process which appears reasonably effective in reducing
road damage. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
effective axle load control measures would be continued.
C. Highway Administration
3.09      Executive responsibility for the maintenance and construction of
all public roads, including those in the project, is vested in the PRA,
which in turn is responsible to the Ministry of Communications. A chart
showing the PRA organization and number of staff is attached. The
engineers are generally well qualified, having graduated mostly from
Scandinavian universities, and there is a satisfactory level of competence
throughout the organization.
3.10      The acquisition of right-of-way is covered by the Road Law of
1963, under which the PRA is empowered to acquire the right-of-way
needed for highway works approved by the Alting (Parliament). The owners
have to surrender the land and property involved, as and when it is re-
quired, and compensation is decided later either by negotiation or, if
agreement cannot be reached, by arbitration.
D. Highway Financing and Planning
3.11      The breakdown of budgeted and actual expenditures by the PRA
over the past five years, together with Plan estimates up to 1972, are
shown in Table 4. Revenues from road user charges are indicated in
Table 5. In 1969 total revenues were estimated at about IKr 740 million of
which about IKr 500 million were earmarked for the Road Fund. Expenditures
by PRA the same year amounted to about IKr 425 million. The balance between
this figure and the IKr 500 million earmarked for the Road Fund is accounted
for in the subsidy for roads in towns and villages which are not through roads.
This shows that in recent years road users have covered all
expenditures on roads, in fact they have made a net contribution to the
budget.
3.12      Funds for the construction and maintenance of public roads
come from a Road Fund, which is administered by the Ministry of Communi-
cations and is financed from taxes on vehicle fuels, tires and tubes



- 7 -
and vehicle license fees. State roads are completely financed from the
Road Fund while local roads are two-thirds financed from it with the
remainder coming from local revenues.
3.13      The planning and programming of all road works (both construction
and maintenance) are done on a four year basis, with a revision after
two years taking into account the anticipated revenues from the Road
Fund. At the end of the four year period an entirely new four year plan
is drawn up and presented to Parliament for approval. The Government is
considering amending the planning procedure from the present system of
separate four year plans to a continuous roll-over, with revision every
two years.
E. Highway Engineering and Construction
3.14      The PRA is at present finalizing new geometric design standards
which are being based on the Norwegian standards. In Table 6 the standards
used for the project roads are shown; these are considered satisfactory.
In both location and geometric design, account is taken of severe snow
conditions prevailing for long periods in winter.
3.15      Design loads for road pavements are commensurate with the
vehicle axle loads indicated in para. 3.08, and when finalizing material
specifications and layer thicknesses, careful consideration is given to
frost conditions. Bridges are designed for a 34 ton truck combination
with a maximum tandem axle of 18 tons. The slightly higher figures for
bridges are used to allow the occasional passage of heavier vehicles, which
would otherwise be prevented from using the roads.
3.16      Highway design and engineering has, until recently, been cartied
out by the PRA. Two local firms of consulting engineers were, however,
employed on part of the proposed highway project; the PRA is prepared
to engage consultants whenever necessary. A working relationship has been
established by the PRA with the highway organizations of the other Nordic
countries and with the Norwegian Transport Economic Institute. Advice
is from time to time obtained from these bodies on highway design and
planning matters.
3.17      There is an adequate soils and materials laboratory within the
Government Building Research Institute, which carried out tests and cont:ols
required by the PRA for design and construction purposes.
3.18      Road construction has mostly been carried out by PRA force
account, occasionally using equipment rented from local agencies. There
is a trend, however, to use contractors on an increasing scale for road
works and several gravel road projects of values around IKr 40-50 million
(US $500,000 equivalent) have been completed in recent years by local
contractors. One major project, the Reykjavik-Keflavik road, was con-
structed between 1962-65 by a local contractor.  This is 37.5 km long, has



a cement concrete payment, and cost IKr 250 million (US $ equivalent at
that time - 5.5 million). There are ten local firms listed by the
Icelandic Contractors' Association as capable of executing civil engineer-
ing works up to IKr 40-50 million (US $500,000 equivalent). In addition,
a number of foreign contractors have been working in Iceland in recent
years on projects other than highways.
F. Highway Maintenance
3.19      Road maintenance is undertaken by the administration's own
forces, through 25 districts, in each of which there is a resident
foreman. Maintenance funds are allocated to the district foremen from
the head office in Reykjavik, while general supervision is maintained
by divisional engineers who control several districts.
3.20      A comprehensive and satisfactory system of accounting and
cost control is in operation, and expenditures are recorded against
the major maintenance items by the district foremen. All PRA equipment
is accounted for on an hourly charge basis which reflects the total
cost of equipment usage, including depreciation. The amounts obtained
from depreciation are credited to an equipment replacement fund. However,
since the devaluation of the Icelandic Kroner in 1967/68, these amounts
have had to be augmented from the Road Fund.  The charges for equipment
are gradually being increased to eliminate shortfall, but without external
financing, this could take several years. Table 7 shows the breakdown
of maintenance expenditure over the past five years.
3.21      The maintenance organization and administration of the PRA are
generally satisfactory in relation to the present conditions prevailing
in Iceland. As and when greater lengths of asphalt paved road come into
use, training of district staff in the maintenance of asphalt paving
will be required. There is sufficient expertise in the organization
of the PRA to provide this.
3.22      In 1969 the average annual cost of maintenance of state gravel
roads, including snow clearing, was IKr 18,500 (US $210 equivalent) per km.
This figure does not include head office overheads which would amount to
about 6%. The low figure is explained by the efficient, highly mechanized
methods used and the fact that lava and gravel, the main material require-
ments, are freely available and normally come from Government-owned or
rented sources. During negotiations an assurance was obtained that
sufficient funds and other resources would continue to be made available
to carry out maintenance at a satisfactory level.

4. THE PROJECT
A. General Description and Purpose
4.01      The project comprises:
(i) the construction and improvement to two lane surfaced
standards to approximately 14 km of a primary road
named Vesturlandsvegur and 34 km of a primary road
named Sudurlandsvegur (see Map 2 for location and
Table 8 for details);
(ii) supervision of (i) by consultants; and
(iii) the purchase of specific items of highway maintenance
equipment (see Table 9).
B. Road Construction and Improvement
4.02      The Vesturlandsvegur is the main route between Reykjavik and
the northern part of the island. The project sections start 2 km from
Reykjavik and consist of approximately 14 km of new road construction to
two lane surfaced standards around the coastal plain. The existing road
is geometrically poor, and it has a gravel surface which requires constant
maintenance to deal with the heavy traffic, particularly during the spring
thaw. The first 2 km, which are not part of the project, are being con-
structed by the PRA to comparable standards and specifications to the pro-
ject sections and are expected to be completed by late 1970. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the Government would satisfactorily
complete this section by the time the adjacent project section is completed.
4.03      The Sudurlandsvegur is the main route connecting Reykjavik with
the southeast coast. The project sections start 2 km from the intersection
with the Vesturlandsvegur and terminate at Selfoss, 50 km from the inter-
section. The project consists of approximately 27 km of new road construction
to two lane surfaced standards and approximatelv 7 km of improvement of the
existing road to the same standards. The existing road has a gravel surface
and is geometrically poor with the exception of 7 km mentioned above. The
surface requires constant maintenance to deal with the traffic, and during
the winter months snow drifting is a problem. Construction of some 14 k"m
in the middle of the route is being undertaken by the PRA and, although not
included in the project, is being built to comparable standards and specifi-
cations. Work has been recently started by the administration's own forces,
and surfacing will be carried out by contract. All work is expected to be
completed by late 1970. During loan negotiations assurances were obtained from
the Government that the middle sections of Sudurlandsvegur would be
completed by the time the adjacent project sections are completed and to
standards and specifications satisfactory to the Bank.



- 10 -
4.04      The geometric design standards adopted for the project are
shown in Table 6 and are satisfactory. Roads are located to minimize
snow drifting and the design of the pavement is aimed at preventing
frost problems.
C. Detailed Engineering
4.05      Detailed engineering and preparation of contract documents
for the three sections of road which make up the first bidding group have
been completed. They are satisfactory. One section was designed by a
local consulting engineer and the others by the PRA. The contract
conditions and construction specifications were prepared by the PRA and
will be applicable, with minor amendments, to the remaining sections.
4.06      The design of the remaining sections is also completed, one by a
local consultant and the others by PRA. Bidding documents will be available
in adequate time for the scheduled bidding in May 1971. Detailed engineering
is not included for financing under the proposed project.
D. Supervision of Construction
4.07      The Government intends to employ local consulting engineers
to supervise the road construction, and the firm or firms concerned would,
if necessary, obtain the assistance of foreign consultants to provide the
required top level expertise. Terms of Reference for the supervision have
been prepared in the Bank and cover the need for suitably qualified and ex-
perienced personnel. They also include the requirement that the supervisoiy con-
sultant shall satisfy himself as to the adequacy and suitability of the
detailed engineering. The arrangements for supervision are considered
satisfactory.
E. Highway Maintenance Equipment
4.08      Details of the equipment to be purchased are shown in Table
9. The items cover normal highway maintenance equipment such as a crushing
plant, shovels and motor graders for use on gravel roads and a snow blower
and wheeled loaders for use on paved roads.
4.09      The PRA at present has two mobile crushing and screening plants
employed on the processing of gravel and rock for road maintenance. One
of these is a 17 year old, small (25/30 ton/hour) plant, which is becoming
increasingly difficult to operate efficiently for the long hours necessary
to produce the gravel requirements of the northern part of the country, in
which it is located. The new larger plant to be provided under the project
is required in order to keep pace with the maintenance needs in the north
and the two cu yd shovels to provide the additional digging and loading
capacity to balance this.



- 11 -
4.10      Grading of the gravel surfaces is the main routine maintenance
operation and with the relatively heavy traffic on many of the roads,
the PRA graders need to operate for long hours, including snow clearing
in winter. Of the grader fleet seven are over 20 years old and require
constant attention to keep them in use. The seven new graders are to
replace these old machines.
4.11      Snow clearing of the gravel roads is carried out either by
graders or bulldozers. Such equipment is not the most suitable, however,
on surfaced roads as the blades could easily damage the surface. The
snow-blower is intended for use on surfaced roads of which the project
roads will form nearly half of the country's total. The three cu yd
loaders would be used in conjunction with the snow-blower and would also
be used for gravel loading in the summer months.
F. Cost Estimates and Foreign Exchange Component
4.12      Cost estimates for all road sections have been prepared by the
PRA from detailed bills of quantities. Unit rates were derived from
equipment operating costs and outputs and were checked, where possible,
against recent construction projects. In addition, bids have been received
for the first group and these bids confirmed the earlier estimates. All cost
estimates appear reasonable.
4.13      Cost estimates for supervision are based on a proposal from a group
of consulting firms; maintenance equipment cost estimates have been taken
from manufacturers' lists. The estimates are considered reasonable.
4.14      The foreign exchange component of construction work has been
estimated at about 55% for execution wholly by foreign contractors and
about 45% by local contractors. As expected, the smaller sections
in the first bidding were awarded to local contractors (see para 4.17)
and it is expected that the larger amount of work in the second bidding
will go to foreign contractor(s), probably in association with local
firms (see para. 4.19). For this blend of contractors the overall estimated
foreign exchange component is 50%. The foreign exchange component for con-
struction supervision has been estimated at 50% on the basis of the estimated
blend of Icelandic and foreign personnel required and the high import component
of supporting services and facilities.

4.15      A summary of the project cost estimate is as follows while
details are given in Table 10:

4.16      A 10% contingency allowance has been added to cover possible
quantity increases; in view of the amount of detailed engineering carried
out for the highway construction, this is considered sufficient.  The 8%
price contingency allowance is based on an estimate of anticipated cost
increases (4 to 5% p.a. which reflect the amount of increase expected in
prices both in Iceland and other countries from which contractors, material
or equipment might originate) over the period of the project.



- 13 -
G. Project Execution and Financing
4.17      The PRA would be responsible for the execution of the project.
Road construction will be divided into two bidding groups, the elements
within each group to be bid concurrently:
Group I (a)    3.0 km of Vesturlandsvegur (in one contract
section with estimated construction cost,
excluding contingencies, US $730,000)
(b)    14.1 km of Sudurlandsvegur (in one contract
section, US $910,000)
Group II (a)    10.7 km of Vesturlandsvegur (in 2 contract
sections totalling US $1,260,000)
(b)    19.6 km of Sudurlandsvegur (in 3 contract
sections totalling US $2,480,000)
4.18      The contract sections are small in order to keep them within
the capability of local contractors or groups of contractors. Foreign
contractors would, subject to prequalification, be allowed to bid for
and undertake all sections in either group.
4.19      There are no regulations which restrict the operation of foreign
contractors but permission has to be obtained to bring in foreign labor;
foreign contractors would normally be expected to confine this element
to management, supervisory personnel and special skills not readily
available locally. Such conditions are not likely to discourage foreign
interest and will be described in the construction contract documents.
Assurance was obtained during loan negotiations that the Government
would assist contractors in obtaining required permits.
4.20      Bidding for construction contracts is being carried out in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Construction contracts for the
first group were awarded in early September 1970, with a construction
period of 24 months. The second group is scheduled for a May 1971 start and a
30 month constructon period. Prequalification of bidders has been completed
in a manner acceptable to the Bank. A number of foreign as well as Icelandic
contractors have been prequalified. The highway maintenance equipment
would be purchased as a result of international bidding, in accordance with
the Bank's guidelines.



- 14 -
4.21      The foreign cost of the project would be covered by the proposed
Bank financing. Local costs would be provided by the Government, and no
problems are expected.
4.22      Based on the schedule in para. 4.20 and on equipment purchases
being made in the second half of 1971, requirements of foreign currency
for the project would be:
Project Year 1/                   1           2           3          4      Total
Amount (US $ million
equivalent)                   1.2        1.7         0.9         0.3     4.1
Further details on a half-yearly basis are given in Table 11.
4.23      Due to winter construction difficulties the Government is arranging
to start the first group of contracts in October 1970; in order to start
work in October, it was necessary to sign contracts in September (para.
4.20). Financing retroactive to September 1, 1970, of expenditure
totalling about US $300,000 (foreign cost US $150,000) would be required
for expenditures in connection with advance payments due to contractors.
The Government consulted with the Bank on all matters related to pre-
qualification, bidding and award of contracts and will continue to do so.
H. Disbursement
4.24      Loan funds would be disbursed on the basis of:
(i) 50% of actual payments to contractors for highway
construction works;
(ii) 50% of actual payments to consultants for supervi-
sion; and
(iii) 100% of the C.I.F. price of highway maintenance
equipment and spare parts.
Any surplus of funds provided under the proposed loan should be
cancelled.
1/   Project year is calculated from the quarter in which the loan
will be signed, i.e., from October 1, 1970.

5. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      During the past decades the main emphasis in highways was on
expanding the highway network in order to interconnect all parts of the
country. Extension of the network, therefore, took precedence over
geometric and structural quality of the roads. The Transport Survey
concluded, and the Government agreed, that the main future emphasis should
be placed on upgrading the standards of the most heavily trafficked road
sections.
5.02      The objective of the proposed project is to reduce the cost of
transport on important sections of the two main roads radiating from
Reykjavik by replacing or improving the existing inadequate gravel sections.
These are among the most heavily trafficked roads in Iceland, and the
sections included in the project were given the first priority in the
highway development program recommended by the Consultants.
B. Vesturlandsvegur
5.03      The 300 km long Vesturlandsvegur forms the first part of the
only road from Reykjavik to western northern and eastern Iceland. It
carried traffic volumes ranging from about 13,000 Average Summer Daily
Traffic (ASDT) near Reykjavik to about 120 ASDT at the northwestern end.
5.04      Average traffic on the three project sections in 1968 ranged
from about 4,000 Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) on the first section to
about 1,600 AADT on the last section; heavy vehicles accounted for about
one-third. In recent years, traffic increased by about 10-12% p.a.
except for 1969 when the combined effect of an economic recession (para.
2.02) and an unusually bad summer caused a modest traffic decline. Table
12 shows present and expected traffic on each of the sections. These
forecasts are based on past traffic trends and on projections by the
Consultants of total production of goods and services and per capita
income in the zones of influence. They assume that the traffic growth rate
will decline from about 7-8% p.a. through 1972 to about 4% by 1983 which
is an acceptable assumption.
5.05      The principal benefits derived from the project are savings ir
vehicle operating costs, and these have been used in calculating the
returns on the investments; the estimated unit savings are about 17% for
passenger cars and about 30% for trucks and buses (Table 13). This
procedure takes no account of passenger time savings, reduction in road
maintenance costs and accidents and, therefore, somewhat understates the
benefits from the project. Moreover, the savings include only the differ-



- 16 -
ence between present and expected operating cost levels and, therefore,
do not take into account the future increases in operating costs which
would take place if the project were not carried out.
5.06      Based on savings in vehicle operating costs alone and the
estimated traffic growth over 20 years, the investment in the three
road sections would yield a rate of return of 22% (ranging from 18% to
25%). The sensitivity of these results was tested according to more
conservative basic assumptions: (i) a 5% increase in constructions costs,
(ii) a 10% reduction in traffic growth rates and (iii) a 10% reduction in
vehicle operating cost savings, resulting in an average rate of return of
19%. Similarly, the sensitivity was tested according to more optimistic
basic assumptions: (i) a 5% reduction in construction costs, (ii) a 10%
increase in traffic growth rates and (iii) a 10% increase in vehicle
operating cost savings, resulting in an average rate of return of 26%
(Table 14). These results indicate that even on extremely conservative
assumptions, the sections would yield a satisfactory rate of return
and the proposed investment is, therefore, well justified. Inclusion
of passenger time savings would increase the rates of return by about
three percentage points. Benefits from reductions in maintenance costs
and accidents would also increase them slightly.
C. Sudurlandsvegur
5.07      The 315 km long Sudurlandsvegur is the main road connecting
Reykjavik with the southeast coast, including its main supply of dairy
and agricultural produce centered around Selfoss. Traffic on the road
ranged from about 4,600 ASDT near Reykjavik to about 50 ASDT at the
southeastern end.
5.08      Average traffic on the project sections in 1968 ranged from
about 2,100 AADT to 1,000 AADT with heavy traffic accounting for about
one-fifth. In recent years, traffic increased by about 9-12% p.a. ex-
cept for 1969 when traffic declined slightly (see para. 5.04). Table
12 shows present and expected traffic on each section, assuming that the
traffic growth will decline from about 8% p.a. through 1972 to about 4%
by 1983.
5.09      Based on savings in vehicle operating costs (Table 13) and
snow clearing, together with the estimated traffic growth over 20 years,
the investment in the project sections would yield an average rate of
return of 14% (ranging from 11% to 16%). As in the case of the Vestur-
landsvegur (para. 5.06), the sensitivity of these results to more con-
servative and optimistic basic assumptions was tested (Table 14), which
also indicated that each of these sections would yield a satisfactory
rate of return.



- 17 -
D. Maintenance Equipment
5.10      As indicated in para. 3.20 the PRA has a satisfactory system
of cost accounting which includes an allowance for depreciation of
maintenance equipment. However, as a result of the two successive de-
valuations (about 50%) in 1967 and 1968, the funds thus generated for
equipment replacement have become insufficient to cover the replacement
needs. PRA is gradually revising the charges for equipment usage and
should in the future generate sufficient funds for equipment replacement,
provided the present shortfall can be filled. The Government has there-
fore asked the Bank to help finance the replacement of selected items
of maintenance equipment as well as the purchase of snow clearing
equipment for use on surfaced roads (largely on the project roads). The
cost of the proposed equipment represents about 10% of the replacement
value of the existing equipment holdings.
5.11      The maintenance equipment included for replacement is old
and is becoming increasingly uneconomical to operate (paras. 4.09 and
4.10). The replacement of the equipment therefore seems obvious, and no
attempt has been made to provide a quantified economic evaluation for
the small amounts involved. If the equipment is not replaced maintenance
of the roads in northern Iceland would suffer and, as a result, higher
vehicle operating costs would occur. Similarly, without the special
snow clearing equipment (para. 4.11), use of the project and other paved
roads in the winter season would be impaired, which would result in losses
to the economy.



- 18 -
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations assurances were obtained on the following
points:
(i)  that the Government would complete the first 2 km of
Vesturlandsvegur and the middle sections of Sudur-
landsvegur by the completion date of the adjacent pro-
ject sections and to standards and specifications
satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 4.02 and 4.03).
(ii)  that the Borrower would permit, under procedures specified
in applicable legislation and regulation, contractors to
employ foreign staff as reasonably required (para. 4.19).
6.02      With assurance having been obtained on the matters mentioned in
paragraph 6.01, the proposed proJect would constitute a suitable basis for
a Bank loan of US $4.1 million equivalent with a 20 year term, including a
four-year grace period.
