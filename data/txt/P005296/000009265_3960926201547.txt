NDIORAIIDUMAND RECONMENDAION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVElOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$36 MILLION TO THE
JORDAN TELEOOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION WITH TEE GUARANTEE OF THE
HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR A T1LECMMNUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Jordan Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) for US$36.0 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be guaranteed
by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and would carry a standard variable
interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace, and
would help finance a Telecommunications Project.
2.        Background.  The Jordanian economy, particularly the dominant
services sector which accounts for about 60% of C-DP, *:' ends critically on
effective communications and modern business data/information services.
TCC has sustained a 19% annual growth in conuected telephone lines and has
tripled its gross fixed assets while experiencing almost a full transition
into new digital technology. By end 1987, TCC has attained a relatively
good telephone penetration rati- of 7 lines per 100 inhabitants and had
satisfied 67% of expressed demand. The recent rapid network modernization
and growth of TCC, however, has not been accompanied by a comparable
program for improviug sector policies, and for upgrading TCC's
organization, manpower skills a;,d management systems. Most project
development has been carried out through turnkey contracts with procurement
tied to bilateral financing, resulting in high expansion costs. TCC is
also constrained by the Government's administrative and financial
procedures and lacks the autonomy to function as an efficient commercial
entity. In addition, its present structure is highly centralized and lacks
the management characteristics and certain basic functions of a commercial
entity.  Tariff levels and structure also have many discrepancies and need
to be refocussed to meet socio-economic objectives, economic costs of
services, and demand patterns.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Through this first
telecommunications lending operation in Jordan, the Bank would play a major
role in assisting the Government to: (a) improve the policy and
institutional framework for the efficieLnt long-term development of the
telecommunications sector; (b) implement a realistic investment program
consistent with resource availabilities that would improve services while
expanding geographic coverage, especially to isolated rural areas; (c)
mobilize competitive financing resources for the program; and (d) devise



and carry out a program for the commercializationi of the telecommunicationis
sector and TCC's operatious.  The Bank has already been iustrumenttal iln
helping TCC to rationalize its investment program aud improve its
procurement processes and their cost effectiveness. During project
implementation, the Bank would continiue these efforts and would help the
Goverumeut to address critical sector issues and implemeut policy actious.
4.        Project Objectives.  The maiu objectives of the project are to:
(a) formulate and implement reforms to improve the overall policy framework
for the commercialization of the telecommuuications sector and TCC; (b)
expand network capacity, improve service quality, increase geographic
coverage and iutroduce new value-added services; (c) strengthen TCC's
capacity to devtlop and implement competitive strategies for procuremeut,
financing aud syotem planning; (d) help the Goverument and TCC to revise
telecommuuicatious pricing policy and tariffs to reflect chauges in cost
structure resulting from growth and technological change, and to adjust for
shifts in market demand due to changes in Jordan's economic conditions and
prospects; and (e) support TCC in conducting a review of its organizatioual
structure, upgrading its management systems using modern information
technology, and implementing a human resource development program in
technical, financial and management areas.
5.        Project Description.  The project, which covers TCC's eutire
revised 1988-92 telecommunications investment program, comprises: (a) a
technical assistance program for sector restructuring and institutional
development, particularly in the areas of organization and management,
personnel and human resource development, accounting and finance,
procurement and inventory management, management information systems and
tariffs; (b) switching equipment for an additional 213,000 lines; (c)
associated local networks and subscriber plant for the connection of about
235,000 new subscriber lines; (d) additional microwave and cable
transmission links; (e) a new national and international switching center
(NISC); (f) a new satellite earth station; (g) computer systems; and (h)
ongoing works still to be completed, principally 30,000 lines of switching
equipment and retained consultants to assist TCC in project planning and
implementatior,.  By end 1992, the project is expected to satisfy 82% of
expressed demand and to provide a coverage ratio of 12 lines per 100
inhabitants.
6.        Actions Agreed: Duri-ng negotiations, the following assurances
were obtained:
(a) TCC will: (i) consult with the Bank before introducing any
major changes in its investment program, which in the
aggregate would involve more than 10% of the total amount of
investment, 1anned for the five-year program ; and (ii)
ensure that no such changes will be introduced unless TCC
and the Bank have agreed that these changes are justified;



-3-
(b)  TCC shall finalize procurement and cofinancing agreements,
in an aggregate amount of about US$80.0 million, to finanice
switching, transmission and other project components to be
procured unider price and terms biddiug before June 30, 1989;
(c)  TCC will maintain the Project Implementation Unit until
project completion and will employ or assign additiotnal
staffing and resources, according to agreed targets, to
ensure effective project implementation;
(d)  TCC will present performance targets for 1990 and each
subsequent fiscal year for joint review with the Bank by
October 31 of previous year, review progress with the Bank
not later than June 30 of each year, and take all necessary
corrective actions. Agreemenit on 1989 targets was reached
during negotiations;
(e)  TCC will furnish audited finiancial statements to the Bank,
including an audit report of the Special Account, within six
months after the end of each fiscal year;
(f)  TCC will: (i) take all measures necessary to ensure that the
sector restructuring and tariff studies shall be completed
and a copy thereof furnished to the Bank by July 31, 1989;
(ii) carry out a mid-term review of the studies with the
Government and the Bank by April 30, 1989; and (iii)
following completion of the studies, the Government, the
Bank and TCC will exchange views on the studies'
recommendations and TCC will, on the basis of said exchange
of views, carry out a Sector Reform Program approved by the
Government, in accordance with the following schedule:
tariff restructuring and adjustment by January 31, 1990, and
sector commercialization by July 31, 1990;
(g)  TCC will: (i) undertake all studies on institutional
development under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank,
and in accordance with an agreed implementation schedule;
(ii) furnish to the Bank quarterly progress reports and
conduct semi-annual reviews with the Governmtnt and the Bank
on interim results of the studies; and (iii) following
completion of the studies' recommendations, and on the basis
of such recommendations and exchange of views, prepare a
Management Development Program and complete the
implementation of said Program by October 31, 1991;
(h)  TCC will furnish to the Bank, by end December 1988, a
detailed aging schedule of accounts receivable and will
implement a plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to provision
over the project period for all outstanding bad debt; and
(i)  TCC will achieve a net internal cash generation not less
than 50% of investment expenditures on a moving three year
average basis in any one year during the project
implementation period.



-4-
In addition, assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(j) The Government will take all necessary measures for carrying
out the Sector Reform Program and the Management Development
Program, after exchanging viees with the Bank on the
studies' recommendations.
7.        The following is a condition of effectiveness:
(a) TCC shall have secured cofinancing agreements, satisfactory
to the Bank, in an aggregate amount of US$46.0 million to
finance local networks.
8.        Project Benefits and Risks.  The proposed project has an
estimated economic rate of return of 31% and its benefits would reach most
sectors-of Jordan's economy. In particular, it would help the Government
and TCC to: enhance the efficiency and productivity of the
telecommdinications sector which should reduce investment and operating
costs and increase resource trausfers to the Government; achieve sector
commercialization and institution building of the operating entity; expand
geographic coverage and improve service quality; spread the benefits of
development to rural areas; develop the information infrastructure for the
services sector; and contribute to employment creation. The main risk is
the potential delay in the identification, formulation and implementation
of sector and institutional reforms. The Government, the Bank and TCC have
agreed on appropriate action programs and on a monitoring system to ensure
effective implementation. The conviction and commitment demonstrated by
the Government and TCC to the proposed sector restructuring aiid
institutional development plans indicate that this risk is manageable.
There is also a risk that demand aay grow slower than anticipated. The
project, however, has been designed to allow for adjustments during
implementation to reflect realized demand.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve it.
