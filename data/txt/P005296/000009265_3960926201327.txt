A     ClMWNCitTISn FIOJUCT
LOAN AMD rcr SUW&R
Borrower:          Jordan Telecommunications Corporation, TCC.
Guarantor:         Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Loan Amount:       $36 million equivalent.
Terms:             17 years, including 5 years of grace, at standard
variable interest rate. TCC will bear the foreign
exchange and interest rate risks, and pay a 1% guarantee
fee to the Government.
Project            The main objectives of the project are to: (a) formulate
Objectives:        and implement reforms to improve the overall policy
framework for the commercialization of the
telecommunications sector and TCC; (b) expand network
capacity, improve service quality, increase geographic
coverage and introduce new value-added services; (c)
strengthen TCC's capacity to develop and implement
competitive strategies for procurement, financing and
system planning; (d) help the Government and TCC to
revise telecommunications pricing policy and tariffs to
reflect changes in the cost structure resulting from
growth and technological change, and to adjust for
shifts in market demand due to changes in Jordan's
economic conditions and prospects; and (e) support TCC
in conducting a review of its organizational structure,
upgrading its management systems using modern
information technology, and Implementing a human
resource development program in technical, financial and
management areas.
Project            The project, which covers TCC's entire revised 1988-92
Description:       telecommunications investment program, comprises: (a)
about 190 manmonths of consultancy services for sector
restructuring and institutional development,
particularly in the areas of organization and
management, personnel and human resource development,
accounting and finance, procurement and inventory
management, management information systems and tariffs;
(b) switching equipment for an additional 213,000 lines;
(c) associated local networks and subscriber plant for
the connection of about 235,000 new subscriber lines;
(d) additional microwave and cable transmission links;
(e) a new national and international switching center
(NISC); (f) a new satellite earth station; (g) computer
systems; and (h) ongoing works still to be completed,
principally 30,000 lines of switching equipment and
retained consultants to assist TCC in project planning
and implementation. By end 1992, the project is
expected to satisfy 82Z of expressed demand and to
provide a coverage ratio of 12 lines per 100
inhabit-ants.

Project Benefits
and Risks:         The project will benefit most sectors of Jordan's
economy. In particular, it would help the Government
and TCC to enhance the efficiency and productivity of
the telecommunications sector which should reduce
investment and operating costs and increase resource
transfers to the Goverument; achieve sector
commercialization and iustitution building of the
operating entity; expand geographic coverage and improve
service quality; spread the benefits of development to
rural areas; develop the information infrastructure for
the services sector; aud contribute to employment
creation. The main risk is the potential for delays in
the identification, formulation and implementation of
sector and institutional reforms. The Government, the
Bank and TCC have agreed on appropriate action programs
and on a monitoring system to ensure effective
implementation. The conviction and commitment
demonstrated by the Government and TCC to the proposed
sector restructuring and institutional development plans
indicate that this risk is manageable. There is also a
risk that demand may grow more slowly than anticipated.
The project, however, has been designed to allow for
adjustments during implementation to reflect realized
demand.

JORDA
JORDN    ICOHNIC&TIONS CORPORATION (TCC)
A TELECOhNC&TIONS PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan has requested
Bank assistance in financing the development of the country's
telecommunications sector. Principal project objectives are focussed on
reforming the regulatory and financial framework for the telecommunications
sector; restructuring the implementing agency to function as a commercial
entity with administrative and financial autonomy; improving its operating
efficiency and profitability to reduce costs and maximize resource
transfers to the Government; upgrading its technical, operational and
managerial capabilities; and expanding the country's telecommunications
network and increasing its geographic coverage. This will be the Bank's
first lending operation in this sector in Jordan.
1.02      The estimated cost of the project is JD 112.7 million
(US0338.1 million) with a foreign exchange component of JD 74.4 million
(US$223.2 million). TCC will finance JD 51.1 million (US$153.3 million)
from net internal cash generation, including JD 38.3 million
(US$114.9 miliion) in local expenditures. The Bank would finance US$36.0
million of foreign costs for underground cables and associated equipment
for local networks, as well as for technical assistance and computer
equipment. Financing for switching and transmission equipment (US$84.9
million) will be secured through price and terms bidding with the exception
of US$5.7 million, which will be financed under tied procurement for
extension of existing equipment.
II.  THE TE      NIC*IOES SECMR
Sector Organization
2.01      Authority for public telecommunications and postal services is
vested in the Ministry of Communications. The Jordanian Telecommunications
Corporation (TCC), a fully Government-owned entity, is a semi-autonomous
public agency in charge of the provision and operation of domestic and
international telecommunications services. TCC has the monopoly of public
telecommunications services: telephone, telex, telegraph and all other
media of transmission, such as data and television. TCC also formulates
sector policy and regulation and proposes tariffs which require approval by
the Council of Ministers. Jordan has no domestic telecommunications
manufacturing industry. Postal services are separately operated by the
Ministry of Communications' Directorate General of Posts (DGP).



-2-
Demand for Service
2.02      As of end 1987, there were about 203,000 telephone direct
exchange lines (DELs) in service and a waiting list of 85,000 registered
applicants; implying that only 70X of expressed demand was satisfied. In
addition to expressed demand, TCC estimates a suppressed demand of about
15,000 DELs in areas without service or with no present service expansion
possibility. Thus, total demand is estimated at 303,000 DELs, with a 67%
demand satisfaction. Demand for telephone service is expected to grow at
about 10% per year over the 1988-1992 period. Demand projections are
reasonable and based on the forecasting model generally used in the
telecommunications industry. During 1983-87, which marked the beginning of
the economic downturn in Jordan, expressed demand (with no consideration
for latent demand) grew as 12% annually.  Details regarding the demand
study are given in Annex 1. By project completion in 1992, supply would
meet 82% of projected demand with a capacity utilization of 80% and a
telephone density of 12 DELs per 100 inhabitants.
2.03      The project implementation would include several safeguards
against overinvestment in the likely event that demand grows at a lower
rate than anticipated. The project has been designed to allow for
adjustments during implementation to reflect realized demand. Project
resources can be redistributed to adjust for any supply/demand imbalances
among regions. Moreover, the project implementation schedule can be
extended to reflect actual growth patterns of total demand. For example,
if demand grows at only 6% per annum and subsequently the project
implementation is extended until 1994, planned supply would meet 88% of
demand in 1994 with a capacity utilization of 80%, which is acceptable.
Access to Service
2.04      Telephone density in Jordan as of end 1987 was about 7 DELs per
luu a.jpulation, which compares well with countries of comparable GNP per
capita (e.g. Syria 5.2, Malaysia 6.5, Costa Rica 9.0). Existing
telecommunications services are concentrated in the urban areas; 63%
percent of DELs in service are concentrated in the greater Amman
metropolitan area which has only 41% of the population (Table 2.1 and
Annex 2). About 270 towns and villages out of a total of about 850

population centers in the country are provided with automatic telephone
services covering 88% of Jordan's total population. Some 380 population
clusters are provided with service by semi-automatic manual exchanges.
Telex service is primarily used for public administration and international
business and is concentrated in the capital city (90%). This service is
being superceded by facsimile and data transmission. For this reason, and
because the existing telex network has a low capacity utilization (65%),
TCC is not planning any further telex expansion. Subscriber trunk dialing
and international dialing is available to 90% of the subscribers who have
direct access to over 50 countries. Automat'c telex service is available
to all subscribers.
Usage of Service
2.05      In the Greater Amman metropolitan area, 20% of telephone DELs are
for business, 9% for Government, and 71% for residential premises.
Depending on the exchange area, the percentage of DELs for business
purposes varies from 58% in the city center to a low of 15X in the suburban
areas. Although statistics are not available for the rest of the country,
experience suggests a higher percentage of telephones for business outside
the capital city. In terms of revenue, distribution by user group cannot
be estimated because current billing does not differentiate between
business and residential telephones.
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
2.06      Under the previous Sectoral Plan 1981-1985, a major improvement
and modernization of Jordan's telecommunications facilities was achieved
following the introduction of digital technology in the area of stored
program controlled (SPC) switching, radio microwave links and cable

transmission. The digitalization of the telecommunications network has
many operational advantages for the customers as well as for the operating
entities. Digital equipment is produced at relatively low costs with much
higher performance/price ratios than the previous analog technology.
Moreover, digital technology has the capability to provide cost/effective
data and other value-added services, which are today essential for managing
modern business information networks. Access to international business
information networks and data integration are highly facilitated with an
in'rastructure of digital telecommunications networks. Digitalizationi
al&ows easy integration of the national network and the extension of
telephone and data servi_es to rural areas.
2.07      Presently, 68% of the existing telephone exchange capacity is
made of electronic digital SPC equipment. With an installed capacity of
329,000 telephone exchange lines and about 203,000 DELs in service,
exchange capacity utilization averages 67%, which is low but acceptable for
a rapidly expanding network and provides lead time for further extensions.
The national backbone of Lhe long distance transmission network consists of
microwave routes (Map IBRD No. 20903), which link Jordan's long distance
network to Iraq and Syria. The national and regional long distance network
is being complemented by digital microwave transmission links.
International service is provided through two Standard A satellite earth
stations working with the Atlantic and Indian Ocean INTELSAT satellites and
one small earth station working with the ARABSAT satellite system.
Likewise, telex service is fairly well developed, with about 2,600
connected lines and a capacity of 4,000 lines.
2.08      With the recent introduction of state-of-the-art digital
technology in switching and transmission, the percentage of unsuccessful
long-distance call attempts due to system malfunctioning and congestion has
dropped to as low as 1.0%; a service quality performance that is matched
only in industrialized countries. However, a sizable 25% of unsuccessful
calls are caused by subscribers' misdialing (12% dialing of nou-ex4sting
codes or numbers, 24% iut. mplete dialing). This may be largely due to
outdated telephone directoL'es and inaccessable information services.
2.09      Like most other developing countries, the development of outside
plant, which includes local cable networks and subscriber installation,
lags behind other components of the network in terms of capacity, quality
and maintenance. Fault rates of about 60 per 100 lines per annum are
reported (a reasonable target would be 10), which clearly indicates the
scope for improvement in maintenance of cable networks and subscriber plant
as well as in the quality of repairs. Improvement of maintenance and
repair capability and restoring the balance of investment between outside
plant and other parts of the network is one of the principal tasks to be
undertaken under the project. Basic data on existing facilities are
available in Annex 3.
Sector Goals and Strategy
2.10      The Government's declared objectives for the telecommunications
sector, as stated in the Five-Year Plan (1986-90), are to:



(a)  restructure the telecommunications sector along commercial
lines in accordance with the national socio-economic
objectives;
(b)  restructure TCC to function as a commercially-oriented
entity with full autonomy;
(c)  rationalize TCC's organizational structure and upgrade its
operational and management capabilities;
(d)  expand telecommunications services to meet unsatisfied
demand and to increase geographic coverage;
(e)  automate rural telephony and improve both regional and
international services;
(f)  enhance network quality and reliability; and
(g)  introduce specialized and new value-added services.
2.11      To substantiate the above goals, TCC's revised 1988-92 Investment
Program (para 3.01) aims at increasing installed exchange capacity from
329,000 lines to 513,000 lines, i.e., an average growth rate of 10.0% per
year. Over the same period, the number of connected DELs would increase
from 203,000 to 400,000 lines, or 14.5% per year. The goal of the planned
system expansion is to meet 82% of unsatisfied demand (para 2.02) while
increasing geographic coverage to rural areas (para 3.01). To meet the
policy and institutional goals, TCC will undertake a sector restructuring
study and an institutional development plan under the proposed project
(paras 4.04 and 4.18). TCC has already retained consultants to assist in
strengthening its project planning, design and operations management
functions and in training technical staff (para 4.08).
Sector Constraints
2.12      In the past few years, TCC has sustained a 19% annual growth in
connected telephone lines and has tripled its gross fixed assets while
experiencing almost a full transition into new digital technology
(paras 5.06 and 2.06). The recent rapid network modernization and growth
of TCC, however, has not been accompanied by a comparable program for
improving sector policies, and for upgrading TCC's organization, manpower
skills and management systems. Most project development has been carried
o-;t through turnkey contracts with procurement tied to bilateral financing,
resulting in high expansion costs (para 4.08). Investment planning,
project design, management and supervision have been performed by outside
consultants (para 3.16). TCC is also constrained by the Government's
administrative and financial procedures and lacks the autonomy to function
as an efficient commercial entity (para 4.02). In addition, its present
structure is highly centralized and lacks the management characteristics
and certain basic functions of a commercial entity (para 4.05). Tariff
levels and structure also have many discrepancies and need to be refocussed
to meet socio-economic objectives, economic costs of services and demand
patterns (para 6.06).



- 6 -
2.13     Given the past rapid growth and modernization of Jordan's network,
major sector reforms and considerable strengthening of TCC's operations and
management capabilities are needed to enable sustained and more efficient
sector development. Three main areas of concern stand out; namely, (a) the
structure of the sector, (b) TCC's requirements for financial and
administrative autonomy, and (c) TCC's organizational structure and
management systems. These areas have been studied thoroughly during
appraisal and will be addressed and tackled during project implementation
in the framework of a sector commercialization plan and an institutional
development plan formulated and agreed upon by the Government, the Bank and
TCC (paras 4.04 and 4.18). Both plans form an integral and essential part
of the project. The institutional development plan will also involve a
study for revising and adjusting telecommunications pricing policy and
tariffs.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.14      With the trend towards globalization and the parallel growth in
the use of information systems in world economy, the development of a
modern telecommunications network in Jordan is of great importance in
linking the country's manufacturing and service sectors to international
markets. The rational development of the telecommunications sector can be
instrumental in increasing domestic resource mobilization and alleviating
infrastructure constraints, especially with regard to establishing small
and medium scale industries and to spreading the benefits of development to
Jordan's rural areas, both of which figure prominently in the Government's
Five-Year Plan. In particular, the dominant services sector, which
accounts for about 60% of GDP, depends critically on effective
communications and modern business data/information services. Jordan can
play a key role in the modernization of the Region's business information
and management systems provided that the development of its educational
programs and business sectors are linked to that of advanced information
and communications systems.
2.15      The Bank's proposed support for telecommunications in Jordan is a
key component of a broader Bank strategy designed to assist the Government
to diversify the country's economy, promote exports through policy
improvements and increased emp'.asis on the producti-e sectors and to
strengthen the infrastructural base and institutional framework for
improved economic efficiency and international competitiveness. Jordan's
economy, particularly the dominant services sector, is highly dependent on
effective communications and data/information services. The Bank worked
closely with TCC to review the telecommunications investment program in the
context of the current Five-Year Plan (1986-90) and the increasingly tight
budgetary and resource constraints within the Jordanian economy, and
considers that the proposed allocation to telecommunications and its
approximate 5% share in total investment is appropriate, particularly given
the expectation of high economic and financial returns from these
investments.



- 7 -
2.16      The Bank supports the Government's objectives in the
telecommunications sector. Through this first telecommunications lending
operation in Jordan, the Bank would play a major role in assisting the
Government to: (i) improve the policy and institutional framework for the
efficient long-term development of the telecommunications sector; (ii)
implement a realistic investment program consistent with resource
availabilities that would improve services and expand geographic coverage,
especially to isolated rural areas; (iii) mobilize competitive financing
resources for the program; and (iv) devise and carry out a program for the
commercialization of the telecommunications sector and TCC's operations.
The Bank has already been instrumental in helping TCC to rationalize its
investment program and improve its procurement processes and their cost
effectiveness. During project implementation, the Bank would continue
these efforts and would help the Government to address critical sector
issues and implement policy actions.
III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01      The project would provide for balanced and integrated development
of telephone facilities for the urban and rural areas. Telephone
concentration in the Greater Amman area would decrease from its present
level of 63% to 56% in 1992. Automatic rural telephone services would be
extended to 62 new villages, or 82% of all towns and villages, covering 98%
of the total population. The revised program projects a 14% annual growth
of connected subscribers which would meet about 82% of projected demand for
1992, a marked improvement over the current situation (67% demand
satisfaction). This planned growth rate seems reasonable and consistent
with TCC's past performance, which averaged an annual rate of 19% during
the period 1982-86. Furthermore, under the project, the installation of
the backbone national and regional long-distance networks will be completed
in 1990.
3.02      Besides network expansion, the project aims at improving TCC's
operating efficiency and profitability by reducing its operating and
investment unit costs and at maximizing the contribution of the
telecommunications sector to the country's economic strategy, especially
with regard to efficient mobilization of domestic resources ard employment
creation. The main sector and institutional objectives of the project are
to:
(a)  assist TCC and the Government to formulate and implement,
within an overall policy framework, sector reforms for the
commercialization of the telecommunications services in
Jordan and to allow TCC to function as a business operating
entity;



- 8 -
(b)  strengthen TCC's capacity to develop and implement
coordinated strategies for procurement, financing and
system planning that would help to reduce investment
costs, especially in light of the Government's decision to
move away from turnkey contracts and procurement tied to
bilateral financing to international competitive bidding;
(c)  help TCC and the Government revise telecommunications
pricing policy and tariffs to reflect the national macro
and socio-economic policies, changes in the cost structure
resulting from growth and technological change and to
adjust for shifts in market demand resulting from changes
in Jordan's economic conditions and prospects; and
(d)  support TCC in conducting a comprehensive review of its
organizational structure, upgrading its management systems
using modern information technology, and implementing a
human resource development program in technical, financial
and management areas.
3.03      The project represents TCC's revised 1988-92 investment program,
and provides in addition, technical assistance for sector restructuring and
institutional development. TCC's investment program has been drawn-up on
the basis of the Government Five-Year Plan (1986-90). Because of delays in
implementation, TCC had to revise the origiual 1986-90 program and extend
its implementatiou to 1992. On this basis, a more realistic and achievable
telecommunications investment program for the period 1988-92 was finalized
and agreed upon during project appraisal. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that TCC will: (i) consult with the Bank before introducing
any major changes in its investment program, which in the aggregate would
involve more tharn 10% of the total amount of investments planned for the
five-year program; and (ii) ensure that no such changes will be introduced
unless TCC and the Bank have agreed that these changes are justified [para
7.01 (a)J.
Project Description
3.04      In accordance with sector goals (para 2.10), the project
comprises three main components:
(a)  ongoing works carried over from 1985 which include the
expansion of existing telephone exchanges by about 30,000
lines; providing 12,000 lines of initial capacity in areas
previously without service and constructing associated
outside plant, and installing regional transmission routes
(microwave and optical fibre cable) which would form the
backbone of Jordan's long distance network connecting it
with the Egyptian, Saudi-Arabian and Syrian networks.
(b)  new works which cover the provision and installation of:



(i) 213,000 lines of telephone switching equipment of
which 27,000 lines are met through redeployment of
existing equipment. That includes:
- establishment of 14 new primary centers and 76
small stand alone exchanges or concentrators with a
total capacity of 170,000 lines;
- extension of 4 primary exchanges and 31 small
switching nodes by 25,000 lines; and
- creation of 27 new switching nodes to be connected
to existing primary exchanges with a total capacity
of 18,000 lines.
(ii) associated local networks and subscriber plant for
the counection of 235,000 new subscriber lines in 620
cities, towns and villages. This includes 12,000
lines for which the exchange capacity exists from the
previous investment program;
(iii)  61 digital microwave links, 29 optical fiber
junctions and 37 pulse code modulation (PCM) cable
systems to provide for transmission links within
multi-exchange areas and between primary exchanges
and corresponding switching nodes;
(iv) a new national and international switching center
(NISC) with a capacity of about 5,500 circuits;
(v) replacement of a satellite earth station antenna for
international traffic via INTELSAT; in addition to
(vi) consultancy services for sector restructuring and
institutional development (paras 4.04 and 4.18); and
(vii)  acquisition and development of computer systems based
on recommendations of the studies included under (vi)
above; and
(c)  provision for future works relating to the next investment
program that would presumably start in 1992 before the completion
of the proposed 1988-92 program.
Details of physical components are given in Annex 4 and illustrated in Map
IBRD 20903. TCC's organization and the studies to be financed under the
project's technical assistance are discussed in Chapter IV.

- 11 -
3.06      The project costs reflect estimated early 1988 prices based on
TCC's experience with contracts relating to ongoing works and those signed
for goods under previous projects, with adjustments taking into account
actual trend in international prices for telecommunications equipment and
in local prices for ci;ll works in Jordan.  The project estimates are
reasonable. TCC is exempt from payment of custom duties on imported goods
and pays no taxes.
Contingencies
3.07      Physical contingencies are 5% for switching aud transmission
equipment, 7.5% for local networks and subscriber installations and 10% for
buildings. Foreign price contingencies are based on estimated annual
foreign cost increases of 1% from 1988 to 1990 and 3.5% thereafter. Local
price contingencies reflect an estimated annual increase in local costs of
3% in 1988 and 5% thereafter.
Project Financing
3.08      The proposed Bank loan of US$36.0 million (Table 3.2) would help
finance underground and aerial cables, wires and heavy material for the
construction of outside plant as well as consultancy services and computer
systems. TCC would generate internally sufficient funds to fiuance all
local costs and 18.7% of foreign costs (para 5.13), corresponding to a
total contribution of US$153.3 million. Ongoing works (US$17.7 million)
and the procurement of new proprietary equipment (US$5.7 million) would be
financed through available bilateral credits. TCC intends to seek
US$79.2 million financing in export and mixed credits to cover switching
and transmission components. Experience from other telecommunications
projects indicates that such financing is available in ample amounts.
Therefore, this financing source can be considered reasonably assured.
This leaves a gap of about US$46.2 million for local networks for which
export credits are not typically available. For this compouent, the
Government and TCC intend to seek bilateral/regional funds.
3.09      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the loan would
be declared effective only after TCC has secured cofinaning agreements,
satisfactory to the Bank, in an aggregate amount of US$46.0 million to
finance local networks (para 7.02 (a)). Furthermore, an agreement was
reached that TCC shall finalize procurement and cofinancing agreements, in
an aggregate amount of about US$80.0 million, to finance switching,
transmission and other project components to be procured under price and
terms bidding before June 30, 1989 [para 7.01 (b)J.

TCC's strategy is to procure the bulk of the network expausion under the
proposed project through open tenders. TCC will undertake international
competitive bidding, in *ccordance with the Bank's Guidelines, for the
procurement of the following: (a) cables and heavy material required for
the construction of local cable networks. This procurement package will be
partly financed by the Bank under cofiuancing arrangements with sources to
be identified (para 3.09); (b) wiring for the network subscriber plant
(US$7.5 million); and (c) computer systems (US$2.4 million). The Bank's
guidelines would also be applied for the selection of consultants for the
technical assistance component (US$3.3 million). In the case the Loan is
reallocated to be used for financing part of the construction and
installation of local networks at an estimated total cost of
US$112.2 million, local manufacturers of ducts and man-hole covers would
receive preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is lower.
3.11      International bids including financing offers (price and terms)
would be invited for the provision and installation of local, long-distance
and transit switching, microwave links, cable and optical fiber
transmission, satellite earth station antenna and subscriber telephone
installations for a total sum of US$87.6 million.  Extensions of certain
proprietary exchanges and transmission stations, estimated to cost about
US$5.7 million, will be arranged through direct negotiations with existing
suppliers.  Although the project components mentioned under this paragraph
will not be financed by the Bank, they do constitute an integral part of
the project and are critical to project implementation and its overall
performance. Hence, procurement, financing and implementation of all the
project components should be closely coordinated.
3.12      Construction of technical buildings estimated to cost a total of
US$9.2 million would be carried out under local bidding procedures
advertised locally in accordance with the Government local procurement
procedures.
Contract Review
3.13      Prior Bank review of procurement documentation would be required
for the eight contracts (all of them larger than US$1.0 million) for goods
to be procured under ICB in accordance with Bank's Guidelines. Related
bidding documents for these contracts have already been reviewed and
cleared by the Bank and bid invitations issued. Prior Bank clearance will
also be required for the short list of consultants, terms of references,
letters of invitation, as well as for evaluation of proposals and contracts
award, in accordance with Bank's Guidelines for the use of Consultants. To
ensure that the sector commercialization and institutional development
plans are carried out in accordance with the agreed action plans
(Annex 12), it has been agreed by TCC during negotiations that letters of
invitation to a short list of qualified consulting firms, approved by the
Bank, will be issued by end May and contracts awarded in September 1988.

Disbursements
3.14      Disbursements for all contracts (partially or totally) financed
by the Bank would be made against fully documented withdrawal
applications. The estimated disbursement schedule for the project, based
on the Bank profile for all sectors in Jordan, is shown in Annex 7. The
loan will be closed on December 31, 1993. Proposed disbursements by
category are shown below (Table 3.4):
TABLE 3.4: DISOURSUHENT OF PROPOSED LOAN
Amount

90% of local expenditures.
4. Unallocated                 3.80
Total               36.00
The loan made to TCC will be at the standard variable rate for 17 years
including 5 years of grace and guaranteed by the Government. TCC will bear
the foreign exchange and interest risks, and pay to the Government a
guarantee fee of 1% per annum of the principal amount of the Loan
outstanding from time to time.
3.15      To facilitate timely project implementation, TCC would establish,
maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank,
a Special Account in US dollars to which the Bank would make an initial
deposit equivalent to about US$3.0 million. The Special Account would be
replenished against withdrawal applications when the undisbursed balance of
the account falls below an amount equal to 50% or less of the amount of the
Special Account. Withdrawal applications would be supported by appropriate
documentation. The Bank would be provided annually with an audit report of
the Special Account [paras 4.14 and 7.01(e)1.
Project Implementation
3.16      During the implementation of the previous 1981-1985 sectoral
plan, TCC made extensive use of turnkey contracts that were planned
by engineering consulting firms. Now, TCC is gradually building in-house



- 16 -
capabilities in the areas of engineering, investment planning, detailed
project design, procurement, project management and supervision. The
planning and the detailed design of the project, as well as the preparation
of bidding documents, is the result of close cooperation between TCC and
the retained engineering consultants, who are also helping TCC to organize
project management and supervision and to improve network operations,
maintenance and customer services. Switching and transmission equipment
will be installed by the respective suppliers. Construction of technical
buildings, manholes, and cable ducts will be carried out by local private
contractors. Installation of underground and aerial cables and associated
equipment, procured separately by TCC, will be installed bv local private
contractors with the support of foreign suppliers. With the exception of
installations in large new buildings that will be carried out by private
local contractors under TCC's supervision, TCC staff will install most of
the new subscriber plant. Overall project management, coordination,
supervision and follow-up of various contractors' involvement, as well as
acceptance tests will be carried out by TCC staff.
3.17      TCC's present organization is not yet tailored to deal on a
permanent basis with the requirements of project planning, design,
implementation and commissioning of a substantial expansion program. For
its 1988-92 investment program, TCC has set up an ad-hoc Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by a Project Director reporting to the
Director General, who has the overall responsibility for project
implementation. The PIU is designed to serve as an interim organizational
set-up for the duration of the project to carry out TCC's investment
program effectively and to develop in-house capabilities in all aspects of
project development (through on-the-job training and teaming with retained
consultants) so as to reduce TCC's reliance on turn-key contracts and
foreign expertise. As to the future integration of the functions of this
unit into the organization and the optimal set-up for undertaking
large-scale investment programs, this will be explo-.ed under the project's
management studies in the framework of TCC's proposed institutional
development plan (para. 4.18).
3.18      The project implementation plan (PIP), including the project
organization, implementation schedule and manpower requirements is
described in Annex 8. The plan takes into account TCC's available
resources and those of the retained consultants. The PIU's director will
be assisted by selected project managers with the support of the retained
engineering consultants. Those managers, and other technical staff, for
the PIU have to be identified, from within TCC or the outside, provided
with the proper training, assigned project responsibilities and ultimately
reintegrated permanently into the organization. According to the
implementation schedule, additional recruits from outside TCC will have to
be employed, trained by the Telecommunications College and then put on the
job not later than 1990. Hence, TCC should immediately proceed with the
necessary recruitment arrangements givea the existing administrative
constraints for hiring additional staff (para 4.02). TCC has to employ or
assign from within to the PIU 36 staff in 1988 and 12 staff in 1989.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that TCC will maintain the



- 17 -
Project Implementation Unit until project completion and will employ or
assign additional staffiug and resources, according to agreed targets, to
ensure effective project implementation [para 7.01(c)].
Performance Monitoring
3.19      TCC's overall performance during project implementation
will be monitored by means of selected performance indicators relating to
techuical, operational and financial perfcrrvance, subscriber counections,
service quality, and staffing (Annex 9). Continuous monitoring of project
physical implementation as well as TCC's operational and financial
performance and efficiency will assist TCC in improving its management and
allow timely corrective actions to be taken, when necessary. TCC will
prepare annually for Bank review a comparative analysis of its actual
performance against the target indicators. Baring negotiations, assurances
were obtained that TCC will present performance targets for 1990 and each
subsequent fiscal year for joint review with the Bank by October 31 of
previous year, review progress with the Bank not later than June 30 of each
year, and take all necessary corrective actions [para 7.01(d)]. While the
targets for later years are indicative, those for 1989 were agreed by TCC
during negotiations.
IV. TME DIPEINI   ACJfl/
Sector Commercialization
4.01      TCC was established in 1971 as a semi-autonomous Government-owned
corporation. A ten-member Board of Directors, chaired by the Minister of
Communications, is responsible for TCC policy and administration. TCC's
Director General, who is appointed by the Council of Ministers, is also
Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive in charge of TCC's management and
operations. There is no private sector represeitation on the Board. The
Law allows for two Board Members from the private sector appointed by the
Gover=sent, but those have been instead selected from the academic field.
The effectiveness of the Board is very much depeudent on the Chairman, who
has the main authority to call for Board meetings.
4.02      Although TCC has the legal statute of a fiuancially and
administratively autonomous entity, it remains truly a public sector
institution governed by the Civil Service By-Law and fiscally tied to the
Governmeut General Budget for both investments and operating expenditures.
TCC's preeent Corporate Law grants the entity management and control
1/ At present, TCC represents the commercial telecommunications sector in
Jordan. For development purposes, however, TCC and the sector should
be differentiated because of the potential participation of the private
sector, in case of commercialization, in the provision of
telecommunications services in Jordan.



- 18 -
authority of its own financial resources and the freedom to deposit its
funds in commercial banks (Law 29-1971, Articles 14 and 15). But in
practice, TCC has no treasury function (para 4.13), nor has it control over
its profits. Its major account is with the Treasury with minor accounts
for operating cash and for settlement of contract retentions with the
Central Bank of Jordan.  Administratively, TCC lacks the authority to
adjust salaries to changing market conditions and cannot freely hire and
dismiss staff. In procurement, TCC is subject to the Government
administrative procedures which are reportedly time consuming and
ineffce:tive.
4.03      While the telecommunications sector is commercial in nature, its
operating entity is constrained by the public administrative and financial
regulations and procedures. The Government and TCC recognize the urgency
for introducing major reforms to optimize the overall policy and
institutional framework for the telecommunications sector. The objectives
are to increase TCC's efficiency and productivity, maximize resource
transfers to the Government and enhance the sector's contribution to the
economy as a whole. Considering TCC's previous performance and potentials;
organizational, operational, financial and personnel capabilities and
limitations; and the overall sector development stage and needs, the
Government has decided to give priority to sector commercialization as a
necessary step towards privatization. This would imply restructuring TCC
as a fully autonomous, administratively and financially, Government-owned
corporation governed under private law.
4.04      The prospects of setting up TCC as a fully  ,nmercial enterprise
raise important issues regarding competition and regulation. For instance,
there is the question of whether TCC should continue to have a monopoly
over all public telecommunications services, or whethet some of these
should be opened up to competition. Services such as data networks, mobile
telephone and paging, which are not subject to large economies of scale,
may be provided efficiently by private firms. This would enhance private
sector participation in telecommunications, mobilize new rssources for
investment, improve responsiveness to specialized business demands and free
TCC to concentrate on the task of developing and efficiently operating,
maintaining and managing the national infrastructure of basic
telecommunications facilities. Another major policy concern regarding
sector restructuring is that of resource transfer between the sector and
the Government. This will eventually require policy decisions regarding
tariffs, taxation of TCC and TCC's financial structure. Furthermore,
relationships and role interplays between the Government, TCC and the
private sector need to be examined. A sector restructuring plan has been
formulated with the help of the Bank. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that TCC will carry out the study of the restructuring plan and
the Government will take all necessary measures to facilitate its
implementatila (paras 4.20 and 4.22).
Organization and Management
4.05      A basic organization chart of TCC is at Annex 10.  The existing
structure ;flects a highly centralized functional/regional organization



- 19 -
biased towards operation with less emphasis on corporate planning and
business development.  There is no clear demarcation of operational
responsibilities between headquarters and regions. In most cases,
headquarters' responsibilities extend beyond policy and planning to
management and control of some field operations and maintenance functions.
Such a situation becomes unmanageable as the network continues to grow at
its projected rate. A clear delineation between the central and regional
responsibilities will be required preferably with operational and technical
authorities decentralized to regions.
4.06      TCC is not organized and managed as a business.  Its present
structure does not have the management characteristics of a commercial
telecommunications entity and it lacks some important functions, such as
treasury, corporate planning and marketing. Managerial accountability is
limited; service performance, financial performance, manpower and overall
productivity of major organizational units and services are not regularly
monitored. The existing structural linkages ar.ag the various functions
are loose and should be reinforced to enhance TCC1s 'bility to manage
growth, technological change, innovation and iLtegrEtion of new services.
Its management functions need to be strengthened L..ough the introduction
of new skills and modern systems using information technology.
4.07      In general, in order to improve TCC's operating efficiency and
profitability two principle interrelated requirements stand out: (i) to
provide TCC with the autonomy of a commercial entity; and (ii) to develop
and implement a comprehensive organizational and management improvement
program.
Planning and Operations Management
4.08      In the past, most project development has been carried out
through turnkey contracts in the framework of bilateral credit agraements.
Investment planning has been done with substantial assistance from retained
consultants, while system design and engineering have been mostly done by
the equipment suppliers. The above approach had been associated with high
expansion costs. For the 1988-92 investment program, TCC has decided to
follow competitive procurement and untied financing strategies in order to
reduce its investment costs and its dependence on foreign contractors.
This would require TCC to strengthen its in-house planning, design,
engineering, procurement and supervision capabilities, as well as build up
experience in technical, commercial and financial aspects of international
competitive bidding. For this purpose, TCC has recently retained
consultants to help on all the above functions. To ensure effective
transfer of know-how and on-the-job training, TCC staff are teamed with
consultants in working groups in the various disciplines of network
planning, system design, service operations, maintenance and customers'
services. The experience in the planning and design of TCC's 1988-1992
investment program has been encouraging; TCC staff contribution has been
substantial. The same approach is being carried over to other functions,
in particular to procurement, project implementation and supervision.



- 20 -
Staff and Training
4.09      As of December 31, 1987, TCC employed about 3,300 staff or about
17 staff per 1,000 DELs, which compares well with newly industrialized
countries (Brazil 15; Singapore 16; Portugal 17). This staff ratio has
been achieved, however, without TCC's participation in project preparation
aud implementation. In view of the future expansion of Jordan's network,
TCC will have to hire additional staff, particularly telecommunications
engineers and technicians but also qualified managers in operations,
accounting, finance, and other business areas. At project completion, TCC
expects to have 4310 staff with a staff ratio of 11 per 1,000 DELs. Hiring
and training additional staff to meet the project requirements also pose a
real challenge to TCC, and it appears obvious that the present
administrative constraints to recruitment will have to be relieved for TCC
to cope with future requirements. TCC lacks a personnel management system
with a formalized performance evaluation system and criteria, as well as a
manpower development plan consistent with operations and management
requirements of network expansion and sector development.
4.10      Current training arrangements for engineers and technicians are
satisfactory. TCC ensures specialized staff training through its
Telecommunications College in Amman, which is an intermediate college
that grants a diploma of telecommunications engineering after a university
bachelor's degree. An important feature of the College is the in-service
technicians program, which aims at enabling the engineers and technicians
to cope with new technological developments. The College is well-organized
and has adequate faculty resources to cope with TCC's training
requirements; but needs to modernize its facilities, upgrade its existing
technical training curriculum and introduce certain management courses to
train a larger number of staff in modern digital technology and project
management. The College is currently undergoing an improvement program of
its training capabilities and facilities with the help of the Swedish
Telecommunications Training Center (Teleskolan) and ITU (financed by
UNDP). TCC seems to have no difficulty securing financing for its training
development programs through grauts.
Accounting and Financial Management
4.11      TCC operates on a zero-base cash budget, as other Government
agencies.  Operating and investment expenditures are authorized annually
through the Government's budget law.  At the end of each fiscal year, the
balance of TCC's generated funds less expenditures, is automatically
transferred to the Government budget (para 5.03). Investments are subject
to the Government's five-year plans. At its own initiative, however, TCC
established a parallel system of commercial accounts. Independently
audited commercial accounts are available for 1981 up to 1986.
4.12      The accounting function has been recently reinforced by
appointing an Assistant Director General for Finance and qualified senior
accountants from the private sector. While this represents a major step



- 21 -
towards reorienting and strengthening the accounting practice at TCC, the
critical need still exists for the development of a modern computerized
analytical accounting system, which would allow TCC to assess the
productivity of its organizational units and the profitability of various
servLces in addition to providing managers with key financial information
for effective decision making. Presently, the accounting unit does not
possess or have access to computer facilities and its procedures are those
of a government agency. As part of the institutional development plan, TCC
will develop and introduce a modern analytical accounting system (para 4.18
(c)).
4.13      TCC's financial function is not organized and managed as it
should be in a commercially-oriented service corporation. The commercial
accounts, which are prepared only once a year, are not being used as a
regular management tool for either performance measurement, planning or
control. TCC had incurred significant exchange losses (para 5.09) because
it had neither the authority nor the internal expertise to hedge against
foreign exchange risks. Project financing is arranged through the Ministry
of Planning. Cash management is non-existent despite the fact that TCC has
been a major source of funds, and internal cash generation is expected to
further increase during the proposed project period (para 5.13). In order
for TCC to function as a business entity, it should develop its own
financial management capabilities in addition to effective accounting
systems. The question of introducing a treasury function will be explored
as part of the sector commercialization and organizational studies
(para 4.18 (c)).
External Auditing
4.14      TCC has annual audits of its accounts performed by qualified
external auditors, since 1981. In previous years some delays were
experienced in the preparation and auditing of TCC's commercial amounts
which should be alleviated with the recent appointment of new management
(para 4.12). During negotiations, assurances were obtained that TCC will
furnish audited financial statements to the Bank, including an audit report
of the Special Account, within six months after the end 'S vaok fi-I yea
[para 7.01 (e)j.
Data Processing
4.15      TCC does not have its own computer facilities but utilizes
instead the computer center of the Royal Scientific Society. Consequently,
processing telephone applications and connecting new subscribers lag behind
exchange and cable network construction and result in low capacity
utilization for some exchanges. Monitoring and reporting data for
operations and customer service are fragmented and not regularly collected
and processed. Furthermore, the reliance on the services of an external
computer center sometimes causes delays in processing telephone bills
(issued monthly) and hinders monitoring of payments and accounts
receivable. For TCC to be able to modernize its management functions, it
should acquire its own computers and have control over the development of



- 22 -
application software systems to ensure relevance to its specific
operational and management needs. The project includes US$2.1 million, to
be financed by the Bank, for the acquisition and development of computer
systems (para 3.05).
Management Information Systems
4.16      TCC's management reporting is fragmented and there is no formal
structure for information flow. The concept of management with
information; creating a management data base, organizing data collection,
flow and processing to support decision making for operations and
management is still a novelty to TCC. The difficulty of developing
effective management information systems is compounded with the
unavailability of computer resources. A study for the development of an
integrated management information system will be conducted in the framework
of TCC's institutional development plan (para 4.18 (d)). The objectives
and design of such system would be linked to TCC's reorganization plan.
Institutional Development
4.17      In parallel with sector restructuring, efforts should be directed
towards the reorientation of the management culture of TCC and streamlining
its operational and management functions along commercial lines. The Bank
has worked closely with TCC to formulate a comprehensive institutional
developmeut plan, which would be undertaken during project implementation,
to enable TCC to cope with sector requirements. The main objectives of the
above mentioned plan are: (1) to allow TCC to function as an efficient and
effective commercial enterprise; and (2) to achieve the objectives of its
1988-92 investment program. Such objectives could be more effectively
realized by granting TCC full administrative and financial autonomy. The
sector restructuring study and the institutional development plan are
closely interrelated and hence should be jointly implemented and well
coordinated.

Terms of reference, which have been agreed with the Bank, are listed in
Annex 11, and action plans for implementation and review of recommendations
are given in Annex 12.
Technical Assistance
4.19      About US$3.0 million has been allocated within the Loan to cover
the full costs of cousultaucy services on sector restructuring and
institutional development. The technical assistance program covers two
principle sets of studies: sector reform and inastitutional development.
4.20      The sector reform studies relate to sector restructuring aud
tariff studies, which would require the involvement of both the Government
and TCC. During negotiations assurances were obtained that TCC will: (i)
take all measures necessary to ensure that the sector restructuring and
tariff studies shall be completed and a copy thereof furnished to the Bank
by July 31, 1989; (ii) carry out a mid-term review of the studies with the
Government and the Banuk by April 30, i989; and (iii) following completion
of the studies, the Goverument, the Bank and TCC will exchange views on the
studies' recommendations and TCC will, on the basis of said exchange of
views, carry out a Sector Reform Program approved by the Government, in
accordance with the following schedule: tariff restructuring and
adjustment by January 31, 1990, and sector commercialization by July 31,
1990 [para 7.01(f)].
4.21.     The iustitutional development studies focus on improving TCC's
organization, management functions and manpower skills. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that TCC will: (i) undertake all
studies on institutional development under terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank, and in accordance with the implementation schedule at Annex 12;
(ii) furnish to the Bank quarterly progress reports and conduct semi-aunual
reviews with the Government and the Bank on interim results of the studies;
and (iii) following completion of the studies, exchange views with the
Government and the Bank on the studies' recomendations, and on the basis
of such recommendations and exchange of views, prepare a Management
De-alopiaeu.t Prcgr:? i and complete the implementation of said Program by
October 31, 1991 [para .1 0i
4.512     The Governme'.t has a key role to play in achieving sector
commercialization, and to a cercain extaint ...n the instituttioal eavelopmeDt
of TCC. Hence, assurances were obtained during negotiations from tLe
Government that it will take all necessary measures for carrying out the
Sector Reform Program and the Management Development Program, after
exchanging views with the Bank on the studies' recommendations
[para 7.01 (J)].

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
5.01      TCC operates on a zero-base cash budget, as other Government
agencies. Operating and investment expenditures are authorized annually
through the Government's budget law. At the end of each fiscal year, the
balance of TCC's generated funds less expenditures, is automatically
transferred to Government's budget. Investments are subject to the
Government's five-year plans. At its own initiative, however, TCC
established a parallel system of commercial accounts. Independently
audited commercial accounts are available for 1981 up to 1986.
5.02      Table 5.1 summarizes TCC's financial results during 1982-86.  TCC
has been a profitable enterprise, capable of sustaining fast growth without
recourse to Government funds for either operation or investment, and with
reasonable borrowing requirements. On average TCC achieved 28% annual rate
of return on net assets in service based on historical value.  This is
high, partly because TCC pays no income taxes.  With an assumed 35% tax
rate2/, the average rate of return would drop to 19%, which compares well

with other telecommunications enterprises in the developing world. Assets
were last revalued in 1976, but this does not materially change the
conclusion because TCC's assets are likely to be overvalued. Until
recently TCC had mainly relied for expansion on turnkey contracts financed
through tied and bilateral credits which resulted in high investment costs.
5.03      During 1982-86, TCC financed about 63% of investments for
expansion from internally generated funds (after debt service) and was able
to make payments to the Government equivalent to about 28% of net income.
The rate of transfers to the Government by TCC falls short of the average
corporate tax rate in Jordan. But this does not alter the profitability
picture of TCC since it has maintained a debt leverage ratio lower than
40%, implying that most of TCC's generated cash flow has been retained for
investment.
5.04      As a measure of TCC's efficiency, direct cash operating cost per
DEL had been maintained at 25% of revenue per DEL, which is satisfactory.
Revenue per DEL in real terms remained almost the same until 1986, after
which telephone usage started slowing down with the economy. Operating
ratio had been consistently below 40% with personnel costs accounting for
60% of total operating expenses.
5.05      As of end 1986, the breakdown of TCC's total telephone revenues
was as follows: (a) international services (71%); (b) installation fees
(12%); (c) rental fees (12%); and (d) local calls (5%). International
revenues have so far constituted the bulk of telephone revenues but are
likely not to increase as in the past due to economic downturn in
neighbouring countries and return of many Jordanian workers from abroad.
Revenues from local calls have been minimal because subscribers have been
entitled to 1,000 free local calls whose charges are presumably included
within a rental fee of JD 27 per DEL. Beginning 1987, the number of free
calls was increased to 2,000 and international rates were decreased on
average by 28%. Subscription rates are quite high averaging JD 130 per
DEL. Telex revenues as a percentage of total operating revenues have

Present Position
5.06      Table 5.2 shows the balance sheet as of December 31, 1986 and
that of 1982 for comparison. The figures show that gross fixed assets
tripled in value over a four-year period which reflects TCC's very rapid
expansion. By contrast, the debt/debt+equity ratio had only increased from
24% to 41%, implying that TCC had self-financed a good portion of its
investments. The current ratio of 2.00 is satisfactory provided TCC's
receivables are solvent (para 5.08). Current assets consist almost
entirely of accounts receivables (85%). Accounts payable consist mainly of
amounts payable to suppliers/contractors and current portions of long-term
debt.
Accounts Receivable
5.07      Telecommunications accounts receivable as of end October 1987,
were an estimated JD 21 million (or 7 months of billing), of which
JD 1.2 million were attributed to telex services. Government's share was a
mere JD 1.6 million reflecting no serious Government arrears problem. A
preliminary accounts receivable aging schedule (Table 5.3) shows that
receivables accumulated during 1987 correspond to 25% of billing (3
months), which is reasonable. This figure is mostly due to delays of up to
3 months in the issue, distribution and accounting of telephone bills of
the Regions. The problem is less acute in the Greater Ammei area where TCC
follows a monthly billing cycle and where the collection rate in 1987 had
been 85-90%.

5.08      Accounts receivables of 1986 and before (JD 10.7 million) make up
over 50% of total receivables, which represent a serious financial concern
for TCC. Beginning in 1988, TCC has started implementing new billing and



- 28 -
collection procedures which have already produced favorable results. It is
estimated that at least 50% of receivables prior to 1987 will be collected
under the new procedures. TCC will have to determine the degree of
solvency of whatever remaining unpaid bills and decide on appropriate
write-off policies. Up to end 1986, TCC has written off JD 2 million worth
of bad debt. Further write-offs will be necessary to account for
uncollectable bills, most of which correspond to business closures caused
by the slowdown of the economy in Jordan and in neighboring oil countries.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that TCC will furnish to the
Bank, by end December 1988, a detailed aging schedule of accounts
receivable and will implement a plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to
provision for all outstanding bad debt over the project period [para
7.01(h)]. For the purpose of financial projections, it was conservatively
assumed that the whole JD 10.7 million that date back to 1986 and before
would be written off to arrive at a receivables level of 90 days of billing
in 1992.
Foreign Exchange
5.09      TCC's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has been drastic
over the past few years. The previous investment program had been financed
mainly through bilateral and mixed credits denominated in Japanese Yen and
French Francs. The appreciation of both currencies vis-a-vis the Jordanian
dinar has caused major losses in current accounts and expenditures as well
as inflating TCC's outstanding long-term debt. The cumulative foreign
exchange losses during 1982-86 were JD 4.7 million and the value
appreciation of long-term debt was JD 12 million. The exchange losses have
been absorbed by TCC although it has been the responsbility of the central
monetary authorities to manage TCC's foreign exchange exposure as part of
the country's overall cash and debt management. If TCC is to become
financially autonomous and managed as a business entity, it would have to
develop its own in-house treasury capabilities in order to hedge against
future exchange risks and manage effectively its cash and debt portfolios
(paras 4.04 and 4.18).
Future Performance and Finances
5.10      There are three main factors that distinguish past financial
results from future performance. First, future investment unit costs are
expected to decrease substantially (almost by half what was incurred during
the previous program) as TCC shifts towards more competitive procurement
and financing strategies. Second, the expected change in Jordan's economic
structure is likely to cause major shifts in demand patterns and levels for
telecommunications services. Operating revenue per DEL is expected to drop
in nominal terms from JD 250 in 1986 to JD 212 in 1989 and then remain at
the same level until 1992. Third, TCC is expected to maintain, and even
enhance, its efficiency by lowering its direct cash operating cost in
nominal terms from JD 60 per DEL in 1987 to JD 55 per DEL in 1992. This
would be achieved through a reduction in staffing per subscriber line and
increasing staff productivity with the use of new digital technology. The



- 29 -
net result would be an increase in overall internal cash generatica
(para 5.13). Key projected financial indicators are summarized it.

5.12      Despite substantial investments during the project period, almost
doubling network size, the financial indicators would remain satisfactory.
The operating ratio would stabilize at around 55%. Rate of return on net
fixed assets in service would decrease in the project's early stage because
of anticipated decline in international revenues, but then would increase
to 20% in 1992. Debt service coverage would be adequate at over 3.0
times. The debt/debt + equity ratio would remain at less than 50%,
with the assumption that TCC would only retain the minimum funds required
for maintaining a current ratio above 2.0 times. During the project
period, TCC would generate cash flow in excess of internal financing
requirements, available for transfers to the Government, equivalent to 85%
of net income.
5.13      Sources and applirations of funds during the project
implementation period are summarized in Table 5.5. TCC's projected capital

structure and the corresponding funds flow were based on the proposed
project financing plan (para 3.08). Interest rates and terms for the
cofinancing component were considered to be comparable to those of the
Bank. Interest rates for export and mixed credits were conservatively
estimated at 5.0%. Under the above assumptions, TCC would achieve an
internal cash generation averaging 145%, thus exceeding construction
requirements by a considerable margin.

Hence, TCC should be able to finance all local costs relating to its
investment program, including indirect foreign exchange, and make transfers
to the Government of JD 96 million. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that TCC will achieve a net internal cash generation not less than
50% of investment expenditures on a moving three year average basis in any
one year during the project implementation period [para 7.01 (i)3.

VI. ECONOHIC ANALYSIS
Benefits
6.01      Benefits from the proposed project will reach most sectors of
Jordan's economy and will be felt throughout business and Government. A
direct benefit would be increased efficiency and productivity of the
telecommunications sector, achieved through sector commercialization and
institution building of the operating entity, which should reduce
investment and operating cosst and increase resource transfers to the
Government.
6.02      For business, improved telecommunications will enchance
management efficiency, improve coordination of economic activities and so
facilitate increased business productivity.  This will provide invaluable
support to initiatives to strengthen Jordan's economic growth through
developing a wider industrial base for export-oriented goods and technical
services. In particular, stimulation of the financial intermediary sector
and other segments of the services sector is highly dependent on the
availability of modern and efficient information and communications systems
(para 2.14). The expansion and improvement of telecommunications services
will directly and indirectly assist in absorbing the returning emigrant
workers and in creating new employment (TCC is expected to add 1000
employees during project implementation) for a growing population
characterized by excess supply of university graduates.
6.03      For rural communities, improved access to service would
facilitate integration of rural areas with the rest of the economy, improve
the efficiency of production and marketing of agricultural produce, and
support the growth of small village-based businesses. Telecommunications
would also support the extension and enhancement of health, education,
government administration and other services to rural areas, which is a
major Gover:nment objective.
6.04      For the Government itself, the proposed project would provide
three main benefits. First, the project would facilitate improvements in
the efficiency of Government administration in a way similar to
improvements in business efficiency. Second, improvements in the structure
of TCC's tariffs (para 6.06) would improve the efriciency of resource use
within the sector through improving the structure of subscriber demand in
relation to resource costs. Finally, revenues that would be generated from
investments included in the project would mobilize substantial domestic
resources for Government at a time of growing budgetary constraints.
Tariffs and Pricing Policies
6.05      Telecommunications tariffs as of end 1987, are summarized in
Annex 15. Tariff overall levels are sufficient to provide an operating
profit and cash level (para 5.12) to satisfy cash flow and rate of return
requirements (paras 3.08 and 6.10) and to transfer funds to the Government
while maintaining adequate liquidity positions (para 5.13). Tariffs were



- 32 -
reviewed in 1983, and in early 1987. International tariffs were
arbitrarily reduced in 1987 on average by 28X since they were considered
high by international standards. This would require an increase of almost
40% in international traffic to make up for the decrease in tariffs. As
international calls dominate the revenues of TCC, a detailed demand and
usage analysis should have been carried out prior to the tariff level
changes.
6.06      The structure of tariffs and the policy for establishing pricing
levels have many discrepancies (para 5.05) and should be refocussed towards
meeting the national socio-economic objectives, demand and economic costs
of services. The current tariff structure provides 2,000 free local calls
for up to 6 minutes each. This high level of free calls distorts usage
patterns, particularly since there is no analysis of median call length to
establish the validity of the six-minute free call duration or the number
of free calls. Telephone usage revenues for TCC are heavily distorted
towards international services with these being about 90% of total usage
revenues, (excluding opportunity values of free calls imbedded in the
rental fee). Installation fees, which represent 40% of domestic revenues
and 16% total revenues, are a non-recurring annual revenue and are
dependent upon network expansion. Following completion of the proposed
investment program, network expansion will drop off considerably and
heavily reduce this revenue source. Pricing of leased circuits and
value-added services is substantially above economic costs, thus adversely
affecting demand for specialized services. All of the above, particularly
in light of the planned network expansion, implies the necessity for
reviewing pricing policies, tariff structure and levels. As part of the
institutional development and sector reform, TCC will carry out a tariff
study, under terms of reference approved by the Bank, and will agree on the
implementation of tariff adjustments necessary for TCC to meet the
financial requirements contained in the Performance Indicators
(para 4.18 (f)). The study's terms of reference are given in Annex 11.
Fiscal Impact
6.07      There is no formal nrocess of resource transfer from TCC to the
Government. TCC pays no customs duties, taxes or dividends; a situation
which is liable to change in case TCC is fully commercialized.
Nevertheless, TCC is taxed indirectly where all generated funds in excess
of internal financing of investment expenditures are automatically retained
by the Government at the end of each fiscal year (para 5.03). Transfers
from TCC to the Government in the last two years amounted to almost 60% of
net income.
6.08      During the project implementation period, TCC is expected to
generate a cash surplus of JD 96 million (equivalent to 85% of net income)
in excess of investment financing requirements, which can be made available
for Government use (para 5.13). What is lacking, however, is a formal
policy that would govern resource transfer from TCC and the sector (in case
private participation is allowed for the provision of certain specialized
services under sector commercialization) to the Government. Such policy



- 33 -
issues as taxation of TCC, TCC's financial structure as a business
operating entity, and TCC's fiscal relations with the Government will be
tackled in the proposed sector restructuring study (para 4.04).
Least Cost Solution
6.09      The project (para 3.04) repre, its the least cost solution for
providing the service levels planned in using modern digital technology
already introduced in the telecommunications network. The timing and
dimensioning of various elements in the system as well as the design and
comparisons of alternative network configurations are the result of careful
studies made by TCC in close cooperation with retained engineering
consultants. These technico-economic studies are based on world-wide
recognized engineering practices.
Return on Investment
6.10      The internal financial rate of return on TCC's 1988-92
investments is 25% (Annex 6). The quantifiable economic rate of return is
about 31%. These estimates understate total project benefits, since they
do not take into account t1 e total consumer surplus or the substantial
secondary benefits accruing to the economy from improved
telecommunications.
Risks
6.11      The project's main risks are the potential delays in the
identification, formulation and implementation of sector and institutional
reforms. The Government, the Bank and TCC will agree on appropriate action
programs and on a monitoring system to ensure effective implementation.
The conviction and commitment demonstrated by the Government and TCC to the
proposed sector restructuring and institutional development plans indicate
that this risk is manageable. On the physical side, there are no unusual
risks associated with the project. With the help of experienced
consultants, the project has been adequately planned and the inputs
required for various project components have been properly determined and
timed. The same consultants have been retained to assist in project
implementation, iriproving operations management and in training. Staff
requirements for project implementation and network operations have been
defined, agreed by the Bank and are expected to be available as required.
Invitations to bid for goods to be financed by the Bank have been issued.
Tender documents for the other main components of the project, namely
switching and transmission, have been reviewed by the Bank and are expected
to be issued before Board presentation. Potential cofinanciers have been
identified and negotiations are underway. One source of uncertainty may be
due to slower economic growth in Jordan than anticipated and its potential
impact on demand patterns and levels for telecommunications service
(para 2.03). Another source of risk may arise out of delayea physical
implementation due to delays in the execution of buildings, civil works,



- 34 -
and/or installation of plant and equipment. A sensitivity test on the rate
of return (Annex 16) indicates that a 20% reduction In benefits would
reduce the estimated economic rate of return to 26%. Furthermore, a
two-year delay in benefits but with no postponement of costs would reduce
the estimated economic rate of return to 19%. A combination of a 20%
increase in capital expenditures and operating costs combined with a 20%
reduction in revenues, which is extremely unlikely, would reduce the
estimated economic rate of return from 31% to 20%.
Environmental and Health Effects
6.12      The proposed project is expected to have no adverse environmental
and health effects. On the contrary, more efficient use of
telecommunications would substitute for personal transportation and
correspondingly reduce environmental pollution and promote energy
conservation. In addition, improved telecommunications services would
facilitate dispersion of health services and emergency care.
VII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECO)EUDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, the following assurances were obtained that:
(a) TCC will: (i) consult with the Bank before introducing any
major changes in its investment program, which in the
aggregate would involve more than 10% of the total amount of
investments planned for the five-year program ; and (ii)
ensure that no such changes will be introduced unless TCC
and the Bank have agreed that these changes are justified
(para 3.03);
(b) TCC shall finalize procurement and cofinancing agreements,
in an aggregate amount of about US$80.0 million, to finance
switching, transmission and other project components to be
procured under price and terms bidding before June 30, 1989

following completion of the studies' recommendations, and on
the basis of such recommendations and exchange of views,
prepare a Management Development Program and complete the
implementation of said Program by October 31, 1991
(para 4.21);
(h) TCC will furnish to the Bank, by end December 1988, a
detailed aging schedule of accounts receivable and will
implement a plan, satisfactory to the Bank, to provision
over the project period for all outstanding bad debt
(para 5.08); and
(i)  TCC will achieve a net internal -ash generation not less
than 50% of investment expenditures on a moving three year
average basis in any one year during the project
implementation period (para 5.13).
In addition, assurances were obtained from the Government that:
(j) The Government will take all necessary measures for carrying
out the Sector Reform Program and the Management Development
Program, after exchanging views with the Bank on the
studies' recommendations (para 4.22).

JORDAN TELECON(DNICATIONS CORPORATION (TCC)
A TELCOHMMDUICATIONS PROJECT
FORECAST DEM       AND DEL GROWTH
1.        Forecasts of demand have been carried out by consultants and as part
of the revision of the Development Plan. These forecasts have focussed on the
growth in the demand for connection to the national network for telephone
service, that is, the number of direct exchange lines (DELs). Other elements
in the demand that affect network planning are the number of leased circuits,
and the traffic generated per connection.
2.        Demand projections have been based on a standard forecasting model
that is commonly used in the telecommunications industry. Demand is measured
as the sum of connections, the waiting list for connection and suppressed
demand. At the start of the planning period, these elements of demand totalled
just above 300,000:
DEL Connections        203,000
Waiting List            84,800
Suppressed Demand       15,000
Total Demand      302,800
The figure for suppressed demand is probably underestimated, as customers are
unlikely to register their interest in connection in areas not yet linked to
the network. Taking the demand estimate at face value, the proportion of
demand satisfied is 67%.
3.        The growth in demand for exchange lines date can be approximated by
an exponential curve. However, the use of a simple exponential curve as a
forecasting method will eventually lead to overoptimistic projections as the
penetration of exchange lines increases. Demand is therefore related to basic
parameters: the rate of economic growth and the rate of growth and distribution
of population.
4.        In principle, the relative price of telecommunication services is
also relevantl/. In the forecasting work under review, no account has been
1/ The standard forecasting model for DEL demand is:
Demand Growth = Constant + b.GDP per capita + c.Popn Growth + d.Relative
Price bf Telephone Service
where the Constant and the coefficients b, c and d are to be estimated.



-37 -                          ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4
taken of the effect on demand of the expected long term fall in relative price
of telecommunication services and to this extent the demand estimates are
understated. The demand for leased circuits has been particularly suppressed
by high prices charged.
5.        The estimated rate of growth of demand for DELs in the revised
Development Plan is 10% per annum, if the base is taken as total demand as
estimated above. The forecasting model is long term; demand is estimated to
continue to grow at 5.5% to the year 2005. Only the projections for the plan
period to 1992 are reviewed in this Annex. Forecasts for later years are in
any event subject to revision in future planning rounds.
Economic Growth
6.        The ratio of the growth in demand for telephone service to the rate
of growth of GDP per capita is a measure of the income elasticity of demand.
Studies in other countries at varying levels of development and over many years
indicate income elasticity at between 2 and 4. Jordan is likely to be at the
upper end of this range because of the high proportion (over 60%) of the
ecotomy accounted for by services. Demand for telephone service has been shown
to be particularly sensitive to growth rates in the service sector. Direct
measurement of income has not been fully met and estimates of unmet demand are
not reliable.
7.        For the forecast period, an annual average growth rate of GDP of 4%
has been assumed. Jordan's economy is sensitive to events in neighbouring
countries and the rate of economic growth can vary substantially from year to
year. During the last ten years, annual rates of growth have varied from 1 to
11%. On recent trends, 4% is a reasonable estimate which is also consistent
with the Bank's economic projections for Jordan.
Population Growth
8.        Jordan's population has been growing at a rate of 3.5% per annum, and
this is expected to continue for some years, This rapid rate of population
growth is likely to have a complex effect on demand. On the one hand, the rate
of growth of GDP per capita will probably be no more than one per cent per
annum.  On the other hand, the increase of population will contribute to demand
independently of income level.
9.        The combined effect of GDP growth and population growth alone should
be to increase demand by at least 7% per annum (the calculation is as follows:
forecast growth in GDP per capita is 1.1% a year; multiplied by income
elasticity of 4 gives a growth rate of 4.4 from existing population; add
population growth of 3.5% gives a combined growth rate of 7.9%).
Population Distribution
10.       The distribution of population will add to the growth of demand.  As
the predicted penetration rate, and hence demand, increases with the size of
the population centre, the rapid long term growth in population will have a



- 38 -                         ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 4
slightly geared effect on demand. An additional factor tending to increase the
rate of growth of residential demand is the expected fall in the average size
of households.
11.       The base for projections of population distribution is the 1979
Census, which provided data on employment and households. Using this data,
several categories of population centre were identified and separate
penetration rates were projected for each category. Local network planning has
been based on the projections for the year 2005, but the numbers for later
years can be revised once the results of the next Census, to be held in 1989,
are available.
12.       Some 60% of subscribers are located in the Greater Amman area.  The
detailed forecasts for this area substantially affect the national total. The
Master Development Plan for Greater Amman published in 1986 provided a more up
to date basis for projections than was available elsewhere.
13.       Outside Amman, the deterrent effect of high installation fees and the
limited reach of the existing network has surpressed demand. In future, a
higher proportion of expansion will be accounted for by these areas.
14.       The sum of the local area projections of demand corresponded well
with the national total, estimated separately.
Excess Demand
15.       In practice, the growth in the number of DELs will continue to be
supply constrained throughout the plan period. Growth in network capacity is
projected at about 10% per annum to 1992, that is, at the same rate as demand.
The number of connected DELs however is expected to grow at a slightly faster
pace, on average at 14.5% per annum, as a result of the increased proportion of
investment in outside plant during the expansion program 1988-1992.
Conclusions
16.       The forecasts of demand underlying the development plan are
satisfactory. Network expansion and DEL connections are planned to grow at a
rate of 10% and 14.5% per annum over the plan period, respectively.
Examination of underlying economic and demographic projections suggests growth
in demand will be sustained at the rate of 8-10% per annum. This lower, more
robust, estimate will not affect the plan targets because of the overhang of
uanet demand. That is, the planned rate of expansion in the number of DEL
connections will satisfy the demand if demand grows at no more than 9% per
annum. The forecasts for later years will be revised when the results of the
1989 Census of Poupulation are available.

A TIECONIWNIC&TIOK  PROJECT
Description of the Physical Ca-poaents of the Project
General
1.        The proposed project is TCC's 1988-92 investment revised
program. Jordan back-bone long distance transmission routes, including
regional transmission links with neighbouring countries have already been
established under the previous investment programs. Therefore, the
proposed project mainly aims at the development of the local telephone
networks accross the country and at increasing the network penetration into
the less developed rural areas. Under the project, the expansion of the
domestic and international long distance facilities will be consequently
limited to the supply and installation of an additional national and
international transit switching center (NISC), introduction of transit
switching facilities in Irbid, switching and signalling modifications in
the existing exchanges, additional multiplex equipment on the existing
transmission routes to cope with the additional traffic resulting from the
expansion of the telephone subscriber base, and the replacement of a
worn-out satellite earth station antenna.
Existing facilities at the beginning of the project
2.        The first semi-electronic exchanges (SPC analog FETEX-100 of
Fujitsu) were introduced in Jordan in 1979, but in 1984, Jordan entered in
the digital switching era with the introduction of the FETEX 150 of
Fujitsu, Japan and the ElOB from Alcatel, France and the phasing out of the
electro-mechanical switching systems which is now fully completed. As of
February 1988, the total installed switching capacity in the country
amounts to 316,000 lines, 79,000 of which or 25% being of analog SPC
FETEX-100 of Fujitsu and 6,300 or 2% of semi-electronic PENTEX from
Plessey). The 230,700 lines of local digital switching equipment are
divided between ElOB of Alcatel 65% and FETEX-150 35%. The long distance
network is a star centered on the National Switching Center (NSC) located
in Amman. The NSC is a SlOB switch with an installed capacity of 4,500
trunks. The international gateway is also a digital switch of type MT-20
of Thomson, France with an installed capacity of 3,400 trunks of which
about 600 are used on international routes. The domestic long distance
transmission network is predominantly digital with the exception of the
microwave route Amman-Aqaba, which is close to the end of its economic
life.

Technology
3.        The expansion under the proposed project will further increase
the coverage of the country with facilities using the digital technology to
about 85% of the total installed capacity. DigitalisatioA of the network
has the following advantages:
-   the progress in the electronic components technology has
been extraordinary over the last years and the resulting
large-scale integration of circuits enables the production
of relatively low-cost equipment.
-   compared with electromechanical switching systems and analog
transmission systems, digital systems facilitate the
introduction of a large variety of new services as well as
the enhancement and quality improvement of existing
services;
-   another important aspect of digital systems is their
capability to integrate within a single domestic network,
not only the transmission, switching and control functions,
but also to integrate different telecommunications services
and forms of transmission of information which results in
cost reduction;
-   finally, digital technology allows lower cost expansion of
facilities to the rural areas.
The drastic reduction of optical fiber transmission cost has also
made possible to introduce this new technology into the metropolitan
junctions and primary areas networks where justified by the route capacity
and the distance between nodes.
Local Telephone Networks
a) Local Switching
4.        The Amman multi-exchanges area presently accounts for 63% of the
total number of subscribers. Under the proposed project, the balance in
favor of network development outside of the Greater Amman area will
increase.  However, although decreasing to 41% at the end of the project,
the Greater Amman area will still dominate the Jordan network.  Outside of
Amman, the urban networks of the cities of Irbid and Zarqua will become
multi-exchanges areas with the addition of new primary exchanges in Irbid
Shamali and Zarqua Shamali. The telephone networks expansion has been
conceived in such a way that the possibility remaias open for the
introduction of a third digital switching system into the domestic network,
depending on the outcome of the international bidding. In this respect,

all 14 new primary centers totalling 116,832 lines to be created under the
project and 76 small nodes stand-alone exchanges or concentrators totalling
53,008 lines to be linked to them within the new primary exchange areas,
will be awarded following international competitive bidding. Switching
equipment of ten existing switching nodes (9 E1OB RLU's + 1 Fetex 150 RSU)
totalling 21,352 + 6,020 lines which htave to be replaced by newly created
primary centers will have to be relocated within primary exchange areas
whose primary exchange is of the same existing system (FETEX or EOB).
Since equipment of those nodes is installed in containers, the redeployment
should not raise too many difficulties. Expansion within 8 existing
primary exchange areas under the project (7E1OB + 1 FETEX) includes
expansion of 4 primary exchanges by 6,184 lines, 31 small nodes by 18,622
lines and creation of 27 new nodes totalling 18,278 lines. Most of the
switching equipment to be relocated will be used to carry out these
expansions. Extension and modifications of the existing exchanges as well
as redeployment will have to be procured from the original suppliers of the
FETEX and ElOB systems under negotiated contracts. Overall the installed
switching capacity in the country will increase by 185,552 lines, 169,840
of which will be of new equipment purchased under ICB to be located in new
created primary areas, the balance of 15,712 lines results from expansion
of existing switching equipment by 43,084 lines within ElOB and FETEX 150
primary areas, less 27,372 lines of dismantled and relocated existing
equipment. Details regarding the population clusters affected by the
project as well as the list and capacities of the switching nodes to be
created, expanded and redeployed is available in the Project File.
b) Cable Networks
5.        This project component includes expansion of local cable networks
in about 620 cities, towns and villages, representing about 350,000
distributed main cable pairs (MDF) available for immediate and future
cornection of subscribers. This project component comprises civil work
construction of ducts and installation of cable systems, for the primary
and secondary levels of the local distribution networks and also for
inter-exchange junctions in the three multi-exchange areas. The proposed
network expansion is estimated to ilclude about 2,525 km of underground
duct cables, 10,790 km of buried cable and 29,936 km of aerial cable in the
less populated areas. TCC's planning unit designed the duct system
capacity for about 20 years of expansion, the primary and secondary cable
systems for 5 years demand in the metropolitan areas and cities.
c) Transmission
6.        As noted under Para 1 above, the transmission component under the
project is mainly for the creation of new junctions links within the
multi-exchange areas and between the new primary centers and the small
switching nodes attached to them.  Single mode optical fibre cables with 2
or 4 fibre pairs working at the wavelength of 1,300nm and microwave radio



- 45 -
ANNEX 4
Page 4 of 4
links in the 8 or 15 GHz bands are planned to carry either 8 or 34 Mbit/s
on the new routes. On some ex'.sting metallic pair cable routes, there will
be new 2 Mbit/s PCM systems installed. Furthermore, there will be some
extensions by new metallic pair cables to be used for PCM. Overall this
project component comprises 61 short distance microwave links (one hop
sometime using a passive relais) 29 optical fibre rontes totalling 728
pair-km, 37 PCM. cable routes totalling 181 km each with 10 X 2 Mbit/s PCM
systems, and PCM systems expansions on existing PCM cables on improved
pairs of junctions cables. This project component also comprises the
redeployment and extensions of existing transmission routes with Alcatel
and NEC equipment and the supply and installation of surveillance systems
monitoring the alarms and the transmission characteristics of each route.
Long Distance and International
7.        The following items are included in the project to cope with the
traffic increase expected from the network expansion.
(a)  The existing National Switching Center in Amman which has
reached its expansion capacity will have to be supplemented
by the creation of an additional transit center. A national
and international switching center (NISC) will be installed
under the project. The NISC is planned for 450 analog
international circuits and 170 2 Mbit/s digital interfaces
(170 X 30 - 5100 ccts) for national or inte^,national
traffic. A transit function will also be introduced in
Irbid so that the traffic between the Northern pr'Saary areas
will be independent from the NSC's in Amman.
(b) Under the project, system modifications and some expansion
or re-arrangement of the trunk routes are required in the
existing primary exchanges, and in the NSC; increase of
processor capacities, and modification of the R2 signalling
system. Furthermore, TCC has included under the project the
introduction of the CCITT common channel signalling system
Nr7 (C7), and the full synchronization of the digital
network.
(c)  The antenna of the Indian Ocean satellite earth station is
worn out and repair costs without guarantee are excessive.
A new satellite earth station and facilities for digitel
transmission antenna are planned under the project.

JORDAN
JORDAN TBI.CWWNIC&TIONS CORPORATION (TCC)
A TELBCOCINICATIONS PROJECT
PROJECr IMPLERENTATION
Proposed Organization
1.        TCC's present organization is not yet tailored to deal with the
requirements of a substantial expansion program. The set-up of a permanent
program implementation organization is one of the tasks to be undertaken in the
framework of TCC's institutional development. To ease the transition an ad-hoc
organization is proposed which best utilizes the available manpower within TCC,
minimizes the need for consultancy services and which provides a good
environment for the transfer of know-how.
The Project Implementation Organization
2.        The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been organized in two
levels. At the top level is the Project Director (PD) who has overall
responsibility for the implementation and who represents TCC in contractual
matters. At the second level there are Project Managers (PM) who are
responsible for defined portions of the Project Implementation Plan (PIP).
3.        The PD and the PMs make up the line organization of the PIU.  They
will need staff resources in the following areas:
- Technology
- Field Supervision
- Budget control
- Follow-up of quantities, etc.
- Supply management
- Contract administration
- Scheduling and coordination
- Logistics including secretarial services
The resources for field supervision will be allocated to the PMs. The other
resources can be allocated to the PD or the PMs or a combination of both. The
determining factor is the structure of the projects, i.e., the defined portions
of the PIP which is handled by the PMs.



- 52 -
ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 4
4.        This structure is determined largely by the contractual arrangements
which, in their turn, depend on the procurement strategy. TCC's strategy aims
at separate procurement of the different technological components of the
Program. In the following we will assume that the organization of the
Implementation Team will follow the same lines, i.e., a functional type
organization with a Project Manager for each technical discipline.
5.        The Project Director will require staff resources for: a)
registration, filing and monitoring of correspondence with the contractors; b)
budget follow-up and forecasting; c) scheduling and coordination; and d)
legal/commercial contract administration. Specialist staff for common
technologies such as power and air-conditioning may also be attached to the PD.
6.        Each Project Manager will be responsible for one or several
contracts. The field supervision staff will be allocated per contractor. In
!       addition, the PMs will be supported by a number of technical specialists/chief
supervisors. One of their main responsibilities will be to ensure unified
standards for field supervision, acceptance testing and interpretation of
specifications.
TCC Manpower
7.        Qualifications.  The staff has been divided into three categories:
managers, specialist staff and field staff.  The Project Managers need good
qualifications not only technically but also managerially including experience
of dealing with contractors. Other TCC staff need good technical knowledge but
the requirement for management experience is less vital. The field staff must
also have good technical knowledge. This can partly be acquired through
on-the-job training.
8.        Recruitment and Training.  Ideally, the TCC project staff should come
from the operational departments. This may be achievable for switching and
transmisison. However, for outside plant there is a definite lack of qualified
staff for operations so the process will have to be reversed. At the end of
the implementation, the additional staff recruited for the Implementation Team
will be transfered to the operational departments. Recruitment of additional
staff will be required. The specialist staff for outside plant implementation
should come from the design team and the deficit there made up by recruiting
more designers.

9.        Technical training for switching and transmission will be conducted
by the contractors. This training should be subtantially complete before the
first acceptance test.
10        In the case of Outside Plant, additional staff resources are needed.
Considering that OSP is implemented and paid for on the basis of unit rates for
work actually done, there is a need for vigorous follow-up and analysis of
deviations between design and as-built quantities. Installation services and
heavy materials will be procured separately. Staff resources will be needed to
keep track of the material flow and to ensure that deliveries match
requirements. The design work will continue during most of the implementation
period.
11.       Technical training for OSP will have to be arranged by the
Telecommunications College and the Consultants. At least one
design/engineering course similar to the one held in 1987 should be conducted.
The students can be allocated either as designers or as field supervisors. The
ongoing training program for Quality Controllers is a potential source for
field supervisors. The field supervisors will need on-the-job training. This
will be the task of the specialist staff. They will have to spend considerable
time in the field during the early days of the implementation.
12.       It is estimated that the Project Implementation Unit will require 36
staff in 1989 and 48 staff in 1990 and 1991. From mid-1991 to mid-1992 staff
requirement is expected to decrease to about 34 and toward the end of the
project PIU fuaction and staff will be progressively integrated into the
permanent organization. PIU staff will be recruited either from within the
present organization or from outside. To meet the needs of PIU, TCC will have
to recruit and train 36 staff in 1988 and 12 in 1989.

project is to support the Government and TCC in the commercialization of
the telecommunications sector. The principal objectives are to: improve
the overall regulatory, financial and institutional framework for the
sector and TCC's operatxons; rationalize TCC's organlizational structure and
upgrade its management capabilities and manpower skills; and revise tariffs
structure and levels including the development of pricing models. The
technical assistance program has two main elements: (a) a sector
restructuring study and a tariffs review; and (b) an institutional
development plan covering key management areas; namely, organization and
management, personnel and human resource development, accounting and
financial systems, store and inventory management systems, management
information systems and computerization.
Sector Restructuring

Government and TCC to carry out agreed recommendations;
Tariffs
4.        Objective: To develop principles and procedures to guide the
formulation of an appropriate level and structure of tariffs for
telecommunication services in Jordan; to devise analytical tariff models
incorporating taese principles; to apply the models to the present tariffs
and to recommend changes that meet national objectives in a way that is
consistent with the strategy of commercialization.
5.        Main Tasks:
(a)   Demand - assess the characteristics of government, business
and residential demand for telecommunlications services and
the sensitivity of demand to changes in prices charged.
(b)   Usage - review data on the development of the national
telecommunlications network, the level and pattern of use of
services and revenues. Particular emphasis should be placed
on analysis of peak traffic periods, the distribution of
usage among customer groups and the pattern of international
traffic.

(c)   Costs - identify the incremental costs of system expansion
in relation to changes in technology and of additions to
traffic carrying capacity in and between Amman, other urban
and routing centres and rural areas.
(d)   International services - review the level of collection and
settlement rates for international services taking into
account the balance of incoming and outgoing traffic, the
number and routing of circuits and circuit occupancy.
(e)   National Development and Social Considerations - an analysis
should be made linking national economic development plans,
sectorial objectives and the role of tariff policy.

TCC's continued viability as a commercially autonomous
entity able to finance expansion while recognizing Jordan's
need for resource mobilization;
(g)   Organizational Aspects  - assess the process for tariff
review and for approval of tariff changes, and examine the
role and constitution of a tariff review committee, the
timing and methodology of implementing tariff adjustments,
and the staffing requirement of a tariff section with TCC;
(h)   Results - the study should result in a set of
recommendations for a tariff policy, guidelines for the
revision for telecommunication services with implications
for revenues, fir_acial performance and resource transfer to
Government. The study should also produce an analytical,
computer-based, model of tariffs capable of being used with
TCC for the systematic review and adjustment of tariffs.

A TELECOIWNICATIOES PROJECT
Action Plans for Sector Restructuring and Institutional Developuent
1.        The list of studies under the project's techuical assistance
component, the responsibility for each and an agreed implementation
schedule are tabulated on page 2 of this Annex.
2.        From an implementation standpoint, the studies will be grouped in
two categories; sector reform and institutional development.
(a) Sector reform studies: These are the sector restructuring
and tariff studies which would require the involvement of
both the Government and TCC. Upon the completion of the
studies, the Government, the Bank and TCC would review the
studies' recommendations and agree on a "Sector Reform
Program" and a corresponding implementation action plans by
end August 1989. A mid-term review would be carried out in
April 1989.
(b) Institutional development studies: TCC would have the
responsibility for all studies related to the development of
its organization, manpower skills and management functions.
All studies under this category would be designed to be
carried out in two broad phases; development and
implementation. This approach would allow the Bank and TCC
to plan and agree jointly on appropriate management programs
at the end of the development phase that could be realized
during project implementatiou. The Bank would review
regularly with TCC the consultancy work based on quarterly
progress reports. By end October 1989, an agreement would
be reached on a comprehensive "Management Development
Program" and implementation action plans. Manpower
allocations and implementation schedules would be adjusted
according to the results of the initial development stage.
3.        The studies' term of reference (Annex 11) have been finalized and
agreed with the Bank. To ensure that both the sector commercialization and
institutional development plans are carried out in accordance with the
agreed action plans, letters of invitation to a short list of qualified
consulting firms, approved by the Bank, will be issued by end May and
contracts awarded in September, 1988.

Notes and Assauptions for the Financial Forecasts, 1988-92
Detailed traffic and operating statistics which form the basis for
these forecasts are shown on page 4 of this Annex. Tariffs are maintained at
the same levels as in 1987 (Annex 15).  nomestic traffic per line is assumed to
decrease with network expansion.  Inte    ional traffic is increased at 5% per
year to account for the 28% decrease i.   -ernational tariffs in 1987, which
would require an effective increase it  nternational calls of 40% to arrive at
the same revenue level. The number (f connected telex lines are assumed to
grow at a modest rate of 5%, but telex use is expected to decrease at 3%.
Where no major change is expected, financial projections represent
extrapolations of historical data.
I. INCOME STATEMENTS
(A) Operating Revenues
Telephonle and Telex - Traffic and subscription revenues are
calculated by multiplying the revenue per DEL times the average
number of DEL in service. Installation revenues are calculated on
the basis of additional lines installed. All details are given in
the table at the end of this Annex.
Leased Circuits - Forecast to increase at 10% per annum.
International Settlements - Forecast to decrease by 5% per annum as a
result of increased international tariffs which will adversely affect
outgoing traffic.

of international events. Assumed to increase at 5% per annum.

A TULZCOIENIC*fONS PROJECT
Return on lavestuer
1.        The project covers TCC's entire investment program for the period
1988-1992. The benefit period of the project extends from 1988 to 2008,
when on average the equipment installed under the project is expected to
have completed its useful life. Operating costs attributed to the project
are the costs of the new telephone and telex lines that would be connected,
less the operating cost savings realised on existing lines. Benefits
attributed to the project are the telephone and telex traffic on the new
lines that would be connected and the higher growth (or decline) in traffic
on exsitiag lines. From 1993 on, operating costs and benefits relating to
the project are assumed to remain constant. Maintenance and replacement
costs for the period 1988-2008 are included in operating costs. No
residual values of fixed assets have been taken into account as their
present value in real terms would be minimal.
2.        A summary of the cost and benefit streams is given below in
JD million. All reveunes and costs have been deflated to bring them to
their comparable 1988 price levels.

3.        The internal rate of return of the above financial streams is
25%. However, this calculation understates benefits that would be derived
from TCC's investment program. The calculation does not take into account
consumer surplus and indirect and external benefits that would be received
by non-users of telecommunications services. A portion of the consumer
surplus that would be realized has been estimated by assuming that: (a)
service demands by new subscribers on average are similar to demands of
existing subscribers; and (b) existing and new subscribers will be willing
to pay for telecommunications services the same prices in real terms as
they are paying at present. Based on these assumptions, the minimum
estimate of the economic rate of return of TCC's investments between 1988
and 1992 is 31%.
4.        A sensitivity analysis was made of the economic rate of return
with the following results:
20% increase in capital expenditures      -    26%
20% increase in operating expenditures   -    30%
20% decrease in operating revenues        -    26%
Combination of the above                  -    20%
Two years delay in benefits               -    19%
