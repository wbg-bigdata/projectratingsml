                   (i.e., investors and lenders) by covering only those

                   risks that the market cannot bear.              For partial

                   credit     guarantees,       this      generally   means

                   guaranteeing the later maturities (in the case of a

                   bond, this means covering repayment at maturity).

                   The extent of risk sharing for a bond issue backed

                   by the Bank's partial credit guarantee can be

                   measured by taking the present value of the

                   bond's cash flows and tends to be a reflection of

                   the market's perception of the creditworthiness of

                   the country in question. In the case of the NPC

                   issue, the present value of the Bank's put option

                   on principal is about 24% of the present value of
