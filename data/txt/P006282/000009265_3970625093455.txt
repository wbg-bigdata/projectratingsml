BRAZIL - VALEFERTIL FERTILIZER PROJECT (LOAN 1411-BR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
On April 19, 1977 the Bank approved a loan of US$82.0 million
equivalent to Fertilizantes Vale do Rio Grande S.A. (VALEFERTIL) to assist
in the financing of the VALEFERTIL Fertilizer Project (Loan 1411-BR). The
loan was guaranteed by the Government of Brazil. In January 1979, with the
agreement of the Bank, the Project ownership was transferred to
Fertilizantes Fosfatados S.A. (FOSFERTIL), an affiliate company of
PETROFERTIL. As a consequence of the transfer, the repayment and all other
obl.gations under the Loan Agreement were assumed by FOSFERTIL. At the
borrower's request, a total of US$27.0 million was cancelled as of March
1980, due to an increased share of equipment obtained by procurement
limited to Brazilian suppliers.
Following successful project commissioning, IND Staff visited
Brazil in August 1981 for the preparation of the Project Completion Report
CPCR) and had discussions with the Government, PETROFERTIL and FOSFERTIL,
the Project implementing agency.   This report reflects the findings of
the mission as well as a review of the project files and related documents.
Copies of the PCR were sent to the Borrowers who had
no comments.    This project was not audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

BRAZIL - VALFPERTIL FERTILIZER PROJECT (LOAN 1411-BR)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Brazilts agricultural policy aims to increase agricultural output
by expanding the area under cultivation and using intensive agricultural
practices supported by extension programs, increased fertilizer
application, better credit availability and use of improved seeds. In this
context the Government encouraged domestic production of fertilizers and to
make increasing use of local phosphate deposits, thus ensuring a reliable
supply of phosphate fertilizers less subject to wide price fluctuations of
the internat'onal market (paras 1.01 - 1.04).
2.        The Project comprises processing facilities near Uberaba (Minas
Gerais) for the production of 330,000 tpy of monoammonium phosphate (MAP)
and 340,000 tpy triple superphosphate (TSP)-built and operated by
Fertilizantes Vale do Rio Grande (VALEFERTIL). The Project facilities were
started-up in July 1980, 11 months behind the original schedule.
Commiss-ioning and start-up of the plant were carried out smoothly and units
generally exceeded their rated capacity (paras 1.05 and 3.18).
3.       Total Project cost at appraisal was estimated at US$294.0
million. Although Project completion was delayed by 11 months actual cost
was US$308.6 million - only about 5% above target, since the project
sponsor was able to offset most of the cost increases (e.g. site
development, Projact impleuencation) through substantially lower cost for
delivered equipment and supplies. Of the total Bank loan of US$82.0
million, only US$55.0 million were utilized. This was mainly the result of
an increase in local procurement of equipment and supplies (70%). The
large share of local supplies could have led to a delay in start-up
(equipment failures/inadequacies during testing and coiuissioning) if
the project completion was not delayed for other reasons. The performance
of the borrower's project management was generally satisfactory. Services
provided by consultants largely met the expectations (paras 3.07 - 3.24).
4.        In the wake of the Brazilian recession, market constraints
limited capacity utilization to 59% and 68% during the two initial
operating years.  Subsequently, however, operating level rose close to
rated capacity (para 4.07).
5.        The financial rate of return (FRR) for the Project is now
estimated at 23% compared to the appraisal estimate of 14%. The increase
in FRR is mainly due to a lower transfer price of rock phosphate. The
economic rate of return is now estimated at 17% against 22% at the time of
appraisal. The decline is mainly due to variations in the price
assumptions for inputs and products between the time of appraisal and now.



The net annual foreign exchange savings from the Project are estimated to
be about US$142 million. In addition, the Project has resulted in
substantial technology transfer to Brazilian firms (paras 5.01 - 6.05).
6.        The Bank worked closely with VALEFERTIL in formulating and
implementing the project financing arrangement which included in addition
to the Bank financing, the use of suppliers' credit and commercial bank
financing to fund the project foreign exchange requirements.  At the
suggestion of the Bank, VALEFERTIL used consultant assistance in developing
the corporate and works financial systems and in implementing and operating
the project.  The VALEFERTIL project is a good example of a project in
which dedicated work by the project management aided by the Bank support
has resulted in a successful project meeting its economic objectives (paras
7.01 - 8.04).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL - VALE    IL FERTI LIR PROJECT
(LOAN 1411-BR)
I.  INTRODUCTION
1.01      Brazil's agricultural policy aims to increase agricultural output
to make Brazil one of the world's foremost producers and exporters of
agricultural commodities.  Brazil plans to achieve this objective both by
expanding the area under cultivation and with increased productivity
of the existing areas by using intensive agricultural practices supported
by extension programs, increased fertilizer application, better credit
availability and use of improved seeds. As part of the above agricultural
policy, Brazil has embarked on several fertilizer projects to increase
domestic availability of fertilizers. The Bank has participated in three
large fertilizer projects in Brazil-the Valefertil fertilizer project near
Uberaba (Minas Gerais); the Ammonia-Urea complex in Sergipe (Salvador) and
the fuel oil based ammonia-urea project near Araucaria (Parana).
1.02      While the level of fertilizer application showed litt e growth
till 1966, agricultural programs adopted in the mid-sixties stimulated
rapid growth averaging 35Z annually through 1972. The consumption increase
was only modest during 1973 to 1975 due to sharp increase in international
prices. Fertilizer nutrient consumption increased on the average annually
by about 16 percent during 1975 to 1980. The 1981 estimated fertilizer
consumption was about 20% below the previous year's level due to (i)
changes in agricultural credit policy (reduced credit availability and
higher interest rates), (ii) high opening inventory of fertilizers with the
farmers and the retailers, (iii) substantial fertilizer price increases
averaging over 96% per annum while prices of major crops such as coffee,
soyabeans, wheat and malze did not increase to the same level and (iv)
effect of unusually cold winter season. In 1982, fertilizer consumption
is expected to increase though not fully to the level in 1980. However, as
a result of the new agricultural credit policy the domestic consumption of
fertilizer nutrients is expected to increase at a somewhat lower rate than
earlier estimated.
1.03      Unlike in the other developing countries, phosphate is the
dominant nutrient in Brazil's agricultural sector, due to the particular
suitability of phosphates to its soil, cropping and agricultural practices.
Brazil's annual phosphate consumption of about 1.7 million tons of P205 in
1979 places it as the world's fifth largest phosphate consuming country -
next only to the USSR, the USA, France and China. The phosphate to
nitrogen ratio in Brazil has increased from-l.51 in 1970 to 2.20 in 1980 -
significantly higher than the world average ratio of 0.6. Brazil's annual
phosphate consumption has increased from 0.42 million tons of P205 in 1970
to 1.95 million tons in 1980 - an annual average growth rate of 16.8%.
1.04      In the initial years of the decade, Brazil's phosphate
requirements were mostly met by imports of rock phosphate, phosphoric acid
and phosphate fertilizers. With increasing phosphate consumption and
rising rock phosphate prices, Brazil has in recent years increased domestic



-2-
production and processing of rock phosphate. As a result, the share of
domestic rock supply has increased from about 40Z of total consumption in
1970 to about 80Z in 1980. Even though several large phosphate deposits
have been located in Brazil, the rocks are generally of low grade and
relatively expensive to beneficiate. However, the sharp increases in world
rock prices in the mid-1970s, Brazil's large and increasing consumption of
phosphate fertiliz_rs and the impact of substantial imports on Brazil's
trade balance have made it economical for Brazil to develop acceptable
technologies to beneficiate the available low grade rocks. As a result,
rock phosphate production in Brazil has increased from about 55,000 tons of
P205 in 1970 to about 930,000 tons of P205 in 1980. Major rock phosphate
production centers are Jacupiranga, Araxa, Tapira, Onvidor and Patos de
Minas. Brazil's rock phosphate production is expected to increase to about
1.60 million tons of P2P5 by 1985.
1.05      The VALEFERTIL Fertilizer Project is part of Government of
Brazil's recent efforts to maximize domestic phosphatic fertilizer
production by processing rock phosphate-mined and beneficiated in Brazil.
The total program, of which The Project formed the major component, was
promoted and implemented by Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) and included
the following components: (i) rock phosphate mining and beneficiation
facilities at Tapira (Minas Gerais) with annual capacity of about one
million tons--built and operated by Mineracao Vale do Paranaiba (VALEP);
(ii) a 118 km long rock phosphate slurry pipeline from Tapira beneficiation
facilities to the Uberaba plant site with capacity of 2 million tpy of rock
phosphate; and (iii) processing facilities near Uberaba (Minas Gerais) for
the production of 330,000 tpy of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and 340,000
tpy triple superphosphate (TSP)-built and operated by Fertilizantes Vale
do Rio Grande (VALEFERTIL).  The products are marketed to other fertilizer
manufacturers for the production of various fertilizer grades. All three
components have been successfully implemented and commissioned.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal, Approval and Credit Effectivenzss
2.01      The project was prepared by VALEFERTIL formed by CVRD in March
1976 as 'i fully owned subsidiary. The major objective of the project was
to process into MAP and TSP rock phosphate mined and beneficiated by
VALEP-another CVRD subsidiary, at Tapira. Following a request from
VALEFERTIL for Bank participation in financing the Project, a Bank
preappraisal mission visited Brazil in July 1976.
2.02      The preappraisal mission generally agreed with the project
configuration proposed by Valefertil. The preappraisal mission however,
noted (a) the difficult mining conditions and urged caution and use of
expert consultants in the selection of mining equipment; (b) the high
factors of safety used in sizing the beneficiation facilities and pointed
out that improved economies would be possible with better optimization
based on more extensive beneficiation studies; and (c) the project depended
on rock phosphate supply through a slurry pipeline which, though engineered
with caution, introduced risks. Since neither CVRD nor Valefertil had
previous experience in phosphatic fertilizers, Valefertil was urged to



-3-
engage a technical consultant group for assistance. The mission reviewed
with Valefertil further possibilities of optimizing plant capacities.
However, since the VALEP rock phosphat^ will be used for the first tlne for
phosphoric acid production, attempts to improve project economics by a
further increase in phosphoric acid plant capacity was not considered
desirable. Consequently, VALEP adopted appropriate mining methods and
equipment selected in consultation with local and Canadian consultants and
also carried out further continuous beneficiation studies to optimize the
facilities.
2.03     The appraisal mission visited Brazil in October 1976. Following
discussion on the achievable stream efficiency of the phosphoric acid plant
especially when using a new rock phosphate the daily capacity of the
facility was increased from 900 tpd to 940 tpd. It was also agreed that
the phosphoric acid plant will be engineered suitably so that any shortfall
in VALEP rock phosphate can be made up with imported rock phosphate.
2.04     The Board approved on April 26, 1977 an IBRD loan to Valefertil
of US$82.0 million for a period of 15 years including 3 years of grace
with interest at 8.2Z per annum and a guarantee fee of 1.8Z per annum to
the Goveruaent of Brazil.

2.05     Valefertil project was planned for the production of 330,000 tpy
of MAP and 340,000 tpy of TSP for sale to other fertilizer manufacturers
for the production of NPK fertilizers.  The project supplements Brazil's
phosphatic fertilizer production capacity based on locally occurring rock
phosphate. The project includes the following main facilities:
1. Sulfuric acid plant       2 lines            1,300 tpd each
2. Phosphoric acid plant    2 lines               470 tpd each
3. MAP plant                                    1,000 tpd
4. TSP plant                                    1,100 tpd
5. Necessary storage facilities
6. Captive power generation - 11 MW
2.06     The main raw material3 used in the project are (a) 986,000 tpy
of rock phosphate supplied from the VALEP facilities at Tapira through
the slurry pipeline, (b) 277,000 tpy of imported sulfur moved by rail cars
to the plant site, and (c) 45,500 tpy of ammonia eithe: imported or
obtained from one of Brazil's new ammonia plants and transported by ammonia
tank cars. Necessary contracting and procurement arrangements for the
above are effective.

III. PROJECT IMPLEHENTAION AND MANAGEMENT
A.  Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The VALEFERTIL project was completed and comissioned in July
1980-about 11 months behind schedule_ Even though tte project mechanical
completion was delayed by 16 months, VALEFERTIL was able to overlap
construction and commissioning to reduce the delay by about five months.
By December 1981, the facilities had been in operation for 18 months_
During the first year of operations and in 1981 the production achieved
were as follows:
First Year                   1981
Capacity                  Capacity
Production  Utilization   Production  Utilization
Sulfuric acid         537,253 tons     65       585,873 tons     70
Phosphoric acid       186,470 tons     64       209,508 tons     72
MAP                   203,261 tons     62       164,190 tons      50
TSP                    97,007 tons     29       147,875 tons      43
While the performance of the sulfuric and phosphoric acid plants were
better than expected during the first year of operation, the performance of
the MAP and TSP plants was less impressive due to several factors. These
two plants faced more than normal difficulties during the initial testing
and commissioning facilities and had to undergo substantial modifications.
In addition, tightening of agricultural credit availability and increased
interest rates for farm loans in 1981 resulted in a sharp fall in the sale
of MAP and TSP. Faced with excessive MAP and TSP inventory, VALEFERTIL
marketed substantial quantities of phosphoric acid. All the process plants
and utility facilities have been operated for sustained period at or over
their design capacities and the project is capable of reaching and
maintaining the planned output levels once the fertilizer market conditions
get stabilized. But for the unforeseen market constraints the production
achieved could have been significantly higher. Even with these
constraints, capacity utilization rates during the first 18 months have
been better than assumed during appraisal (para 4.06).
B.  Project Scope
3.02      There has been no siginficant deviation in project scope in
regard to the main process units. The scope changes carried out during
project implementation were mainly in the areas of offsites and
infrastructure. The changes adopted includc (i) increase in captive power
generation from 7 MW to 11 NW, (ii) deletion of steam condenser in sulfuric
acid plant with decision to use the phosphoric acid evaporator for same
service, (iii) increase in finished product storage capacity by 50%, (iv)
gypsum disposal lagoon capacity reduced for the present to meet the need
for five years instead of ten years, (v) additional lagoon with spray
system for contaminated water, and (vi) deletion of rock phosphate dryer
now located as part of VALEP facilities. The changes in project scope did
not significantly affect the project costs, economics and implementation
schedule.



-5-
C. Project Managemont
3.03      The project implementation responsibility was initially entrusted
to a consortium US and Brazilian companies. VALEFERTIL provided the
overall project management from its corporate offices in Belo Horizonte and
through technical managers located in the local office of the Brazilian
firm in the cosortium. VALEFERTIL obtained the process licenses and basic
engineering from well known process licensors.  The responsibility for
detailed engineering, procurement, construction management, project
scheduling and cost control rested with the consortium.
3.04      The above arrangement underwent change in December 1977 (Annex 1)
when the consortium responsibility was significantly reduced and limited to
inspection and expediting outside Brazil and detailed engineer'ng.  Rest of
the procurement activity was shifted to Belo Horizonte and carried out by a
group reporting to the Operations Director. Work at the project site
became the responsibility o' the Implementation Director. His area of
responsibility included project engineering, construction management and
project planning. Even though the change in implementation arrangements in
the course of the project resulted in completion delays, the new groups
carried out their responsibilities professionally and efficiently leading
to successful completion of the project. Simultaneously, an industrial
group, reporting to the Operations Director, was formed with responsibility
to take over the facilities from the construction group at the appropriate
time and commission them. This group was also responsible for hiring and
training the technical personnel required for the facilities. The
industrial group performed well especially during testing and commissioning
when the group showed initiative in identifying and implementing the
required plant modifications.
D.   Employment and Training
3.05      The project manpower req'tirement was estimated at tne time of
appraisal, as 450 people mostly skilled and semi-skilled technicians. At
present, the project employs 1,022 people consisting of administrative 257,
production 388, maintenance 286, technical 76 and others 36 (Annex 2). The
large number of administrative people has been the result of the
organizational restructuring when VALEFERTIL was merged with Fosfertil. As
a result, the VALEFERTIL administrative personnel got shifted to the
project site. The present employment is substantially hlgher than was
estimated at the time of appraisal but is still not considered excessive
for a complex handling large tcnnages of solids.
3.06      VALEFERTIL developed and implemented an effective training
program in consultation with its consultants and in cooperation with its
process licensors. The operation and maintenance staff proved to be
adequately competent in commissionir.g and operating tba facilities without
major difficulties.



-6-
E.  Use and Performance of Engineering Contractors and Consultants
3.07      The consortium performed the responsibilities of the general
contractor. Their overall performance was technically adequate and
satisfactory. The VALEFERTIL decision in December 1977 to take over the
construction management responsibility was due to the availability of a
group within CVRD for the above purpose and did not reflect any
inadequacies on the part of the consortium.
3.08      VALEFERTIL was satisfied with the services provided by the
licensors for the sulfuric acid plant and for the phosphoric acid plant.
The cooperation extended by both the consultants was adequate to carry out
the detailed engineering and for the Brazilian equipment manufacturers to
participate in equipment supplies.    The technology and basic designs for
the MAP and TSP plants were provided by a third firm, (USA). These two
plants contain several solid handling equipment for which detailed designs
are normally provided by equipment manufacturers. Several of them were
ordered on Brazilian manufacturers who did not have inhouse design
capabilities and could not obtain adequate assistance. As a result, the
two plants needed substantial modifications during commissioning resulting
in loss of production.
3.09      External technical assistance was provided to VALEFERTIL during
implementation and commissioning. The specialists were competent and were
useful to the project. VALEFERTIL received satisfactory assistance in
developing the corporate and works financial systems.
F. Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.10      It was anticipated during project appraisal that, of the
estimated total cost of equipment and supplies of US$103 million, 40% of
the items would be procured by bidding reserved for Brazilian suppliers, 4%
under suppliers' credit/commercial financing and 56% following Bank's
procurement guidelines and using the Bank loan. The actual cost of
equipment was US$79 million-23Z lower than the appraisal estimates, mainly
due to the more favorable prices obtained by VELEFERTIL and the effect of
variation between the domestic inflation rates and cruzeiro to dollar
exchange rates on domestic equipment prices, expressed in US dollars. The
actual share of Bank financed equipment and supplies was only 44Z against
the appraisal estimate of 56%. Only about 52% of the Bank financed items
were procured from suppliers outside Brazil (Annex 3). As a result, about
70% of the project equipment and supplies were procured from Brazilian
suppliers. While the large share of local supplies did not significantly
delay project completion, it could have if project completion was not
delayed by 11 months for other reasons. Difficulties encountered by the
local manufacturers in fabricating some of the equipment for the first time
were reflected as equipment failures/inadequacies faced by VALEFERTIL
during testing and commissioning--especially in the MAP and TSP plants.
3.11      The larger than expected share of local supplies was mainly due
to pressures on VALEFERTIL by domestic manufacturers, their associations
and Brazilian import regulating agencies. While similar pressures on other



-7-
Bank financed fertilizer projects in Brazil resulted in procurement delays,
the VALEFERTIL management handled the procurement problems with skill
ensuring minimum adverse impact on project completion. While several
equipment problems were encountered during commissioning and initial
operation, generally there were no major problems in obtaining equipment
suppliers' cooperation and assistance in carrying out the required
modifications.
G. Implementation Schedule
3.12      The mechanical completion and commissioning dates of the various
facilities are listed in Annex 4. The project was mechanically completed
and commissioned in July 1980, about 11 months behind the appraisal
schedule (Annex 5). The above delay was mainly due to the following
factors: {i) delay in start of civil works, (ii) change in implementation
arrangements decided on in December 1977, (iii) change in VALEFERTIL senior
management when FOSFERTIL took over VALEFERTIL, and (iv) delays due to
failure of phosphoric acid plant rubber-lining, late availability of
sulfuric acid plant converter internals and damage in transit of acid
resistant bricks. Even though the start of project activities was delayed,
the timing of Bank's involvement in the project was appropriate since it
facilitated better definition of project scope and formulation of
appropriate implementation arrangements.
3.13      The decision of the Government of Brazil in January 1979 to
transfer the ownership of VALEFERTIL from CVRD to FOSFERTIL resulted in a
change in senior management. The VALEFERTIL President, Finance Director
and Operations Director left the company. Since they formed the core
decision making authority for the project, their departure delayed the
progress of the project.  In addition, prob'-ms with obtaining adequate
quality rubber-lining in the phosphoric acid plant, the re-ordering of
sulfuric acid plant converter internals due to inadequate quality of
initial supplies and the damage to acid resistant bricks in transit delayed
project completion.
3.14      Another major factor which might have delayed the project was the
long time normally taken to obtain import clearances from the Brazilian
authorities. The Valefertil, however, handled these clearances at senior
management levels and ensured that there were no undue delays in obtaining
clearances.
3.15      Sulfuric Acid Plant - The two lines of the sulfuric acid plant
were mechanically completed in March and July 1980 respectively and
commissioned in April and July 1980 respectively. Both the plants have
fulfilled performance guarantee tests and have reached maximum daily
production of 1,400 tpd and sulfur conversion and recovery efficiency of
over 99.5%. At present, the only factor limiting production has been the
difficulties faced with the main air blower turbines. The turbines are
.2ing modified to improve performance.
3.16      Phosphoric Acid Plaut -  The two lines of the phosphoric acid
plant were mechanically completed and commissioned in April and June 1980,
respectively. Both plants have completed satisfactorily the performance
guarantee tests in August and October 1980, respectively. Both lines have



-8-
reached over 130% of their daily capacity and have attained P205 recovery
efficiencies exceeding 90%. Except for somewhat higher than the design
reactor temperature and lower fluorine recovery the plants are performing
satisfactorily. Necessary modifications to remedy the above are being
implemented.
3.17      MAP and TSP Plants -  These plants were mechanically completed
and commissioned in May/June 1980. The performance tests carried out in
March 1981 for granular MAP and in April 1981 for Run of Pile (ROP) TSP did
not meet the guarantees. VALEFERTIL, thereafter, decided to take over
direct responsibility for these plants. All the required modifications-
mainly due to the large share of domestic equipment used in the plants and
the inadequacy of the specifications for their manufacture in Brazil, have
been carried out. VALEFERTIL has been able to reach 115% of the rated
daily powdered MAP capacity and 127% of the rated dailv granulated MAP
capacity. The maximum ROP TSP and granulated TSP capacities reached are
108Z and 109% respectively. VALEFERTIL has not however, been able to
achieve the desired stream days of production due to equipment failures and
more recently due to market constraints. The VALEFERTIL operating
personnel have exhibited considerable initiative in identifying and
carrying out substantial plant modifications to improve plant performance.
3.18      Overall, the project was mechanically completed in July 1979-16
months behind the appraisal schedule. However, by overlapping of testing
and commissioning with the final stages of the construction activities
VALEFERTIL was able to commission the facilities by July 1980-only about
11 months behind schedule, thus reducing the project completion delay by
five months. For a grass-root project which faced initial delays in
obtaining the project site and underwent major changes in implementation
arrangements in the early stages of construction the performance of
VALEFERTIL and its consultants was creditable. VALEFERTIL project
management and progress reporting systems were professionally organized and
performed well. The VALEFERTIL operating team - though overstaffed
especially when compared with appraisal estimates, was built up and trained
well in time. The team also utilized to best advantage the consultant
personnel and their specific capabilities. As a result, the testing and
commissioning proceeded smoothly and resulted in a successfully completed
pro ^ct.

3.20      In spite of the eleven months delay in commissioning, the project
cost has increased only by 5Z in current US dollars. In fact expressed in
constant 1981 dollars the actual project cost is US$332 million against
appraisal estimate of US$376 million. The reduction of project cost in
real terms is due to the substantially lower cost of equipment and supplies
delivered at the project site. The reduction of about US$36.8 million (in
current terms) in delivered cost of equipment and supplies was mainly due
to the better prices at which supplies could be obtained, waiver of import
duty and the impact of variation between domestic inflation and cruzeiro
exchange rates. On the other hand, there were substantially increases in
the cost of engineering and project management services amounting to
US$20.6 million mainly due to the change in project implementation
arrangements and project completion delays. The following table summarizes
the variations in project cost by different causes.

3.21      Of the total Bank loan allocated to the project of US$82 million,
the actual utilization was only US$55 million. At the request of
VALEFERTIL, US$27 million of the loan was cancelled. The category wise
allocation at the time of project appraisal and the actual utilization are
simmarized below:

Interest During Construction        9.0          8.0
Total  82.0        55.0
3.22      The main factor responsible for the reduced utilization of the
Bank loan was the lower cost of equipment and supplies and the increase in
share of equipment procured with bidding limited to Brazilian suppliers.
These factors alone were responsible for about 90% of the cancelled loan of
US$27.0 million.  When VALEFERTIL took over corstruction management, the
responsibility of the external firm and its share in construction
management cost was substantially reduced. Since Bank financing covered
only the foreign exchange cost of engineering services, less of the
allocation for engineering services was actually utilized.

3.23      The disbursement pattern for the Bank loan as estimated at the
time of appraisal and the actual pattern are summarized below:

Actual                 5.0   17.7  20.3     8.0    2.0    2.0
The disbursemenc pattern estimated at the time of appraisal has proved to
be optimistic due to several reasons.  The loan utilization was only 67Z of
the original loan amount of US$82 million. There was considerable delay in
the availability of the project site and the start up of project
construction. Difficulties with equipment during commissioning, especially
of the MAP and TSP plants, delayed final payments to some of the eauipment
suppliers and required procurement of replacement items during 198].
US$53.04 million of the loan has been disbursed by the end of DecemAer
1981. The loan will be fully disbursed by May 1982. The project
disbursei:enc schedule is given in Annex 6.
3.24      Tne total project cost of US$308.6 million has been financed with
equity provided through FOSFERTIL of US$148.2 million and borrowings-local
of US$82.7 million and foreign of US$77.7 million. Details of the project
financing plan proposed at the time of appraisal and actually realized are

The shortfall in borrowings of US$15.6 million and the project cost overrun
of US$14.6 million have been financed by additional equity of US$30.2
million. Foreign loans including the World Bank loan form only 252 of the
project financing against 36% estimated during project appraisal. The
reduction is due to two factors: (i) the share of equipment obtained by
procurement limited to Brazilian suppliers has increased and iii) the
project cost overruns have been mainly in local costs of engineering
services and site improvements. The final debt/equity ratio of 52:48 is
more favorable compared to 60:40 stipulated at the time of appraisal.
I.   Project Ownership
3.25      At the time of project appraisal Companhia Vale do Rio Doce
(CVRD)-a public sector company primarily engaged in the mining and exports
of iron ore, was the sole shareholder in both VALEP-the sponsor of the
phosphate mining and beneficiation project, and VALEFERTIL-the promoter of
the phosphate fertilizer project. Common ownership and cross membership in
the administrative councils gave assurance for close coordination between
both companies' operations. Such coordination was vital to the success of
the two highly interdependent projects executed and operated by two
separate corporate entities.
3.26      In January 1979, the Government of Brazil--with the approval of
the Bank, transferred the ownersbto of VALEFERTIL from CVRD to FOSFERTIL,
an affiliate company of PETROFERTIL. With the above action, the Government
brought all public sector fertilizer production units under the overall
coordination of PETROFERTIL. Even though there were resulting changes in
che senior management of VALEFERTIL, the construction and operation of the
project facilities, while suffering some delays, did not face any other
serious difficulties.
3.27      FOSFERTIL had been formed in February, 1977 with responsibility
for the production of phosphate materials and was entrusted with the
development and operation of the Patos de Minas deposits in August 1977.
Following the transfer of VALEFERTIL to FOSFERTIL, the Government of Brazil
decided in July 1980 to transfer VALEP from CVRD to FOSFERTIL (Annex 7).
The share holding of FOSFERTIL was restructured in December 1980 with the
following ownerships: PETROFERTIL (32.6%), FIBASE/BNDE (32.6%, CVRD
(34.2%) and CAMIG (0.6%). The above changes in corporate structure have
once again brought the VALEP and VALEFERTIL operations under a single
company retaining PETROFERIL's overall coordinating role in the
Government-owned fertilizer sector (Annex 1). VALEP and VALEFERTIL are
operated and managed as separate profit centers, thus retaining the
operating efficiencies of the individual units.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As mentioned earlier, the project facilities were mechanically
completed in July 1930-about 16 months behind schedule, but the project
could recover about five months of the delay by overlapping the final



- 13 -
stages of construction with tsRting and commissioning. This was possible
due to the earlier completion of the utility facilities - water supply and
steam generation facility by January 1980 and one line each of the process
acid plants by March/April 1980. The commissioning of the plants went
smoothly and the production levels achieved (Annex 8) in the first month of
operation were sulfuric acid 75% in first line, phosphoric acid 62% in
first line and MAP 60Z. The TSI plant reached about 36Z production only in
the fourth month of operation. While the acid plants could increase
production soon after the start-up, the MAP and TSP plants underwent
substantial modifications before reasonable production levels could be
reached.
4.02      During the first year of operation, the sulfuric acid plants
produced a total of 537,000 tons of acid which corresponds to about 65% of
the annual capacity. Except for some modifications to the air blower
turbine, the plants have been stabilized and were capable of achieving and
maintaining the rated capacity. Finished product manufacture and marketing
were the major constraints.
4.03      The phosphoric acid production during the first year of operation
was 186,000 tons of P205--corresponding to 64% of the annual rated
capacity. All production constraints enc(iuntered during initial operation
have been resolved and plants can achieve ai.  maintain the rated capacity.
Production and sale of MAP and TSP were the major constraints.
4.04      The first year production of MAP--both powder and granular--was
about 203,000 tons, corresponding to about 62Z of the annual rated
capacity. The plant has faced process and equipment problems, several of
which have been rectified. Marketing of MAP became a limitation by the
latter half of the year and excessive inventory forced production cutback.
4.05      The first year TSP production totalled about 97,000 tons
corresponding to only 29% of the annual rated capacity. Even though the
plant has reached its daily rated capacity it has not been possible to
maintain high production levels due to equipment problems. Several
modifications have been carried out but the marketing constraints have not
permitted trying out the plant at high capacities.
4.06      The overall performance of the complex-expressed in nutrient
terms, was 64% in the first year. This was better than the 50 production
level in first year used in appraisal and generally achieved in such plants
elsewhere.
B.   Build-up of Production
4.07      Against about 215,000 tons of P205 produced and marketed as MAP,
TSP and phosphoric acid in 1981, VALEFERTIL plans to produce and market
about 289,000 tons in 1982. The continuing market constraints in 1982 is
expected to require VALEFERTIL to market about 120,000 tons of P205 as
phosphoric acid. The production levels achieved in 1981 and expected in
1982 of the various products and their rated capacities are summarized
below.

The marketed products of 194,000 tons of P205 in the first year of
operation and about 215 thousand tons in 1981 form 59Z and 68X respectively
of the annual rated capacity. The 1982 expected P205 production is 289,000
tons of P205 forming about 87Z of the rated capacity. The production
achieved so far and planned for 1982 is substantially better than the
perEormance assumed in the appraisal of the project and normanly achieved
in such plants in initial years.
C.  Market Growth
4.08      The apparent plant nutrient consumption in Brazil increased from
2.527 million tons in 1976 to 4.274 million tons in 1980. The actual
increase of 1.747 million tons is 46X higher than the increase of 1.194
million tons estimated at the time of appraisal. The higher growth rate
achieved was the result of various government measures aimed at promoting
fertilizer application in the agricultural sector. The historical and
projected fertilizer demands estimated at the time of appraisal and now are
stumiarized below.

4.09      Between 1976-80, the actual fertilizer consumptions was
consistantly much higher than appraisal estimates. However, as a result of
severe economic difficulties faced by Brazil since 1980, the Government has
taken unusual measures to control inflation which has adversely affected
economic growth. These economic measures and poor weather have also hurt
the agricultural sector and as a result 1981 apparent fertilizer
consumption is about 30% below the 1980 consumption. Four specific
developments are mainly responsible for this drop: (a) as part of its
anti-inflationary measures the Government of Brazil has tightened its
agricultural credit policy; (b) credit availability to the farmers has been
reduced and the interest rate has been increased from zero to 45Z in
current terms-the newly introduced interest on farm credit encouraged the
farmers and retailers to liquidate their inventory which stood at over 2
million tons by the end of 1981; (c) the fertilizer product prices were
also deregulated in February 1981, resulting in an average fertilizer price
increase of about 96% while the price increases of major agricultural crops
like coffee, soya beans, wheat and maize were far lower affecting adversely
the benefit/cost ratio of fertilizer application; and (d) the adverse
unusua'lly cold and dry winter also affected fertilizer application.
Fertilizer consumption should improve during 1982 when the inventory at the
farmer and retailer level is depleted, the weather is normal and
particularly if the benefit/cost ratios to the farmer improve. FOSFERTIL,
expects that the 1982 consumption may still be about 10% below the 1980
consumption.
4.10      The historical and projected domestic production of fertilizers
during 1972 to 1980 are sunmarized below.

While the 1980 phosphate fertilizer production exceeded appraisal estimates
partly due to the better than expected VALEFERTIL performance, the nitrogen
production was lower mainly due to delays in completion of the Araucaria
project. By 1985, domestic fertilizer industry will meet Brazil's total
phosphatic fertilizer requirement. While the 1985 nitrogen production will
be short of expected consumption by about 20Z, Brazil could have temporary
surplus urea in the earlier years if the Araucaria and Sergipe plants go
smoothly into production and if nitrogen consumption, which fell by about
26% in 1981, does not rise rapid enough in the next few years.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORHANCE
A.  Financial Rate of Return
5.01      The financial rate of return has been calculated at the 1981
input prices under prevailing contracts with the suppliers (Annex 9). The
rock phosphate contract transfer price from VALEP is US$40 per ton. The
coars of imported raw materials-sulfur and ammonia-are based on pro-
jectedll 1990 import prices adjusted for transport cost to Uberaba. In
view of the product price deregulation (para 4.09)J the product prices are
based on 1990 projected international prices (in 1981 constant dollars)
adjusted for transportation differential to the fertilizer market. This
assumption will also ensure a more realistic project analysis by providing
an appropriate adjustment from the depressed international and local
product prices now prevailing. The annual cost of production and sales
realization with the facilities operating at 90% are given in Annex 10.
Based on these assumptions, the project financial rate of return (FRR) is
23% before taxes (Annex 11)-92 higher than the appraisal estimate of 14% in
spite of 11 months delay mainly due to the low transfer price of rock
phosphate. If the present rock phosphate price is increased to the
equivalent landed cost of imported rock, the FRR comes down to 16Z-still
about 2% better than the appraisal estimate in spite of the project delay
due to the lower capital c.st (in constant terms) and better production
performance during the first eighteen months.
B.   Financial Results
5.02      As was mentioned earlier (para 3.24), the ownership of VALEFERTIL
was transferred to FOSFERTIL in January 1979. The past financial data for
VALEFERTIL for 1980 and for FOSFERTIL for 1980 and 1981 are presented
below. Income Statements and Balance Sheets from 1976 onwards are
presented in Annex 12.

5.03      Since FOSFERTIL has undergone two restructurings in the last
three years, the financial situation of the company has not yet stabilized.
Also during the last year, FOSFERTIL has marketed substantial quantities of
rock phosphate and phosphoric acid at the government fixed prices lower
than international prices due to marketing limitations resulting from the
new policies on csedit to farmers. With improved market conditions and
better production performance in VALEFERTIL after the initial operating
problems, FOSFERTIL's financial performance is expected to improve in 1982
and beyond.
5.04      The VALEFERTIL project has been financed with 48Z equity-better
than the 401 stipulated in the Project Agreement. The equity ccntent of
49Z in the financing pattern of FOSFERTIL is also more favorable than the
required 40x. The major inadequacy of the FOSFERTIL's financial position
is the low current ratio-0.7 in 1981 against 1.2 stipulated in the Project
Agreement.   The deviation from the financial covenant was discussed with
the FOSFERTIL and PETROFERTIL managements who pointed out that the low
current ratio is mainly due to the large amount of short term borrowings
-Cr$16.4 billion, used by FOSFERTIL to finance its investments and
operation. PETROFERTIL intends to recommend to the FOSFERTIL board, that
the shareholders' equity capital be increased by Cr$4 billion. This
measure along with use of internally generated cash to finance part of the
inventory and accounts receivable are expected to improve the current ratio
to an acceptable level by 1983.
5.05      The present investment plans of FOSFERTIL are limited to (a)
possible expansion of VALEP and VALEFERTIL capacities to optimize
production capabilities (as stipulated in the Project Agreement) and (b)
expansion of Patos de Minas rock phosphate production capacity from 150,O0O
tpy to 300,000 tpy. With the measures to improve the FOSFERTIL financial
status listed in the above paragraph, those investments are appropiate.
VI. ECONOMIC PERFOREMANCE
A.  Economic Rate of Return
6.01      The project economic rate of return (ERR) has been determined
using the input and output price assumptions sumnarized in Annex 9. All
traded items have been priced based on projected international prices
allowing for transportation and handling costs. All non-tradeable items
have been priced at their financial prices after adjusting for duties and
taxes. The production cost details for the project are shown in Annex 10
and the economic cost and benefit stream in Annex 13.
6.02      The economic rate of return (ERR) with Cruzeiro exchange rate
shadow priced by 251, is 17% against 22% at the time of appraisal. The
decline in spite of the lower capital cost (expressed in constant dollars)
and better performance during the first 18 months is due to the variation
in the projected price assumptions for inputs and products between the time
of appraisal and now. If the inputs and products are priced as at the time
of appraisal, the ERR improves to 23Z.



- 18 -
B.  Environmental Aspects
6.03      The VALEFERTIL project facilities have been constructed in
conformity with environmental regulation norms agreed to during the project
appraisal. Trhe measures taken have ensured that the required standards are
met during plant operation except for the following: bulk movement of MAP
and TSP by truck causes spillages on the plant roads. The spilled products
get washed into the plant sewerage system during rains causing pollution.
Special efforts are made to reduce spillage and to periodically clean the
roads. While fluosilic acid produced in the acidulation of rock phosphate
is now recovered and treated before discharge, VALEFERTIL has not yet
arranged for its utilization to produce cryolite or aluminum fluoride.
VALEFERTIL is attempting to interest private investors in promoting the
fluoride utilization project.
C.   Foreign Exchange Saving
6.04      The foreign exchange value of production with the facilities
operating at 90Z of the rated capacity will be US$199 million per year.
The foreign exchange cost of sulfur, ammonia and maintenance materials will
be US$57 million. The net annual foreign exchange saving for Brazil from
this project will be US$142 million (in 1981 constant dollars) compared to
estimated saving of US$165 million at the time of appraisal.
D.   Transfer of Technology
6.05      The project has been implemented with substantial involvement of
Brazilian institutions. Using know-how and basic designs obtained from
process licensors, the detailed engineering was carried out by a Brazilian
engineering company. Several equipment for the project were also obtained
from Brazilian suppliers. The VALEFERTIL and local engineers absorbed very
effectively the tecenology transferred to them tnd now have significant
capabilities.
VII. bANK ROLE
7.01      During the various phases of the Project, the Bank has worked
closely with VALEFERTIL and its consultants. During project appraisal, the
Bank not only reviewed the VALEFERTIL project but also the related VALEP
project and the rock phosphate slurry pipeline to ensure that the
integrated scheme was not only technically sound but also economically
optimum. The Bank worked closely with VALEFERTIL in forulating and
implementing the project financing arrangement which included in addition
to the Bank financing, the use of suppliers' credit and commercial bank
financing to fund the project foreign exchange requirements. At the
suggestion of the Bank, VALEFERTIL used consultant assistance in developing
the corporate and works financial systems and in implementing and operating
the project. The VALEFERTIL project is a good example of a project in
which dedicated work by the project management aided by the Bank support
has resulted in a successful project meeting its economic objectives.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      Except for the delay of about eleven months, the project has been
completed successfully at close to initially estimated project cost in
current terms and 12% below appraisal estimates in real terms. Even though
the project faced some initial commissioning problems, especially in the
TSP and MAP plans, the VALEFERTIL engineers worked on the problems,
developed solutions and implemented them successfully. As a result, the
facilities have achieved about 60% capacity utilization in the first year,
compared to 50% assumed during appraisal. The 1982 production is expected
to reach close to 90% compared to 75% assumed in appraisal. But for the
marketing constraints referred to earlier, VALEFERTIL could have achieved
even better levels of production. Due to lower capital costs in real terms
and much faster production build-up than assumed during appraisal, the
economic rate of return of the project is estimated at 23% compared to 22%
at appraisal, if the price and cost assumptions applied in appraisal are
used. Even based on more conservative output and input price relationship,
the ERR is calculated at a healthy 17%.
8.02      The success of the project has been mainly due to the VALEFERTIL
management group which carried out the project with enthusiasm and
dedication. VALEFERTIL utilized expatriate consultants to full advantage
of the project and there has been smooth and useful transfer of technology.
8.03      The project delays were mainly due to (a) initial delays in
availability of land; (b) change in implementation arrangement with
VALEFERTIL taking over construction management; and (c) change in the
management team when VALEFERTIL was taken over by FOSFERTIL. The time
needed for obtaining land for locating the project is often underestimated
and other phases of the project implemented ahead of needs. However, in
spite of this initial delay, the timing of the Bank involvement in the
project was appropriate since it facilitated effective Bank participation
in formulating project scope and implementation arrangements. This timely
participation contributed to the success of the project. rhe decision to
take over construction management and to merge VALEFERTIL with FOSFERTIL
had acceptable rationale. Rowever, in both instances the Bank and the
Brazilian authorities aid not fuUy recognize the possible impact of the
above decision on project schedule. As a result, mechanical completion was
delayed by 16 months and it was the alertness of the commissioning staff
which enabled about five months of the delay to be recovered.
8.04      On the overall, the VALEFERTIL project has been a success
achieved through close coordination of effort between the VALEFERTIL
Managers and the Bank staff. The project has fully met its objectives and
can be relied upon to continue to be successful industrial enterprise in
Brazil.
