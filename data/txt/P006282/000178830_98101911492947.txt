BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF THE VALEFERTIL PHOSPHATE FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to produce phosphate fertilizers
with a capacity of 1,000 tons per day of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and
1,100 tons per day of triple superphosphate (TSP) for respective annual
capacities of 330,000 and 340,000 tons. The project will also produce the
intermediate sulphuric acid and the phosphoric acid needed for the production
of these phosphate fertilizers. The plant will be built at a new site, 37 km
South of Uberaba, in the State of Minas Gerais. The project will use as
principal raw material local low grade phosphate rock to be supplied by
Mineracao Vale do Paranaiba S.A. (VALEP), which is presently installing
phosphate mining and beneficiation facilities at Tapira, about 118 km east
of the project site. VALEFERTIL is expected to start commercial production
in mid-1979, and the output will be marketed in the Center region of Brazil
through private fertilizer blending and mixing companies. Total financing
requirements are estimated at US$294 million equivalent, including US$104
million in foreign exchange. A Bank loan of US$82 million is being proposed.
ii.       The project is sponsored by Fertilizantes Vale do Rio Grande S.A.-
VALEFERTIL (VALEFERTIL) which was established in March 1976 as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), Brazil's largest producer
and exporter of iron ore. Although CVRD tried to attract private Brazilian
fertilizer companies into some equity participation in the project, the idea
was abandoned because the private sector fertilizer industry has a low level
of capital formation when compared to the substantial capital requirements
of modern and large-scale plants and the funds the industry has are already
committed to other projects.
iii.      The Bank has so far assisted one project in the Brazilian fertilizer
sector with a loan to Petrobras Fertilizantes S.A. for an ammonia/urea project
at Araucaria (May 1976 - US$50 million). Implementation of this project is
proceeding satisfactorily. A second loan of US$64 million to Petrobras
Fertilizantes S.A., to assist an ammonia/urea project at Sergipe, will also
be proposed to the Bank's Executive Directors at about the same time as the
proposed loan to VALEFERTIL.
iv.       Brazil's rising agricultural output has so far resulted mainly from
expansions of cultivated area. Although the area under cultivation will
continue to grow, the Government is also allocating substantial resources
to raise agricultural productivity, especially of smaller farmholdings,
through a number of extension programs and through increased application of
modern inputs such as fertilizers and improved seeds.
v.        The Brazilian fertilizer industry supplied only 40% of the country's
1976 fertilizer consumption. This low level of domestic output is due to
Brazil's lack of easily exploitable fertilizer raw materials, the large capital



- ii -
requirement for fertilizer plants, and the absence of specific Government
support policies for the fertilizer sector during the 1960s. As a conse-
quence, the industry has concentrated on importing, mixing and distributing
rather than on establishing large, efficient production facilities. To
overcome this dependence on imports, the Government initiated a program for
increasing domestic production with the publication in 1974 of a National
Fertilizer Program and establishment of an interministerial Fertilizer
Commission charged with ensuring the rational development of the sector.
As a result, an investment program for large, primary production facilities
emerged of which the Bank-assisted Araucaria project, as well as the Sergipe
project and the proposed VALEFERTIL project form part.
vi.       There was little growth in fertilizer use up to 1966 but stimulat-
ing measures introduced in the mid-sixties brought six years of very rapid
growth averaging 35% annually through 1972. From 1973 to 1975, however,
fertilizer consumption increased only modestly due to the sharp rise in
international prices. Concerned with the trend, the Government introduced
a price subsidy to the farmers in April 1975 which resulted in a significant
recovery in consumption during 1976. However, the subsidy was discontinued
in December 1976 following the dramatic fall in international prices and the
improvement in the price relationship of agricultural products relative to
fertilizers which is expected to continue. The removal of the price subsidy
is not expected to have any significant adverse impact on demand beyond the
first few months of 1977.
vii.      Government policies in the fertilizer and the agriculture sectors
during the Second Development Plan period (1975-79) provide a favorable
setting for continued growth in fertilizer consumption, ranging from 10-12%
annually. Domestic fertilizer production is projected to increase sharply,
providing from 60% to 70% of expected consumption during the early 1980s
compared to the 40% at present. Potash will remain the main import, and there
will be near self-sufficiency in nitrogen and phosphate. The rapid expansion
of consumption and the changing pattern of supply expected in the next few
years will probably create severe strains on the existing marketing and
distribution network. The Government, therefore, in connection with the
Bank's loan for the Araucaria project, undertook a marketing and distribution
study expected to be completed by late 1977.
viii.     VALEFERTIL's production will be marketed in the Center region
where fertilizer consumption is already substantial and phosphate fertilizer
demand is expected to grow at least 10% per year during 1977-80. But VALEFERTIL
will produce only bulk products for sale to blenders/mixers and will need
to develop marketing plans as there are limited fertilizer blending/mixing
facilities close to its plant and target market area.
ix.       The project is based on modern, commercially proven technology and
will be implemented by a general engineering firm under the supervision
of VALEFERTIL's own project team which will be strengthened with foreign
Technical Advisers. The general engineering firm is a consortium of



- iii -
FLUOR (USA) and NATRON (Brazil), both experienced engineering firms. Basic
engineering for the sulphuric acid plant will be provided by Lurgi (F. R.
Germany) based on the Bayer-Lurgi process. The phosphoric acid plant will be
engineered by Krebs (France) based on the Rhone-Poulenc process. Finally,
the MAP and the TSP plants will be engineered by Gulf Design, a division of
Badger (USA), based on the Swift-Gulf Design process for MAP and the Gulf
Design process for TSP. Basic engineering is almost complete and procure-
ment started in January 1977 using Bank guidelines.
x.        In agreement with the Government's policy to support and develop
the Brazilian capital goods industry, 40% of the value of equipment and
materials required by the project will be bid only among Brazilian suppliers.
This is expected to increase the project cost, but by less than 2%. Proprie-
tary equipment not available in Brazil, representing close to 5% of the total
equipment value, will be purchased using suppliers credits. The balance of the
equipment (55%) will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines and will
be financed from the proposed Bank loan; the loan will also cover the foreign
cost of engineering, process licenses and technical advisory services, and
interest during construction on the Bank loan.
xi.       The project will be financed with 40% equity from CVRD (US$118
million) and 60% loans from: (a) the National Development Bank, BNDE, and its
subsidiary, FINAME (US$70 million); (b) foreign commercial bank loans and
suppliers credits (US$24 million); and (c) the Bank (US$82 million).
xii.      The project's financial rate of return is satisfactory at 14%
before and 11% after taxes. The financial forecast also shows satisfactory
debt service coverage and debt/equity ratios upon reaching a steady state of
production at an assumed 90% capacity utilization in 1981. VALEFERTIL will be
required to follow prudent financial practices to maintain its financial
strength.
xiii.     The economic rate of return of the project is 22% and remains
satisfactory even under adverse conditions. The project is located in an area
with little industrial development and will contribute to the regional indus-
trialization objectives of Brazil. In addition, the project will accelerate
the development of the fertilizer marketing and distribution system in the
western section of the Center region, thereby providing support to that area's
agricultural development programs. The project will also help ensure stable
fertilizer supplies and prices, thereby contributing to a more orderly growth
in agricultural output. The local engineering and capital goods industries
will benefit with about US$73 million worth of goods and services that will be
purchased by the project from these two sectors. The VALEFERTIL project is
the final stage of a two-stage import substitution process, the first being
the VALEP project which will produce phosphate rock concentrate. The economic
return of the combined projects is 16.6%; this rate is similar to the return
of the VALEFERTIL project if based on imported rock. On the other hand,
VALEP's return is only 9.6% if it's output were to be sold to manufacturers
in the coastal area i.e., without the VALEFERTIL project. Brazil therefore,
has economic justification to undertake the two projects at the same time.



- iv -
xiv.      The project faces some risks but these are expected to be reduced
or have been reduced to acceptable levels. For example, VALEFERTIL's lack
of technical experience will be overcome through foreign technical advisory
services. Similarly, the phosphoric acid plant has been designed with addi-
tional safety factors because the Tapira phosphate rock will be used in a
fertilizer plant for the first time. VALEFERTIL will also develop market-
ing plans for the project, in consultation with the Bank, to overcome present
weaknesses in the marketing and distribution system in the project's target
market area.
xv.       On the basis of the agreements reached with the Government, CVRD
and VALEFERTIL, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$82 million to
VALEFERTIL for 15 years including 3 years of grace at the standard Bank rate
plus a fee to the Government for a total interest rate of 10% per year.



I. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
1.01      Fertilizantes Vale do Rio Grande S.A. - VALEFERTIL (VALEFERTIL)
has requested a Bank loan of US$82 million equivalent to assist in financing
its new phosphate fertilizer complex, with a capacity of 333,000 tons per
year (TPY) of P 20 nutrient 1/ to be erected at Uberaba, Minas Gerais (Map
IBRD 12055R1).  aUeraba, situated within an important cattle raising area,
is located 475 km west of Belo Horizonte, the state capital and 510 km south
of Brasilia, the national capital. At present, Uberaba has a limited, agri-
culture-based industrial sector, but an industrial park has been reserved
in the southern part of the municipality and the project is one of several
industries planned for that site. The project's primary raw material, phos-
phate rock concentrate, will be provided by Mineracao Vale do Paranaiba S.A.
(VALEP), which is presently installing phosphate mining and beneficiation
facilities at Tapira (near Araxa), some 118 km east of the project site.
1.02      VALEFERTIL and VALEP are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Companhia
Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), a public sector enterprise primarily engaged in
the mining and exports of iron ore. The VALEFERTIL project is expected to
be completed by July 1979 and estimated to cost about US$294 million equiv-
alent, including US$104 million in foreign exchange. It will be financed
with 40% equity from CVRD; local loans from BNDE (the National Development
Bank) and its subsidiary FINAME 2/; foreign suppliers credits and commercial
bank loans; as well as the proposed Bank loan.
1.03      Following preparatory missions in June and September 1976, the
project was appraised in October 1976 by a mission consisting of Messrs.
D. Carpio (Chief) and S. Venkataraman of the Industrial Projects Department
and J. Cape (Consultant).
B. Bank Group Involvement in the Brazilian Fertilizer Sector
1.04      The Bank Group has so far undertaken two operations in the Brazilian
fertilizer industry. IFC participated in the ULTRAFERTIL project at Cubatao
(Report No. IFC P-34, Sept. 21, 1966) which started production in late 1970
(Annex 1-2). The Bank approved in May 1976 a US$50 million loan to Petrobras
Fertilizantes S.A. for an ammonia/urea project at Araucaria (Report No. 1050-BR,
April 23, 1976). A second loan of US$64 million to Petrobras Fertilizantes
S.A., to assist an ammonia/urea project at Sergipe (Report No. 1414-BR, April
1977), will also be proposed to the Bank's Executive Directors at about the
same time as the proposed loan to VALEFERTIL. Implementation of the Araucaria

is given in Annex 1-1.

project is proceeding satisfactorily. Procurement of time critical equip-
ment is on schedule although the rest of procurement is about two months
delayed due to an initially slower pace of basic engineering work and exten-
sive negotiations with the associations of local manufacturers resulting in
an increase in the proportion of local equipment from the appraisal estimate
of about 50% to about 65% of total equipment cost. Expected project comple-
tion date is still mid-1979, as originally estimated, but financing require-
ments have increased by about US$32 million or 14%, all in local currency
and are being covered by Brazilian sources. Even with the higher capital
cost, Araucaria's economic rate of return remains satisfactory at about 20%.
Implementation of the Sergipe project has just started and completion is
planned for early 1981.
II. PROJECT SPONSOR
A. Fertilizantes Vale do Rio Grande S.A. - VALEFERTIL (VALEFERTIL)
2.01      VALEFERTIL is the project sponsor and will own and operate
the project. The Company was registered in March 1976 with an initial
share capital of Cr$20 million which will be fully subscribed by CVRD
and its subsidiaries. CVRD had originally intended to attract other
investors, including foreign firms, to participate in the project. How-
ever, it had to abandon this idea because private fertilizer enterprises
in Brazil either have limited financial resources or are themselves already
involved in other projects; foreign investors have also not shown interest
in the project.
2.02      Although virtually the entire output of the phosphate mining-
beneficiation project (VALEP) will go to the phosphate fertilizer project
(VALEFERTIL), it is not unusual, considering the size and complexity of the
two projects, to have them owned and operated by two separate companies. In
addition, VALEP is to be basically a mining enterprise, and as such will also
extract and process other ores, notably titanium and niobium, which are found
in conjunction with the phosphate ore in Tapira. However, CVRD will ensure
that the two firms will closely coordinate their activities and plans of
operation through the respective Administrative Council of each company.
This Council, which has four members all from CVRD, is the equivalent of
the Board of Directors. The same CVRD director is the chairman of each
company's Council which also includes each company's president. In addi-
tion, the president of one company will be a member of the Administrative
Council of the other. As the Council has the responsibility for approving
annual budgets, investment plans and operating policies of the company, this
arrangement will ensure a cooperative as well as coordinated operation of the
two enterprises. CVRD has agreed to continue this arrangement.
2.03      The corporate organization chart of VALEFERTIL is shown in Annex 2-1.
Having just been established, the Company continues to receive some management
support from CVRD. However, VALEFERTIL will need to evolve, within the next



- 3 -
12 months or so, a plan covering the organizational structure for its com-
mercial operations, the main administrative as well as commercial policies
and procedures, and the major financial control and information systems.
In developing and implementing such a plan, VALEFERTIL will use management
consultancy services, which are available in Brazil. The terms of reference
for the management consultants are satisfactory and VALEFERTIL is now invit-
ing proposals from local firms. The consultants are expected to be hired
by late 1977.
2.04      The president and the three other operating directors (implementation,
technical operations, and finance) of VALEFERTIL have been appointed (Annex
2-1) and the Company has agreed to appoint a marketing manager by September 1,
1977 so that he can participate in formulating the organizational development
plan, especially as it relates to marketing. After the start of commercial
production, the position of project implementation director will be replaced
by a commercial director and it is likely that the marketing manager will
assume this position. So far, the top management personnel, with the exception
of the project implementation director, have been recruited from outside the
CVRD system. While these are qualified for the general management functions,
additional technical expertise is needed, and will be filled by technical
advisers (para 4.09). The Company has already selected Arthur Andersen and
Company of Brazil as external auditor; this is satisfactory.
B. Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD)
2.05      The parent company, CVRD, is primarily engaged in the exploration,
mining, transport, and exports of iron ore although it also has subsidiaries
and associated companies involved in forest industries including pulp and
paper (Annex 2-2). During 1975, CVRD produced about 50 million tons of iron
ore and exported about 47 million tons at an FOB value of US$611 million,
accounting for 60% of total Brazilian iron ore exports.
2.06      CVRD's recent financial statements are shown in Annex 2-3 and its
cash flow projections in Annex 2-4. Gross revenues have increased dramati-
cally from US$524 million in 1974 to US$749 million in 1975 and about US$907
million in 1976. Almost 85% of gross revenues are accounted for by iron ore
exports and roughly 70% of the increase in gross revenues is due to higher
prices, with the balance accounted for by physical increases in sales. During
the last three years, net income has averaged 22% to 25% of equity. At the
end of 1976 the debt/equity ratio (37:63) and the current ratio (2.8) were
also satisfactory. From 1973 to 1975, CVRD's capital investments averaged
US$255 million annually and are expected to increase substantially during the
next five years. CVRD's investment program for 1976-80 is forecast to require
financing commitments of about US$3.8 billion equivalent in current terms,
including close to US$3 billion for the Carajas iron ore project in the
Northeast; about US$250 million for the VALESUL aluminum project; and US$118
million for the equity investment in the VALEFERTIL project. Bank financing
has been requested for all three projects. The investment program is expected
to be financed with 35% loans, 15% new capital subscriptions and Government
funds and 50% internally generated resources; this is a sound capitalization.

III. FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
A. Agriculture in Brazil
3.01      Brazil's rising agricultural output has so far been due mainly to
expansions of cultivated area (Annex 3-1). While the area under cultivation
will continue to expand, agricultural growth will have to depend increasingly
on raising the productivity of land already under cultivation. The Government
in its Second Development Plan (1975-1979) has a goal of a 40% (7% annually)
real increase in agricultural output to make Brazil one of the world's fore-
most producers and exporters of foodstuffs. To achieve this, the Government
has allocated substantial resources to open new areas to production and to
increase agricultural productivity through a number of extension programs
and through increased application of fertilizers and improved seeds.
3.02      These programs reflect a shift in agricultural policy.  In addition
to the promotion and establishment of large commercial agricultural enter-
prises, greater emphasis is also being given to raising small farm produc-
tivity, especially in the Northeast. These efforts to improve agricultural
productivity, coupled with an increase in industrial activity have already
resulted in a more rapid growth of per capita income in the Northeast than
in Brazil as a whole; this process is expected to continue.
B. The Fertilizer Industry and Government Fertilizer Policies
3.03      Brazil's fertilizer industry (Annex 3-2) consists of about 50
relatively small private sector and three larger Government-owned companies
which supplied 40% of the 1976 fertilizer consumption. On a nutrient basis
33% of nitrogen, 69% of phosphates and none of the potash come from domestic
production (para 3.11). But phosphate production is mostly based on imported
raw materials since Brazilian phosphate rock output accounts for only 10% of
phosphate consumption. The low level of domestic production has been due
to Brazil's lack of easily exploitable fertilizer raw materials, the large
capital requirement for the manufacture of chemical fertilizers and the
absence of specific Government policies during the 1960s for the development
of the fertilizer sector. The industry has therefore concentrated on im-
porting, mixing, blending and distributing at the retail level rather than
on establishing large, efficient production facilities.  To overcome this
dependence on imports, the Government embarked on a program of assuring
self-sufficiency in fertilizers by 1980 with the publication in 1974 of a
National Fertilizer Program (NFP) and establishment of an interministerial
Fertilizer Commission charged with ensuring the rational development of the
sector. As a result, an investment program for large, primary production
facilities emerged of which the Bank-assisted Araucaria project, as well as
the Sergipe project and the proposed VALEFERTIL project form part.
3.04      The production costs of local fertilizers have generally been higher
than the cost of imports. To ensure full use of all the domestic output, a
Government-established quota system requires retailers to purchase a given
proportion of domestic fertilizer for each unit of imported fertilizer. This



- 5 -
proportion is changed periodically depending on consumption forecasts and
local availabiLity. As new, large-scale efficient fertilizer plants enter
into production, domestic fertilizer costs are expected to move, in the longer
run, in line with long-term international prices, thereby obviating the need
for the import quota system.
3.05      The high level of international fertilizer prices in 1973-75 (Annex
3-2, Chart I) induced a levelling off of fertilizer consumption in Brazil
as in many other import dependent countries. Concerned with the trend, the
Government introduced in April 1975, a price subsidy which reduced the price
of fertilizers to the farmers by 15% to 30%. However, the Government discon-
tinued the price subsidy in December 1976 following the significant fall in
international fertilizer prices and the improvement in the price relation-
ship of agricultural products relative to fertilizers which is expected to
continue. Consequently, the removal of the price subsidy is not expected to
have any adverse impact on-fertilizer demand beyond the first few months of
1977.
C. Historical Consumption of Fertilizers
3.06      Growth of fertilizer consumption in Brazil though rapid has been
erratic as shown in the table below (Annex 3-2, Charts II and III):

/a   As estimated by ANDA (National Association for the Promotion of Fer-
tilizer Use).
Up to 1966 there was little growth in fertilizer use due to the Government's
neglect of the agriculture and fertilizer sectors. But stimulating measures
introduced in the mid-sixties brought six years of very rapid growth with
annual increments averaging 35% through 1972. From 1973 to 1975 however,
fertilizer consumption increased only modestly, primarily due to the sharp
rise in international prices and the scarcity of fertilizers in the world
market. A significant recovery in consumption occured in 1976 due to the
Government's subsidy and lower international prices.



- 6 -
3.07      Phosphate is the most important nutrient consumed, accounting
for 50% of the total nutrient used, because of the soil characteristics
and cropping pattern in Brazil resulting in an NPK consumption ratio of
1:2.3:1.3. Detailed statistics of fertilizer application to various crops
are not available; however, sugar, coffee, soybeans and wheat together
account for 50% to 60% of total consumption.
D. Projected Demand and Supply of Fertilizers
3.08      As the past growth of fertilizer consumption in Brazil has been
erratic, and detailed and consistent fertilizer statistics are lacking,
demand projections carry considerable uncertainty. The most important
factor favoring increased fertilizer consumption is the expected strong
Government support in view of: (a) the Government's interest in higher
agricultural production with fertilizers as an essential input; (b) its
willingness to stabilize the price ratios between agricultural products and
fertilizers; and finally (c) its declared goal of assuring a stable supply
of fertilizers by sharply increasing domestic production. These provide
a favorable setting for continued growth in fertilizer consumption. The
limiting factors can be bottlenecks in transportation, deficiencies in
extension services, shortages of foreign exchange for imports of fertilizer
materials, and constraints to the expansion of agricultural credit.
3.09      The upper limit for future demand can be estimated by normative
analysis from necessary nutrient replacement and by projections of cultivated
area and cropping patterns. Estimates of this nature result in a potential
demand of about 12 million nutrient tons (NPK) in 1985, compared to the
consumption of 2.3 million nutrient tons estimated for 1976 (para 3.11).
The maximum average annual growth between 1976 and 1985 would, therefore,
be around 23%. The NFP assumes NPK consumption to grow at an average annual
rate of 15% through 1980. But slightly lower rates are assumed in this
report - ranging from 10-12% annually through 1985 - considering the con-
straints mentioned in the preceeding paragraph.
3.10      The higher NPK consumption growth rate anticipated in the NFP is
primarily due to a much faster demand growth assumed for nitrogen, since
those for phosphates and potash are in line with the estimates in this
report. While more intensive application of fertilizers and higher levels
r  of agricultural productivity imply an increasingly larger proportion of N
relative to P205 application, the evolving cropping pattern and the opening
of new cultivated areas, which require relatively more P 0 than N, are ex-
,2 5
pected to result in only a minor change in the country s overall NPK consump-
tion ratio.



- 7 -
The regional 1/ distribution of fertilizer consumption is also assumed to
follow the pattern of the last few years with about 10% of total consumption
occuring in the Northeast, 60% in the Center and 30% in the South.
3.11      On the other hand, the pattern of future fertilizer supply is
expected to differ dramatically from the present as a direct result of the
NFP. While self-sufficiency by 1980 will not be achieved, during the early
1980s domestic fertilizer supply is expected to account for 60% to 70% of
total NPK consumption compared to about 40% at present. Potash (K 0) will
remain the main import and there will be near self-sufficiency in   and P205.

Northeast: The rest of the States.
Because of its negligible role in the fertilizer sector, the North is
not referred to in this report.

The above estimate takes into account only those projects that are firmly
planned and have a reasonable chance of finding the necessary financing.
Thus, the projected gap between demand and production for 1985 should be
interpreted as an indication of what additional projects would be needed
in the sector. To keep abreast of the investment plans in the fertilizer
sector and to ensure that new plants are built in accordance with as real-
istic demand projections as possible, the Government has confirmed that it
will exchange views with the Bank from time to time regarding the expansion
and development of the fertilizer sector, including investment plans and
import and pricing policies.
3.12      The forecast of the national demand/supply situation masks some
sharp regional and structural differences in the pattern of local production
as described in more detail in Annex 3-2. The South region will not produce
any basic N product through the mid-1980s while the Center region 1/ is ex-
pected to produce by 1982 about 80% of its N demand. The Northeast, however,
will start exporting substantial N products to the South and Center regions as
early as 1978 and through possibly the end of the 1980s. The inter-regional
movement of phosphatic fertilizers, on the other hand, is not expected to
reach any significant volume. The South could produce up to 80% of its
phosphatic fertilizer needs by 1980, but all production will be based on
imported raw materials such as phosphate rock and/or phosphoric acid since
no phosphate rock deposit has yet been found in that region. The Northeast
will achieve self-sufficiency in phosphate products by 1979, but similarly,
all production will also be based on imported raw materials. The Center
region is also expected to be self-sufficient in phosphate products by 1979
and may even be capable of shipping a limited quantity to the South after
1980. In contrast to the two other regions, the Center will be using an
increasingly large proportion of local phosphate rock, since its production
is expected to increase from about 19% of total P 205 demand in the region
in 1976 to 80% by 1979 and 95% or more by 1982 2/.
E.   Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
3.13      About 90% of total fertilizer distribution is effected through
blenders which are either owned by fertilizer manufacturers (25% of total),
independent companies (65%) or cooperatives (10%). The Government intends
private firms to continue the handling, marketing and distribution functions
in the sector. However, the rapid expansion of consumption expected in the
next few years, and changing pattern of supply, might create a severe strain
on the existing fertilizer marketing and distribution network. To analyze
potential bottlenecks, and their effect on future fertilizer consumption,
the Government, in connection with the Bank's loan for the Araucaria project,
undertook a marketing and distribution study under satisfactory terms of
reference. The study began in October 1976, and its results are expected
to be available by late 1977.
1/   The VALEFERTIL project is located and will market all its production
in the Center region.
2/   The Center's phosphate rock production by 1982 is expected to represent
close to 60% of the total national phosphate consumption.



- 9 -
F.   The Market and Marketing of VALEFERTIL's Production
3.14      VALEFERTIL's production will be marketed in the Center region
with most of the sales concentrated in its middle and western sections.
Fertilizer (NPK) consumption in the region has grown at an average annual
rate of about 20% during 1966-76; and the NPK consumption ratio has averaged
1:2:1.3 during 1972-76.  At present, only about 50% of P 05 consumption in
the region is in the form of high analysis products, such as TSP and MAP;
but this proportion is expected to reach 60% by 1980 and 70% by 1985, re-
flecting the convenience and the transport cost advantage, on a nutrient
basis, of these products over the low analysis products such as SSP and
thermo-phosphates.
3.15      Although the South is the most intensive user of fertilizers, the
Center region, with its larger cultivated area, accounted for about 60% of
total NPK consumption and 54% of P 205 consumption in Brazil during 1972-76.
This pattern is expected to continue through 1985. The forecast of the
phosphate fertilizer demand/supply situation in the Center region (Annex 3-2)
is summarized below indicating a shift from a deficit situation up to 1978,
to a potential small surplus during 1980-83. By 1984 any surplus will
probably have disappeared and a deficit situation could again occur by 1985.

3.16      The P 0  demand forecast for the Center region assumes an annual
growth rate of i0@ during 1977-80 and 9% during 1981-85, the same rates used
for the national P 20  demand forecast.  Should demand grow even only slightly
higher than these ra5es, the surplus projected for 1980-83 will not materialize.
In any case, this surplus is expected to be modest, ranging from 100,000 to
150,000 TPY of P 0 and exists because four firms have the flexibility of pro-
ducing either only5SSP, equivalent to 210,000 TPY of P 20, or a combination of
SSP and TSP, the latter based on imported phosphoric acid, for an equivalent
of 300,000 TPY of P205 (the basis for the assumed surplus).  The production
forecast above assumes that during 1980 through 1983, these four firms will
adjust their product mix between SSP and TSP to avoid any significant surplus
in the region. It appears therefore that the Center region will not need
additional P205 product capacity other than the  VALEFERTIL and the ARAFERTIL



- 10 -
projects until about 1984. By 1985 or 1986, additional capacity of about
100,000 TPY of P 20  will be needed each year  to keep production in line with
increases in deman .
3.17      Ribeirao Preto, some 180 km south of Uberaba, is the center of
gravity of fertilizer consumption in the Center region at present. During
the next five to ten years, this center of gravity is expected to move closer
to Uberaba, thus further improving the location advantage of Uberaba as the
project site. But because of the dominance of imported fertilizer raw mate-
rials and products at present, most of the existing manufacturing and blending
facilities are located close to the coast in Sao Paulo and Santos. Since
VALEFERTIL intends to manufacture only bulk products for sale to blenders/
mixers, additional blending/mixing facilities will have to be located inland,
close to Uberaba and the project's target market, to take full advantage of
transportation savings. VALEFERTIL has completed, through CVRD's engineering
and planning division and the Brazilian consulting firm Economia Estatistica
e Planejamento Ltda. (EEP), a study of the spatial distribution of fertil-
izer consumption in the Center region. The study will provide the basis for
identifying potential locations for new blending/mixing facilities and the
likely product transport pattern for VALEFERTIL. VALEFERTIL then intends to
assist private blending/mixing firms and financial institutions, in developing
and implementing a program for blending/mixing as well as storage and distri-
bution projects.
3.18      The development of VALEFERTIL's marketing plans and related blend-
ing/mixing facilities is a critical step to ensuring the success of the
project. So far, VALEFERTIL has not appointed a marketing manager who
will be responsible for developing such plans, but VALEFERTIL has agreed
that a marketing manager will be appointed by September 1, 1977, in time
to participate in the development of the organizational plans for the Com-
pany (paras 2.03 and 2.04) and to formulate, in consultation with the Bank,
specific marketing plans for the project by December 31, 1977.
3.19      VALEFERTIL's production is expected to account for 25% to 30% of
the P2 5 production in the Center region during 1980-85, making the Company
an important factor in the industry. The marketing risks for the project,
however, are considered minimal, since there is sufficient time to develop
the necessary marketing and distribution network. The Government's national
fertilizer marketing and distribution study (para 3.13), expected to be
completed by late 1977, should also provide additional information on the
required investments in marketing and distribution facilities in the region.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope and Location
4.01      The project consists of (a) two sulphuric acid units each with
a design capacity of 1,300 tons per day (TPD) of 98.5% acid; (b) two
phosphoric acid units each with a design capacity of 470 TPD of P 20  in the
form of 52% acid; (c) a 1,000 TPD MAP unit; (d) a 1,100 TPD TSP unit; (e)



- 11 -
storage facilities for 30,000 tons of sulphuric acid, 8,500 tons of pho-
sphoric acid, 4,000 tons of ammonia, 2,500 tons of fuel oil, 28,000 tons of
sulphur, and 100,000 tons of finished products; (f) a rail spur and 25 ammonia
tankwagons; and (g) ancillary facilities such as offices, laboratories,
maintenance shops, effluent treatment, and the supply of utilities. VALEP
will provide the phosphate rock storage facilities (para 4.04). The ammonia
tankwagons are needed since the railways do not have enough of these spe-
cialized wagons nor do they intend to purchase any for this project. Because
the project would be the first to use the Tapira phosphate rock, there are
inherent uncertainties as to the achievable efficiency of the phosphoric acid
production process. The phosphoric acid units have therefore been designed
with additional safety factors in the reactors and filters. Should the actual
production experience approximate the test results, the phosphoric acid units
may have about 10% more capacity than indicated above. To take advantage of
this potential additional phosphoric acid, the design capacities of the TSP
unit and the sulphuric acid units are slightly larger than what would be
needed to just match the phosphoric acid design capacity indicated above. On
the basis of this phosphoric acid design capacity, the project will have an
annual production capacity of 330,000 TPY of MAP (10-51-0) and 340,000 TPY of
TSP (0-48.5-0). The design capacities of the different units are within
the range presently installed elsewhere in industrial countries and give the
project the advantages of economies of scale. A process flow chart is shown
in Annex 4-1.
4.02      The project site (Annex 4-2) is within a recently established
industrial park located along the right bank of the Rio Grande river, 37 km
south of Uberaba City, an important crossroads in the Center region, with
transportation links to Goiania, Brasilia, Montes Claros, Belo Horizonte, Sao
Paulo and Santos. VALEFERTIL has already acquired the 48 ha of land needed
for the project. Soil investigations and land grading have been completed.
The project is the first to be erected in the industrial park, which is
located between the proposed FEPASA branch railroad (Uberaba-Ribeirao Preto)
currently in the early stages of construction, and the Goiania-Sao Paulo
highway, ensuring adequate transport means. The FEPASA branch railroad is
included in the Bank's Third Railway Loan (Loan No. 1171-BR, Nov. 12, 1975)
and is expected to be completed by December 1978, about six months earlier
than the VALEFERTIL Project. VALEFERTIL has agreed to enter, by September 30,
1977, into a contract with FEPASA for the construction of a rail spur to the
plant site, and the provision of railroad cars for the transport of sulphur,
fuel oil and finished products. The external power requirements of the
project will be provided through a nearby existing 30,000 KVA substation which
is connected to the hydroelectric power plants along the Rio Grande river. A 2
km water pipeline from the Rio Grande river to the factory, with associated
water treatment facilities, will supply the water for the project and is
included in the project scope.
B.   Technology
4.03      To achieve a 99.5% efficiency in the conversion of sulphur to
sulphuric acid and to minimize pollution, the project will use the Bayer-
Lurgi double catalyst process which involves a two-stage catalytic conver-
sion and a two-stage absorption operation. Basic engineering for the



-12-
sulphuric acid units will be provided by Lurgi (F.R. Germany). The phosphoric
acid units will be based on the Rhone-Poulenc (France) process which provided
the most favorable test results using samples of beneficiated Tapira phosphate
rock. Basic engineering for the phosphoric acid units will be provided by
Krebs (France) and for the MAP and the TSP units by Gulf Design, a division
of Badger (USA), based on the Swift-Gulf Design process for MAP and the Gulf
Design process for TSP. A description of the different production processes
and the plant facilities is given in Annex 4-3. All the processes are commer-
cially proven and the engineering firms 1/ experienced, and there are no
unusual risks involved.
C.   Phosphate Rock Supply and the VALEP Project
4.04      Beneficiated phosphate rock (35% P 05) for the project will be
supplied by VALEP from its phosphate mining-beneficiation project currently
under construction at Tapira, some 118 km from the VALEFERTIL project site
(Annex 4-2). The beneficiated phosphate rock will be transported as a slurry
through a nine-inch (internal diameter) underground steel pipeline designed
and being constructed for VALEP by Bechtel (USA), an experienced engineering
firm. Phosphate rock dewatering, drying and storage facilities at the pipe-
line terminal (i.e., adjacent to the VALEFERTIL plant site) are included in
the VALEP project scope. A review of the topographical survey for the pipe-
line and its system design confirms the technical soundness of the scheme and
the pipeline is free from any serious risks. The VALEP project is expected
to be completed by August 1978, some 11 months earlier than the VALEFERTIL
project, and the initial production will be sold to manufacturers in the Sao
Paulo area. A description of the VALEP project, including capital and operat-
ing costs, is given in Annex 4-4.
4.05      The Tapira deposit has low grade phosphate rock, containing an
average of only 8% P 205 compared to the 12% to 16% found in the Catalao, the
Araxa, and the Patos deposits in the region and to the 20%-30% usually found
in the commercial deposits in other countries. The beneficiation process,
a locally developed technology, is similar to the process which has been well-
proven at Jacupiranga 2/; it has also been tested at the ARAFERTIL industrial
pilot plant at Araxa and additional laboratory tests are being done to optimize
and verify the most efficient production parameters. The P 0 recovery in the
beneficiation process is expected to range from 60% to 70% whlch is very satis-
factory; the process does not present any unacceptable risks.
1/   The engineering firms (and associated processes) were selected from
among seven different international firms. VALEFERTIL was assisted
by FLUOR/NATRON and by process engineering consultants (DUETAG-France)
in the selection.
2/   The Jacupiranga phosphate deposit, in the State of Sao Paulo, provides
rock to the QUIMBRASIL phosphate fertilizer complex which started
operations in 1969 (Annex 3-2).



- 13 -
4.06      The VALEP project scope had been finalized before the Bank was
requested to assist the VALEFERTIL project. The VALEP beneficiation plant
was designed based on 7,000 hours per year (HPY) of operation. However,
because of heavy rainfall and poor drainage conditions during six months
of the year, mining is expected to be hampered and the beneficiation plant
can be expected to operate for only 6,000 HPY. This would mean that the
VALEP design capacity is 15% short of the VALEFERTIL requirements, although
a review of the sizes of the equipment actually ordered indicates that it
may have just enough achievable capacity to meet the design needs of
VALEFERTIL, as all discussed in greater detail in Annex 4-4. The benefi-
ciation plant's capacity can also be increased by 15% with an additional
investment of about US$5 million. However, this debottlenecking is best
carried out after both VALEP and VALEFERTIL have gained adequate operating
experience. Agreement was reached with CVRD and VALEFERTIL that after
VALEFERTIL has operated for about two years, the Company will undertake
a joint study with VALEP to analyze the feasibility of increasing and/or
balancing the outputs of the two projects. The results of the study will
be made available to the Bank. If appropriate, a debottlenecking program,
acceptable to the Bank, will also be implemented.
4.07      For the above reasons, VALEFERTIL will have to have access to other
sources of phosphate rock, should VALEP's production be inadequate for what-
ever reason. To this end, agreement has been obtained with the Government,
CVRD and VALEFERTIL that the project will be allowed to use, and will util-
ize, other sources of phosphate rock, either domestic or foreign, if needed
to operate the project at full capacity. It is thereby expected that the
benefits from the additional output will outweigh the higher cost of other
rocks and the likely lower efficiency of the phosphoric acid plant because
the characteristics of these other rocks are different from the VALEP rock
for which the VALEFERTIL project has been designed. To ensure adequate
flexibility in using alternative phosphate rocks, the Technical Advisers
(para 4.09) will be asked by the Company to review the designs of the facil-
ities included in the VALEFERTIL project and propose measures that will pro-
vide such flexibility. VALEFERTIL will also enter, by December 1977 and
after consultations with the Bank, into a long-term phosphate rock supply
agreement with VALEP, to cover at least the design requirements of the
VALEFERTIL project, and to obligate VALEP to jointly undertake the debot-
tlenecking study mentioned above.
D.   Project Management and Implementation
4.08      The project will be implemented by VALEFERTIL through its own small
project team headed by a Project Manager who will report to the Project Im-
plementation Director (Annex 2-1). The project team, which will be strength-
ened with Technical Advisers (para 4.09), will supervise and coordinate the
work of the process licensors/basic engineering firms (para 4.03) and the
general engineering firm. The general engineering firm is a consortium
of FLUOR Latin America Inc., a subsidiary of the FLUOR Corporation (USA),



- 14 -
and NATRON Consultoria e Projetos S.A. (Brazil) 1/; the consortium will pro-
vide overall project management, detailed engineering of process plants and
engineering of offsite facilities, procurement services, management of sub-
contracted construction and erection services, and supervision of commission-
ing. The process licensors will assist NATRON in detailed engineering design
and train VALEFERTIL personnel in the operation and maintenance of the pro-
cess plants. FLUOR will head the consortium and will also undertake foreign
procurement; NATRON will undertake local procurement and supervision of con-
struction 2/. FLUOR is an experienced international engineering company and
the implementation arrangement is satisfactory. Basic engineering is almost
complete and procurement of equipment started in January 1977 using Bank
guidelines. The project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4-5 with
the start of commercial operation planned for July 1979.
4.09      Neither VALEFERTIL nor CVRD has any previous experience in cons-
tructing and operating a large fertilizer plant. To strengthen VALEFERTIL's
(and the project team's) technical capabilities in supervising the engineer-
ing firms, in commissioning and initial plant operations, the Company is
presently negotiating 3/ and intends to contract by May 1977, foreign
technical advisory services through an experienced firm. The terms of ref-
erence for the technical assistance have been found satisfactory by the Bank
and include an evaluation of the project design to permit the use of other
phosphate rocks (para 4.07).
E.   Employment and Training
4.10      The project will provide direct employment for about 450 people,
most of whom will be skilled or semi-skilled technicians. The staff will be
recruited from the existing fertilizer and chemical plants in Brazil and from
the city of Uberaba. Preliminary training plans for the technical staff have
been prepared and will be finalized after the Technical Advisers have made
their comments on the proposed program. Part of the technical training will
be arranged by the process licensors in plants using their respective tech-
nologies. VALEFERTIL also intends to finalize arrangements with existing
phosphate fertilizer companies in Brazil (e.g., ULTRAFERTIL) for some train-
ing in their facilities. The plans include training in safety and occupa-
tional health.
F.   Pollution Control
4.11      The process units of the project will be designed and engineered
to reduce pollutants in the effluents to acceptable standards. In the
1/   The engineering firm was chosen after receipt of international proposals
from foreign firms in association with qualified local firms.
2/   NATRON is associated in a similar way in the implementation of the
Bank-assisted Araucaria Fertilizer Project.
3/   Three proposals for technical advisory services were received and
evaluated by VALEFERTIL.

sulphuric acid plant, the high conversion efficiency of sulphur to sulphuric
acid (para 4.03) plus the use of two-stage demisters for the acid mists
after final absorption, reduces the contaminants in the effluent gases which
will be discharged into the atmosphere through a tall stack to ensure ade-
quate dilution. In the phosphoric acid plant, the major contaminant is
fluorine; but about 80% will be recovered as fluosilicic acid. VALEFERTIL
is presently evaluating two alternatives: selling the fluosilicic acid or
converting it to either cryolite or aluminum fluoride. The markets for
these two products and for fluosilicic acid are being evaluated and a choice
will be made with the assistance of the Technical Advisers who will be hired
shortly (para 4.09). Most of the remaining fluorine will be condensed and
discharged into a large pond designed to ensure no overflow. In an emergency,
the overflow will be treated with lime to precipitate the fluorine compounds.
A small amount of fluorine will escape with the gaseous effluents but will
not exceed 230 grams per ton of P205 produced. Gypsum, the by-product in
the production of phosphoric acid, will be dumped in gypsum ponds with
adequate capacity for the project's life. Finally, the effluent gases
from the MAP and the TSP units will be scrubbed to remove MAP dust, ammonia
(MAP unit) and fluorine dust (TSP unit). The Company will continuously
monitor the effluent streams. The pollution control system is described
more fully in Annex 4-3 and is satisfactory.
4.12      The pollution control system for the VALEP project (Annex 4-4) is
also satisfactory.
V. CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A.   Capital Cost
5.01      Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$294
million equivalent (Cr$3,350 million) of which US$104 million (Cr$1,179
million) is in foreign exchange. The capital cost estimate is based
on mid-1976 prices and already reflects the equipment price increases
experienced in 1975/76. Details of the capital cost estimate and the
assumptions used are given in Annexes 5-1 and 5-2 and are summarized
below:

/a   The costs expressed in Cr$ have been calculated from the US$ costs using
an exchange rate of Cr$11.40 = US$1.00 and are therefore only notional, as
changes in the exchange rate are expected (para 5.04).
/b   Includes US$19.4 (Cr$221) million equivalent of indirect foreign exchange
cost estimated as 25% of the value of locally purchased equipment plus 15%
of the civil works cost.
/c   The foreign exchange base cost estimate for engineering and other services
of US$10.2 million includes about US$0.8 million for the technical advisory
services while the local currency cost of US$16.2 million includes about
US$1.3 million for local management consultancy and other services.
/d   5% of the BCE for engineering and other services, land and site improve-
ment; 10% of the BCE for all other items.
/e   19.7% of the BCE and PC for civil works; 14.5% of the BCE and PC for all
other costs except engineering which has nc price escalation provision.
5.02      The equipment costs have been derived from estimates prepared in
October 1976 and reconfirmed in March 1977 by VALEFERTIL and FLUOR based on
a similar project in another country scheduled for completion in 1977. The
equipment base cost estimate also reflects the higher cost of items to be
procured in Brazil (para 5.09). The project already qualifies for an 80%
exemption from import duties on equipment but VALEFERTIL has requested for a
100% exemption. In the meantime, the cost estimate includes a provision for



- 17 -
duties on 20% of the CIF value of the imported equipment. The civil works
cost has been estimated by FLUOR/NATRON based on preliminary designs and
experience with similar civil construction in Brazil. The cost of process
licenses, engineering and other services are based on contracts already
signed in 1976 with the engineering firms and the process licensors. The
estimated cost of foreign engineering and technical services range from
US$4,500 to US$7,000 per man-month exclusive of travel and subsistence
allowances. The cost of local engineering and other consultancy services
range from US$2,000 to US$5,000 per man-month.
5.03      As noted, VALEFERTIL intends to sell the entire output in bulk
to fertilizer blenders/mixers. The estimates do not, therefore, include
bagging facilities. The investment required for the fluosilicic acid recov-
ery is included in the capital cost estimate but the cost of the facilities
for converting the fluosilicic acid to either cryolite or aluminum fluoride
(para 4.11) of about US$5 million (in constant 1976 US dollars) is not
included 1/; however, should VALEFERTIL decide to install these facilities,
CVRD has agreed that additional funds, equity and/or loans, as appropriate,
will be provided.
5.04      Price escalation for equipment is calculated on the basis of pro-
jected price increases of 9% for 1976 and 8% per year for 1977-79 in major
equipment supplying countries and worldwide inflation. No price escalation
is provided for engineering costs as the values given represent the amounts
estimated in the various contracts in current terms (Annex 5-2). Inter-
national price inflation has also been used for local supplies and services
expressed in US dollars on the assumption that differences in the domestic
and the international inflation rates will be accounted for by adjustments
in the foreign exchange rate. This assumption is based on the current govern-
ment policy which is expected to continue. On civil works however, escalation
rates of 13% for 1976 and 12% per year for 1977-79 have been assumed based on
experience in the recent past, that the cost of civil works in Brazil will
rise faster than the general price level. The above cost estimate including
the provisions for physical and for price contingencies is considered adequate.
5.05      The initial working capital requirement is estimated at US$33
million and details are given in Annex 5-3. Interest during construction is
calculated on the basis of total debt financing of US$176 million, which
1/   Traditionally, the fluosilicic acid is chemically treated with lime and
then discharged as a waste material. While this is a satisfactory
environmental protection method, it is generally economic to convert
the fluosilicic acid to either cryolite or aluminum fluoride if there
is a domestic market for these two products as shown in the Bank's
evaluation of similar pollution control projects in India (Report No.
928-IN, November 24, 1975). As the choice of product, i.e., cryolite
or aluminum fluoride, will be made only after a thorough market study
is completed (these two products are used in the aluminum industry and
therefore have a market in Brazil), the costs and the benefits of the
conversion facilities, or the benefits from the sales of the fluosilicic
acid, are not included in the financial or economic analysis of the
VALEFERTIL project.

corresponds to a debt/equity ratio of about 60:40. The assumed loan terms
and corresponding interest during construction are shown in Annex 5-4 for the
proposed Bank loan, Annex 5-5 for the other foreign loans, and Annex 5-6 for
the local loans.
B.   Financing Plan
5.06      The financing plan for the project is as follows:
VALEFERTIL - Proposed Financing Plan
In Millions of Cr$      In Millions of US$       %
Equity (CVRD)                          1,345                   118.0             40
Loans
Local Loans (BNDE/FINAME)              797                    70.0             24
Foreign Loans /a                       273                    24.0              8

Total Loans                    2,005                  176.0              60
Total Financing                        3,350                   294.0            100
/a   Suppliers credits and commercial banks.
CVRD will provide the equity funds equivalent to 40% of the required financing.
An analysis of CVRD's cash flow projections indicates that it should be able
to provide these funds as well as additional funds to cover cost overruns were
this to become necessary. The balance of the local currency financing will
come from a BNDE loan of about US$48 million and a medium-term loan from
FINAME of about US$22 million. The BNDE loan was signed December 27, 1976
for Cr$506 million (in December 1976 Cr$) equivalent to about US$41 million
in constant 1976 US dollars. Monetary correction during the disbursement
period is expected to raise actual disbursements to about US$48 million in
current terms. The loan has a maturity of 15 years including 3.5 years of
grace. The FINAME loan will be for at least 8 years including about 2.5 years
of grace. The FINAME loan and US$10 million of the BNDE loan will each sepa-
rately finance up to a maximum of 80% of the purchase price of the equipment
and materials to be bid among Brazilian suppliers only 1/. Foreign suppliers
credits of about US$4 million will be used towards proprietary equipment that
are not manufactured in Brazil. Finally, foreign commercial bank loans of
about US$20 million, although untied as to purpose, will be utilized to
cover, primarily the disbursements for local consultancy services after
mid-1977 (US$9.5 million), part of erection costs, and to supplement the
suppliers credits as well. This report assumes the foreign suppliers cred-
its and commercial loans to be for 8 years including 2.5 years of grace.
1/   VALEFERTIL has submitted to FINAME a list of equipment to be procured
locally and FINAME has formally indicated that it will finance up to 80%
of the ex-factory value of each equipment in the list. A separate loan
is made for each piece or group of equipment (i.e., purchase order)
financed by FINAME. Part of the BNDE loan (US$10 million) will finance
80% of a separate list of goods.



- 19 -
5.07      A Bank loan of US$82 million is proposed for 15 years including
3 years of grace at the standard interest rate plus a fee to the Government
to bring the total interest rate to VALEFERTIL to 10% per year. The Bank
loan will be made to VALEFERTIL which will bear the foreign exchange risk.
5.08      Agreement has been reached with the Government, CVRD and VALEFERTIL
regarding the financing plan as follows: (a) CVRD will assist VALEFERTIL
obtain the foreign suppliers credits and commercial bank loans (US$24 mil-
lion) to be repaid in not less than 7 years including a grace period of not
less than 2 years; (b) should a financing gap and/or cost overrun occur, CVRD
will ensure that both the VALEFERTIL and the VALEP projects will be provided
the necessary funds in the form of equity and/or loans to complete the respec-
tive projects and any subsequent debottlenecking program (para 4.06) without
delay. For purposes of this covenant, the VALEFERTIL project is considered
complete when the plant has been tested and proven to be satisfactory in
accordance with established engineering procedures, and has operated at an
average production rate of not less than 80% of the design capacity during
a period of 60 consecutive days. The VALEP project is considered complete
when the facilities have been in satisfactory operation for not less than 60
consecutive days including at least 15 consecutive days at an average produc-
tion rate of 80% (or better) of the project design capacity. In addition,
the funds should be provided in such a way that the debt/equity ratio would
not exceed 60:40 at completion of each project and the current ratio would
be at least 1.2:1.0; and finally (c)  as a back-up to CVRD's obligations, the
Government has ensured that all funds, including foreign exchange will be
provided as required to complete the VALEFERTIL and the VALEP projects without
delay and that all approvals for the implementation of these projects, includ-
ing import licenses will be provided in time.
C.   Procurement
5.09      Equipment, materials and the initial set of spare parts valued at
US$103 million for the VALEFERTIL project have been divided into three pro-
curement categories: (a) proprietary equipment that is not made in Brazil,
with an estimated FOB value of about US$4.5 million to be purchased using sup-
pliers credits supplemented with foreign commercial bank loans as necessary;
(b) items to be bid only among Brazilian suppliers with an estimated ex-
factory value of US$40.8 million to be financed with the BNDE/FINAME loans
(80%) and with equity funds (20%); and (c) items to be purchased using the
Bank's guidelines with an estimated FOB value of US$57.7 million of which
about US$50 million will be procured through international competitive bidding
(ICB) and the balance through international shopping. Of the items for local
procurement (US$40.8 million), equipment valued at some US$24 million is not
appropriate for international competition and is efficiently purchased in
Brazil. The remaining local equipment (about US$17 million) could possibly
cost up to 30% less if procured through international competition. As the
estimated increase in total project cost is less than 2%, and the local
capital goods industry is experiencing some underutilization of capacity
following the Government's and the industrial sector's cut-backs in capital
spending, the amount of the local procurement is considered reasonable.



- 20 -
5.10      For purchases to be financed with Bank funds, the list of goods and
their poterntial suppliers will require prior Bank approval and procurement
will follow Bank guidelines. Local suppliers will be allowed to participate
in international competitive bidding with a 15% (or the import duty rate if
lower) preference margin. On this basis, it is estimated that about 25%
(US$15 million) of the FOB value of the equipment to be financed by the
Bank will likely be won by Brazilian suppliers. Finally, the potential
suppliers of critical equipment not financed by the Bank will also require
prior Bank approval.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.11      The Bank loan will finance (a) 100% of the foreign exchange expen-
ditures for foreign engineering, process licenses and technical advisory
services (US$10.7 million); (b) 100% of the foreign expenditures 1/ (if
imported) or the ex-factory (if locally supplied) cost of equipment procured
through ICB (US$54.0 million); (c) the foreign expenditures for imported items
and packages costing less than US$100,000 each to be purchased through inter-
national shopping (US$8.3 million); and (d) interest during construction on
the Bank loan (US$9.0 million). The foreign engineering services proposed
for Bank financing have already been contracted. Retroactive financing
for disbursements after August 15, 1976 for these services of up to US$6.2
million is therefore recommended.  About US$5 million worth of equipment con-
tracts eligible for Bank financing will have been made before May 1977, the
expected signing date for the proposed Bank loan. However, no retroactive
financing will be needed for equipment purchases as VALEFERTIL has already
made satisfactory arrangements to open letters-of-credit for these contracts
and the contracts will stipulate that initial payments will be made only after
May 1977. If necessary, CVRD has agreed to guarantee these letters-of-credit.
The proposed allocation of the Bank loan is shown in Annex 5-7 and the esti-
mated disbursement schedule is given in Annex 5-8.
VI. FINANCIAL A4ALYSIS
A.   Operating Costs and Financial Forecasts
6.01      Production is assumed to start at 50% capacity utilization and reach
the steady state at 90% in the second full year of operation (1981). Depre-
ciation charges (Annex 6-1) are on a straight-line basis over 12 years. The
estimated product and raw material prices over the project's operating life,
expressed in constant 1976 US dollars are shown in Annex 6-1. The MAP and the
TSP ex-factory prices are assumed at US$280/ton and US$225/ton respectively,
i.e., at levels competitive with imports on a net-of-tax basis delivered to
the market area.
1/   Foreign expenditures for equipment and materials include ocean freight
and insurance. The difference between the FOB value of US$57.7 million
used in para 5.09 and the US$62.3 for (b) and (c) combined is ocean
freight and insurance.



- 21 -
6.02      The delivered price of the phosphate rock is taken to be US$55/ton
as tentatively agreed between VALEP and VALEFERTIL. This rock price is
mid-way between what VALEP would otherwise get from alternative users in the
coastal area of Sao Paulo or Santos (US$45/ton ex-pipeline terminal) and the
cost to VALEFERTIL of using imported rock (US$65/ton delivered). But this
transfer price can be maintained only if VALEP operates efficiently and at
high rates of capacity utilization because its cost of mining and beneficia-
tion, as discussed in Annex 4-4, is relatively high, about US$37/ton (includ-
ing depreciation but excluding financial charges) delivered to the VALEFERTIL
complex, which provides only a modest financial rate of return of 9% before
taxes for VALEP. The other two raw materials, sulphur and ammonia, have a
delivered cost of US$95/ton and US$215/ton respectively on the assumption
that no import duty would be levied on raw materials. 1/
6.03      Raw materials account for about 68% of the project's production
cost, with phosphate rock representing 41% and sulphur and ammonia another
27%. Depreciation charges contribute just 15% of the production cost. The
production cost structure is shown in Annexes 6-2 and 6-3; it is summarized
below and is typical for phosphate fertilizer projects. It differs from that
of ammonia/urea projects where raw materials account for about one-third and
the depreciation charges another one-third of the production cost.
1/   Ammonia will be initially imported and after 1981, will probably be sup-
plied from the proposed ammonia/urea project at Norte Fluminense (Annex
3-2). Sulphur will be imported.

Annexes 6-4 through 6-6 and projections of the income, cash flow and the

Annexes 6-7 through 6-9. These projections are expressed in current US
dollars, with both costs and revenues escalated at the assumed international
inflation rates (Annex 5-2) and are summarized on the following page.
6.05      The financial forecasts indicate a satisfactory financial situation
for VALEFERTIL, with a debt service coverage ratio in excess of 1.7 times on
reaching 90% capacity utilization and the capacity to start distributing
dividends in 1981. Dividend payments for the more successful Brazilian firms
range from 7-12% of equity (revalued for monetary adjustments). The forecasts
assume dividend payments equivalent to 10% of the equity at the start of each
year. Even with this level of dividends, the Company is still expected to
accumulate significant funds for new investments. The debt/equity ratio
improves rapidly from 60:40 in 1979 to 38:62 in 1982. The profit and cash
breakeven points do not exceed 62% and 52% respectively. On reaching 90%
capacity utilization in 1981, the project could still show a profit breakeven
operation even if phosphate rock prices increased by 50% or if product prices
decreased by 15% (Annex 6-7).

B.   Financial Rate of Return
6.06      The cost/benefit streams for the financial rate of return are
expressed in constant 1976 US dollars (Annex 6-10). The return is sat-
isfactory, 14% before and 11% after income taxes. Sensitivity tests
(Annex 6-10) show that under moderately adverse conditions, such as a 10%
increase in capital costs, or a 5% reduction in ex-factory prices, or a 10%
increase in operating costs, the after tax rate of return will still be at
least 8%. Should VALEFERTIL's steady state production be 100% rather than
the 90% capacity utilization assumed here as a result of the potentially
higher capacity in the phosphoric acid plant (para 4.01), the financial
rate of return improves to 12.8% after taxes.



- 24 -
C.   Financial Covenants
6.07      VALEFERTIL has agreed to follow prudent financial practices, and,
after the start of commercial operation, observe the following: (a) main-
tain a debt/equity ratio of 60:40 or better; (b) maintain a current ratio
of 1.2:1.0 or better, (c) not incur any long-term debt if its future debt
service coverage ratio will fall below 1.5; (d) limit its dividend or other
cash distributions (except for dividends on preferred shares), or equity
investments and/or loans to subsidiaries (if any), or prepayment of any debt
if such action would cause its current ratio to fall below 1.5; and (e) until
December 1985, consult with the Bank before undertaking any expansion program
or any other investment not related to the project exceeding USe5 million
annually. The Company's accounts will continue to be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank (para 2.04).
D.   Major Risks
6.08      The Tapira phosphate rock will be mined, beneficiated and used
in a fertilizer plant for the first time. Although CVRD has extensive iron
ore mining experience, it and VALEP do not have prior experience in phosphate
rock mining and beneficiation. Moreover, neither CVRD nor VALEFERTIL has
previous experience in the phosphate fertilizer field. Thus, there are
inherent uncertainties as to the final performance of the processes and
the interdependent operations in the mining-beneficiation-fertilizer pro-
duction stages. Several technical risk areas have been identified and dis-
cussed in Chapter IV. In summary, the technical risk areas are: (a) VALEP's
mining, beneficiation technology and plant capacity (para 4.05 to 4.07); and
(b) VALEFERTIL's phosphoric acid plant design and the Company's technical
experience and organization (paras 2.04 and 4.09). As indicated earlier, the
risks in all these areas have either been reduced or are to be reduced to
acceptable levels on the basis of actions taken or to be undertaken by VALEP
and VALEFERTIL. For example, the phosphoric acid plant has been designed with
additional safety factors to ensure that the design capacity will be achieved
and VALEFERTIL will engage Technical Advisers to strengthen its management.
6.09      Market risks are minimal as the project is favorably located to a
market area where fertilizer consumption is already substantial and demand
is expected to grow at a minimum rate of 10% annually. The project's output
is expected to be easily absorbed by the market. In addition, the Government's
on-going fertilizer market and marketing study (para 3.13) should provide the
basis for the development of the necessary distribution network and pricing
policy at the farm level that can support this projected increase in fertil-
izer use. Product pricing is not a serious risk as the Government has so far
maintained and intends to continue a policy of allowing manufacturers to earn
a reasonable return by permitting prices to rise in line with increases in
production costs. The Government has reconfirmed that it will continue the
policy of allowing efficient producers to earn a reasonable return on invest-
ment.



- 25 -
6.10      When the CDI (Council for Industrial Development), a government
agency under the Ministry of Industry, formally approved the VALEFERTIL
project in October 1976 thereby granting it an 80% exemption from import
duties, it imposed the condition that VALEFERTIL give priority consideration
to the use of ARAFERTIL's Araxa rock in any expansion program 1/. It is likely
that ARAFERTIL would have implemented its own fertilizer project long before
VALEFERTIL will be in a position to invest in an expansion program, thereby
relieving VALEFERTIL of the CDI condition. Nonetheless, the CDI condition
poses a minor risk in that instead of an optimal expansion of the VALEP-
VALEFERTIL system, some less economic investment program may be imposed.
As noted in para 6.07, the financial covenants will therefore require
VALEFERTIL to consult with the Bank before undertaking any other major
financial commitments. The Government has also confirmed that the CDI
condition does not apply to any debottlenecking or balancing program in-
volving the present project facilities of VALEFERTIL.
VII.  ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   World Fertilizer Supply and Economic Prices
7.01      International fertilizer prices have decreased substantially
from the 1974-75 peak and by 1977 have come down to about the same level
as 1972-73. But the downward trend is not expected to continue; instead,
over the next decade, prices (in real terms) are projected to move along a
gradually rising trend line, reflecting the higher capital cost of additional
capacity, the increasing cost of raw materials, and the continued growth in
demand. In the economic analysis, all costs and prices during the project's
operating life have been expressed in constant 1976 US dollars. In addition,
a shadow foreign exchange rate, 25% higher than the official rate (i.e.,
Cr$14.25 = US$1.00), is used to reflect foreign trade distortions caused
by import tariffs, export taxes and subsidies, as well as other forms of
import restrictions and export incentives.
7.02      As the project's output will substitute for imports, the economic
ex-factory prices of the VALEFERTIL products have been estimated on the
basis of the delivered cost of imports to the market area. During the opera-
ting life of the project, the CIF prices of MAP and TSP imported into Brazil
have been estimated as US$245/ton and US$195/ton respectively on the basis
of the production costs plus a reasonable return on investment for new,
export-oriented foreign plants built with only modest investments for in-
frastructure and having access to high grade phosphate rock, sulphur and
ammonia, all assumed to be produced in the fertilizer (MAP, TSP) exporting
country and priced at the respective FOB costs. This slightly underestimates
the CIF prices as it is rare for a factory to be located in a place that
exports all three raw materials. However, the resulting product prices are
still about 5% to 10% higher than the prices that could be expected from
the most efficient existing producers with access to nearby raw materials
1/   ARAFERTIL's Araxa deposit is located 30 km from VALEP's Tapira deposit.

sources and whose facilities were built at lower capital costs. But since
the projected demand for phosphatic products greatly exceeds the existing
capacity, the additional international supply will have to be provided from
new plants. Consequently, the marginal cost of the additional phosphate
fertilizer supply will have to be based on the production cost of the new
plants. Port handling in Brazil and inland transport costs, converted at
the shadow exchange rate, are added to the CIF price to arrive at the eco-
nomic ex-factory price of US$265/ton of MAP and US$213/ton of TSP (Annex
6-1).
7.03      Although the economic cost of imported phosphate rock delivered
to Uberaba is about US$60/ton, the VALEP rock to be used by the project has
been given an economic cost of US$45/ton, ex-pipeline terminal, on the basis
of its value in its best alternative use (Annex 6-1). The VALEP project was
started in 1975 (Annex 4-4), following the steep increase in the international
prices of phosphate rock and fertilizers during 1974. It was also apparent,
especially when international prices began to decline by the end of 1975, that
it would be more economical to process the VALEP rock closer to the mine and
the market area, rather than transporting the rock all the way to the coast
for processing and then transporting the finished product back inland to the
market. Furthermore, as Brazil needed additional phosphoric acid and phos-
phatic fertilizer capacity, this additional capacity could optimally be
located close to the phosphate deposit. Without the VALEFERTIL project,
the VALEP project would still proceed but its output would have to be sold
to existing producers in Sao Paulo. Because of the transportation cost, the
VALEP rock would have an ex-pipeline terminal price of only US$45/ton if it
were to be competitive with imported rock delivered to the coastal manufac-
turers.
7.04      The estimated economic cost of production is shown in Annexes 6-2
and 6-3 using either the shadow or the official foreign exchange rate. The
economic production cost indicates the large share (83%) of raw material
costs in the total economic production cost.

/a   At 90% capacity utilization and the shadow exchange rate.



- 27 -
B.   Economic Rate of Return
7.05      At 90% capacity utilization, the project will produce 300,000 TPY
of P 0 with an ex-factory value of US$152 million annually (in constant
19762US dollars) using the financial prices and the official foreign exchange
rate. The direct net foreign exchange savings of the project is about US$65
million annually before provisions for principal and interest payments on
the foreign loans. For the economic analysis, three adjustments have been
made on the financial costs and benefits to arrive at the economic costs
and benefits, namely: (a) an economic rock cost of US$45/ton compared to
a financial price of US$55/ton; (b) the use of a shadow foreign exchange
rate; and (c) the elimination of import duties and taxes in the economic
costs.  The economic value of the project's output is about US$144 million
annually (in constant 1976 US dollars) and the economic rate of return
is satisfactory at 22% (Annex 7-1).  The return justifies the high priority
accorded by the Government to the expansion of the local fertilizer produc-
tion capacity.  The project's import substitution role, its economies of
scale, as well as its favorable location with respect to both the source
of phosphate rock and the market, account for the satisfactory rate of re-
turn. Sensitivity tests (Annex 7-1) indicate that the return would still
be about 15% even if operating costs increase by 10% and product prices
decline by 10%.
C.   Economic Analysis of the Combined VALEFERTIL and VALEP Projects
7.06      The import substitution effort of Brazil in the phosphate fertilizer
area not only involves the domestic production of finished products but also
includes the production of phosphate rock concentrates to replace raw material
imports. Thus, the VALEFERTIL project is just the final stage of a two-stage
import substitution process, the first stage being the VALEP project which
will produce phosphate rock concentrate containing 35% P 05 from the low grade
(8% P205) phosphate deposit at Tapira. The economic anaiysis of this two-stage
process is done by treating the two projects as an integrated undertaking.
The analysis shows that the economic rate of return of the combined projects
is 16.6% (Annex 7-2). This rate is similar to the economic rate of return
of the VALEFERTIL project if it were designed to use imported phosphate rock
instead of local rock. Should both VALEP and VALEFERTIL produce at 100%
rather than the assumed 90% capacity utilization, the economic rate of return
of the combined ventures would improve to 18.4%. Thus, in addition to ensuring
a dependable source of fertilizer supplies, Brazil also has economic justifica-
tion not only to produce phosphate fertilizers, but to develop its low grade
phosphate deposits; provided the deposit and the phosphate fertilizer facili-
ties are both located close to the market area and take full advantage of the
savings in transport cost to offset the high production cost of the phosphate
rock concentrate. The importance of avoiding transportation costs is illus-
trated by the low economic rate of return, only 9.6% for the VALEP project,
if there were no VALEFERTIL project and VALEP's output had to be sold to
manufacturers in the coastal area. The combined projects have a direct net



- 28 -
foreign exchange savings of about US$100 million annually (in constant 1976
US dollars) before provisions for principal and interest payments on the for-
eign loans.
D.   Other Benefits
7.07      The Government has been encouraging the location of industries away
from the congested Sao Paulo-Rio de Janeiro coastal corridor and towards the
less industrially developed regions such as the Northeast and the western
section of the Center region. VALEP's low-grade phosphate deposit is located
in the industrially less developed area of the Center region. The exploita-
tion of this deposit and installation of the VALEFERTIL phosphate fertilizer
plant is an important element of the regional industrialization objectives
of Brazil. In addition, the project will accelerate the development of the
fertilizer marketing and distribution system in that part of Brazil, thereby
providing support to the agricultural development programs in that area.
7.08      The project will also contribute significantly toward increasing
Brazil's self-sufficiency in fertilizers and help reduce the country's reli-
ance on cyclical and erratic international supply sources and prices. Brazil
should then be able to pursue its agricultural production growth objectives
with more certainty about the supply of fertilizers as well as more stable
domestic fertilizer prices. Agriculture, both for domestic consumption and
exports, will continue to be a major component of Brazil's economy and an
important source of growth in economic output.
7.09      During commercial operations, the project will provide about 450
jobs in production 1/ and a much larger number in the subsequent distribution
network. During construction the project will employ about 3,000 workers
at the peak level and provide additional jobs in the engineering and equip-
ment industries. Although this cannot be accurately estimated, the impact
can be gauged by the dollar value of the local engineering and other con-
sultancy services to be provided by NATRON (para 4.08), the management
consulting firm (para 2.03) and the marketing consultants (para 3.17) at
a cost of about US$17 million (61% of the total cost for services); and the
expected value of the locally supplied equipment of about US$56 million which
is about 54% of the total equipment value on an FOB basis.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Agreement was reached on the following:
1.   From the Government that it will:

BRAZIL - VALEFERTIL FERTILIZER PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF COMMON TERMS IN THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY
Acqua Ammonia : Solution of ammonia in water. Solubility of ammonia in
water depends greatly on temperature. At 00C (32 F), solubility is about
900 grams per liter and only 7.4 g/lt at 1000C (212 F). Acqua ammonia is
also used as fertilizer by dissolving anhydrous ammonia in irrigation
water.
AAmmonium Carbamate : An intermediate chemical formed in solution during
synthesis of urea from carbon dioxide and ammonia. On reduction in pressure
it decomposes into urea with the formation of byproduct water. Ammonium
carbamate is a highly corrosive material and requires the use of special
materials in equipment required to handle it.
Ammonium Chloride : NHhCl is obtained as a co-product in the manufacture
of sodium carbonate and is used as a fertilizer for some crops and types
of soil.
Azmonia Feedstocks are the sources of hydrcgen used for ammonia production.
Except for the minor use of hydrogen produced by electrolysing water, the
principal feedstocks are hydrocarbons such as natural gas, naphtha, heavy
fuel oil and coal.
Ammonium Nitrate (AN) or chemically NHhNO3 is produced by reacting ammonia
with nitric acid. Nitric acid (HN03), in turn, is made from ammonia. AN1/
contains 33.5% nitrogen, half in the ammonium form and half in the nitrate
form, and is very hygroscopic. It also is a commercial explosive. In many
countries, a diluent--e.g. limestone--is added to lower the analysis and
negate the explosive properties as well as to minimize the hygroscopic
properties. Mixed with small amounts of fuel oil it is known as ANFO
explosives used in open pit mining.
Ammonium Sulphate (AS) : Reaction product of ammonia and sulphuric acid
(NH)2 SO[.  It should contain not less than 20.5% N.
Anhydrous Ammonia : (NH3) A gas containing approximately 82% nitrogen.
Under pressure, amonia gas is changed to a liquid and is usually stored
and transported in this form. Anhydrous ammonia is used to make most of
the solid forms of nitrogenous fertilizers and also is used for direct
application to the soil either as a gas or in the form of aqua aomonia.
Bagged Fertilizer : Solid fertilizers delivered to the user in bags. Net
weight of the bagged fertilizer is commonly 100 lbs, 50 kg and 100 kg.
1/ Fertilizer grade.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
Biuret : An impurity, NH (CONH2)2H20 found in commercial urea, brought about
by a partial decomposition of the urea to biuret and ammonia. For certain
applications, particularly when the urea is ultimately sprayed on citrus
trees, the biuret content should be kept as low as possible, in the range
0.1 to 0.3 wt.%.
Bulk Fertilizer : Solid or liquid fertilizer sold loosely in tankers, ship
holds, train wagons, trucks or large containers. Anhydrous ammonia is
sometimes transported in refrigerated barges or railroad tanks.
Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) or nitro-lime is a granulated mixture of
ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate, generally containing 25% N.
Calorific Value : A measure of the quantity of heat given out in the
combustion of a fuel. Usually expressed as BTU/standard cubic foot in the
case of a pipeline gas, where the standard cubic foot of gas is measured
at 1.7 lb/sq. inch absolute pressure and 60 F. temperature and in the
dry state. A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise 1 pound of water
through 1 fahrenheit degree at 60 fahrenheit. The calorific value may
be expressed either as gross or net. The gross value is obtained when the
water vapour in the combustion products is condensed and the net when it
remains as vapour.
Chemical Fertilizers : Manufactured chemical compounds suitable as fertili-
zers should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards and
handling problems; water soluble and available to plant root systems. It
is the common practice to report the nutrient content of materials in terms
of percentages of N (nitrogen), P205 (phosphorus pentoxide) 1/ and K20
(potassium oxide)2/.  Commnercially available materials meeting these require-
ments to a large degree are

ANNEX 1 -I
Page 3
Complex or NPK Fertilizers: All three primary nutrients (N, P20 , K 0)
are frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios va;ying
with the nutrient requirements of different crops. Complex fertilizers
contain at least two chemically combined nutrients.  To facilitate handling,
the several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uniform
granules for distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as a
ratio to describe the NPK product. Thus 15_15_15 complex fertilizer con-
tains 15% each of N, P20,. and K20; and 12-24-12 camplex fertilizer contains
12% N, 24% P205 and 12% t2.
Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) is produced by reacting ammonia with phosphoric
acid followed by granulation and drying.
Dosage: Intensity of fertilizer application generally measured in kg/ha
or lbs/acre (nutrient content).
Fertilizer: The vehicle through which plant nutrients--with the exception
Of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen--are added to the soil. It is usual to
distinguish between natural fertilizers (such as compost) and manufactured
or chemical fertilizers. Very often when the term fertilizer is used alone
it refers to the latter.
Giammarco Vetrocoke: Proprietary name of patented carbon dioxide scrubbing
process using hot potassium carbonate solution as the solvent but with the
addition of small amounts of arsenious oxide to inhibit corrosion. One of
the most efficient carbon dioxide removal processes but it suffers from
the disadvantage of employing highly poisonous arsenic compound.
Granular Fertilizer: Fertilizer in a granular form, as distinct from
powdered ferti izer which has a tendency to 'bridge' in hoppers and generally
to make bagging and application more difficult.
Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP) is produced by reacting ammonia with phosphoric
acid followed by prilling or granulation and drying.
Mixed Fertilizer: A fertilizer made by the physical mixing or blending of
two or more fertilizers and generally containing more than one plant nutrient.
Monoethanolamine: An organic solvent made from ethanol and ammonia which
has a high solubility for carbon dioxide and which can be easily regenerated.
Widely used in carbon dioxide scrubbing processes particularly in cases of
small to medium scale operation.
Partial Oxidation is a method of producing hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuels
of almost any type by a non-catalytic reaction with oxygen followed by
removal of the by-product, carbon monoxide.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 4
Plant Nutrients: Essential to plant growth are some 17 elements, six in
large and the remainder in small or micro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six; the
others of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulphur, silicon
zinc, iron, aluminum, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Chlorine and
cobalt are also thought essential. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are readily
available from the atmosphere and water, Nitrogen, phosphorus and potas-
sium--three main nutrients-- and the other elements are drawn fram the soil
systems. Unless supplemented by regular additions of materials containing
the three main nutrients, soil becomes depleted of fertility by repeated
cropping. Use of natural organic materials such as animal and vegetable
wastes can be utilized but the scale and intensity of modern agriculture
have far exceeded the availability of natural 'fertilizers'. Consequently,
the majority of the world's primary plant nutrient needs are now supplied
in the form of manufactured or 'chemical' fertilizers. To an increasing
degree, secondary nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, sulphur and micro
nutrients such as boron, zinc, copper and manganese are also added to soils
along with the primary nutrients in ratios prescribed by agronomists
according to specific crop and soil needs.
Phosphoric Acid (H P0 ): An inorganic acid used in the manufacture of
concentrated calciN; phosphates, ammonium phosphates and sometimes for
direct application through irrigation water. Although in fertilizer
terminology the term has been used practically from the inception of the
fertilizer industry to denote the available phosphate (P 0 ) equivalent
of a fertilizer, this usage is not strictly correct and has become
particularly confusing in recent years since phosphoric acid H P0 is
being used as such in the manufacture of fertilizer. Phosphoric kcid
(containing 52-54% P205) is generally produced by reacting phosphate rock
with sulphuric acid.
Phosphate Rock: Rock containing phosphates mainly of calcium in generally
complex forms. Rock phosphate can occur in igneous (formed by solidification
of molten magma) or sedimentary (formed by deposit of sediments) forms.
Some deposits contain the phosphates as nodules scattered in sterile gangue.
It is used to produce phosphoric acid (HP0h) as well as superphosphates.
Potash: A term used to denote the potassium oxide (K20) equivalent of
materials containing potassium. Actually, K20 as such is never found in
fertilizer, but historically the potassium in fertilizer has been thus
expressed.
PPM (Parts per million): The concentration of a substance expressed as
th; number of units of that substance per total million units.
Prilled Fertilizer: Fertilizer in spheroidal particles generally between
1 and 4 mm in diameter.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 5
Prills: Spherical particles prepared by spraying molten material downward
through a countercurrent stream of cooling air; this operation is performed
in a prilling tower. The particles obtained have excellent storage and
handling properties in th_t they are hard and have less surface area than
crystals.
Scrubbing: Process of removing dust and/or vapor from an inert gas otream
by using an absorbing liquid. Always required in fertilizer plants to
remove ammonia, fluorine, and fertilizer duot.
Single Superphosphate (SSP): A product obtained by treating phoaphate rock
with sulphuric acid and consisting of a mixture of monocalcium phosphate
CaHI (P0O    dicalcium phosphate CaHPOh, tricalcium phosphate Ca (PO0)2,
cal!itum su2phate ana other impurities.  Tricalcium phosphate is lot aly in-
soluble and is not includea in the P205 content of the auperphosphate (i6% to
18%).
Sulphuric Acid (H9SO1; Oil of Vitriol): This strong acid is made from various
sulphur materials. SIlphuric acid is a common acid, and is used in the
manufacture of fertilizers such as ammonium sulphate and superphosphate.
Triple Superphosphate (TSP): Obtained by reaction or phosphate rock and
phosphoric acid. Since it contains no calcium sulphate, its P205 content
(about 46%) is much higher than in single superphosphate.
Urea is known chemically as carbamide or IH2 CONH --the normal amide of
carbonic acid; this compound contains about 46%N, all in tne ammonium form.
It is considerably less hygroscopic than ammonium nitrate and it is the most
widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
Urea Synthesis: Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon dioxide. Since
both of the materials are produced during the ammonia synthesis, urea
prodluction is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant. Unfortunately,
the corresponding acid oI carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does not form stable
anmonium ddlts as do nitric, sulphuric or phosphoric acids. Therefore, simple
neutralization as used in making ammonium nitrate and sulphate fertilizers is
not possible. Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide are combined under heat
and pressure to make ammonium carbaxiate which, although unstable, can be
dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable compound. Again, unfortuna-
tely, the overall reaction is reversible and even at 300 atmospheres pressure
and 2000C, the conversion to urea in a single pass through the reactor is
under 70%. This introduces several complications: high pressure must be used
to maximize conversion; unconverted reactants must be separated and recycled;
increased corrosion under the high temperatures and pressures used must be
overcome, and urea decomposition into undesirable products must be minimized.
In recent years, several engineering and producing companies have developed
ways of surmounting these problems, and large plants capable of producing a
thousand tons per day, or more, of urea to rigid chemical and physical speci-
fications have now been operating successfully for long periods throughout
the world.

ULTRAFERTIL FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.     Industria e Commercio de Fertilizantes S.A. (ULTRAFERTIL)
ULTRAFERTIL was established in 1966 as a joint venture between
Phillips Petroleum, a US petroleum and fertilizer company, the Brazilian
Ultra group and IFC.  In 1974, because of financial difficulties, Phillips
sold its shares to PETROQUISA and ownership of the company now is 85%
with PETRDQUISA, 10% with the Ultra group and about 5% with IFC.
The company's facilities at Cubatao (Sao Paulo) include a 450 ton
per day naphtha-based ammonia plant with auxiliary facilities to produce
ammonium nitrate and diammonium phosphate fertilizers. Port-handling
facilities for ammonia and fertilizer materials are also included. At present
the company is completing an ammonia storage tank of 20,000 tons capacity and
is altering the ammonium nitrate plant to produce calcium ammonium sulphate
in the future.
Together with its production facilities at Cubatao, ULTRAFERTIL
established 14 distribution centers intended to handle about half of the
company's total production. The centers are located in south central Brazil,
the market area for ULTRAFERTIL. However, soon after production had started
in late 1970 it became apparent that the distribution centers were overdesigned
and only six of them are now operating, the others being used for storage.
Production has been reasonably stable with capacity utilization
for the whole plant averaging about 90% over the last three years:

With a total N production of around 90,000 TPY, ULTRAFERTIL is
presently the largest producer of N in Brazil. ULTRAFERTIL's production
equals about 56% of Brazil's domestic production of N and 21% of her
consumption in 1975.
Because ULTRAFERTIL also mixes and blends fertilizer materials,
part of which is imported, its sales are very diversified as shown below:

The sales volume has been rather stable over the last three years,
and 1976 sales are expected to follow the same trend, although sales of
complex fertilizers are lagging behind.
ULTRAFERTIL's financial performance has been less than satisfactory
(Table 1). In 1974 the company made, after three years of operation, its
first profit of US$21.5 million, which reduced the accumulated deficit from
US$33.2 million at the end of 1973 to US$11.7 million at the end of 1974.
Profitability in 1975 was marginal with net income being only about 1% of
net revenues and a sizeable loss of around US$10 million is projected for
1976. As a consequence of the poor performance, the debt/equity ratio
deteriorated to 95/5 in 1973, but has improved in 1974 and 1975 to about
60/40. The debt service coverage has been only between 0.3 and 0.5
except in 1974 when it was satisfactory with 1.3.   Additional long-term
debt and share capital contributions from PETROQUISA provided the necessary
funds to keep ULTRAFERTIL solvent.



ANNEX 1-2
Page 3
The reasons for ULTRAF3RTIL's poor financial performance are
manifold.  While the company's production performance has been satisfactory,
production costs have been high caused partly by built-in inefficiencies in
the plant and partly by high overhead. Also, ULTRAFERTIL initially had
difficulties obtaining Government approval for price increases for its
products.  In addition, ULTRAFERTIL is affected by the import quotas, which
are established at times of low international fertilizer prices to protect
the domestic industry. These quotas, however, are dependent on consumption
and production forecasts which are never completely accurate. As a result,
there might be an excess of imports, which penalizes higher-cost domestic
producers such as ULTRAFERTIL or not enough imports which restricts overall
growth of fertilizer consumption.

ANNEX 3-1
Page 1
BRAZIL - VALEFERTIL FERTILIZER ROJECT
AGRICULTURE IN BRAZIL
A. Development and Government Policy
1.        Over the period 1967-75, the agricultural sector has performed
well in supplying domestic demand for food and fibers while producing a
rising volume of export commodities, with output growing at an average of
5.5% annually despite adverse climatic conditions in four out of nine years./
The agriculture sector's contribution to NDP has declined from 20% in 1967
to about 15% at present, but its contribution to exports has remained
significant and currently accounts for over 50% of the total value of exports.
Because of the seriousness of the balance of payments constraint, the strategy
of Brazil's Second National Development Plan (1975-79) aims at a more
efficient development of Brazil's agricultural potential. Besides its
favorable impact on the balance of payments, the new growth strategy also has
favorable implications for domestic price stabilization and incOM6
distribution.
2.        Until 1970, growth in agricultural production was attributable
almost entirely to expansion of land under cultivation. Little if any
effort was expended on improvement of productivity in agriculture. Inspite
of having been relatively neglected by policy makers, the agricultural sector
managed to grow at about 4.5% annually during 1950-70. Inflation, price con-
trols, erratic Government intervention in marketing of products, overvalued
exchange rates and export controls, tended to distort prices particularly in
the early 1960s, discouraging production and exports. The movement of agri-
cultural activity into the interior of the country created a need for an
elaborate infrastructure to handle product distribution which remained largely
neglected until'the mid-1960s.  Changes in overall economic management since
then have helped to eliminate some of these distortions and improve incentives
for farmers. Recent growth has tended to be higher, although there have been
fluctuations due to climatic factors. Brazil has become the world's largest
producer of sugar and its second largest supplier of soybeans, while remain-
ing the world's leading coffee producer.  Coffee continues to play a very
important role in the agricultural sector accounting for about 12% of output,
though its share in total exports has declined from 4h% in 1967 to about
11% in 1975.  It is expected to rise to almost 17% in 1976 despite a lower
volume of exports than 1975 due to a large price increase.  Annual variations
in coffee production, largely resulting from frosts, are generally responsible
for year-to-year fluctuations in the growth of the agriculture sector. The
1975 frosts which caused extensive crop damage in the states of Sao Paulo,
Parana, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso, will result in an estimated 70% decline
in coffee production in 1976 and will reduce overall growth of the agriculture
sector from an estimated 4% in 1975 to between 0-2% growth in 1976.
1/ Tables 1-4 of this Annex gives some basic agricultural statistics about
development of area, production and yield of the country's main crops.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
3.        The agricultural policies of the Government have multiple objec-
tives: they are designed to stimulate output to meet the increasing demand
of Brazil's population, to encourage production for export to make a substan-
tial contribution to foreign exchange earnings; and, as instruments for raising
income levels of the rural poor. The Government's price stabilization
objectives depend upon the extent to which agricultural production meets the
increases in domestic demand. More balanced and abundant increments in
production relative to population increase would alleviate the commodity
scarcities which have complicated stabilization efforts in recent years. The
agriculture sector in Brazil, besides employing relatively little in way of
imported inputs, has enormous potential as a supplier of primary commodities
to a world increasingly afflicted by food shortages. Agriculture is and will
continue for some time to be a key generator of foreign exchange. The aim of
the Government is to make Brazil one of the world's foremost producers and
exporters of foodstuffs. Finally, with almost 45% of the population engaged
in agricultural activities, a more balanced and equitable development process
can only be achieved with comparatively higher increases in agricultural pro-
duction and productivity than those experienced in recent years. Substantial
increases in per worker productivity in the rural areas can alleviate poverty
where it currently is most heavily concentrated. The Government is thus
giving more attention to the modernization of agricultural production and
marketing and expansion of the frontier of cultivation.
4.        Brazil has the potential for sustaining relatively high long-term
growth in agriculture and the Plan target of a 40% (7% annually) real increase
in agricultural output for the 1975-79 period appears feasible. To support
these growth objectives, the Government has allocated substantial public
resources to programs to incorporate new areas to agricultural production.
Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that still has available
abundant land on which continued expansion of output can be based, so that
reasonably high growth is possible if accompanied by modest iprovements in
agricultural technology. The goal of these programs is to expand agricul-
tural area by 5% annually and to encourage settlement to bring these areas
into production as quickly as possible. A second component of the Government
strategy is to increase productivity and production options through moderni-
zation of agriculture research and increase domestic production of improved
seeds, fertilizers, and substantial expansion in the supply of credit and
complementary technical assistance for the purchase of modern agricultural
inputs. These inputs should bring about a 2% annual increase in productivity
necessary to achieve the overall growth target for the agriculture sector.
Government policies and programs are already stimulating considerable progress
both in expanding land under cultivation and increasing productivity of
activities for domestic and external markets.
5.        Following the example of the comprehensive programs created in the
early 1970s for the development of Northeast agriculture (PROTERRA), the
Amazon (PIN), Mato Grosso and Goias (PRODESTE), Valley of the Sao Franciso
River (PROVALE), the Government in 1974, launched a program (POLOCENTRO) to
focus on the technical and infrastructure requirements for initially exploit-
ing 3.7 million hectares of land area in the Campos Cerrados area. This



ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
program will also finance agricultural research, feeder roads, rural
electrification and agricultural storage facilities. The Government has also
initiated a program (POLONORDESTE) designed to improve small farmer productivity
in the Northeast through the formulation and execution of integrated rural
development projects. This constitutes a significant shift in the emphasis of
governmental programs which in the past have concentrated on expanding socially
oriented programs in the fields of education, health, nutrition, sanitation
and broadening the application of social security and labor legislation rather
than on production oriented programs aimed at low income groups. These re-
gional programs are designed to bring about a fuller utilization of the
country's land and related resources in order to provide a means for the
alleviation of poverty and underemployment, which are particularly pressing
in the Northeast. 1VAiile no overnight eradication of rural poverty, which has
been endemic in the Northeast for decades, is likely to be forthcoming from
these programs, responsible efforts to improve the productivity of Northeast
agriculture together with programs to increase industrial activity in the
region already have resulted in a more rapid growth of per capita income in
the Northeast than in Brazil as a whole, and with the initiation of new pro-
grams this process is expected to continue under the Second Development Plan.
6.        Considerable emphasis is also being given to agricultural research
and to the dissemination of research findings through a national extension
network. The Brazilian Agricultural Research Enterprise (EKBRAPA) and the
Brazilian Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Enterprise (EMBRATER) have
been strengthened to carry out these objectives. Guaranteed minimum price
support and subsidized credit for financing acquisition of modern inputs are
being emplcyed to encourage farmers to take advantage of technological improve-
ments resulting from these research and extension activities. A program of
agricultural infrastructure improvements (Export Corridors Program) is being
implemented in the South and Center regions to facilitate movement of export-
able agricultural surpluses from the interior of Brazil through the major
ports of the region (Vitoria, Santos, Paranagua and Rio Grande).
7.        Since 1965, with the creation of the National System of Rural
Credit, the Government has made a continuous effort to increase the amount
of loanable funds for agriculture. Agricultural credit is crucial to reso-
lution of the challenges confronting Brazilian agriculture, particularly
expansion of land under cultivation and use of modern inputs. Currently,
about 27% of total Brazilian bank credit is directed into agriculture pri.n-
cipally by the Bank of Brazil and through Central Bank refinancing programs
using the private commercial banks as agents. Agricultural credit as a per-
cent of Brazil's agricultural domestic income has increased from about 23%
in 1966 to over 80% in 197L. Agricultural credit lines are available for a
multiplicity of purposes including working capital, acquisition of modern
inputs, irrigation, land acquisition by small holders, retention of breeding
stock, pasture improvement, etc. Agricultural credit is extended at subsi-
dized interest rates differentiated in favor of the small holders and of
development in certain regions, particularly the Northeast. The Government
has also established an insurance scheme or fund to cover debts of farmers



AN1.X 3-1
Page 4i
when affected by natural disasters. This Insurance Program for Agricultural
and Livestock Activities (PROAGRO) has been extremely useful in reducing
risk of credit operations both to lenders and borrowers. The Government
recently extended this coverage to 80% of the losses in Parana guaranteed
under the PROAGRO program when the State was devastated by the severe frosts
of mid-1975.
8.        A major difference between the approach of the Second National
Development Plan and efforts heretofore made to improve Brazil's agricul-
tural performance lies in better coordination of the activities of the
many agricultural development agencies. Institutional changes made since
March 1974 suggest that for the first time there is a chance for effective
coordination between agro-policy makers, agricultural research and extension
agencies, agrarian reform and regional development agencies.
B. Major Export Crops
9.        Three agricultural commodities, coffee, soybeans and sugar,
generate over 35% of total export earnings and, including unprocessed or semi-
processed agricultural exports, the agricultural sector accounts for more
than 50% of total value of exports. The diversification of agricultural
exports, which over 1967-75 period has been more important than even the
spectacular growth of manufactured exports, is all the more remarkable since,
unlike manufacturers, they benefit little from fiscal incentives.
10.       Brazil is the largest exporter of coffee in the world although its
share of the world market has declined from 50%in_ the early 1950s to an
estimated 20% in 1976. With the exception of the 1965-66 harvest, domestic
production has been consistently below requirements for domestic consumption
(8 million bags) and exports (18 million bags), leading to a gradual depletion
of stocks. Due to a large build-up of stocks and the tremendous excess of
production capacity in 1966, the Government initiated a coffee tree eradication
program. However, the movement of coffee planting into the interior of the
state of Parana by the early 1960s had left substantial portions of Brazil's
production capacity exposed to frosts. After the frosts of 1969 which reduced
1970 crop to less than 11 million bags, the Government was forced to reverse
its policy and establish price and credit incentives for new tree planting.
The impact of the program was felt in 1974 with production of some 26 million
bags. The severe frosts of 1975, which drastically reduced production capacity
with an estimated production of 6 million bags in 1976, may start a new phase
in Brazilian coffee history, and coffee production may gradually move out of
frost-prone Parana. The danger of movement into the over-production stage of
the coffee cycle still exists, though greater attention on the part of the
Government and the declining comparative advantage of coffee over other crops
tend to forestall this. The increased cost of fertilizer and pesticide, and
the emerging shortage of agricultural labor in the coffee regions discrimi-
nates severely against coffee since no mechanized means of coffee harvesting
has ever been developed. Continuation of a moderate coffee tree planting



ANNEX 3-1
Page 5
program at moderate levels should maintain Brazilian production capacity at
adequate levels, and should permit the Government to recoup the decline in
Brazil's share in world exoorts that occurred in 1974-76.
11.       Wiith the recent decline in Cuban production, Brazil is now the
largest producer of sugar in the world. Until 1970 sugar production in-
creased very slowly but, in response to rapidly rising world prices, large
increases took place in 1972 and 1973. Due to unusually bad weather (drought
and frosts in Center-South and heavy, unseasonable rains in the Northeast),
production declined in 1974 and 1975, and despite exhaustion of its sugar
stocks early in 1974, Brazilian sugar export in that year surpassed coffee as
Brazil's principal foreign exchange earner. Most of the increases in cane
production have been due to expansion in harvested areas, with practically no
increases in average yields. Increases in Brazil's exportable sugar surplus
(from 1.1 million tons in 1968 to peak of 2.8 million tons in 1973 with 1975
exports of only 1.7 million tons) have been facilitated by a Government
program to reform the production and processing of sugar in the Northeast.
This reform has various elements including the creation of credit lines
to merge and re-equip sugar mills and to integrate and reallocate cane
production and milling; the adoption of a uniform sugar price throughout
the country; the establishment of a gradually declining subsidy to be
eliminated over a six-year period, to compensate for the currently higher
production costs of the Northeast; and the allocation of PROTERRA funds to
finance the re-employment of cane and mill workers displaced by productivity
improvements. Additional planting of land area in sugarcane and improvements
in productivity are expected to increase sugar production from about 7.7
million tons at present to about 10 million tons by 1980, out of which only
23% would be for exports due to growing requirements for domestic consumption.
12.       The production of soybeans has increased from less than 1 million
tons in 1968 to an estimated 11 mi=lion tons in 1976, making Brazil the third
largest producer in the world, behind the U.S. and the People's Republic of
China. Soybeans represent the most startling example of the speed at which
new products have been added to the export flow as exports of soybeans, soy-
bean meal and soybean oil increased from US$40 million in 1967 to US$1,302
million in 1975. This vast expansion has taken place mainly in the states of
Sao Paulo, Parana, and Rio Grande do Sul and has been instrumental in re-
structuring southern Brazilian agriculture. Up to 1975, most of the expansion
came from double-cropping of wheat areas and cultivation of natural pastures
and thus has not provoked any significant reduction in the output of alternative
crops. In addition, per hectare productivity has increased and at present
Brazilian productivity is only slightly lower than in the U.S. and Canada,
and higher than in Japan. Most of the Southern region presents favorable
conditions and sufficient land available for further expansion of soybean
cultivation. The area under soybean cultivation is expected to increase from
5.2 million hectares in 1974 to 10.5 million hectares by 1980, and production



ANNEX 3-1
Page 6
is expected to reach 18 million tons, with exportable surplus at 11-12 million
tons compared to 6.7 million tons in 1975. In terms of production capacity,
soybeans clearly constitute one of Brazil's principal opportunities for
expansion of agricultural exports.

BRAZIL - VALEFERTIL FERTILIZER PROJECT
THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
A. Fertilizer Industry - General Background
(i) Resource Endowment
1.        Brazil is not well-endowed with good raw material resources for the
production of chemical fertilizers. Natural gas, the ideal raw material
for nitrogen (N) fertilizer production, has been found only in modest
quantities in three areas: (a) Sergipe and Alagoas (Northeast), (b) offshore
of Campos, near Rio de Janeiro (Center), and (c) 200 Ian offshore of Amapa
(North). The reserves in the Northeast have been known the longest and
they have the advantage of being located close to the Northeast fertilizer
consumption center. These reserves are limited in size but will provide
the feedstock for the Sergipe project and PETROFERTIL's existing and
presently expanded ammonia/urea plant.  The oil and gas fields offshore
Campos have just been discovered,and priority for the use of this gas has
been given to fertilizer production. At this time, no information is avail-
able on the likely quantities involved. The gas in the North has also just
been discovered, but the location of the reserves will make exploitation
difficult, and it is not likely that gas from these fields will be used
for fertilizer production in the near future. The other feedstocks for N
fertilizer production, naphtha and fuel oil, are indirectly imported as
they are derived from crude oil,and Brazil imports some 80% of its crude
oil requirements. The Araucaria fertilizer project under construction at
Parana will use fuel oil, and the proposed project in Rio Grande do Sul
will probably also use fuel oil feedstock.
There are six major deposits of phosphate rock (Table 1 and MAP
IBRD 12055R1) with an average P205 content ranging from 5% to 17%, well below
the 20% to 30% average P205 content found in commercial deposits in other
countries (USA, Morocco, Jordan, etc.). At present, only one deposit
(Jacupiranga with an average of 5% P205 ore grade) is commercially develop-
ed, in conjunction with a cement factory, which improves the economics of
the combined cement/phosphate fertilizer enterprise. The Jacupiranga
deposit provides the rock for the QUIMBRASIL fertilizer plant and accounts
for just about 8% of the 1976 P205 consumption. However, with the recent
local development of a commercial beneficiation technology capable of
producing ore concentrates with 35% P205 at a high recovery factor_/ and
the increase in the international prices of phosphate rock and phosphatic (P)
fertilizers, Brazil has embarked on a phosphate mining/beneficiation
l/  The beneficiation process is now well proven at Jacupiranga and the
Arafertil pilot plant at Araxa.  A unique feature of the process is
its ability to attain a fair, from 50% to.80%, P205 recovery from
the low grade igneous ores common in Brazil.  On a comparable basis,
the standard metallurgical process used on U.S. sedimentary type ore
in the 5% to 8% P205 range shows recovery factors of about 30% to 50%.

investment program to develop its low grade deposits. The ARAFERTIL mining/
beneficiation project at Araxa and the VALEP project at Tapira are scheduled
for commercial operation by mid-1977 and late-1978, respectively. Feasibility
studies for developing the Catalao deposit, the Patos de Minas deposit and
the Ipanema deposit are underway. These six deposits have potential reserves
of about 345 million tons of P205 of which about one half can be considered
as proven. With an average P205 recovery factor of 60%, the proven reserves
of about 170 million tons of P205 is equivalent to 90 times the 1976 annual
P205 consumption. Elemental sulfur, another important raw material for
phosphoric acid production, has not been found in commercial quantities in
Brazil.
2.        Finally, only one significant potash (K) deposit has been found,
in Carmopolis (Sergipe). The deposit is in the form of potassium
chlorinated salts with the equivalent of at least 30 million tons of K20
or equal to about 50 times the 1976 annual consumption.  However, the
existence of oil in the same area, the lack of adequate technology, and the
disagreement among the different parties concerned have so far prevented
the commercial development of this deposit. Consequently, all potash require-
ments will continue to be imported for some time.
(ii) Industrial Structure
3.        With international prices for raw materials, intermediates
(phosphoric acid and ammonia) and fertilizer products relatively low up to
1973 and because of Brazil's low natural resource endowment, the Brazilian
fertilizer industry has concentrated on importing, mixing, blending and
the distribution of fertilizers, rather than on establishing large scale,
efficient production facilities. Brazil's fertilizer industry, therefore,
consists of a large number of small to medium-sized, mostly private sector,
firms with relatively uneconomic production facilities. Because of their
high production costs, producers have to be protected except when world
fertilizer prices are high. Over the next five years, however, the industry
will undergo major changes, with new and larger facilities providing
economies of scale and being mostly owned by public sector enterprises, not-
withstanding the Government's policy of encouraging the private sector to
invest in the industry. The large financial requirements for new projects
will prevent the private sector, with its limited financial base, from
participating in a major way in the capacity expansion of the industry.
Consequently, the new, large-scale projects have to be financed and under-
taken with the help of sources outside the present industry. Most of the
new projects are, therefore, sponsored by the large, Government-owned
industrial enterprises such as Petroleo Brasileiro (PETROBRAS), the national
oil company, and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce S.A. (CVRD), a large mining company.
However, it is expected that the blending, mixing and distribution of
fertilizer products will continue to be in the private sector.
4.        At present, there are 20 firms producing fertilizers and about
30 more enterprises just engaged in mixing, blending and retail operations.
Of the 20 producers, only one firm (ULTRAFERTIL) has primary production
facilities for both ammonia and phosphoric acid; three firms (PETROFERTILr,



ANNEX 3-2
Page 3
r     a.  u    h have aammonia production units; and two firms (COPEBRAS
and QUDfBRASIL) have phosphoric acid production facilities. However, only
QUIMBRASIL uses local phosphate rock. Both COPEBRAS and ULTRAFERTIL use
imnorted roeW   The other 14 manufacturing firms import the intermediate
products (ammonia and/or phosphoric acid) for final processing and/or
produce low analysis products such as thermophosphates and single super-
phosphates (SSP) which do not require phosphoric acid and ammonia. Of the
20 firms, five produce complex (NP and NPK) fertilizers, another five produce
just N fertilizers, and the remaining ten P fertilizers only.
5.        Following the extraordinary increase in international fertilizer
prices in 197  (Chart I) which almost tripled the fertilizer import bill from the
US$169 million in 1973 to US$492 million in 1974 and about US$500 million
in 1975, the Government initiated a National Fertilizer Program (NFP) which
stipulated self-sufficiency in fertilizer by 1980. To implement the NFP,
the Government established the National Fertilizer Commission with
representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Industry, Commerce, Transport,
Agriculture, and Planning. The Commission has overall responsibility for
planning and formulating policies to facilitate the growth of the industry,
especially the expansion of the production capacity.
As a result of the NFP, three new large-scale ammonia/urea
projects are now firmly planned at Araucaria (under construction), Sergipe
and Norte Fluminense, all of which will be undertaken by FERTILIZANTES, a
subsidiary of PETROBRAS. The three projects will almost triple the ammonia
capacity from the 1977 level of 477,000 TPY of N to 1,300,000 TPY of N
by 1981.
6.        One large public sector phosphate fertilizer project is under
construction by VAIEFERTIL, a CVRD subsidiary, which will more than double
the domestic phosphoric acid production capacity from 220,000 TPY of P205
to 510,000 TPY of P205. Three other large phosphate fertilizer projects
are planned in the private sector, but all face serious financing problems
and are not expected to start production until 1981 or later. The three
are: the ARAFERTIL project at Araxa, the Luchsinger project in the South,
and the ICC project, also in the South. Both the ARAFERTIL and the
Iuchsinger projects will have phosphoric acid capacities of about 190,000
TPY of P205 and the ICC project 105,000 TPY of P205.  However, only the
VALEFERTIL and the ARAFERTIL projects will be based on local phosphate rock.
The two projects in the South will have to use imported phosphate rock as
no phosphate deposit has been discovered in that region.
In all, there are nine firm projects, supported by the NFP, which
are estimated tc cost almost US$1.9 billion and include four phosphate rock
mining/beneficiation projects (Araxa, Tapira, Ipanema, Patos), two phosphate
fertilizer projects (VALEFERTIL, ARAFERTIL), and three ammonia/urea projects
(Araucaria, Sergipe, Norte Fluminense).
7.        There are four industrial associations for the fertilizer industry:
(a) The Associacao Nacional Para Difusao de Adubos (ANDA), which is
responsible for the general promotion of and research on fertilizer use;



ANNEX 3-2
Page 4
(b) The Syndicato de Materias Primas, which represents the domestic producers
of fertilizers, (c) The Syndicato da Industria de Adubos e Colas do Estado
de Sao Paulo, and (d') The Syndicato Estado de Rio Grande. The last two
associations represent blenders, mixers and retailers.  ANDA also acts as
consultant to the Government and in the past has engaged the services of
foreign firms (e.g. Tennessee Valley Authority and FAO) for special projects.
The syndicates collect and disseminate information on consumption, production,
stocks and distribution. They also prepare special studies to support the
industry's views to the Government whenever changes in prices, subsidies
and import quotas are contemplated. With the Government's manifest interest
in the industry, the associations have begun to improve their system of data
collection, their role as information sources and are now engaged in fore-
casting likely fertilizer consumption levels.
B. Agriculture and Fertilizer Use
(i) Factors Affecting Fertilizer Use
8.        Four main factors, other than weather, affect the fertilizer
usage in Brazil. These are: (a) the development of the cultivated area;
(b) soil characteristics; (c) the cropping pattern and the level of
agricultural technology; and (d) the Government policies concerning relative
agricultural input and output prices, subsidies, credit, agricultural
extension services and special programs related to agriculture. The
Government's agricultural policies are generally discussed in Annex 3-1,
and fertilizer prices and subsidies are discussed in Section C of
this Annex.
9.        Table 2 provides information on the potential agricultural areas
that could be developed in the different regions of Brazil. The total
potential agricultural area that could be used is estimated to be between
165 to 250 million ha. with a best estimate of 210 million ha. During the
period 1960-1970, cultivated area increased at an annual rate of 3%, from
28.5 to 38.5 million ha. During 1970-1975, however, the cultivated area
increased only slightly (Annex 3-1, Table 2) and for 1975 was about 41.5
million ha., representing just about 20% of the estimated potential of 210
million ha. Thus, the Government's Second Development Plan (1975-79)
objective of increasing the cultivated area by 4% to 5% annually is slightly
higher than the average rate achieved in the past.
Brazilian soils are generally acidic and seriously deficient in
phosphorus. Table 3 shows the average phosphorus and potassium content of
the soils by states, indicating that on a national basis, an average of 77%
of the presently cultivated area is low in phosphorus (or phosphate) with
the remaining 23% containing medium to high levels of natural phosphate
nutrients. In contrast, only about 29% of the cultivated area is considered
seriously deficient in potassium (or potash). This deficiency in phosphorus
coupled with the acidity of the soil has led to the unusual NPK consumption
ratio of about 1:2.3:1.3 (average for the period 1972-1976), with phosphate
consumption more than twice the nitrogen consumption. The planned
increase in cultivated area, mostly involving soils with nutrient deficiencies,



ANNEX 3-2

will clearly require an increase in fertilizer use, especially phosphatic
fertilizers. To correct for soil acidity, large quantities of lime are
applied since acidity is not compatible with most crops and in addition,
the efficiency of N fertilizers is reduced, depressing agricultural yields.
There are adequate domestic lime deposits and production capacity.
10.       The cropping pattern and the level of agricultural technology is
the third important factor affecting fertilizer use.  As shown below, there
has been a marked change in the cropping pattern. The area cultivated with
coffee, for example, decreased from 4.h million ha. in 1960 (15.4% of the
cultivated area) to 1.4 million ha. in 1976 (3.2% of the cultivated area).
In contrast, the area planted with soybeans increased from a 1960 level
of 0.2 million ha. (0.7% of the cultivated area) to a 1976 level of 6.3
million ha. (14.5% of the cultivated area). The increase in the areas
planted with crops such as wheat, rice and soybeans, which receive more
fertilizers than other crops,partly explains the increase in fertilizer
consumption experienced during the 1966-1976 period.

11.       The recommended fertilizer application rates, which are shown in
Table 4 and summarized below, show that most major crops, with the notable
exception of coffee, require more P nutrients than either N or K. Actual
fertilizer application rates are difficult to obtain since there is no
systematic collection of data on fertilizer use by crops or by year, and
only rough estimates can be made on the basis of fertilizer credit application
data. One estimate of actual fertilizer application rates for different
crops for 1974 is shown below. The recommended levels are low by inter-
national standards but are appropriate for the existing level of agricultural

technology. The actual application rates range from about 35% to 70% of
the recommended level except for corn and rice, which are much lower. The
six crops below account for almost 7% of the total fertilizer used in Brazil.

2/  This is the estimated average for 1971, 1973, and 1974.  The 1971 and 1973
estimates were derived according to the distribution of fertilizer credits.
The 1974 data is an ANDA estimate.
3/ This is probably in the 10% to 20% range considering that the corn area
was 2.8 times the rice area in 1974 while rice accounted for 7% of
fertilizer consumption compared to 10% for corn.
12.       The differences between the recommended application rate and the
actual rate can be partly explained by (a) the inadequacy of complementary
inputs or technologies (plant varieties, cultivation method, correction of
soil acidity, etc.) and agricultural extension services; (b) the low level
of commercialization in several areaswith concomitant high transportation
costs for both agricultural inputs and outputs and lack of accessibility to
credit sources; (c) the general poverty of the small farmholders who are
mostly non-users of fertilizers; and most importantly (d) the decline in the
purchasing power of agricultural crops relative to fertilizer prices during
1974 as a result of the large increase in international fertilizer prices
(para 26).
13.       The cropping pattern also affects the seasonal or monthly usage of
fertilizers. About 70% of the fertilizer used for coffee, 60% of the
fertilizer used for soybeans and 50% of that used for sugarcane are applied
during the four months from July to October. Consequently, more than 50%
of the total fertilizer consumption is used during July to October and about
70% is used during the six months from May to October (Table 5). This
seasonal pattern of consumption is also reflected in the pattern of imports
with about 50% of total imports occurring during May to August.



ANNEX 3-2

14.       Of the Government policies affecting the use of fertilizers, the
policies for the agricultural credit system are particularly important.
The Government has been well aware of the importance of working
capital and liquidity for the modernization of agriculture; however, the
effectiveness of the programs instituted is somewhat debatable given the
relatively low overall efficiency of agricultural production and the lack
of sufficient statistical data and analysis. In 1965, the Government created
the National Rural Credit System (SNCR) which involved a complete revolution
in Brazil's rural credit system. SNCR is made up of the Central Bank (which
has a supervisory role in the system) and the Bank of Brazil, Bank of Amazonia,
Bank of the Northeast, and the National Credit Cooperative Bank. The National
Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), the State official
banks, the National Savings Bank, the private banks, and the rural credit
cooperatives are linked informally to the SNCR. To coordinate, guide and
control the behavior of the different components of the credit system, a
special department was established in the Central Bank.
15.       The subsidy for the modernization of agriculture, specially the
consumption of fertilizer, began with the foundation of FUNFERTIL which
paid the total interest on loans used for buying fertilizer. In 1964 it
was substituted by FUNDAG which provided most credit at an annual interest
rate of 7% for buying modern inputs except for fertilizers where credit was
interest free until 1974. This accounts for the large (95%) share of
fertilizer puirchases through the agricultural credit system. In addition
rural credit plays a major role in special development programs such
as the National Integration Program (PIN), the POLOAMAZONIA and POLWNORDESTE.
The POLOCENRO, PRODEPAN and GRANDE DOURADOS programs will be of special
importance for the development of fertilizer consumption in the western part of
the Center. With the introduction of the price subsidy, interest on fertilizer
credit was increased from 0% to 13 and 15% for medium/large and small farmers,
respectively. The average maturity for fertilizer credit is 7-10 months,
although it can be extended up to two years for crops like sugarcane and coffee,
which require a longer gestation period.
16.       Rural credit increased by a factor of seven from Cr$12.9 billion
to Cr$90 billion in current terms (a factor of 3 in real terms) between
1971 to 1975 (Table 6). The share of fertilizer credit to the total rural
credit gradually increased from 7.3% in 1971 to 8.3% in 1973. As a result of
the steep rise in fertilizer prices in 1974, the share of fertilizer credit
increased to 1h% of the toval rural credit but declined slightly to 11.4%
in 1975 partly reflecting the drop in fertilizer prices and the slower growth
in consumption during that year. Regionwise, fertilizer credit has the
largest share in the Center followed by the South and the Northeast. It
should be noted that the Center region in Table 6 does not include the
State of Parana which is included in the South. The regional distribution of
fertilizer credit according to the definition of the fertilizer market and
marketing regions (where Parana is part of the Center) would have to be
adjusted therefore to be about 8%, 75% and 17% for the Northeast, Center
and South, respectively, while consumption of fertilizer is about 9%, 60%
and 31%. This would indicate that the South is making less use of fertilizer
credits than the Center. Lacking more specific data, it is difficult
to find an explanation for this.

(ii) Agricultural Productivity
17.       Until 1970, the growth in Brazil's agricultural output was mostly
accounted for by the expansion of the cultivated area. With the exception
of a few crops such as coffee, wheat and potatoes which registered remarkable
increases in yields, the productivity of most crops showed only slight
improvements from 1961/63 through 1968/70.  During 1968/70-1973/74, cotton,
cacao and soybeans achieved gains in yields as shown below. Over the
period 1961/63-1973/74, five of the major crops achieved average productivity
increases exceeding 2% annia1Uy.

1/  For estimating the annual increase in yield, the Ul-year period, 1962/1973,
is used.
18.       Different levels of agricultural technology for the various crops
account for most of the difference in productivity gains or lack thereof.
Coffee, being the most important crop in terms of export earnings, has
probably the most advanced agricultural technology in terms of high-yielding
varieties, cultivation methods and fertilizer application. In addition, it
also has well-developed supporting services such as extension services,
credit facilities, and marketing system. As a result, the 50% reduction



ANNEX 3-2
Page 9
in the area cultivated with coffee between 1960 and 1974 was offset by a
doubling of yields in the same period. The shift in the coffee areas away
from the frost-prone zone of the southern part of the Center region towards
the central part of the Central region with its more favorable weather
conditions should ensure more stable and better yields in the future.
19.       The level of agricultural technology and supporting services,
even for the same crop, varies among the different regions in Brazil. In
general, the most agriculturally developed region is the South, followed by
the Center with the North and Northeast regions the least developed. The
regional differences in productivity during 1973 is illustrated in Table 7.
The best productivity is in the South and Center regions while the lowest is
in the Northeast region. Thus, the regional distribution of the cultivated
area for a particular crop affects the overall productivity for that crop.
For example, practically all the wheat and the soybean areas are in the South
and Center regions. In contrast, about 96% of the sugarcane areas and
practically all the cotton areas are in the Center and the Northeast regions.
The gains in cotton productivity, however, mostly originate from the Center
region, which accounted for 60% of the 1973 cotton output but only 28% of
the cultivated area. Finally, most of the recently cultivated land is
in less developed areas with a low productivity, thereby depressing the
overall national yields for those crops introduced in the newly cultivated
land.
20.       An international comparison of agricultural productivity, as
shown below, indicates a large potential for improving agricultural productivity
in Brazil, even among those crops which have shown significant yield improve-
ments during the last 15 years.

21.       While Brazilian agriculture will continue to be extensive in
character as opposed to intensive agriculture as practiced in the Netherlands
or Japan, the Government's objective of a 2% to 3% annual increase in
agricultural productivity during 1975-1979 (Annex 3-1) appears reasonable.
Such improvements, however, will require a systematic and deliberate approach
to agricultural development considering that most of the newly cultivated
land will be located in less developed areas requiring the development of
transportation and marketing systems. Both the expansion of cultivated area
and the improvement in the level of agricultural technology imply a continued
growth in the demand for fertilizers.
22.       The extensive nature of Brazil's agriculture is further demonstrated
by low fertilizer application rates, when compared to other countries, as
shown below:

C.  Agricultural Inputand Output Prices
23.       In pursuing its agricultural production and productivity objectives,
the Government has traditionally relied on two policy instruments: providing
credit to finance agricultural inputs (as discussed) and setting minimum
prices for agricultural outputs to guarantee a reasonable level of profit-
ability for agricultural production. The system of minimum prices for
agricultural output was started in 1945 and has since extended its coverage
from six major crops (rice, beans, corn, peanuts, sunflower and soybeans)
to almost all agricultural products and most products of animal origin. The
Consejo Interministerial de Precos (CIP) is responsible for operating the
minimum price system. The minimum price is generally announced 60 days
before the crop is planted and the Government guarantees the purchase of
the production at this price. Financing is also provided for about 180 to
216 days at 100% of the estimated value of the production based on the
minimum price. The geographical coverage of the system has expanded from
the export ports and large consumer centers to many in' ermediate points in the



ANNEX 3-2
Page 11
country thereby creating homogenous price zones. From 1966 thr mgh 1974,
farm prices of most agricultural products increased in real terms (Table 8).
24.       Up to 1974, the Government has not intervened in the determination
of fertilizer retail prices, allowing market forces to set prices.
Consequently, fertilizer prices have been affected by both international and
domestic economic trends as indicated below by the cyclical pattern of
prices (in constant terms) during the last 30 years.

1/ The 1975 index is estimated on the basis of a 40% subsidy. Without
the subsidy the index would be 209.
2/ Prices are expected to decline slightly (in real terms) during 1976
and 1977.
25.       The combination of real term increases in farm product and decreases
in fertilizer prices increased the purchasing power of agricultural products
relative to fertilizers as shown below:

26.       The purchasing power of agricultural crops relative to fertilizer
declined dramatically during 1974 as a consequence of the large increase in
international fertilizer prices. Concerned about the possible adverse effect
of the increase in fertilizer prices on fertilizer usage and agricultural
production, in 1975 the Government introduced a 40% subsidy towards the
purchase of fertilizer and a 15% interest rave on fertilizer credits which
had been interest free prior to 1975. The net effect, however, was favorable
and brought the purchasing power of most agricultural crcps back to thie
1972 Level.  International rertilizer prices began to decline in the third
quarter of 1974, and by 1976 have settled back to the 1972/73 levels (Chart I).
As a result of the rapid decline in international fertilizer prices during
1975, the purchasing power of agricultural products in relation to fertilizers
increased again and therefore the Government eliminated the subsidy in late
December 1976. This however, is not exDected to have any adverse effect on
fertilizer demand, since the relationship between agricultural product and
fertilizer prices is expected to remain favorable. The removal of the subsidy,
when it was not any longer economically justified, is an indication of the
attention the CGoernment is paying to the fertilizer sector and of the
Government's determination to follow rational policies in this sector.
27.       To avoid abuses within the fertilizer price subsidy crogram anc
to prevent the fertilizer industry from making excessive profits arising
from the preference position granted to the industry by the import quota
system for fertilizers (para 4o), the Government in 1975 initiated a system
of maximum fertilizer prices at the retail level. The CIP computes the
maximum price per nutrient based on the proportion and expected cost of
imported and domestically produced fertilizers, and an allowance for blending
and distribution costs. The resulting price is then published as a ceiling
price and credit or subsidy is only given to fertilizers purchased at prices
equal or below the ceiling price.  For the first half of 1976, the CIP
published the following maximum retail prices:  US$640/ton of N, US$690/ton
of P205, and US$250/ton of K20 as derilved below.

28.       The maximum retail prices, on a US$ equivalent basis, have
declined by 28% for N, 13% for P205 and 23% for K20 between 1975 and the
first half of 1976. For the second half of 1976, the CIP has increased the
maximum prices at a monthly rate of 1.5%, which is considerably lower than
the inflation rate of 2% to h% per month expected for the same period.
This intended reduction in the maximum retail price level in real terms is
apprcpriate considering the downward trend in international prices from
1975 through 1976. As the maximum prices are conservatively estimated and
include a safety margin in the import, production and distribution costs,
it has been observed and can be expected to continue that, on the average,
actual prices because of competitive pressures at the retail level wlla
tend to be 15-20% lower than the stipulated maximum.
29.       The estimate for domestic production costs indicate that they are
about 52% higher for N and 39% higher for P205 compared to the cost of
imported fertilizers. Several factors couLd explain this difference.
Firstly, the domestic production facilities, particularly for N, are small
and do not enjoy the economies-of-scale common in the export oriented
plants of other countries.  Secondly, the industry is based on imported raw
materials and intermediate products, particularly phosphate rock, sulfur,
phosphoric acid and ammonia whose international prices have not decreased in
the same proportion as the prices of finished products.  1Shile this is a
short-term phenomena that is expected to change, the inmediate effect is a
situation whereby the cost of importing the raw materials and intermediates
required for the production of some fertilizers into Brazil is higher than



ANNEX 3-2
Page 14
the cost of importing the finished product. Finally, the domestic costs are
provided by the local firms and the cost data probably contain some upward
bias, to ensure higher profits or to incorporate anticipated cost increases
that may not be fully matched by increases in the stipulated maximum prices
in the future.
30.       The export of agricultural output contAinues to be the primary
source of foreign exchange for Brazil. The Government's economic objectives
especially the management of the country's precarious balance-of-payments
situation, depends heavily on the export performance of the agricultural
sector. Thus, there is within the Government increasing attention on
agricultural policies designed to increase agricultural exports. To enhance
Brazil's competitiveness in the agricultural export market, it is important
that agricultural inputs be provided at cost levels comparable to those
prevailing in other exporting countries. The introduction and abolishment
of the 40% subsidy for fertilizer is illustrative of the Government's increasingly
active role.  In mid-2976,-Brazilian fertilizer retail prices  without the
subsidy are somewhat higher than those prevailing in the USA as shown below.

However, during the latter half of 1976, Brazilian fertillizer prices
further declined in real terms and in early 1977 they are estimated to be only
slightly above those prevailing in the USA. in the longer run, as the new
fertilizer production facilities come into operation, the average cost of
domestic production is expected to decline and come in line with the lower
international prices forecast for the end of thds decade.
D. Fertilizer ConsumDtion
(i) Historical Fertilizer Consumption Patterns
31.       Between 1959 and 1966, the year-to-year apparent consumption of
fertilizer fluctuated considerably, but did not show any underlying growth



ANNEX 3-2
Page 15
trend (Table 9, Chart II), reflecting in part the Government's neglect of
the agriculture and.Fertilizer sectors during that period.  By the mid-
sixties, however, the improvements in the credit system, the favorable
economic climate, the continued expansion of the cultivated area, the shifts
in the cropping pattern, the improving relationship of agricultural product
to fertilizer prices and the increasing availability of high analysis
fertilizer products, provided the stimuli for increased fertilizer use.
During the six years from 1966 to 1972, fertilizer consumption increased at
an average annual   rate of 35%.  This rapid growth in fertilizer use is also
reflected in the marked improvement in the intensity of fertilizer use be-tween
1966 and 1972 as shown below:

1/ Based on apparent consumption and cultivated area.
2/  From para 27.  The price index is in real terms with 1963 = 100.
For 1976, the index shown is for 1975 and is based on a 40% price
subsidy.  Without the subsidy, the index would be 209.  A slight
decrease in real prices is expected between 1975 and 1976.
The strong upward trend was only interrupted by adverse weather
in 1969 and 1973 and slowed down by the large increases in interna+tional
fertilizer prices during 1974 and 1975. The introduction of the fertilizer
retail price subsidy (paras 26 to 28) during 1975 helped apparent consumption
grow at a modest rate that year. The continuation of the subsidy system and
the continued decline in international prices have caused apparent consumption
to rise by 17% in 1976.
32.       The absence of systematic statistics on changes in the fertilizer
inventory levels makes it difficult to estimate actual year by year
consumption, which would probably show less annual fluctuations and a more
discernable trend compared to apparent consumption. The Ministry of
Agriculture has made an estirmate of actual consumption for the last six
years which shows a more stable groarth as shown below:

33.       Phosphate is the most important nutrient consumed because of the
soil characteristics and cropping pattern in Brazil (paras 9 to 12). This
has led to the NPK consumption ratio of about 1:2.3:1.3 for the 1972-1976
period. As can be expected, there is a marked difference in the NPK
consumption ratio between the South, the Center and the North/Northeast
regions (Table 10, Chart III) as summarized below. The highest ratio of P
to N is in the South, where most of the soybean and wheat areas are located.

34.       Fertilizer consumption has increased most rapidly in the South,
at about 34.4% annually over the last 10 years (Table 11), followed by the
Northeast (22.4%) and the Center (19.7%). The higher growth rate in the
Northeast compared to the Center reflects the relatively lower consumption
levels in the Northeast during the mid-sixties. Although the South is
the most intensive user of fertilizer, the Center, with its larger cultivated
area, accounts for almost 60% of total nutrient consumption over 1972-76
(Table 12) followed by the South (31%) and the North/Northeast (9%).
35.       Although a significant shift towards higher analysis fertilizer
products occurred in the late sixties, only the phosphatic fertilizers
continued the trend between 1970 and 1974, with TSP displacing SSP
(Table 13). The limited domestic production capacity for urea is partly
responsible for the continued dominance of low analysis products in the
nitrogen fertilizer area.

(ii) Fertilizer Demand Forecast
36.       In 1972  the Government commissioned a study of the fertilizer
sector. The study was executed by SEITEC under the joint supervision of
BNDE (The National Development Bank), IPEA (a planning institute in the
Ministry of Planning) and ANDA. The report, published in May 1974 on the
basis of actual data up to 1970, estimated fertilizer demand at about 4.0
million nutrient tons by 1980 equivalent to an application rate of 80 kg of
nutrient/ha. compared to about 52 Kg/ha. during 1976. The demand forecast
formed the basis for the Government's National Fertilizer Plan (NFP) of
ear'y 1975.
37.       The upper limit for the potential demand for fertilizer can be
estimated on the basis of normative analysis of necessary nutrient replace-
ment rates, and projections of both increases in cultivated area and cropp-
ing patterns. This approach results in a potential demand estimate of about
12 million nutrient tons in 1985. Given the 1976 consumption of 2.3
million nutrient tons, an upper bound of 23% annual average growth rate
from 1976 to 1985 can thus be established. On the basis of the trends of
the past ten years, the Government's agricultural programs for achieving
its goal of an increase of about 7% annually for agricultural output
(Annex 3-1) during the Second Development Plan period (1975-1979), and
the increasing availability of more economically produced local fertilizers,
demand growth rates ranging from 10% to 15% annually appear likely, which
would be somewhat lower than the actual rates for 1970-76 (para 34). Higher
growth rates could probably not be sustained because constraints such as a
slower development of complementary agricultural technology, and limitations
in the extension services, credit facilities and the transportation and
marketing systems would be much too difficult to overcome. The Bank's
forecast on the basis of a 10% to 11% annual NPK demand growth rate is
shown below, together with the forecast contained in the NFP. The NFP
forecasts the NPK ratio to shift significantly to about 1.0:1.14:0.7 by
1980, since generally, at more intensive levels of fertilizer use, pro-
portionately more N is required compared to P.  However, because of the
planned increase in newly cultivated area, which require considerably more
P than N; and the evolving cropping pattern showing several major crops
such as soybeans and wheat which also require more P than N, it is very
likely that only a modest shift in the NPK ratio will materialize.

E. Fer-tilizer Supply - Imports and Production
(i) Historical Pattern of Fertilizer Supply
39.       Brazil imports a major portion of its N and P and all of its K
nutrient requirements in the form of raw materials (phosphate rock), inter-
mediates (phosphoric acid and ammonia) and finished products as, mentioned in
para 3. From 1960-1965, total nutrient imports accounted for 55% to 65% of
apparent consumption. From 1966 to 1975, the share of imports has increased
to about 65% to 80% (Table 14) reflecting the low natural resource endowment
of the country. Nonetheless, an increasing proportion of imports represented
raw materials and intermediates, especially for P, rather than finished
products. This reliance on imported fertilizer materials has proved expensive
when international fertilizer prices increased threefold between 1973 and 1974
(Chart I). The fertilizer import bill for 1974 and 1975 were about US$500
million compared to US$169 million in 1973.
40.       The reliance on imports of finished as well as intermediate products
prior to 1973 has helped maintain retail fertilizer prices at reasonable
levels, since local production costs were generally much higher than the
costs of imports (para 29). To protect local producers and ensure that all
local production is consumed, the Government has instituted an import quota
system for finished fertilizer products. The system requires retailers to
purchase a given proportion of local production for each unit of imported
fertilizer product. The ratio changes depending on local availability and
consumption expectations. When international prices are exceptionally high
as in 1974 and 1975, imports are not restricted. But under more normal inter-
national price conditions, when local production costs exceed the cost of
imports, the quota system is implemented. For 1976, the quota in the North-
east was 1:1 (1 ton of imports per ton of local purchases) for N and P205
could be imported without limit. In the South and the Center the 1976 quota
was 1.6:1 for N (1.6 tons of import per ton of local production) and about
0.4:1 for P205.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 19
41.       Imports are seasonal (Table 15), reflecting the seasonal structure
of consumption (para 13) anr, V- a        Brazilian blenders, mixers and
distributors to niinimize their nretog  costs by timing deliveries just
slightly ahead of' the fertilizer season. The blending and mixing production
levels are easily changed from one or two work shifts during the slack
season and three to four work shifts during the peak season, thereby also
minimizing working capital requirements. About 80% of imports are processed
through two ports, Santos (60%) and Rio Grande (20%), reflecting the
concentration of consumption in the States of Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul.
42.       The historical production of N and P fertilizers are shown in
Table 16. Significant increases in production occurred only
after 1968/69 when the QUIMBRASIL phosphate project started production with
a phosphoric acid capacity of 65,000 TPY of P205 and a total phosphate product
capacity of 100,000 TPY of P205. During 1970/71, the UlTRAFERTIL plant
(123,000 TFY of N, 65,000 TPY of P2%05) at Sao Paulo and the PETROFETIL plant
(55,000 TPY of N) in Bahia came on stream. The COPEBRAS phosphate project
started production in late 1975 with a phosphoric acid capacity of 90,000
TPY of P205 and a total phosphate product capacity of 145,000 TPY of P205.
The PETROFERTIL ammonia/urea expansion project (247,000 TPY of) is scheduled
for completion in mid-1977 and will double Brazil's ammonia capacity from
230,000 TPY of N to 477,0Co TPY N.
During 1973-75, the local N production accounted for about 35%
of N consumption while the domestic P production accounted for about 45%
of P consumption. However, since all K nutrients are imported, the total
nutrient (NPK) production just represented some 30% of total NPK consumption.
(ii) Production Forecast
43.       As discussed (para 3), the Government, through the NFP, is supporting a
number of projects which will transform the fertilizer industry into a major
industrial sector in Brazil's economy. One fuel-oil-based ammonia/urea
project (325,000 TPY N) is under construction at Araucaria, Parana, with a
Bank financing of US$50 million (Loan No. 1256 BR). Two other ammonia/urea
projects, both gas-based, are in an advanced stage of planning. The most
advanced is in Sergipe in the Northeast (247,000 TPY N) which is being pro-
posed for Bank financing. The other is at Norte Fluminense, Rio de
Janeiro (247,000 TPY N) which replaced the Paulinea project after the dis-
covery of offshore oil and gas near Campos.  The Norte Fluminense project is
being proposed for financing by the Inter American Development Bank. The
three projects are expected to start commercial operation in 1979 and 1981,
respectively, and will be owned by FERTILIZANTES with a combined financing
requirement of about US$800 to 850 million. Since ULTRAFERTIL, PETROFERTIL
and FAFER will also be subsidiaries of FERTILIZANTES to consolidate all
fertilizer enterprises of PETROBRAS, FERTILIZANTES will hold the monopoly
of the ammonia/urea production capacity in the country. A fourth ammoria/
urea project probably based on fuel oil to be located in the South (Rio Grande
do Sul) is in the initial stages of planning by FERTILIZANTES and the State
Government, but is not expected to come into production until 1982/83.



ANNEX 3-2

44.       Table 17 shows the development of the ammonia capacity and
production from 1976 through 1985, indicating an almost sixfold increase in
capacity between 1976 and 1981. During 1976 through 1979, about 75% to 80%
of the ammonia production will be available for fertilizer use, the balance
will be needed for industrial uses. By 1980 and 1981, however, when the
Sergipe and Norte Fluminense projects start operation, about 85% to 90% of
the total ammonia production will be available for fertilizer use.
45.       The phosphate rock production capacity of Brazil is also expected
to increase about six times from about 130,000 TPY P205 in 1976 to about
875,000 TPY of P205 by 1979 (Table 18) with the operation of three mining/
beneficiation projects at Araxa (the ARAFERTIL project - 225,000 TPY P205)
in mid-1977, at Tapira (the VALEP project - 345,000 TPY P20s) in late-1978
and at Ipanema (the QUIMBRASIL/SERRANA project - 105,000 T   P205).  The
Ipanema rock and the output from pilot plants at Patos and Catalao (METAG0),
which will start production in 1977, will all be used for direct application.
Between 1980 and 1985, three additional mining/beneficiation projects, now
under initial planning, are expected to be operational. These are the Patos
de Minas project of FERTILIZANTES (350,000 TPY of P205) expected to start
operation in 1981 at the earliest; the Gatalao project of METAGO (220,000
TPY P205) and another project at Catalao by Mineracao Catalao (200,000 TPY
of P205). The two projects at Catalao in the state of Goias are private
sector ventures and will probably come into operation about two to three
years apart, starting 1983 because of transportation difficulties, financing
constraints, and inadequate market demand before 1984.  The financing
requirements of a large mining/beneficiation project based on low grade rock
can range from US$50 to US$200 million.
46.       Several phosphate fertilizer projects are also in the planning
stage (para 6). The most advanced is the VALEFERTIL project at Uberaba
with a phosphoric acid capacity of 290,000 TPY of P205 and a total phosphate
product capacity of 333,000 TPY of P205, expected to be completed by mid-1979.
The VALEFERTIL project will use the phosphate rock from the VAL2P project.  A
Bank loan has been requested for the VALEFERTIL project. A second project,
by ARAFERTIL, will be located at Araxa to use the Araxa phosphate rock. The
ARAFERTIL project will have a phosphoric acid capacity of 190,000 TPY P205
and a total phosphate product capacity of 220,000 TPY of P205.  While the
project has been ready for implementation for sometime, financing constraints
have delayed construction and the project is now expected to be completed by
1981. In the meantime, the Araxa rock will be sold to producers in the
State of Sao Paulo. Two projects are proposed to be constructed in the South,
with a combined phosphoric acid capacity of 285,000 TPY of P205 and a total
product capacity of about 330,000 TPY of P205, or about the size of the
VALEFERTIL project. These two projects will be owned by LUCHSINGER and by
ICC and will likely be completed in 1980. They will both use imported
phosphate rock because no phosphate deposit has been discovered in the South.
Table 19 contains the forecast of phosphoric acid capacity and production,
while Table 20 shows the forecast of total phosphate fertilizer nutrient
output.

F. Forecast of Fertilizer Demand and Supply Situation
47.       The regional as well as national forecast of fertilizer demand and
supply is given in Table 21 for N and Table 22 for P205. All K20 is expected
to be supplied from imports. The forecasts are summarized below and indicate
that with the three new ammonia/urea projects Brazil will be increasingly
self-sufficient in N with local production accounting for 33% of consumption
in 1975 and reaching full self-sufficiency in 1981. The Northeast will have
a surplus of N fertilizers which will be shipped to the Center which will
continue to be a net importer of N. If demand should continue to grow at
10% annually, a new N fertilizer project will be needed to come into
production every two years starting in 1983 to keep local production close
to the demand levels. Thus, the ammonia/urea project in the South can be
planned for completion by 1983.

48.       The supply and demand forecast for P indicates that the South will
continue to be a deficit region, inspite of the planned doubling of capacity
from 328,000 TPY of P205 in 1976 to about 643,000 TFY of P205 by 1980. The
deficit could be eliminated by adding another 130,000 TPY of P205 product
capacity for 1980/81, and then increasing capacity by about 150,000 TPY of
P205 every other year thereafter. The South will also be importing all its
phosphoric acid and phosphate rock until 1980 when LUCHSINGER and ICC
complete their phosphoric acid projects. By 1981, the South would still be
only about 50% self-sufficient in phosphoric acid requirement, and will still
import all its rock requirement. While a potential surplus of phosphate
rock (from Catalao) exist in the Center region for 1982-1984, the prohibitive
local transport cost makes shipment into the South uneconomic except when
international prices increase much higher than presently estimated.
49.       The phosphate product supply and demand  situation in the Center
region will change, however, from a deficit situation up to 1978, to a
balanced situation in 1979, and then to a potential surplus situation



ANNEX 3-2
Page 22
during 1980 and 1983. The potential surplus is about 100,000 to 150,000 TPY
of P205 and exists only because four firms (UNIAO, FERTIBASE, MANAH and
INDAG) have the flexibility of producing some TSP, based on imported
phosphoric acid, or SSP, based on imported sulfuric acid or sulfur. If
these four firms produce the maximum TSP, they will supply 50% more P205
nutrients than if they produced only SSP.S/ The four firms could produce
the maximum P205 nutrients (TSP) and ship part of their production to the
South, which is expected to have a deficit of about 100,000 to 150,000 TPY
of P205 between 1980 and 1983 and a much larger deficit after 1983. But
these four producers may not be competitive with imports into the South.
The production forecast for phosphate products in Table 21 assume that
during 1980 through 1983, these four firms will adjust their product mix
between SSP and TSP such that a surplus of P205 nutrients in the Center
region is avoided. This assumption is reasonable since the VALEFERTIL
and the ARAFERTIL projects, which come on-stream during 1979 and 1981,
respectively, will supply the necessary TSP and MAP based on their own
phosphoric acid production. By 1984, however, this potential surplus will
disappear and a deficit will occur again by 1985. It appears, therefore,
that the Center region will not need additional phosphate product capacity,
other than the VALEFERTIL and the ARAFERTIL projects, until 1984. Starting
1985 or 1986, additional capacity of about 100,000 TPY of P205 will be
required each year to keep production in line with increases in demand.
50.       The North/Northeast region will have a deficit of phosphate
products up to 1979, when the proposed PROFERTIL TSP project and the
AGROFERTIL MAP project are expected to be completed. Beyond 1979, the region
should be self-sufficient in P205 products, although it will import all the
phosphoric acid and phosphate rock raw materials.

52.       The Center region is expected to be self-suffLcient in phosphoric
acid between 1980 and 1983 with the VALEFERTIL and the ARAFERTIL projects.
In addition, the region will also be about 85% to 95% self-sufficient in
phosphate rock with the completion of the four projects at Araxa, Tapira,
Ipanema and Patos de Minas (Table 18). The present plans for the Patos
deposit envisions a mining/beneficiation project (310,000 TPY P205) to be
completed perhaps by 1981 to substitute for imported phosphate rock. At
that time, the ARAFERTIL fertilizer project will likely come on stream and
use the Araxa phosphate rock. Thus, the Patos project will continue to
supply rock to the present producers, notably COPEBRAS and ULTRAFERTIL. An
expansion project for Patos, probably to be ready by 1985 or 1986, will
involve a doubling of the mining output for processing into phosphatic
fertilizers. This expansion project will be identical in scale to the combined
VALEP-VALEFERTIL complex and will provide the additional phosphoric acid
capacity needed in the region. Development of one of the Catalao deposit for
production by 1983 and the second Catalao project for operation by 1986 would
ensure the Center region self-sufficiency in phosphate rock through the end
of the 1980s.
G. Distribution System
53.       The structure of the Brazilian marketing and distribution system
is schematically shown in Chart IV. Most of the fertilizer passes through
three levels on the way to final consumption: (i) primary production,
(ii) blenders and (iii) wholesale and retail sales organization. In
addition, domestic producers, who supply about one-third of consumption, are
also usually involved in importing as well as blending and selling. About
90% of total consumption is processed through blenders, which are either
owned by manufacturers (25% of total), independent companies (65%), or
cooperatives (10%). Blenders are also involved in importing.
54.       Sales organizations are either:  (i) dependent organizations of
the manufacturers, (ii) commission agents, (iii) independent dealers
and (iv) cooperatives. Dependent organizations are extensions of the
manufacturer's marketing organization and employees work on a fixed salary.
Commission agents depend on the blending operation or the domestic
manufacturers by an agreement which obliges them to sell only fertilizer
products of the corresponding companies. The local agents who sell on a
commission basis can be exclusive fertilizer dealers or general rural
salesmen. Companies which sell by commission agents employ one regional
sales manager and 4-6 inspectors for every 50-150 local agents. The regional
sales manager is a salaried employee of the company, the inspectors may or
may not receive fixed salaries. Local agents receive a commission of about
4% from the sales as an average ranging from 3 to 10%.  The agent helps the
farmer in arranging bank credits and transportation.
55.       Independent dealers have lost importance and this trend is continu-
ing. At present they are primarily used in new areas in which the amount of
fertilizer sold at the introductory phase does not pay a company-owned
selling system. Similarly, cooperatives are not a major sales outlet, and
are not expected to grow significantly in the near future. Sales on commission
is still the most frequently used marketing channel. However, the exact



ANNEX 3-2
Page 2h
distribution on the different market channels is not known, and the percentage
numbers given in Chart IV are only rough estimates.
56.       The distribution of storage between manufacturers, blenders and
local retailers is not accurately known. Blenders try to avoid storage as
far as possible because of the lack of working capital. Considering the cost
of storage it is usually more profitable for them to adjust their blending
operation to the seasonal structure of consumption by increasing the daily
working time from 8 to 24 hours, than to store large quantitites over 9
months of the year. Farmers participate only marginally in storage also due
primarily to lack of working capital and insufficient discount and credit
facilities.  Thus, most of storage is done by the manufacturers, who usually
rent storage in the peak season. The problem of storage will become more
serious with increasing degree of local production, since adjustment by
imports will lose its present importance.
57.       Transportation is one of the most important distribution elements
in Brazil because of the long distance between production and consumption
centers.  It is also a significant constraint to the growth of fertilizer
consumption especially in the regions which will become crucial for the
further increase of agricultural production. The Government (GEIPOT) has embarked
in 1975 on a country-wide transportation study and has completed Phase I which
studied the present and expected transportation pattern of ten commodities
which constitute the bulk of Brazil's transportation requirements. One of
the commodities studied was fertilizer,and the following is an extract from
the Phase I report.
58.       In principle, highway transportation, railway transportation and
coastal shipping compete against each other. But transport by ship along
the coast or on the great rivers has not gained importance in domestic
transportation. Road and rail transport are, therefore, the only significant
means of transportation,and the split for the two modes is shown below for
1974:
BRAZIL - TRANSPORT MODES OF FERTILIZER, 1974
(in %)
Region           Product          By Road  By Rail  Total
Northeast  Finished Products        96.9      3.1    100.0
Center     Raw Materials            95.9      4.1    100.0
Intermediate Products   88.0      12.0    100.0
Finished Products        84.8    15.2    100.0
South      Finished Products        81.7     18.3    100.0
Source: GEIPOT
59.       Most fertilizers are thus moved by road transport despite the fact
that rail transport may be cheaper in many cases. The principal reason for
this pattern is the greater flexibility and convenience provided by road



ANNEX 3-2
Page 25
transport particularly for the distribution of finished fertilizer. Para-
doxically, the share of rail transport in the Center is larger for finished
products than for raw materials (15.2% versus 4.1%). This is due to the
lack of a railway link between the fertilizer terminal in Santos and the
railway network of the Center. All raw materials entering the port of Santos
have to be loaded on trucks before they can be moved by railway. A rail link
is being built and financed under the Bank's First Port Project. The share of
fertilizer raw materials carried by the railways in the Center can be expected
to increase once the line is completed.
60.       The lack of specialized freight cars for corrosive bulk materials
and the fact that many manufacturers and blenders do not have adequate
facilities for loading and unloading bulk materials from railcars is one of the
most important handicaps which have prevented the railways from capturing a
larger share of the transport of raw and intermediate materials. Manufacturers
generally have to bag intermediate products in order to use the railway's
standard box cars. The blender receiving the material has to tear the bags
as an additional operation before he can use the material. Unless the
distances are very long, the additional cost of bagging and unbagging normally
offsets the cost advantage of the railways, thus road transport, which is also
generally faster, is used.
61.       The industry would use the railway for transport of bulk materials
but for the lack of proper railcars. To overcome this situation, it would be
necessary to identify those transport routes which carry a considerable
amount of bulk materials and to convert such routes to rail transport by
working out an agreement between the companies involved and the railroad
authority. The necessary analytical work for this is being done as part of
the Fertilizer Market and Marketing Study (para 70).
62.       The GEIPOT study also evaluated the port situation which is impor-
tant to the fertilizer industry as over 50% of all the nutrients still come
from overseas. In terms of importance, the ports of Santos and Rio Grande
rank first and second and they handle about 80% of imported fertilizer
materials. The table below gives a breakdown of the volumes handled by
each port for 1974 and also an estimate of the fertilizer unloading capacity
for some of the ports:

63.       Rio Grande is the best equipped port with special fertilizer handling
equipment and storage installed by FERTISUL and by LUCHSINGER. Santos also
has a special fertilizer terminal with a nominal capacity of unloading 12,000
tons per day per ship. The actual unloading however, reaches only about
1,800 tons per day per ship because of the design of the berths, the low capa-
city of the grabs, and the tendency of the fertilizer to cake. The other
difficulty in Santos is the lack of a railway link as mentioned earlier. The
ports in the Northeast are much more inefficient, and Recife, which handles
more than 50% of the imports for the Northeast will require a fertilizer
terminal to cope with the larger volume expected in the future.
64.       The new chemical port being built in Aratu (Bahia) to move the raw
materials and finished products of the chemical complex in Camacari (which
includes the PETROFERTIL plant) will have excellent fertilizer handling
facilities. The excess fertilizer production of the Northeast can thus be
very efficiently shipped from Aratu.
65.       Port handling charges average about US$20 per ton depending on the
port and the material handled. Costs in Rio Grande and the new port of Aratu
are and will continue to be much lower than in other ports.
66.       Table 23 gives a comparison of some representative routes and costs
for rail and road transport in the Center and the South. It shows that while
the railroads charge less than the trucking companies on a per ton-km basis,
this advantage, particularly for distances less than 600 road km-, is offset
by the fact that the trains have to cover a much greater distance
between any two given points compared to highway travel. There appears to



ANNEX 3-2
Page 27
be an interesting regional difference between the Center and the South. The
South's rail tariffs are considerably lower, while road transport charges
appear higher, than the Center's. As a result, rail transport in the South
is generally cheaper than by truck, while the Center shows a slight advantage
for road transport. This probably explains why rail transport has a higher
share of fertilizer shipments in the South than any other region.
67.       The future transportation pattern will be significantly altered by
the expected growth of the fertilizer sector and by the shift from imports to
local production of raw and intermediate materials. This will generally ease
the load on the ports, but will increase the inland transport requirements
significantly.  Starting in 1977 when PETROFERTIL's new ammonia/urea plant
will commence production, large quantities of ammonia will have to be moved
over long distances. At present, only small amounts of ammonia are moved, all
by truck. The companies and the railroads have to make a considerable invest-
ment in ammonia moving facilities. PETROBRAS is presently studying this
problem and specific recommendations are expected by early 1977.
68.       Because the Northeast will become a net exporter of nitrogen
fertilizers, coastal shipping will become a more important mode of transport
to move ammonia and urea. It is also possible that the production from the
proposed plant at Norte Fluminense would best be moved by ship, further
increasing the role of coastal shipping in the fertilizer sector.
H. Proposed Fertilizer Market and Marketing Study
69.       In connection with the Araucaria project, the Government has under-
taken a study of the market and marketing aspects of the fertilizer sector.
While the Government intends that the private sector handle the marketing and
distribution of fertilizers, as has been the case in the past, it is crucial
that the Government help identify potential bottlenecks in marketing and
distribution, to ensure that the Government's policies and programs comple-
ment to the fullest degree, and facilitate, the rapid expansion of fertilizer
use. The Government has also agreed to exchange views with the Bank regarding
the expansion and development of the fertilizer sector including fertilizer
import and pricing policy, and the results and recommendations of the
proposed study.
70.       The proposed study would have the following major objectives:
(i)    Develop a methodology for and estimate fertilizer demand
and supply for a 10-year period and propose institutional
arrangements for annual updates;
(ii)   Make recommendations as to the optimal location of future
fertilizer plants considering regional increase in
consumption and likely shifts in fertilizer distribution
patterns;



ANNEX 3-2
Page 28
(iii) Identify specific constraints that may prevent the more
efficient and broader use of fertilizers;
(iv)   Define improvements and/or expansion of storage, transporta-
tion and mixing/blending facilities that are required to
support the expected increases in fertilizer production/
consumption; and
(v)    Recommend possible new Government policies (including
credit and pricing) and programs that would be needed
to ensure that the required marketing/distribution
investments are undertaken either by the private or public
sectors, and encourage broader and more efficient fertilizer
use.
71.       Detailed terms of reference for the study were prepared by IPEA,
which will supervise the study, and have been reviewed by the Bank.  It is
expected that the final report of the study which began in October 1976
should be available in the fall of 1977.

THP - thermophosphate; NPK - complex fertilizers.
2/ The TSP units of these four firms can produce either or both TSP and SSP.  The production forecast assumes that the product mix will be adjusted to avoid
a surplus of P205 nutrient in the Center region.
3/ See Table 19 for firms and year of installation.
4/ The capacity includes expansions of 50,000 TPY P 0  for TSP and 10,000 TPY P205 for PAP by 1977 and 1978 respectively.
5/ The NPK product has an average formula of (6-32-I2. The planned phosphoric acid plant (Table 20) is to substitute for imports and will not add to product capacity.
6/ The capacity includes an expansion of 7,000 TPY for TSP by 1980.

ANNEX 4-3
BRAZIL - VALEFERTIL FERTILIZER PROJECT
PROJECT SCOPE, PROCE W DESCRIPTION AND POLLUTION OONTROL
A. Project Scope
1.       fThe project consists of (a) two sulphuric acid units each with a
capacity of 1,300 TPD of 98.5% acid; (b) two phosphoric acid units each with
a capacity of 470 TPD of P205 in the form of 52% acid; (c) a 1,000 TPD
MAP unit; (d) a 1,100 TPD TSP unit; (e) storage facilities for 30,000 tons
of sulphuric acid; 8,500 tons of phosphoric acid; 4L,000 tons of ammonia;
2,500 tons of fuel oil; 28,000 tons of sulphur, and 220,000 tons of finished
products; (f) a rail spur and 25 ammonia tank wagons; and (g) ancillary facilities
such as offices, laboratories, maintenance shops, effluent treatment, and the
supply of utilities. The project will operate at achievable stream efficiencies
of 302 days/year for the sulphuric acid units, 309 days/year for the phosphoric
acid units and 330 days/year for the MAP and the TSP units.1/ The ammonia tank-
wagons are needed since the railways do not have enough wagons nor do they intend
to purchase any for this project. Because the project would be the first to use
the Tapira phosphate rock, there are inherent uncertainties as to the achievable
levels of the phosphoric acid production. The phosphoric acid units have, there-
fore, been designed with additional design factors in the reactors and filters.
Should the actual production experience approximate the test results, the
phosphoric acid units may have about 10% more capacity than indicated above. To
take advantage of this potential additional phosphoric acid capacity, the design
capacities of the TSP unit and the sulphuric acid units are slightly larger than
what would be needed to just match the phosphoric acid capacity indicated above.
On the basis of the phosphoric acid design capacity, the project will have an
annual production capacity of 330,000 TPY of MAP (10-51-0) and 340,000 TPI of TSP
(o-48.5-o). The design capacities of the different units are within the economic
range and gives the project the advantage of economies of scale.
2.        The two major raw materials required by the project at rated
capacity will be about 277,000 TPY of sulphur and about 986,000 TPY of
phosphate rock. Sulphur will be obtained by imports and moved by rail cars
to the plant site. Rock phosphate will be supplied by VALEP - another
subsidiary of CVRD, which is developing for this purpose, the rock phosphate
deposits at Tapira in the State of Minas Gerais.  The rock phosphate ore
mined at Tapira will be beneficiated and carried through a slurry pipeline
to the VALEP terminal adjacent to the VALEFERTIL project site. The rock
phosphate requirements of VAIEFERTIL will be available partly (86%) as a
slurry containing 63% solids for the phosphoric acid plant and partly
(14%) as fine dry material for the TSP plant. The beneficiated rock
phosphate is expected to contain 36+2% of P205, with not more than 3%
of Fe2O3. Ammonia (45,500 TPI) for the production of MAP will be supplied
initially from imports and then (1981/82) from the proposed PETROBRAS

Ammonia will be moved in special tankwagons by railroad to the plant site.

B.   Process Description
3.        The sulphuric acid plant is based on the Bayer double catalyst process
and can achieve a conversion efficiency of 99.5%. The basic design for the
plant is provided by Lurgi of the Federal Republic of Germany. The total
capacity of 2,600 TPD is provided in two trains of 1,300 TPD capacity each.
Bright sulphur is melted with steam heating in melting pits and pumped
through sulphur filters to the plant for combustion. Air for combustion is
drawn from the atmosphere by the main air blower, filtered in a dry air
filter, and dried with sulphuric acid in the drying tower. The sulphur is
burnt in the air in a furnace to produce sulphur dioxide. The hot gases are
cooled and the heat recovered, as medium pressure steam, in a waste heat
boiler, followed by superheater and economizer. Sulphur dioxide in the gases
is converted to sulphur trioxide over vanadium pentoxide catalyst, in a four
layer catalytic converter. The gases are cooled in between the catalyst
layers, in separately arranged waste heat boilers. Part of the sulphur
trioxide is removed in an absorption system, after the second catalyst
layer. This system improves conversion efficiency to 99.5%. The absorption
system after the second catalyst layer absorbs about 87% to 90% of the total
sulphur trioxide with sulphuric acid in a brick lined mild steel venturi.
The rest of the sulphur trioxide, including that formed in the third and
fourth catalyst layers, is absorbed in a final absorption system, similar
to the intermediate one. The air drying towers and the absorption systems
have mist eliminators to minimize carryover of acid mist. The product of
98.5% sulphuric acid purity is cooled and stored in two storage tanks each
of 7200 M3 capacity.
h.        The phosphoric acid plant is designed and engineered based on the
Rhone-Poulenc process, with basic designs from Krebs of France. Total
production capacity of 940 TPD is provided in two trains of 470 TPD capacity
each. Rock phosphate slurry, containing about 63% solids, is received at
the VALEP terminal in Uberaba through a 9 inch diameter slurry pipeline,
having capacity of 260 tons per hour of concentrate (ANNEX 4h-1).
5.        The rock phosphate slurry from VALEP's pipeline terminal facilities
is received in the phosphoric acid plant in two agitated storage tanks, each
of 500 cu. m. capacity. Phosphate rock slurry, sulphuric acid and recycled
phosphoric acid are introduced into a single tank agitated reactor with no
inner partitions. Reactions take place with the formation of phosphoric
acid and crystallization of gypsum. The reactor includes cooling arrange-
ments for maintaining desired reaction temperatures. Slurry, overflowing
from the reactor, is pumped to the feedbox of the continuous vacuum filter.
Gaseous effluents from the reactor are washed for removal of dust and
fluorine and sent to the stack. Phosphoric acid in the slurry is separated
from gypsum in the filter. The gypsum cake is washed in multiple stages to
minimize ?2(5 loss. The plant produces phosphoric acid containing 30% P205.
The gypsum cake from the filter, is slurried with water from the water pond
and pumped to the gypsum pond. The 30% P205 acid is cooled in a stirred
cooling tank to increase the precipitation of sludge and clarified in a
decanter. The clarified acid is sent to a storage tank of 2500 m3
capacity.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 3
6.         The phosphoric acid concentration units are designed to remove
800 TPD of water in each stream to produce acid with 52% P 205. The units
include vacuum evaporators in which the acid is circulated, using carbon
block heat exchangers for reheating. Steam from the unit contains fluorine
and chlorine. The concentrated acid is pumped to four storage tanks each
of 2500 m3 capacity. The fluorine released from the evaporator is absorbed
in a scrubbing tower in recirculated fluosilicic acid to produce 25%
fluosilicic acid liquor.
7.        The MAP plant has a capacity of 1000 TPD and is engineered with
basic designs from Swift-Gulf Design. The 52% P20< phosphoric acid, along
with dust laden water from the plant, is reacted with ammonia in a Tee Reactor
to produce non-granular MAP. For the production of granular MAP, phosphoric
acid is pumped to the ammoniator-granulators. The acid is also pumped to
the tower-granulator scrubbing system to capture ammonia fumes from the
granulation system. Powder MAP from the MAP tower and granular MAP from
the anmoniator-granulator are sent to the dryer-cooler to reduce the water
content to 1 to 2%. The granular material is milled and screened before
storage.
8.        The TSP plant is engineered with basic designs from Gulf Design,
a division of Badger (US). The plant has a capacity of 1100 TPD for producing
TSP, either as a run-of-pile or granular product. Ground rock phosphate is
fed continuously to a mixer cone, where it is mixed with preheated 52% P205
phosphoric acid. The reacting material is discharged onto a slow moving slat
conveyor in the Broadfield den. The conveyor is equipped with a revolving
cutter at the discharge end and is enclosed in vented housing. The run-of-
pile TSP is conveyed to a storage building, and cured for two weeks.
Reclaimed TSP is granulated in granulating, drying, screening and milling
units. The project has total product storage capacity of 100,000 tons for
MAP and TSP.
C.   Plant Location and Supply of Utilities
9.        The project site is within a recently established industrial park
located along the right bank of the Rio Grande river, some 37 km south of
Uberaba City. Uberaba is an important crossroads in the center region, being
served by highways BR-365 (Sao Simao-Montes Claros), BR-050 (Sao Paulo-Goiania)
and BR-262 (Vitoria-Belo Horizonte). It is also served by the FEPASA and
the RFFSA railways, both in meter gauge, connecting Uberaba to Sao Paulo,
Santos, Belo Horizonte and Brasilia. The project location is shown in
Annex 4-2 (IBRD Map 12666). VALEFERTIL has already acquired about 48 ha
of land for the project. Soil investigations and land grading have been
completed. The project is the first to be erected in the industrial park,
which is located between the FEPASA branch railroad currently unuer construction
and highway BR-050 ensuring adequate transportation facilities. VALEFERTIL is making
arrangements for the construction by FEPASA, of a railspur to the plant as well as
the provision of railroad cars for the transport of sulphur, fuel oil and



ANNEX 4-3
Page h
finished products. The external power requirements of the project will be
provided through a nearby 30,000 KVA substation which is connected to the
hydroelectric power plants along the Rio Grande river. A 2 km water pipeline
from the Rio Grande river to the factory, with associated water treatment
facilities, will supply the water for the project.
D.   Pollution Control
10.       Special features, included while specifying and designing the
facilities to minimize the emission and/or discharge of objectionable
waste materials, are summarized below.
11.       Sulphuric acid plant.  The normal pollutants from this plant are
the unconverted sulphur dioxide, unabsorbed sulphur trioxide and the acid
mist in the stack gases. The sulphuric acid plant for the project is being
engineered based on the Bayer double-catalyst, double-absorption process
with a guaranteed sulphur conversion efficiency of 99.5%. The acid mist
in the stack gases is minimized by the use of two-stage demisters after
final absorption. The expected S02 in the exit gases is 1.96 kg per ton
of H2SO4. The gases, after the final absorber and demisters, will be let
into the atmosphere through a tall stack to ensure adequate dilution.
12.       Phosphoric acid plant.  Fluorine is the major pollutant and occurs
during three of the process stages - (a) acidulation of rock phosphate in the
reactor (b) filtration of the phosphoric acid and (c) concentration of the
phosphoric acid. The reactor cooling gas effluent containing fluorine is
subjected to two stage scrubbing - with recirculating pond water in the first
stage and with used soft water from the vacuum pump scrubber in the second
stage. The scrubbed gases are let into the atmosphere through stacks.
Fluorine evolved during the filtration is scrubbed with soft water in
washing condensers and the effluent gas exhausted at the vacuum pump
discharge. About eighty percent of the fluorine evolved during acid
concentration is recovered as fluosilicic acid, which will be converted
either to cryolite or aluminum fluoride. The rest of the fluorine is
condensed in the barometric condenser and sent to the pond water system.
The pond water, which is kept recirculated, will be saturated with P20s
and fluorine. The pond will be designed with enough volumetric capacity
as to ensure zero overflow. Any emergency overflow will be treated with
lime to precipitate fluorine compounds. Of the total fluorine present in
the rock phosphate 5h% will be recovered as hydrofluosilicic acid, 28% will
remain in the concentrated phosphoric acid, and about 19% is discharged
into the recirculating pond water via the barometric condensers and the
recycled gypsum slurry water. The designs envisage emission into the
air of about 0.4 percent of the fluorine in the rock phosphate or not
exceeding 230 gms per ton of P20s. In addition during high wind conditions,
the pond will lose some fluorine into the air but at very low concentrations.
13.       Monoaimmonium phosphate plant.  The effluent gases from the prilling
tower and the granulator contain ammonia and MAP dust, which are removed in



ANNEX 4-3
Page 5
tower scrubbers before the gases are exhausted to the stack. The dryer-
cooler exhaust gas and vent air at de-dusting points will contain dust
with ammonia and P205 which are recovered in a scrubber before the gases
are vented to the stack.
14.       Triple Superphosphate plant.  Vent gases from the acid/rock phosphate
mixer and the den, contain fluorine, which is scrubbed in a scrubber with
recirculating water. Dust-laden gases from the granulator and dryer are
scrubbed with recirculating water. The recirculating water containing
fluorine and P205 is sent to the cooling water pond. Scrubbed gases are
vented to the atmosphere.
15.       Auxiliary boiler.  The project will have a fuel oil-fired auxiliary
boiler with    tons per hour capacity.  The boiler will be used when required
to meet shortages of steam especially during start ups and when the sulphuric
acid plant is shut down. The flue gas which will contain sulphur dioxide
will be let out through a stack, adequately sized to provide enough dispersion
of S02.

BRAZIL - VALEFERTIL FERTILIZER PROJBCT
VALEP PHOSPHATE MINING PROJECT
A.  Introduction and Background
1.        The VALEFERTIL Project has a design requirement of about 986,000
tons per year (TFY) of phosphate rock (35% P205 content) which will be
provided by Mineracao Vale do Paranaiba, S.A. (VALEP), a fully-owned
subsidiary of CVRD. VALEP was established in December 197h, as successor
to Rio Doce Titanio S.A. (TITANSA), earlier set up to exploit the titanium
and niobium ores found in conjunction with the phosphate deposits at Tapira.
The shift in commercial interest, from titanium to phosphate mining resulted
from two factors: (a) the increase in international rock phosphate prices
and the establishment of the Brazilian National Fertilizer Program to
increase self-sufficiency in fertilizers; and (b) the development of a
local beneficiation technology suited to the low grade igneous phosphate
ores commonly found in Brazil. The beneficiation process can produce
phosphate rock concentrate with 30% to 36% P205 from raw ore containing
an average of 5% to 16% P205. The process has been well proven at the
QUIMBRASIL mining/beneficiation complex at Jacupiranga and at the ARAFERTIL
industrial pilot plant at Araxa. The P205 recovery of the process is also
satisfactory, ranging from 60% to 70% of the P205 contained in the raw ore.
This recovery factor compares favorably with the standard metallurgical
process used on U.S. sedimentary type low grade ore in the range of 5%
to 10% P205 content which shows a recovery of just 30% to 50%. Although
VALEP is presently concentrating its efforts on the phosphate mining/
beneficiation project, it is also continuing the research and development
effort for exploiting the titanium and, in the near future, a research and
development program for the niobium ore is also a possibility. VALEP has
associated with New Jersey Zinc Company (U.S.) in a research effort for
recovering a commercial titanium product from the Tapira ore. However,
commercial exploitation of the titanium ore is not expected until after
about five or more years (Section J).
2.        At present, Brazil produces about 250,000 to 300,000 TFY of
phosphate rock concentrate containing about 35% P205 mostly from the
Jacupiranga deposit, with small quantities coming from pilot plants or
mining/washing operations fron the Araxa deposit for direct application.
The phosphate rock production forecast is shown in ANNEX 3-2. AlU the
production occurs in the Center Region as no significant phosphate
deposit has been found in the other regions. The potential reserves
and production capacity of the several phosphate mining/beneficiation
projects are shown below :

a/ Small quantities for direct application are also produced or will be produced
at Araxa, Patos and Catalao (ANNEX 3-2, Table 18) and are not included in this
Table.
b/ Most of the production is in the form of 35% P205 concentrate.
c/ Approximately half of the reserves can be considered as proven and the P205
recovery will range from 60% to 70%.
d! The P205 content of the Araxa deposit occurs partly as "locked" minerals that
cannot be upgraded. Thus, the effective grade is less than the l5/o shown above.
No information has been obtained as to whetler the Catalao deposit is of
similar character.
3.        Except for the Patos de Minas deposit which is sedimentary type
rock, all the other deposits are igneous type rock. S'ialler igneous deposits
are also found in Juquia (Sao Paulo) and in the Northeast but these are not
expected to be convercially developed in any significant levels.
B.   The Tapira Phosphate Deposit
4.        The Tapira phosphate deposit has been subdivided into several target
areas, with target areas 1 and 4 having been sufficiently drilled to determine
the reserves. Target area 1 covering about 2 x 1.5 km, is adjacent to the
beneficiation plant and has adequate reserves for the initial 20 years of
operation. Target area 2, about 2 km farther has twice the reserves of
Target area 1. The reserves, on the basis of areas with at least 5% P205
and with less than 40 mters of overburden, produce an average ore grade of
8% soluble P205 and are summarized below.

Target Area 2.
b/ The measured and indicated category correspond to proven reserves while
all the three categories correspond to potential reserves.
c/ Recoverable reserves at an average beneficiation plant recovery (of P205)
of 65%.
5.        Drilling of the Tapira reserves started in 1971 and was undertaken
by DCCEGEO, another CVRD subsidiary. The measured reserves are based on a
200m x 200m drill pattern. The indicated reserves are based on the same drill
spacing but with analytical chemical data extrapolated from only a portion of
the holes. The inferred reserves are based on widely spaced drilling and
mineralization was determined on the basis of a weighted value of the measured
and indicated reserves. The entire reserve program was reviewed independently
by Mr. Michel David of the Ecole Polytech of Montreal, Canada. As a result of
this review, it was determined that drill holes on 400 meter centers would
have been statistically adequate for measuring the reserves. The Target area
1 reserves will be adequate for 20 years production at 986,000 TPY of 35%
P205 concentrate (about 3h5,000 TPY of P205).
6.        The drilling program at the Tapira deposit included 186 holes, with
an average depth of 65 meters and an average ore recovery of 83%. In addition
to the drill holes the program included 5 large pits in the outcrop, several
smaller vertical pits and trenches, several auger holes up to 80 cm in diameter,
plus 5 drifts each approximately 40 meters into the outcrop. Approximately
95% of the drill cores as well as most of the ore from other exploratory work
have been physically processed.
7.        A review of the analytical procedures and calculations used to arrive
at recoverable reserves shows the procedure to be valid. The direct P205
analysis of core samples have been correlated with beneficiation tests to
prove that the direct chemical analysis is a valid method of core evaluation.
A very exhaustive program of ore characterization related to processing has
been carried out by VALEP.
8.        The phosphate reserves are located generally as a slightly dipping
elluvial layer within a large irregular shaped hill. The deposit is a typical
alkaline pipe or carbonatite ring of igneous origin. Minerals associated
with the hydroxapatite (phosphate ore), are chiefly vermiculite, magnetite,



ANNEX 4-4
Page 4
anatase (titanium ore), pyrochlore (niobium ore), and various clays and
silicates. The anatase and pyrochlore are in sufficient quantities to be
considered for future commercial development.
C.   VALEP Project Description and Implementation
9.        The VALEP ProJect includes mining, beneficiation and product
transport facilities for a production of 986,000 tons per year (TPY) of
35% P205 phosphate concentrate. Drying and dry rock storage facilities
will also be provided for 300,000 TPY of the production. The prime contractor
for the project is a consortium known as "PAAA-LOGOS-EIM."   PAAA, Paulo Abib
Andery y Associados s/c Ltda and EIM, Engenharia para a Industria Mineral S.A.,
are specialists in minerals processing and engineering. PAAA developed the
carbonatite phosphate beneficiation technology. LOGOS, Logos Engenharia,
S.A., specializes in the management of large construction projects. Super-
vision of the prime contractor is handled by the VALEP Project Team and
operations engineers. As the project nears completion a training program
is planned for the operations personnel. The organization for the commercial
operation has been planned in detail with an expected personnel requirement
of 922. Most of the personnel will come from the Belo Horizonte mining
area and the key personnel are expected to have some mining experience.
An extensive training facility has been included within the main office
building complex.
10.       Beneficiation tests for the Tapira rock were carried out during
1975 at the ARAFERTIL industrial pilot plant. Engineering work started in
1975 and work on the beneficiation plant site began in mid-1976. Mechanical
completion is scheduled for May 1978 and following three months of testing,
commercial production should start August 1978.
11.       Power requirement of 26,000 KW for the VALEP Project will be
supplied by CEMIG as hydroelectric power. Water will be pumped at 3,000
cubic meters per hour by VALEP from the Rio do Inferno, a distance of 9 km
from the plant. The system is adequately designed with a 30% surge capacity
complete with a large reservoir to easily accommodate the project's needs.
A study was made to assure that use of the river water will always be
available. Extensive maintenance facilities have also been provided to
handle the normal requirements of a remote facility.
D.   Mining Plans
12.       A relatively simple conventional shovel and truck open pit mine
plan will be used at Tapira. The mine will be a "U" shape cut into the side
of a hill. The mining will provide open faces of the entire ore body to
permit conditions for selective mining and ideal blending. Haul distance
for the ore is 1 km and for the overburden should average h km. Overburden
thickness in later years will reach 40 meters (expected economic cut-off)
and the ore thickness varies from 0 to 90 meters thick, and in the area to
be mined about 30 to 40 meters thick. The overburden and the upper portion



ANNEX 4-4
Page )'
of the ore is a soft earthy material containing some clay and tends to be
quite sticky when wet. Drainage will be provided ahead of the mining face
and surface drainage will be provided in the mine workings. The lower 30%
of the ore is generally a highly weathered hardrock. Allowance has been
made for blasting this material.
13.          Initial equipment for the mine will be four, 9-cubic yard electric
shovels (marion 151-M), two 15-cubic yard wheeled loaders, and ten 120-ton
trucks. This equipment selection is optimum for the initial stage of the
project where flexibility to suit weather and ore grade conditions is
critical. Since the mine begins on the outcrop, the equipment for major
overburden stripping is not required until 1980. During the interim
VALEP could easily change its overburden stripping methods based upon
its experience and economic studies presently underway for this aspect
of the project.
14.        The following table summarizes the expected annual volume of
ore and overburden to be mined.

Tapira is located in an area of heavy rainful, averaging 1.5
meters annually and of poor drainage conditions. The rainy season spans
six months from October to March, with the heaviest rainfall concentrated
during the three-month period November to January. During these three
months, mining at the Tapira mine can be considerably hampered by rains
of approximately 80-120 inches per month. To cope with this, the operating
hours of the mine were discounted; the mining equipment has extra wide
tracks and tires; the mining plan allows flexibility to mine areas least
hampered by rain; and where permissible benches will be surfaced with
waste rock or hardrock ore. In addition, hydrology studies are underway
by Brazilian consultants on the feasibility of lowering the water table
(pieziometric surface) in advance of mining. The final stages of the
dewatering studies should be completed by mid-1977. These precautions
should permit mining during the rainy season but at a lower level of
production.
16.       To maintain a constant feed to the beneficiation plant, two
large storage piles will be provided. Each pile will accommodate up to
4 days of mine production which will last for 7 days of plant operation.
The mine will have no difficulty insuring the plant a constant feed except
during extended periods of continuous rain. Because of the large volume of
materials involved, costs of stocking, reclaiming and inventory will limit
raw ore pile to about two weeks of supply to the beneficiation plant. Thus
it is very possible that the beneficiation plant will operate at less than
capacity or even shut-down completely during certain times within the three-
months (November-January) of heaviest rainfall.
E.   Beneficiation Process and Plant Description
17.       The Tapira ore will be beneficiated by a process similar to the
one now in use at Jacupiranga and the ARAFERTIL pilot plant at Araxa.
Briefly, the process involves crushing the ore to minus 8 inches, spreading
it in either of two large storage piles, and reclaiming it in a manner such
that optimum mixing is accomplished. The ore is further crushed and milled
with rod and ball mills to minus 65 mesh, deslimed at 20 micron, sized into
two fractions and then conditioned. The conditioning involves the addition
of starch and other reagents as depressants for the iron, aluminum, and
calcium gangue minerals. The fatty acid collector, frother, and pH control
reagents are added at the flotation cells. Flotation includes several
steps of rougher, cleaner, and scavenger cells. After sizing and regrinding
the tails are recycled to a separate circuit for a final flotation step.
The tails and slimes are thickened and pumped to the nearby disposal ponds.
The concentrates are thickened and pumped to the slurry transport station.
The main plant is under construction on a hill addacent to the Tapira deposit.
The primary crushing station is located on the hillside near the base of the
deposit. The ore will be trucked and dumped directly into the primary
crusher and the crushed product will be conveyed by a 1 km belt to the
main plant area.

18.       The process was initially established using batch tests of
composite drill core samples from the Target Area 1. This was followed
by continuous tests at the ARAFERTIL industrial pilot plant using 20,000
tons of ore at a feed rate of 15 tons per hour (TPH). The ore for these
continuous tests was obtained from 5 large pits and blended to represent
average ore characteristics of the deposit. A further series of tests
were run to evaluate results under extreme variations in the ore quality.
From this data, optimum metallurgical conditions were determined. At
this time the metallurgical testing is complete but further tests are
being carried out to optimize the operating parameters required for actual
plant operations. These tests will be handled by the Brazilian consultancy
firm of Paulo Abib Andrey and Associates in their bench and small batch
type pilot plant.
19.       The beneficiation plant could normally operate at about 6,600 HPY
provided sufficient raw ore supply can be maintained at all times. Because
of the restriction on the raw ore inventory and the reduced mining efficiency
during the rainy season, the beneficiation plant may operate at lower levels
of capacity utilization during the rainy season duie to inadequate supply of
raw ore. Even by scheduling maintenance of the beneficiation plant during
the rainy season, the available operating hours of the plant may only be
about 5,900 to 6,000 HPY.
20.       To supply the VALEFERTIL design requirement of 986,000 TPY of
concentrate, the VALEP beneficiation plant should have a minimum design
capacity.of 165 TPH of concentrate on the basis of a 6,000 HPY of operation,
A 10% to 15% larger design capacity would be preferable considering the
potential extra capacity of the VALEFERTIL project and the possibility of
selling any small surplus to other producers. The engineering guarantee,
the design capacity and the actual equipment capacity of the beneficiation
plant is tabulated below:

a/  The VALEFERTIL requirement has been expressed as 986,000 TPY of 35% P25 rock,
-   but the difference in concentration is not significant and was intended to be
conservative as the guarantee is for a range of 34-35% P205.
b/ The design capacity originally assumed 7,000 HPY of operation for about
980,000 TPY of concentrate capacity.



ANNA h-
Page 8
21.       The P205 recovery factor is a very difficult metallurgical
variable to confirm, even in the larger pilot plant tests, thus, only
operating experience, at high levels of capacity utilization, can
determine the most likely recovery that could be achieved. It would
be prudent, for planning purposes, to assume an initial recovery factor
of 60% which may gradually increase to 65% only after a few years of
experience. On a design basis, therefore, the VALEP plant is about 15%
short in capacity for meeting fully the VALEFERTIL design requirements
of rock phosphate. After a review of the actual equipment capacity, VALEP
have confirmed that the hourly beneficiation capacities that can be achieved
will be 153 TPH at a 60% recovery factor and 166 TPH at a 65% recovery factor,
equivalent to 918,000 TPY and 996,000 TPY respectively of concentrate on the
basis of 6,000 HPY of operation. This would just cover the design needs of
VALEFERTIL (986,000 TPY) without any margin or provision for a potentially
higher VALEFERTIL output.
22.       It appears that it would be possible for VALEP to debottleneck
its beneficiation plant and raise its equipment capacity by about 15% to
about 1.1 million TPY of concentrate (assuming 6,000 HPY of operation) with
an investment of about US$5 million. The investment would involve additional
secondary crushing facilities (ball mills at a cost of about US$2-3 million),
enlargement of the flotation cells (US$1 million) and some other additional
equipment. But it may be premature at this stage to initiate a specific
debottlenecking program. It would be advisable to allow VALEP and VALEFERTIL
to operate for a period of about two years before debottlenecking is examined.
The operating experience will then determine the recovery factors and operating
hours that could be achieved and on the basis of this information, the two
companies can then undertake whatever debottlenecking program proves economic
and is necessary to balance the production of the two firms. Both firm
could also opt for a major expansion if market demand is sufficient, but
the expansion must be coordinated and planned to ensure a balanced system.
23.       The phosphate rock slurry pipeline (Section F) and the primary
crushing facilities have been designed to handle the equivalent of 2 million
TPY of concentrate production, about two times the present capacity of the
beneficiation plant in anticipation of a major expansion in the future. The
mining capacity, especially during the dry season, can be easily increased.
Thus, a modest increase in the beneficiation plant capacity will not cause
any problems in these other areas.
2h.       Although the use of other types of phosphate rock by VALEFETIL
will be more expensive and technically difficult because the plant is being
designed to use the Tapira rock with its unique characteristics, it would be
desirable for VALEFERTIL to have the flexibility to use alternative rocks,
should VALEP's production be inadequate for whatever reason. While the
production efficiency of VALEFERTIL's phosphoric acid plant may be reduced
when using other types of rock (e.g., Araxa, Patos, Morocco, Florida), such
use may still be a better alternative rather than shutting down the plant
temporarily. Finally, VALEFERTIL and VALEP should enter into a long-term
supply contract to cover at least the design requirements of VALEFERTIL
and to obligate VALEP to jointly undertake the debottlenecking study and
program (if appropriate) mentioned above.

F.  Phosphate Rock Slurry Pipeline
25.       The rock concentrate will be transported as a slurry through a
pipeline from the beneficiation plant to the VALEP terminal located near
the VALEFERTIL plant site at Uberaba. From the beneficiation plant, the
phosphate rock slurry will be initially pumped into either of two 3,000
ton capacity (dry rock basis) agitated tanks where the slurry will be
tested for suitability for injection into the pipeline. When a tankful
of slurry is ready, it will be pumped into the pipeline system for
transport to the VALEP terminal at Uberaba. The system consists of
positive displacement slurry pumps at Tapira and a 9-inch I.D. steel pipe-
line capable of transporting 260 TPH (dry basis) at a velocity of 5.h ft.
per second. The design is such that the system could handle up to 2
million TPY of concentrate and could operate for 7,800 hours/year if
necessary. Maximum particle size will be 65 mesh (21 microns) with a
slurry density of 63% solids by weight. The specific gravity of the
solids is about 3.1.
26.       Bechtel (U.S.) is designing and will construct the system based
on a contract awarded in early 1976.    The design was at least 30%
complete as of September 1976, and in Bechtel's opinion, it is a relati'vely
simple and straightforward system cmpared to most pipelines they have
engineered. The system can be restarted underload in case of emergency
shutdown. Normal shutdown on a daily basis will involve flushing the
pipeline with clear water. A thickener at the pipeline terminal provides
for recovery of product when the system is flushed with water.
27.       The pipeline is 118 km. long, upgrade from elevation 1,180
meters to elevation 1,350 meters in the first 6 km., and then is down
grade 112 km. to the terminal at elevation 5h0 meters. Average slopes
range 2% on the upgrade and 0.1% on the downgrade. Maximum slope for
any single point in the line dictated by design, is 15%. The topography
is generally rolling hills the first 30 km. with the balance along the
valley adjacent to the Rio Grande River.   The pipeline will be buriad a
minimum of 70 cm deep. The expected life for the pipe is over 20 years.
28.       The slurry from the pipeline system will be discharged to either
of three points: a 100,000 ton capacity storage pond; a large thickener;
or to either of two 1,500 ton (dry basis) storage tanks. The storage pond
provides extra surge capacity should the chemical plant become inoperative.
When required, product from the storage pond will be reclaimed with a
dredge, thickened to a density of 63% solids in the pipeline flushing
system thickener, and pumped to the 1,500 ton tanks as feed to the
chemical plant.



ANNEX 4-h
Page 10
29.       When required, a portion of the chemical plant feed from the
storage tank can be filtered. The filtered product can then be combined
with the chemical plant feed to provide a more dense feed slurry. When
excess concentrate is available or when TSP plant feed is required, a
portion of this filter cake will be dried and sized with cyclones. The
coarse portion can be sold as dry rock and the fine rock conveyed to the
TSP plant. The drying system has a capacity of 300,000 TPY of concentrate.
At times when large amounts of concentrate must be stored, as when the
chemical plant is shut down for extended periods, a large open area is
provided for storage of filtered concentrate. This storage and reclaim
system would consist of a wheeled loader and truck. The filter, drier,
cyclones and dust (fine phosphate rock) collectors are still in the
preliminary design stage, and VALEP is expected to finalize the design
shortly. Both the slurry pipeline and the terminal at Uberaba will be
installed, owned and operated by VALEP.
G.  Environmental Aspects
30.       The terrain near the beneficiation plant site provides many
excellent locations for tailings disposal. Tailings will initially be
disposed along the face of the slimes dams and in later years, the tailings
will be stacked on the adjacent hillsides. Water from the tailings will be
reclaimed from the slimes ponds and recirculated to the plant facilities.
The slimes, which are at least half clay and half grinding slimes, settle
well. The reservoirs for the slimes will produce a water overflow which
can be reused. VALEP expects to recycle at least 70% of its total water
use of 10,000 cubic meters per hour. The remaining 30% will be clarified
so that it does not present a pollution problem after discharge.
H.  Capital Cost Estimate and Financing Plan
31.       The total financing required for the VALEP project including the
pipeline and the terminal is about US$216.1 million equivalent, with some
US$56.6 million for foreign exchange cost. The capital cost estimate is
shown in the following page. It is based on a detailed list of equipment
and cost items and already reflects purchase cost information on at least
30% of the equipment already committed as of October 1976 and price
quotations for most of the remaining major equipment items. The base cost
estimate is 5% higher than VALEP's 1975 estimate even without the additional
provision for the pipeline and terminal facilities which was not included
in the original VAIEP cost estimate. The estimate has no provisions for
import duties as VALEP has been granted a 100% exemption. However, physical
contingencies and price escalation provisions are included. The working
capital estimate is much lower than the original VALEP provision and
reflects the most recent pricing arrangement (tentative) for the rock
concentrate of US$55/ton delivered at Uberaba and the finished goods
inventory implied by the facilities now tentatively planned at the
pipeline terminal facilities.

32.       The VALEP project is being financed with 40% equity (US$86.5
million) from CVRD and loans from foreign suppliers credits for the
directly imported materials and services (17% or US$37.1 million), from
FINAME (a BNDE subsidiary) for financing up to a maximum of 80% of the
ex factory cost of locally supplied equipment (1h% or US$31.3 million),
from BNDE (the national development bank) to finance mostly civil works
and erection (22% or US$h7.2 million) and from FINEP (a Government agency)
to finance up to 80% of the local engineering and technical consultancy
services (7% or US$14.0 million). However, as the original cost estimate
did not include provision for the pipeline terminal facilities and in
addition, the base cost estimate has now increased by about 5% over the
original value, there is a financing gap of about US$20 million equivalent,
mostly for local purchases. VALEP has initiated arrangements for supple-
mental financing from BNDE/FINAME, which is included in the BNDE/FINAME
loan amounts indicated above. CVRD is assisting VALEP to complete the
financing package and has assured the Bank appraisal mission that funds
will be made available as needed to complete the project or, time.
33.       The BNDE/FINAME loan and the FINEP loan have the usual maturities
of just about eight to ten years while the foreign suppliers' credits have
maturities of from six to eight years. The grace periods for the loans range
from three to four years. Given the short average loan maturity, it is very
important that VALEP maintain the original plan of a debt/equity ratio of
60:4O or better at project completion.
34.       The mine and beneficiation plant facilities are designed for a
20-year operating life, and during this period, additional capital invest-
ments will be required, mostly due to an increase in overburden stripping.
The additional investment is shown below, and about 60% of these costs are
expected to be in foreign exchange.

are expected to be about US$5/torn initially and will probably average at
MS$3/tor (in constant 1976 US dollars) over the first seven years of
operation when the loans are outstanding.
The financial operating cost of about US$37/ton of concentrate (before
financial charges) is slightly higher than the projected international FOB price
of high grade phosphate rock of US$35/ton (in constant 1976 US dollars) over the
life of the VALEFERTIL project.  But ocean freight, port handling and inland
transport would raise the delivered cost to Uberaba of imported rock to about
US$65/ton.
36.       The initial production of VALEP which is not used by VALEFERTIL is
assumed to be dried and sold to other users at a price of US$45/ton, net of
drying cost. As VALEP will have a drying capacity of only 300,000 TiY of
concentrate, the financial forecast assumes that the VALEP production that
can not be dried due to the drying capacity constraint will be temporarily
stored and then gradually 30ld. The production and sales forecast are shown

37.       The financial rate of return before income taxes is about 9%
(Table 2). The after tax return will probably be about 2 percentage points
lower but cannot be reasonably ascertained at this point since the final
debt/equity ratio and the loan terms can only be roughly estimated.
Sensitivity tests (Table 2) show that if production is increased by 11%
starting in 1980 over the output assumed above,1/ even with an additional
cost of US$5 million (para 22), the before tax rate of return will improve
to 10.2%.
38.       The economic rate of return of the VALEP project without the
VALEFERTIL project (i.e. all output is sold at US$b5/ton to manufacturers
in the coastal areas) is only 9.6% but improves to 10.8% if production is
increased by 11% and to )L.5% if output is sold at US$55/ton. This implies
that import substitution can be economically viable only if the Tapira rock
is processed close to the mine and sold in the same area to take full
advantage of transportation savings, as indicated by the 16.6% economic rate
of return of the combined VALEP and VALEFERTIL projects (Annex 7-2).2/
J.   Commercial Prospects for Titanium and Niobium Ores
39.       The VALEP anatase (titanium) ore reserves at Tapira total 200 million
tons of ore with an average grade of 21% TiO2 on the basis of a lower cut-off
grade of 15% TiO2. The anatase will be stripped with the overburden and
stored in a separate area for future use. VALEP is undertaking a research
and development effort (para. 1) to develop a commercial process to extract
titanium from anatase. The normal ore minerals of titanium, namely rutile
and ilmenite have well proven economic processes for the extraction of
TiO2. But anatase, which is a polymorph to rutile, is not amenable to these
standard TiO2 extraction processes. It is well known in the industry however
that anatase will convert to rutile at +7500C but with various other minerals
and elements present in the Tapira anatase ore, additional research is needed
to verify the feasibility of the heat treating process. Should such a tech-
nology be developed, it is expected that the titanium venture could share
the overall mining costs with the phosphate mining/beneficiation venture
thereby potentially reducing the cost of production of the phosphate rock
concentrate by about US$2-3/ton (in 1976 US dollars). The titanium venture
itself should be able to earn a good return on investment provided the
market for VALEP's titanium can be developed.
40.       Should a heat treating process convert the anatase to rutile at
say a cost of US$10 per ton of product and with mining and beneficiation
at US$60/ton,the production cost (before depreciation and financial charges)
per ton of product might be in the range of US$70 to 100. Under such a
cost basis and a sales price of US$500/to4 one can readily see the merits
of developing a viable process for the titanium ore. The capital requirements
could hardly exceed US$100 million (in 1976 US dollars) for such a project.
The above costs are rough preliminary estimates but serve to bracket what
1/ Equivalent to 100% capacity utilization by 1980 for VALEP.
7/ The economic rate of return of the combined VALEP-VALEFERTIL operation is
18.h% at an 11% higher production.

might be expected from the VALEP titanium ore. On the other hand, the
world rutile output including ilmenite adjusted to a rutile base is in
the range of 3 to h million tons per year. A VALEP 5 million tons per
year anatase ore production when converted to rutile would be equivalent
to 10% of the world's present rutile output. Some assurance of a market
would therefore be a crucial step in the VALEP anatase ore development.
41.       One area of the Tapira phosphate reserves includes, in the over-
burden, an indicated reserve of Niobium ore (pyrochlore) estimated at
60 million tons with 1.5% Nb205 on the basis of a cut-off grade of 0.5%
Nb205. VALEP has done very little work on development of this ore other
than outlining it in their reserve picture. The nearby niobium ore deposit
being processed by CBMM (Compania Brazilia Metallurgia e Mineracao) at
Araxa has a grade of 3.5% Nb205             CBBM has reserves of about 500
million tons at 3.5% Nb205 and over i billion tons at 2.5% Nb2O<.  In
1972 CBMM produced 7600 tons of 59% Nb205 concentrates, 60% of the world
production.!/ The 1975 production is claimed to be 80% of the world
output. Even with concentrates selling at approximately US$3000 per ton
and production costs a mere fraction of the selling price, VALEP would find
it very difficult to enter the market which is evidently rather well
controlled. For this reason, the Nb205 potential for VALEP is not as
promising as the titanium venture. It is understood that a new plant
at Catalao (METAGO) for producing niobium concentrates is being
implemented.

Us$62.3 million for the CIF (or ex-factory if local) cost of equipment and materials;
US$10.7 million for 100% of the foreign engineering and technical assistance services;
and US$9.0 million for interest during construction on the Bank loan. Retroactive
financing of about US$6.2 million for foreign engineering and technical assistance
services is included in the US$10.7 million. Of the US$62.3 million for equipment,
some US$8.3 million (CIF) is estimated to be used for imported packages each with
a value below US$100,000 which will be procured through international shopping.
The remaining US$54.0 million will be used for ICB procurement. The Bank will not
finance any proprietary items which will be financed through buyer's credits
(or foreign commercial loans).

a/   This rate is below the regular tariff rate since the ammonia will be transported
in VALEFERTIL'S own tank wagons.
b/   This is the differential in freight cost between the factory at Uberaba to the
market, and from the port to the market.
c/   This is the price currently agreed to between VALEP and VALEFERTIL.
d/   This is equal to the delivered cost of imported rock (CIF US$45 plus $13 per ton
for handling and transport) to Sao Paulo/Santos, where the alternative users of
VALEP rock are located, less drying costs of US$3/ton and freight from Uberaba
to Sao Paulo/Santos of US$10/ton, giving an economic cost of US$45/ton of VALEP
rock. The economic cost of imported rock at Uberaba is, however, US$63/ton at
the official exchange rate and US$60/ton at the shadow exchange rate.

ANNEX 6-9

BRAZIL - VALEFERTIL FERTILIZER PROJECT
NOTES TO FINANCIAL FORECASTS
1.        The factory is expected to start commercial operations by July
1979. For the financial and economic analysis, production is initially at
a 50% capacity utilization rate and gradually reaching 90% by 1981 and
thereafter, although the plant can and should be able to achieve a 100%
rate. The depreciation charges (Annex 6-1) are on a straight-line basis
over 12 years. The estimated product and raw material prices over the
project's operating life, expressed in constant 1976 US dollars are shown
in Annex 6-1. The MAP and the TSP ex-factory prices of US$280/ton and
US$225/ton respectively, have been set such that the project will be
competitive with the cost of imports on a net-of-tax basis delivered
to the market area. As of November 30, 1976, the maximum ex-factory
prices set for MAP and TSP by the CIP was US$3h0 and US$310 per ton
respectively, although the average import and ex-factory prices were
about US$285/ton of MAP and US$270/ton of TSP as a result of the decline
in international prices. Because of the present NPK consumption pattern
favoring phosphates (Annex 3-2), the present TSP ex-factory price is just
10% to 15% lower than the MAP price, compared to the international (CIF
basis) differential of about 20%. During the project's operating life
however, as more local phosphate resources are developed and the NPK
consumption ratio slightly shifts towards more nitrogen, it is assumed
that the MAP price will be about 20% higher than the TSP ex-factory
price.
2.        Brazil's accounting procedures and income tax laws allow for an
annual revaluation of fixed assets as well as current assets and liabilities
on the basis of monetary correction factors closely linked to the domestic
inflation rates. In addition, most local medium and long-term loans are
also subject to monetary adjustment or indexing, thus effectively protecting
the balance sheet value of the fixed assets and local loans from being
eroded by local inflation. This indexing procedure has two major effects
on the financial projections. Firstly, depreciation charges, on a straight
line basis for example, remain constant in real terms and are computed on
the value of the fixed assets expressed in real terms. In current terms,
depreciation charges will grow at the same rate as the.1onetary correction
factor, which is assumed to equal the  inflation rate.-  This indexing of
the depreciation charges increases the cash flow (in current terms) and
1/  The financial projections are expressed in US dollars using international
inflation rates as the monetary correction factor on the assumption that
the difference between the international and the domestic inflation rates
will be accounted for by changes in the foreign exchange rate. For income
tax purposes, any increase in the principal repayments for foreign loans
due to changes in the exchange rate can also be deducted from income but
this tax benefit has not been utilized in the financial forecast for the
project.

improves the debt service coverage ratio of the enterprise. The second
effect is in the balance sheet which now reflects inflated values for both
assets and liabilities. The monetary adjustment to the fixed assets in
the asset side of the balance sheet is partly matched by the adjustment
to the indexed local loans and the revaluation of foreign loans due to
changes in the foreign exchange rate if any, with the remainder entered
as an adjustment to equity. Since the BNDE/FINAME loans represent about
3C% of the fixed asset value at the start of production, a larger
proportion of the monetary adjustment to the fixed assets is added to
equity thereby causing the debt/equity ratio to improve even more rapidly
than the retained earnings would imply.
