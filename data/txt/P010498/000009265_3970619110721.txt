Block 1: Project Description
1. Project Development Objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
In order of importance, the project objectives are to:
a) Promote the provision by the private sector, NGOs and cooperatives of grid-connected and off-grid energy services using
environmentally sustainable renewable energy technologies;
b) Strengthen the environment for Demand Side Management (DSM) implementation; and
c) Improve public and private sector performance to deliver energy services through renewable energy and DSM.
Selected Performance Indicators
a) Installation of at least 26 MW of grid and off-grid renewable energy capacity including service up to 32,000 off-grid customers;
b) CEB issuance of Energy Efficient Commercial Building Code of Practice (EECB); and
c)  (I) CEB annual update of Small Power Purchase Tariff (SPPT); (2) signing by CEB of at least 5 SPPA contracts by mid-term
evaluation; 12 by project completion; and (3) generation planning models prepared by CEB which incorporate intermittent, non-
dispatchable renewable energy generating sources.

2. Project components (see Annex 2 for a detailed description and Annex 3 for a detailed cost breakdown):
Component                                        Cost Incl. Contingencies    % of Total
(US$M)
The ESD Credit Component, channeled through private Participating Credit Institutions          48.9                 88.0
(PCIs), would provide medium and long-term financing to private sector firms, NGOs,
and cooperatives for solar home system and village hydro pre-grid electrification, grid-
connected mini-hydro schemes, and other renewable energy investments. Grant
cofinancing from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) would be available for solar
home system and village hydro subprojects.
The Pilot Grid-Connected Wind Farm Component would finance a CEB-executed pilot                3.8                   7.0
grid-connected wind farm project of approximately 3 MW. This pilot project is
expected to demonstrate the commercial viability and long-run economic potential of
wind power in Sri Lanka, and to catalyze future private sector windfarm development.
The Capacity Building Component would provide training and technical support for               2.6                   5.0
renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives by both the public and private sector.
Total            55.3                 100.0
enefits and target population:
The primary direct project benefits are:
a) the addition of about 26 MW of environmentally sustainable generating capacity, including a Pilot Wind Farm, grid-connected
mini-hydros, and electricity services to up to 32,000 rural customers through solar home systems and village hydro schemes.
This comes at a time of severe capacity shortf.ill, when CEB is aggressively pursuing thermal power capacity additions.
b) development of sustainable markets for grid and off-grid renewable energy technologies.
c) strengthening of demand side management and energy conservation capabilities within the CEB and the Sri Lankan
architecture/engineering community.
d) for the GEF eligible technologies (village hydro and solar home systems), benefits include the mitigation of greenhouse gas
emissions through displacement of conventional technologies.
The primary programmatic benefits are:
a) incorporation of environmentally sustainable renewable energy technologies within the planning framework for grid-connected
power generation (wind, and mini-hydro) and pre-grid rural electrification (solar home systems and village hydro).
b) acceptance by consumers, project developers and financial institutions of the viability of grid and off-grid renewable energy
systems for electricity production and delivery.
c) incorporation of DSM and energy efficiency measures in standard building design practices.

4. nsituioal and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period:         Five years (1997-2002)
Executing agencies:            Ministry of Finance and Planning, Ceylon Electricity Board
Institutional and implementation arrangements for the Project are based on a Project Implementation Plan, discussed and agreed with
the Bank during appraisal (see Project files).
Project coordination:
For the ESD Credit Program Component, the Ministry of Finance and Planning would onlend the proceeds of the credit component to
eligible PCIs, which would, in turn, onlend these proceeds, along with complementary financing out of their own resources, to
eligible subborrowers.I The GOSL has selected the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC) to create an Administrative
Unit (AU) to administer the Credit Program. The GOSL and the DFCC are currently negotiating an Administration Agreement. The
AU would be responsible for (i) administration of the Credit Program; (ii) administration of the GEF grants; and (iii) technical
assistance related to off-grid subprojects. The Credit Program would support subprojects up to 5 MW in capacity per project. (Larger
projects could seek financing via the Private Sector Infrastructure Development [PSID] Project. -- Cr. 2880-CE.) US$5.0 million of
the Credit Program proceeds would be reserved for off-grid subprojects (e.g., solar home system and village-hydro schemes) until the
Mid-Term Review which would consider the need for continued earmarking of funds. The maximum IDA refinancing amount under
the Credit Program would be US$3.0 million per project or the PCI's single borrower exposure limit, whichever is lower. Operating
policy guidelines and proposed on-lending arrangements for the ESD Credit Program are patterned after those used in the ongoing
Private Finance Development Project (PFDP -- Cr. 2484-CE) and are presented in Annex 2. These guidelines define the onlending
mechanism, including the onlending rate, the terms and conditions, the responsibility of the Administrative Unit, procurement
procedures, disbursement procedures, and audit requirements. Eligibility criteria for PCIs, including commercial banks, development
finance institutions (DFIs), merchant banks, and leasing companies, are given in Annex 5, Part I.
The onlending rate to PCIs would be a variable rate equal to the Average Weighted Deposit Rate (AWDR), or another appropriate
rate to be determined during project implementation by GOSL in consultation with IDA. The GOSL would assume the foreign
exchange risk. The onlending rate to PCls would be adjusted semi-annually to reflect market conditions. PCIs would assume the
credit risk and set their own lending rates in agreement with their clients. Subloan maturities would vary according to individual
subprojects but would not exceed 10 years, including a maximum 2-year grace period. Private enterprises, NGOs and cooperatives
operating in Sri Lanka are potentially eligible subborrowers, subject to PCI credit-worthiness assessment.
In addition to administering the Credit Program component, the AU would administer GEF grant funds to: (i) support off-grid
subproject preparation activities; (ii) cofinance off-grid subprojects; and (iii) provide off-grid project support through promotional
activities, provision of grant funding for verification of solar home systems, and consumer education and protection.
The final date for submitting subproject applications to PCIs will be three years after Credit Effectiveness. The closing date for
disbursement will be five years after Credit Effectiveness. Each subproject proposal would include a timetable for implementation.
GEF Technical Assistance (TA) grants would be available to help project developers prepare feasibility studies, business plans and
bank loan documentation for off-grid subprojects . Grants would be disbursed on a reimbursement basis up to 90% of the cost of
preparation of a solar home system subproject (up to US$6,500) and 95% of the cost of consulting services for preparation of a
village hydro subproject (up to US$9,000). Reimbursement would be triggered by (i) PCI approval of a subproject on the basis of a
bank loan application package supported by a complete feasibility study/business plan; (ii) presentation of eligible expenses; and (iii)
submission of subloan disbursement request equal to or exceeding the GEF grant amount. Only expenses incurred after September 1,
1996 would be eligible for reimbursement. Each subproject developer would be eligible for only one grant.
Subloans may also include lease investments.

Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:          (CAS: Report No. 15633-CE, Board Date: May 21, 1996):
The proposed project supports the three CAS objectives of enhancing: (i) environmentally sustainable energy development; (ii)
promoting private sector delivery of energy services; and (iii) enhancing efficiency in the power sector. ESD investment and TA
support for small-scale private power investments would complement the Private Sector Infrastructure Development (PSID) Project
(Cr. 2484-CE), designed for large-scale investments and further the CAS objective of encouraging private sector investment in
infrastructure projects. The CAS objective of improved efficiency in the power sector would be supported by: (i) development of
least-cost grid-connected and off-grid renewable energy resources based on avoided cost principles; and (ii) capacity building in
renewable energy and DSM.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Public sector investments in power generation have lagged behind Sri Lanka's rapidly growing demand. Investments in core
infrastructure have increased marginally since 1990, to about 4.5% of GDP. However, this level remains well below levels in other
lower and lower-middle income countries such as Indonesia (5.5-6%), Thailand (6-6.5%), and the Philippines (7%)2. In contrast,
demand for power continues to increase at 8% or more annually. Daily power cuts in 1996 underscore the urgent need for new
generating capacity and improved efficiency.
The GOSL strategy for redressing these deficiencies has two components: (i) creation of a regulatory and policy environment which
encourages private investments to supplement public resources; and (ii) improving the efficiency of energy services delivery. To this
end, the CEB has contracted with Price Waterhouse under a PHRD grant to examine the legal and regulatory framework and policy
incentives required to promote private sector participation in power sector development. Also, IDA has initiated a study on power
sector restructuring to review problems and issues and recommend suitable restructuring strategies for the sector. These studies will
support a separate GOSL exercise to articulate long-term sector reform strategy and a Policy Paper on Power Sector Reform.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project would address serious issues of capacity and efficiency in the sector through fostering private provision of energy
services. Even before the current capacity shortfall, CEB experienced difficulties in utilizing available donor financing, due to
management weakness and a cumbersome procurement process. The recent power shortage has compounded these difficulties and
spurred the GOSL to investigate options for restructuring the power sector and encouraging private participation in the generation and
delivery of energy services. The project would enhance the enabling environment for: (i) private investments in renewable energy
services delivery through application of a standardized small power purchase agreement and non-negotiable tariff (lack of which
effectively impeded development of small grid-connected power projects); and (ii) DSM implementation. The project would also
enhance consumer awareness of renewable energy services and help the financial community become familiar with privately
developed renewable energy projects.
During project preparation, consideration was given to an alternative project design which relied heavily on public sector delivery of
renewable energy services. For off-grid (PV and village hydro) subprojects, the CEB could have maintained ownership of the
2  "Sri Lanka in the Year 2000 - An Agenda for Action," joint Sri Lankan and World Bank Study, March 1996.

equipment, adopting a tariff schedule sufficient to maintain its standard rate of return on investment and thereby reducing the cost for
such off-grid services to the ultimate beneficiary (the rural households). The private sector's role would have been confined to supply
of equipment and services. This alternative was not adopted, due to CEB's serious implementation constraints. The strategic choice
taken was to focus the project on private sector implementation.

8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
*   Additional Renewable Energy Technologies - In addition to the Pilot Wind Farm component, the ESD Project would support
village hydro, mini-hydro, and photovoltaic technologies through the Credit Program. While the Credit Program Operating
Guidelines do not exclude other technologies (such as biomass and solar thermal), these are not expected to be supported by the
ESD Project because of market and/or technical immaturity. Biomass power systems, for example, show good technical promise,
but have not yet demonstrated commercial market viability in Sri Lanka. Enhancing the basis for commercial development of
biomass power is one of the aims of the parallel UNDP/GEF-assisted Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Capacity
Building Project (see para 9 below).
*   Alternative size of the Credit Program Component - Given the large number of potential subprojects already identified and the
strong interest expressed by seven potential PCIs (paras 3 through 5 of Annex 2), a larger credit program could have been
pursued to meet the potential demand. However, it was decided that the amount allocated for this component should be large
enough to justify the proposed administrative and financial arrangement and yet small enough to ensure a reasonable pace of
disbursements. Taking these criteria and the availability of IDA funds into account, an allocation of US$19.7 million equivalent
is considered a reasonable amount for the credit program component.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
* Solar home system projects must: (i) overcome the first cost barrier created by their high initial cost (relative to conventional
alternatives) to gain an adequate potential market size; (ii) establish responsive and sustainable PVsales and distribution
infrastructure; and (iii) provide quality products and services. (World Bank Technical Paper Number 324, Best Practices for
Photovoltaic Household Electrification Programs, 1996) Solar home system subprojects supported by the ESD Credit Program
will offer consumer level financing to address the first cost barrier and maTket size issues, allowing dealers to create the necessary
infrastructure. All solar home systems will be required to comply with technical specifications, ensuring quality products and
services. Solar home system projects should. (i) operate on afull cost-recovery basis; (ii) provide adequate consumer
information; and (iii) ensure adequate management skills in local implementing organizations. (World Bank Technical Paper
Number 304, Photovoltaic Applications in Rural Areas of the Developing World, 1995) All solar home system subproject
proposa]s will be reviewed by the lending PCI and most will also be reviewed by the Bank. These elements will be included in
the reviews.
* Implementation of a standardized small power purchase agreement (SPPA) and tariff, derivedfrom (i) published purchase prices
not to exceed the utility 's avoided cost; and (ii) standard and efficient small power market,, are central to the realization of a
sustainable and efficient small power market (Indonesia Second Rural Electrification Project; Ln.3845-IND). An SPPA and
tariff acceptable to the Bank were approved by the CEB in December 1996.
* Community ownership of village hydro schemes improves village self-help capabilities, strengthens community relations within
the village, aids cost recovery and promotes environmental awareness. (Consultancy and Professional Services (Pvt.) Limited,
"Review of Existing Village Hydro Schemes," July 1995, see Project File) Community ownership has been the norm for Sri
Lankan village hydro schemes to date and is expected to continue under the Project.
*  Rigorous economic andfinancial analysis of rural electrification projects and an increased attention to cost recovery are key to
successfulproject implementation. (OED Report #13291, Rural Electrification in Asia: A Review of Bank Experience, June
1994) Economic and financial analyses are required for all ESD Credit Program subprojects.
*  Demonstration of commercial renewable energy technologies can remove information barriers andfacilitate widespread
replication. The wind farm component of the India Renewable Resources Development Project (Ln. 3544-IN/Cr. 2449-IN) has
helpedfinance 26 MW of wind capacity to date, and has catalyzed commercial development of an additional 470 MW. (Mid-
Term Evaluation Report of the India Renewable Resources Development Project, November 1995) This is a fundamental tenet
of ESD Project design.
* Government incentives, including taxes, duties, and subsidies, must be consistent with national and sectoral objectives for
maximum long-term impact. (Mid-Term Evaluation Report of the India Renewable Resources Development Project, November
1995.) During ESD Project preparation, the GOSL agreed to rationalize import duties on photovoltaic modules, thus removing a
major barrier to utilization of this technology.
* CEB procurement delays and shortage of experienced staff can result in serious implementation problems. (May 1996
Supervision Report of the Sri Lanka, Second Power Distribution and Transmission Project, Cr. 2297-CE) CEB's involvement in
ESD procurement has been minimized. Advanced action on Pilot Wind Farm EPC procurement has demonstrated CEB
willingness to move quickly on this component.
11. Indicators of borrower commitment and ownership:
Ministry of Finance and Planning: The MOFP has requested and utilized PPF funds for financing of two off-grid pilot subprojects
(one village hydro, one solar home system) through commercial channels. It has also rationalized the import tariff for photovoltaic
modules and requested retroactive financing of off-grid subprojects.
Ceylon Electricity Board: The CEB has used PPF funds preparation of a Feasibility Study and Tender Package for the Pilot Wind

Farn and preparation of a DSM Action Plan. During project preparation, the CEB created a Pre-electrification Unit to provide
technical support and training for the ESD Credit Program subproject developm.ent and a Demand Side Management Unit to
implement DSM activities. The CEB has prepared and recently published a SPPA and Non-Negotiable Power Purchase Tariff for
small (under 10 MW) private power producers such as grid-connected mini-hydro issuance. It has issued a Request for Proposals for
the Pilot Wind Farm.. Finally, the CEB has undertaken a collaborative CEB/Urban Development Authority/ private sector
preparation of a DSM Action Plan.
Ministry of Transport, Environment, and Women's Affairs: The Ministry, which prepared the Sri Lanka National Environmental
Action Plan (EAP) has endorsed the request for GEF support for the ESD project. The EAP emphasizes need for renewable energy
development as well as end use energy efficiency activities.
Private SectoriNGO: Strong interest in the ESD Credit Program has been expressed by private domestic banks, two development
finance institutions (DFIs), and one merchant bank, all of which appear to meet eligibility criteria for participation. The private banks
have highlighted the need for retroactive financing so as to facilitate lending to off-grid subproject developers. The NGO
commitment is evident in their review and comment on technical specifications for off-grid (solar home system and village hydro)
installations as well as their assistance in preparation of subprojects for ESD Credit Program financing. Projects under preparation to
be ready by ESD Project effectiveness (June 1997) include 3 solar home system, 2 village hydro, and at least 5 mini-hydro schemes.

12. Value added of Bank support:
The Bank urged rationalization of PV module import tariff (now reduced from 35% to 10%, consistent with other similar
commodities.) The Bank has assisted in preparation of the SPPA and Non-Negotiable Power Purchase Tariff for small power
producers. It has helped prepare technical specifications for solar home systems as well as design of private sector renewable energy
investments and will review most solar home system subprojects prior to approval. The Bank has also catalyzed public and private
sector cooperation on DSM actions (including a Code of Practice for Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings and Load Research
initiatives) and helped mobilize the following grant support for alternative energy development in Sri Lanka:
-    $5.9 million cofinancing from the GEF for the ESD Project
-    $1.5 million from the GEF and $335,000 from the UNDP for the parallel UNDP/GEF Sri Lanka: Renewable Energy and
Energy Efficiency Capacity Building Project

Notes:
*   For the GEF-eligible technologies of wind, solar home systems, and village hydro, GEF grants are included as economic and
financial benefits in accordance with OP 10.04. The GEF grant size was calculated as the "incremental cost" necessary to make
the current economic costs of the renewable energy technologies equal to the conventional alternatives. This results in a zero net
present value. GEF support is required to make these projects economically viable. Since conservative assumptions were used
in the economic analysis, the risk of the NPVs falling below the above values is considered low.
*   In the case of off-grid subprojects (PV and village hydro), the economic benefits were based on the avoided expenditures in
kerosene lighting and battery use. Additional benefits accrue to the household from increased convenience and safety, improved
indQor air quality, and a higher quality of light (more consistent illumination, better color rendering). However, since data is
insufficient to calculate these benefits, they are not included in the analyses. Experience gained in this and other projects (e.g.,

Country: Sr Lanka                                                                     Project Title: Energy Services Delivery
the Indonesia Solar Home Systems Project), may permit quantification of these benefits for future projects.
Fiscal Impact (for all ESD components): The project does not burden the GOSL with any subsidies and will impact the economy
positively by generating revenues from taxes and duties on private sector subprojects; reducing government investment in grid-
connected generation in the longer term by promoting private investment; promoting private supply of off-grid power to rural
households with full cost recovery and no GOSL subsidy (as compared with the conventional subsidy required for grid-connected
household rural electrification); and reducing pressure for government investment in uneconomic extension of the rural power grid.
The SPPA Tariff is based on CEB avoided energy costs, and, as such, creates a payment stream which is sustainable from CEB's
perspective, and reliable from the project sponsor's perspective.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annexes 4 and 5):
Financial analyses were performed for the Pilot Wind Farm as well as representative solar home systems, village hydro and mini
hydro subprojects. The financial analyses were performed from the perspective of the subproject sponsor to confirm the financial
viability of proposed subproject categories. Import duties and taxes, income tax, and financing costs all were included in subproject
costs. Financial rates of return are given in real terms.
Pilot Wind Farm: FIRR 11%. The financial benefits for the Pilot Wind Farm are CEB's avoided cost of generation.
Solar Home Systems: FIRR 19%. The analysis for the solar home system subproject reflects the assumptions given in the business
plan for the pilot subproject, financed by the Project Preparation Facility. Since the NGO sponsoring this subproject has prior
experience in solar home system programs, their estimated financial benefits, reflecting willingness to pay as shown by the proposed
customer payments, were used in the financial analysis.
Village Hydro (8.5kW serving 100 households): FIRR 22%. The pilot village hydro subproject is the first village hydro to use
commercial financing (all previous village hydros relied on donor funding). Since the consumer surplus associated with village
hydro is unknown, the financial analysis conservatively assumed only the avoided financial cost as benefits.
Mini-Hydro (580 kW, grid-connected): FIRR 13%. Financial benefits are (a) the power purchase tariff from CEB; and (b) avoided
payments to CEB when micro-hydro power displaces grid service.
Participating Credit Institutions (PCls) for the ESD Credit Program should be privately owned and controlled and meet the eligibility
criteria, presented in Annex 5, as under the ongoing Private Finance Development Project (Cr. 2484-CE). This will require, (a)
compliance with Ministry of Finance and Planning/ Central Bank guidelines on prudential regulations, capital adequacy,
classification of risk assets, provisioning, single borrower exposure limits, sector exposure limits, and disclosure and reporting
requirements; (b) fulfillment of such specific financial soundness criteria as a minimum cash collection ratio of 80%, a minimum
return on average equity of 9%, a maximum portfolio affected by arrears as a percentage of total portfolio of 20%, a maximum debt
equity ratio of 8: 1, minimum capital adequacy ratios of 4% and 8% for tier-l and tier-2, respectively as required by the Central Bank.
Detailed financial data presented by four domestic private commercial banks, two development financial institutions (DFIs) and one
merchant bank confirm their ability to meet the eligibility criteria. These institutions have expressed strong interest in ESD Credit
Program participation. Statistical highlights of their financial standing and performance are provided in Annex 5. A detailed
assessment of their eligibility is available in the Project File.
chnical Assessment: (see Annex 2 - Detailed Project Description)
The renewable energy and DSM technologies supported by the ESD project are technically sound and demonstrated worldwide.
Technical viability is further supported by Sri Lanka's prior experience with mini-hydro, village hydro, and solar home systems, and
by resource and feasibility studies for wind power.
s Istit utional Assessment:
Executing agencies and Project management
* MOFP/DFCC - ESD Credit Program: The MOFP has satisfactorily implemented IDA credit programs. As in previous
programs, the MOFP will contract out the day -to- day administrative duties to the ESD Credit Program to the Development
Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC), a well run, reputable DFI, to create and manage an Administrative Unit (AU) for the
ESD Credit Program. In addition to record keeping and periodic reporting, the AU (acting for the GOSL) will process
disbursement requests for subloans and GEF grant funds approved by PCIs under their free limit and those requests above the
free limit approved by IDA. The AU will also undertake off-grid subproject support activities. The role and responsibilities of
the AU are detailed in the TOR (Annex 12). Although the DFCC has not previously administered an IDA Credit program, it is

Country: Sn Lanka                                                                            Project Title: Energy Services Delivery
familiar with IDA's procedures and has assigned a competent manager to head the AU whose staffing arrangement appears
adequate.
* CEB - Pilot Wind Farm and Capacity Building: The CEB has adequate experience under previous IDA projects in implementing
similar project components. The Pilot Grid-Connected Wind Farm would allow the CEB to address grid integration issues,
demonstrate commercial viability, and prepare for anticipated subsequent private sector wind farm development. The Pilot Wind
Farm and Capacity Building components will be supervised by the Deputy General Manager (Generation Planning). To avoid
procurement delay problems, the CEB agreed to an accelerated procurement schedule for the Wind Farm and, in keeping with
this schedule, has released the Request for Proposals in January 1997. If the CEB is restructured, both the Pilot Wind Farm and
Capacity Building component experience are transferable to the new utility entities.
17. Social Assessment:
Project preparation included extensive consultation with local NGOs and as well as public and private sector stakeholders. The
proposed project would have a positive social impact by providing initial electrification services to up to 32,000 rural households
currently without access to grid service.
Women and children are expected to benefit the most from these off-grid services. The improved lighting will allow time to
undertake additional income generating activities. Women also note that better lighting enables them to respond more quickly to
infant needs at night. Children benefit from the additional time to study, watch television or listen to the radio.
18. Environmental Assessment:                              Environmental Category    QA          0 B           nc
The proposed project would yield net positive environmental effects. The off-grid electrification sub-projects would reduce use of
kerosene and lead-acid automotive batteries. No significant negative impacts are envisaged from the run-of-river village-hydro
projects, as demonstrated by the 20 existing village hydro projects. Because of their small size and the fact that in many cases civil
works are already in place, the grid-connected mini-hydro sub-projects are also unlikely to cause significant environmental damage.
No resettlement is envisioned because the Project does not involve land acquisition. Power generated from renewable energy sources
or saved through DSM would correspondingly reduce emissions from fossil fuel burning, with benefits to the local and global
environment. PCIs would ensure that project sponsors obtain GOSL and IDA-mandated environmental clearances, where necessary.
Mini-hydro subprojects will be reviewed by the Central Environment Authority. An environmental review for the Pilot Wind Farm
has confirmed that it will have minimal environmental impacts, entails no relocation of local population and would be located more
than one mile outside the Bundala and Yala wildlife reserves.

Project identification/preparation included extensive collaboration with private sector, NGOs, local financial institutions, and donor
stakeholders which is expected to continue during project implementation:
Private Sector - The Project has been prepared at the request and in consultation with the beneficiaries, many of whom are in the
private sector. Mini-hydro project developers in particular, have met frequently with the project preparation team to assess progress
and offer advice. They have made very clear their interest in accessing the ESD Credit Program.
NGOs - Sri Lankan NGOs active in renewable energy, including Sri Lanka's two largest NGOs, Sarvodaya and Sanasa, as well as
several others more directly focused on energy issues, have been key participants in project preparation: (i) Sarvoday has
undertaken the PPF-funded solar home system pilot project of 300 systems, and plans to expand this effort to at least 5,000 systems
under the ESD Credit Program; (ii) SoLanka, an NGO which focuses on provision of solar home systems, has advised on issues in
this area; (iii) the Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG), has supported early development of village hydro in Sri
Lanka, installed the first 20 systems with donor support, and provided consultant assistance to the PPF-funded Pathavita Village
Hydro pilot project; (iv) the Energy Forum, a consultative group including these and other NGOs, as well as CEB, academic, and
private sector parties interested in promotion of renewable energy in Sri Lanka, coordinated comments on ESD Project design as well

as specifications for village hydro and solar home systems; and (v) Sanma, has expressed interest in a solar home system project.
These and other NGOs are expected to take an active role in ESD Project implementation and operation.
Local Financial Institutions - Development finance institutions as well as private banks have participated in project preparation,
offering suggestions based on experience with previous SMI projects as well as the ongoing Private Finance Development Project.
These financial institutions requested that the Project include retroactive financing, so they could begin project development
immediately.
Donors - Project preparation included extensive collaboration with UNDP to ensure complementarity between the proposed project
and the UNDP/GEF Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Capacity Building Project. Collaboration with additional donors, in
particular GTZ, and USAID is anticipated during project implementation and operation.

20. Sustainability:
The sustainability of the mini-hydro subprojects would derive from an enabling regulatory environment, strengthened institutions,
and appropriate incentives for stakeholders. These include the SPPA and Non-Negotiable Tariff and interconnect specifications for
small private power producers. The project would also strengthen CEB's planning capacity, support the growth of a commercial
infrastructure, strengthen the capabilities of the banking sector in lending for alternative energy projects, and use local institutions to
deliver energy services. Financial participation from stakeholders and the establishment and enforcement of technical standards
would also contribute to long term sustainability of mini-hydro sub-projects which would not receive any GEF grants.
The sustainability of the GEF-supported off-grid solar home system, village hydro and Pilot Wind Farm subprojects would be
ensured by technical and financial performance after the GEF grant ends. Pilot projects will help demonstrate the affordability of
commercial delivery of solar home system and village hydro services. The Project ensures sustainability by: (i) mandating
appropriate technical specifications for equipment; (ii) requiring project sponsors to develop credible servicing plans; (iii) certifying
subproject commissioning, and, for solar home systems, providing a consumer education and protection service as well as spot-
checking of systems. Future village hydro and solar home systems are expected to benefit from cost reductions due to economies of
scale and learning curve cost reductions, mainly in the delivery and financing mechanisms but also in locally manufactured
components. The pilot windfarm performance is expected to encourage replicability by private developers and local manufacture of
some components, thereby reducing prices, as has been the case in southern India's windfarm development.
The long-term sustainability of demand-side management energy savings and financial benefits are based on application of the
Load Research Program and Code of Practice for Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings as well as a pilot design competition for
new buildings which will heighten awareness and demonstrate benefits of compliance with the Code.

CEB's labor union has expressed strong opposition towards privatization of energy services delivery, specifically private
development of large power facilities. In this regard, however, the small size (under 5 MW) of the mini-hydro plants, envisioned
under the ESD Credit Program, are not expected to generate controversy.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
Project Component 1 - Energy Services Delivery Credit Program - US$47.7 million (total cost
of component)
Description
1.     The ESD Credit Program would make funds available to Participating Credit Institutions
(PCIs) to provide medium and long-term financing to private enterprises, NGOs and cooperatives
for household solar photovoltaic (PV) and village-hydro off-grid electrification, grid-connected mini-
hydro schemes and other renewable energy subprojects up to 5 MW. IUS$5.0 million of the Credit
Program proceeds would be reserved for off-grid subprojects (e.g., solar home system and
village-hydro schemes) until the Mid-Term Review of the Project, after which time reallocation of
the reserved funds may be considered. An Administrative Unit (AU) to be established within the
DFCC will administer the Component on behalf of the GOSL on a fee basis.
2.     Grant cofinancing from the GEF would be made available through PCIs to developers of
off-grid PV and village hydro subprojects. Grant funds will help subproject developers cover costs
for consultant services to prepare feasibility studies, business plans and PCI loan documentation
for off-grid subprojects. GEF funds will also be used for AU off-grid project promotional efforts as
well as solar home system verification and implementation of a consumer education and
protection service.
3.     As of July 1996, a pipeline of mini-hydro, village hydro, and solar home system projects
totaling over $58.0 million in total project costs had been identified for potential financing through
the Credit Program Component. Additional subprojects are likely to be forthcoming once the
proposed IDA Credit is approved and potential PCIs sign Participation Agreements with the
GOSL:
Mini-hydro
4.     A World Bank-assisted study confirms the technical, economic and financial viability of
rehabilitating at least 100 grid-connected mini-hydro schemes (under 2 MW). Conservative CEB
estimates indicate a potential of about 90 MW for mini hydro (under 10 MW). A national
hydropower assessment, currently underway, is expected to identify additional opportunities. As
of January 1994, there were approximately 60 isolated mini-hydro facilities. The CEB has recently
begun accepting power from two privately-developed mini-hydro plants (the 1.2 MW Dik Oya Plant
and the 140 kW Deniyaya facility). In addition, the Chief Electrical Inspector has issued letters of
preliminary approval for 10 more sites.
Village hydro
5.     Existing village hydro systems range from 0.5 to 25 kW, at an average all-inclusive cost of
$275/household. These systems already serve about 20 isolated Sri Lankan villages in hilly areas
with high rainfall, which, have been installed and managed by village cooperatives, with
assistance from donor-supported Integrated Rural Development Projects, NGOs and the National
Development (formerly Janasaviya) Trust Fund (Poverty Alleviation Project, Cr. 2231-CE). Under
the GEF Project Preparation Advance (PPA), more than 30 villages have requested preparation

Annex 2

assistance for off-grid village hydro subprojects which range in size from 1.5 to 60 kW and, in
total, could serve nearly 4,800 households. In addition, a call for expressions of interest by
Intermediate Technology Development Group (ITDG - a local NGO active in village hydro), has
yieldeu requests from about 140 villages for assistance in developing their own village hydro
schemes. While all of these may not prove technically or economically viable, they indicate
significant village hydro market potential.
Solar home systems
6.     Since 1982, about 5,000 individual solar home systems have been installed in Sri Lanka
at an all-inclusive cost of $300-$700/household. This initial market activity has produced a
nascent local PV supply industry. Approximately 300,000 Sri Lankan rural households currently
use automotive batteries to power lights, televisions and radios. These households represent a
first market for off-grid solar home systems and village hydro subprojects. The proposed Project
will also provide pre-grid renewable energy services to some of the additional 1.4 million
households in rural Sri Lanka without grid access. Under the GEF PPA, four developers are
already preparing solar home system subprojects and two others have expressed interest.
Projected sales of about 37,000 systems over a five-year period are indicated by currently
available solar home system business plans.
Wind
7.     Wind resources in coastal areas of the Hambantota District were closely measured from
1987 to 1993. These measurements indicate an average windspeed of 6.8 meters per second at
40 meters, sufficient for commercial development of wind power in the Hambantota area. A
recent consultant report has concluded that wind resources in the region could support up to 200
MW of commercial wind power development. The CEB used an IDA Project Preparation Facility
(PPF) to complete a feasibility study and prepare the bid package for the Pilot Wind Farm.
8.     The identified pipeline includes 37 potential grid-connected mini-hydro subprojects with
capacities ranging from 250 kW to 4,665 kW. Collectively, these facilities would add
approximately 35 MW to the CEB Grid.
9.     Seven financial institutions have expressed strong interest in participating in the ESD
Credit Program Component and have provided detailed financial data which confirm their ability to
meet the agreed eligibility criteria for participation. Collectively these potential PCIs are comprised
of domestic private commercial banks, development finance institutions (DFIs) and merchant
banks. In addition, a leasing company has expressed strong interest in participating, but intends
to clarify tax implications before requesting to be considered as a PCI.
10.    Given the large number of potential subprojects noted in paragraph 3 and the strong
interest expressed by seven potential PCIs, there is reasonable certainty that the proposed IDA
credit and GEF grant amounts (IDA $19.7 million, GEF $3.8 million) could be committed within
three years following credit effectiveness.
On-lending Arrangements
11.    On-lending arrangements and operating policy guidelines for the ESD Credit Program are
patterned after those used in the ongoing Private Finance Development Project (PFDP - Cr. 2484-
CE). For subprojects below their free-limit (and except for certain projects discussed in paragraph
7), PCIs will submit refinancing applications directly to the AU. IDA prior project approval is not
required, although PCIs are responsible for maintaining subproject documentation on file including
the PCIs assessment of creditworthiness of the subborrower, a brief description of project and



Annex 2
Page 3 of 10
procurement methods, and a list of goods and services to be financed (for a complete list of
documentation see page 8 of this annex). All reimbursement applications shall be submitted
directly to the AU and shall include a summary description of the subproject and subproject
developer, and the terms and conditions of the subloan. Reimbursement requests will be paid to
the applicant PCIs from a Special Account in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which the AU
will operate.
12.    PCIs will submit the following directly to IDA for reviews and approval: (i) each PCI's first
two subloan proposals (irrespective of size), (ii) subloan proposals in excess of the free limit; (iii)
each PCI's first solar home systems subloan proposals, and (iv) each subproject developer's first
solar home systems subloan proposal. In addition to the documentation required for projects
below free-limits, subproject proposals to IDA shall include appraisal of the subproject, cash flow
projections for subborrower and the project, assessment of technical and commercial feasibility,
and financial and economic justification for the project (see page 8 of this Annex). In addition all
reimbursement requests for contracts above the prior review limits shall be submitted directly to
IDA. Reimbursement requests shall include a summary description of the subproject and
subproject developer as well as the terms and conditions of the subloan, and will be paid to the
applicant PCIs from a Special Account in the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), which the AU will
operate.
On-lending Terms and Conditions
13.    GOSL to PCJs: The proceeds of the Credit Program Component would be onlent to PCls
in rupees (i.e., GOSL will bear all foreign exchange risk) for a term equivalent to a composite
amortization schedule with a maximum of 15 years, including a maximum of 5 years grace. The
onlending rate to PCIs will be a variable interest rate equal to the Average Weighted Deposit Rate
(AWDR) of all interest-bearing deposits of all branches of domestic commercial banks, or another
appropriate rate to be determined during project implementation by GOSL in consultation with
IDA. The interest rate for new and existing loans would be subject to revision every 6 months.
Refinancing for each subproject will be limited to US$ 3.0 million or the single borrower exposure
limit of concerned PCI (whichever is lower) as well as 60% of the total PCI subloan amount.
14.    PCIs to Sub-Borrowers: PCIs will be free to set their lending rate in agreement with their
clients. Subloan maturities will be limited to 10 years, including a maximum 2 year grace, and not
to exceed the useful economic life of the equipment financed.
Disbursement
15.    The Credit Component will have a 5-year disbursement period as indicated on page 1 of
the Project Appraisal Document. IDA will reimburse the PCIs for 60% of eligible subloan
expenditures. Reimbursement is available for project-related expenditures made within 120 days
prior to receipt of the reimbursement application and supporting subproject documentation. For
expenditures below the prior review limits, PCIs will submit reimbursement applications and full
documentation directly to the AU who will ascertain the eligibility of the expenditures and notify the
CBSL to make payments from the Special Account to the PCI for eligible expenditures. For
expenditures above the prior review limits, the AU will submit reimbursement applications to IDA
for review/approval.

Credit Program Operation(see pages 8 - 10 of this Annex for the Operating Policy Guidelines)
16.    PCI Eligibility: Under the PFDP Credit, only private commercial banks and development
finance institutions (DFIs) which meet specific eligibility criteria have been allowed to participate.
These are: the NDB, DFCC, Hatton, Sampath, CBOC, and Seylan Banks. The ESD Credit
Program would adopt the PFDP eligibility criteria (see Project Files and Annex 5) for DFis and
commercial banks. The six PCIs under PFDP, all of which have expressed interest in the ESD
Credit program, would be eligible in principle by virtue of their continued compliance with PFDP
eligibility criteria. PCI eligibility criteria also have been prepared for merchant banks, leasing
companies, and NGOs (see Project Files). Candidate institutions would be able to apply for PCI
status at any time during the ESD Credit Program commitment period. Assessment of eligibility of
the potential PCIs for the ESD Credit Program will be given in the Project Files. A condition of
effectiveness will be the signing by at least two PCIs, of a Participation Agreement with the GOSL
(satisfactory to IDA). The Agreement will include a clause that the PCI will at all times comply with
the eligibility criteria and maintain the minimum ratios as shown therein.
17.    Eligible Subproiects: Eligible subprojects include investments by private enterprises,
NGOs, and cooperatives for grid-connected mini-hydro facilities (not to exceed 5 MW in
generating capacity), off-grid village hydro schemes which comply with the current Village Hydro
Technical Specifications on file at the AU, solar home systems project which comply with the
current Specifications for Solar Home Systems, and other renewable energy investments.
18.    Subloan Applicant Eligibility Criteria: Eligible subloan applicants include any private
enterprise, NGO and cooperative operating in Sri Lanka, subject to the PCIs credit-worthiness
assessment.
GEF Grants
19.    Cofinancinc of Off-Grid Subproiects: Grant cofinancing would be made available through
PCIs to developers of off-grid PV solar home system and village-hydro projects. Grant financing
will be limited to $400 per kW of installed village hydro capacity, up to US$20,000 per installation,
and $100 per PV solar home system with a module rating not less than 30 W. For PV solar home
systems, beneficiaries will submit installation certificates to the AU through their PCI. The AU will
subsequently release grant funds to the PCI upon verification of eligibility (see the Project File for
the complete Terms of Reference for the AU). Similarly, the AU will release grant cofinancing of
village-hydro schemes subject to certification by a Chartered Engineer that the facility is complete,
operational, and in compliance with IDA-approved Specifications for Village-Hydro Schemes.
20.    Subproject Preparation Grants: In addition to cofinancing of off-grid subprojects, grant
funds will be available to subproject developers to help prepare feasibility studies, business plans
and PCI loan documentation for off-grid subprojects. Up to 90% of the preparation costs for a
solar home system subproject (maximum grant $6,500) and 95% of the preparation costs for a
village-hydro subproject (maximum grant $9,000) can be reimbursed. The preparation grants
cover only independent consulting services directly attributable to subproject preparation. The
cost of off-grid project developers' direct project preparation efforts are ineligible for
compensation. Reimbursement would require off-grid subproject developers to submit the
following documentation to the AU through their PCI: (i) PCI approval of the subproject on the
basis of a completed feasibility study/business plan/bank loan application package, (ii)
presentation of eligible expenses, and (iii) a disbursement request equal to or exceeding the grant
amount. Off-grid project preparation activities previously paid for by GEF and/or IDA are not
eligible for subproject preparation grants.



Annex 2
Page 5 of 10
21.    Off-Grid Project Support: GEF funds will also be channeled to the AU for the following
off-grid support activities:
*  Off-Grid Project Promotion: A promotional effort will be carried out by the AU to
increase awareness among potential customers regarding energy service delivery
through village hydro and solar home systems
*  Solar Home System Design Verification: GEF Grant funds will be available to PCls
for hiring consultants to verify that solar home system designs meet IDA-approved
specifications and that systems are installed properly (as required for GEF Grant
cofinancing and IDA refinancing, respectively).
*  Consumer Education and Protection Facility: A Facility will be maintained and
publicized by the AU for investigating unresolved consumer complaints against
dealers and seeking appropriate solutions.
Responsibilities of AU
22.    An Administrative Unit (AU) established within the DFCC will administer the Component
on behalf of the GOSL on a fee basis. The Terms of Reference for the AU are presented in
Annex 12. The AU's responsibilities will include:
(a) Administration of the ESD Credit Program Component including processing
refinancing applications and disbursement requests for loans approved by PCIs under
their free-limit and those approved by IDA for loans exceeding PCIs' free-limits;
(b) Administration of the GEF Grant Funds in Support of the ESD Credit Program
Component including processing requests for disbursement of GEF Grant Financing;
and
(c) Off-Grid Project Support Activities, including:
* Off-Grid Project Promotion - The AU will implement a promotional effort to
increase awareness among potential customers regarding village hydro and solar
home systems. This should include both promotional and educational messages
regarding realistic expectations of system performance, other benefits, costs,
lifetime, and warranties. The promotional effort should be aimed at enabling
consumers to make informed purchase decisions. Details of the promotion
campaign will be developed by the AU in close consultation with IDA.
* Solar Home System Verification - The AU will maintain a list of consultants
acceptable to IDA who are capable of verifying that the solar home system
proposed in the subloan application meets the Specifications for Solar Home
Systems (see Project Files). The AU will also administer TA funds for PCIs to
retain consultants for this purpose. If a subborrower changes elements of the
solar home system design during the course of the subproject, re-verification will
be required. Such re-verification will not be eligible for TA funds. The AU also
will administer TA funds for PCIs to retain consultants to verify serial numbers
given on grant applications and to confirm on a sampling basis the compliance of
installed systems with the PV Specifications. Upon receipt of a PCI report of
irregularities, the AU will follow up with remedial action. If the remedial action is
unsuccessful and suspension from the Credit Program is required, the AU will



Annex 2
Page 6 of 10
notify all PCIs.
Consumer Education and Protection Facility - The AU will maintain and publicize
a Consumer Protection Facility. The Facility would investigate unresolved
consumer complaints against dealers and seek appropriate resolution.
Project Component 2 - Pilot Wind Farm - US$3.5 million (total cost of component)
23.    The Pilot Wind Farm of approximately 3 MW would be executed by the CEB on an
Engineer, Procure, and Construct (EPC) basis. The CEB would be responsible for monitoring,
operation, and maintenance of the facility. The Pilot would be located in the Hambantota District
which has sufficient wind resources to support up to 200 MW of commercial-scale wind farms.
24.    The Pilot Wind Farm would entail no relocation of local population and would be located
well outside of the Bundala and Yala wildlife reserves. The size of the Pilot Wind Farm has been
selected to: (i) give CEB practical operational experience in grid integration issues for such
intermittent generation sources; (ii) demonstrate the viability of wind power in Sri Lanka; and (iii)
encourage subsequent private sector development of wind resources.
25.    The CEB has prepared and issued the Pilot Wind Farm Bid Package. Prior to issuing the
EPC contract, the CEB will finalize wind farm site selection. Subsequent to signing the EPC
contract, the CEB will ensure that the contractor implements the Pilot in a timely manner, and
monitors its operation and performance. The CEB will also make available to prospective private
sector wind farm developers semi-annual reports concerning the technical, economic, and
financial performance of the Pilot Wind Farm.
26.    Onlendina Rate: The onlending rate to the CEB for the Pilot Wind Farm Component will
be 13% with a 17 year maturity, including 2 years grace.
Project Component 3 - Capacity Building - US$2.4 million (total cost of component)
27.    CEB Pre-Electrification Unit: Capacity building to the CEB's PEU would broaden the
Unit's expertise in off-grid project preparation. Funds would also enhance the PEU's ability to
train staff from CEB, private sector, and non-governmental organizations. To this end, funds
would be provided to the CEB's Pre-Electrification Unit to procure equipment as well as retain
local consultants with expertise in technical, financial, institutional, or business matters related to
renewable energy project design and development. Consultants would:
(a)    develop and conduct training courses for CEB staff as well as private sector and
NGO personnel; and
(b)    assist CEB staff in feasibility study preparation and other services related to off-
grid project support.
28.    Capacity Building funds would also support two overseas training courses involving up to
two CEB staff (one for each course). These courses would focus on (a) practical experience in
implementation of the U.K. G-59 Engineering Recommendation for grid interconnection of small
power producers; and (b) utility grid integration of wind power systems.



Annex 2
Page 7 of 10
29.    DSM Unit. Capacity building to the CEB's DSM Unit would consist of:
(a)    design and implementation of a Code of Practice for Energy Efficient Commercial
Buildings;
(b)    development of institutional capacity in the energy-related public and private
sectors to incorporate the Code of Practice into building design and operations
and to monitor the energy savings;
(c)    demonstration of energy efficiency building design through design competition
incentives; and
(d)    support to CEB in implementation of a DSM Strategy and Load Research
Program.
30.    This effort would require load research equipment procurement as well as international
and local expertise to advise and train the various stakeholders (government agencies, building
associations, owners and developers) involved in the process.

Net Benefits:
IRR:                                 12%             19%
Nature of Benefits:
a) To the economy: (i) Reduction in kerosene and battery usage; (ii) Demonstration of a
commercially viable private sector/NGO executed off-grid electrification initiative; (iii)
Mobilization of investment from private investors, village cooperatives and NGO enterprises at
the village grassroots level; (iv) Reduced government investment in rural electrification through
subsidized grid-electrification; (v) Protection of environment by avoided use of fossil fuels.
b) To Consumers: Access to clean and better quality electricity service to 5,000 rural
households currently without electric power. (Additional consumer benefits from improved
quality of service are not included in the analysis.)
Main Beneficiaries: a) This NGO-supported subproject would serve 2,200 medium income rural
households in the Galle district providing pre-electrification services; ESD Credit Program support
of solar home system subprojects would have the following additional beneficiaries b) Private
investors /NGOs at the village grassroots level; c) Local private sector entrepreneurs.
Main Assumptions:
a) Ability to pay: Target households income per month exceed Rs. 3,000 and meet the-
affordability criteria.
b) GEF grant: Grant cofinancing of $100 per solar home system.
c) Economic Assumptions:
(i) Discount rate: 12%; (ii) Exchange rate: Rs. 53/US$; (iii) Currency/US$; 1996 prices.
d) Market Share: 30 Watt system: 30%; 4OWatt system: 42%; and 50 Watt system: 30%.
e) Benefits: Avoided expenditures on kerosene for lighting and on automotive battery charging
for television, radio, etc. Additional consumer benefits of convenience, improved safety, better
indoor air quality, and higher quality of light were not included due to a lack of adequate
valuation data.
This analysis is for one representative Solar Home System subproject. The ESD Credit Line is expected to support
several such projects which, cumulatively, would install 30,000 systems.
2 Given the focus on private sector provision of renewable energy services, the financial analysis incorporated elements of
concern to private investors such as inflation, taxes, duties, and financing terms and conditions. Present values of benefits
and costs are given in nominal terms.

Part II: Financial Highlights of Potential PCIs
8.     Four private domestic commercial banks namely, Hatton National Bank (HNB), Sampath
Bank, Seylan Bank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBOC), the two DFIs namely National Development
Bank (NDB) and Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC), and one merchant bank
namely Vanik Incorporation Ltd. have been evaluated. Detailed assessment of their eligibility is
available in the Project File. As can be seen from statistical financial highlights presented in Table
below, seven financial institutions noted above demonstrate their ability to meet the eligibility criteria.
More specifically, these institutions have the following characteristics:

Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing Arrangements
Procurement
ESD Credit Line Component:
* ICB for goods contracts in excess of $2.0 million.
* ICB for works contracts in excess of $3.0 million.
* ICB for turnkey contracts in excess of $5.0 million.
* Established commercial practices will be utilized for all non-ICB contacts. Three quotes will
be required to ensure competitive prices. An opinion from an independent expert acceptable
to IDA on the reasonableness of quoted prices will be required for all contracts where 3
quotes are not received.
The PCls will be required to maintain details of the procurement methods used by sub-borrowers
and to monitor the utilization of subloan funds for procurement through regular site supervision
visits; Administrative Unit staff and IDA field supervision missions will continue to review
implementation of these procedures.
Wind Farm and Capacity Building Components:
* ICB for goods contracts in excess of $200,000.
 NCB for goods contracts between $25,000 and $200,000.
* NCB for works contracts in excess of $25,000.
* Local/international shopping with a minimum of 3 quotations for goods and works contracts
below $25,000.
* Selection of consultants will follow the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers.
Prior review:
* All subloan ICB contracts.
* All goods and works contracts under the Wind Farm Components.
* The letter of invitation to bid, terms of reference and short list for all consultant services
contracts under the Wind Farm and Capacity Building components.
Disbursement
The Project has a projected five-year disbursement period.
ESD Credit Line Component:
A. IDA Funds
* The final date for submitting financing applications would be three years after Credit
effectiveness. The Closing Date for the Credit would be five years after Credit Effectiveness.
* The Administrative Unit (AU) will process disbursement requests for subloans and grants
approved by PCIs under their free limit, and disbursement requests for subloans and grants
above the free limit approved by IDA. Also subject to prior approval by IDA are: (i) the first
two subloan proposals, irrespective of size, presented by any PCI, (ii) each PCI's first solar
home systems subloan proposal, and (iii) each subproject developer's first solar home
systems subloan proposal.
* Eligibility of expenditures below the prior review limit would be ascertained by the AU and
disbursements for all subloans would be made against full documentation. For expenditures



Annex 6
Page 2 of 5
above the prior review limits, the AU will submit reimbursement applications to IDA for
reviewlapproval. Detailed documentation evidencing expenditures would be kept by the AU
for external audits and for review by IDA supervision missions.
*  IDA funds would be used to reimburse up to 60% of amounts of subloans made by PCIs for
subproject-related expenditures incurred no more than 120 days prior to the date on which
IDA receives the relevant information on subloan/ subproject proposals together with
corresponding subproject documentation.
*  The AU would authorize the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to make payments from the
Special Account to the PCI and would also be responsible for keeping track of this Account.
B. GEF Grant Financing
Grant funds will be available to off-grid subproject developers who have signed a subloan
agreement with a PCI. Grants would be disbursed on a reimbursement basis, after installation of
the off-grid system, and upon presentation of certificates noted below and documentation showing
eligible expenditures.
Village Hydro
*  Grant funds of US$400 per kilowatt of village hydro installed will be provided, but the
maximum amount of grant funds per village hydro will be US$20,000.
*  The AU will process the grant release for the subproject, within one week of receipt of
certification by a Chartered Engineer that the entire system (including civil works,
electromechanical, distribution system, and house wiring for beneficiaries) is complete,
complies with the most recent village hydro specifications, and is operational.
Solar Home System (SHS)
*  Grant funds of US$100 per solar home system with module of 30 watt or greater will be
provided. A household may not receive more than one SHS grant, and each PV module
would be eligible for no more than one grant or loan.
*  PCIs are responsible for verifying that proposed solar home systems conform to the most
recent Specifications for Solar Home Systems. To facilitate such a verification, the AU will
administer TA funds for PCIs to retain consultants for this purpose and will maintain a list of
consultants acceptable to IDA who are capable of verifying that the system proposed in the
subloan application meets the most recent Specifications for Solar Home Systems.
*  The AU will maintain a list of photovoltaic modules imported for potential use in ESD funded
installations based on information provided by importers through PCls.
*  The AU will process the grant release upon receipt of a complete installation certificate of the
dealers through the PCIs and verification that (i) the installed module was on the PV module
list maintained by the AU; (ii) the module had not been used previously to apply for an ESD
Grant; and (iii) the household had not previously received an ESD Grant.
*  The AU will ensure that the Installation Certificate contains the following information: (i) serial
number of photovoltaic module installed; (ii) name, national identification number, and address
of customer; and (iii) signature of customer indicating acceptance of the system and
agreement to the terms of the loan, lease or other contract with PV system supplier, and
certifying that the household had not previously received an SHS grant under the ESD
Project; (iv) date of acceptance that the system is satisfactory and operational; and (v)
signature of the dealer indicating that the system complies with the most recent Specifications



Annex 6
Page 3 of 5
for Solar Home Systems and that the module installed has not previously been used to
acquire a grant under the ESD project or other program.
PCIs will also be responsible for verifying actual SHS installations. To facilitate such a
verification, the AU will administer TA funds for PCIs to retain consultants to verify, on a
sampling basis, (i) module serial numbers given on grant applications; and (ii) compliance of
installed systems with the PV Specifications. The AU will follow up with remedial action upon
receipt of a PCI report of irregularities. If the remedial action is unsuccessful, suspension of
dealers from the Credit Program is required and the AU will notify all PCIs.
Off-grid Project Preparation Technical Assistance
* Each off-grid subproject developer would be eligible for only one grant to help prepare
feasibility studies, business plans and bank loan documentation for off-grid suprojects.
Grants would cover only independent consulting services on a reimbursement basis up to
90% of the cost of preparation for a SHS subproject (up to US$6,500) and 95% of the
preparation cost of a village hydro subproject (up to US$9,000).
* Reimbursement would require PCI approval of a subproject on the basis of a complete
feasibility study/business plan/bank loan application package, presentation of eligible
expenditures and submission of a disbursement request(s) for IDA funds equal to or
exceeding the GEF grant amount. Only those expenditures incurred after September 1, 1996
would be eligible for reimbursement.
Wind Farm and Capacity Building Components:
* IDA and GEF funds will be disbursed on a pari passu basis against 100% of the foreign
expenditures and 70% of local expenditures under the Wind Farm EPC contract.
* Prior authorization by IDA for all ICB goods and services contracts under the Capacity
Building component will be required.
* IDA will disburse against the principle amount of the Project Preparation Facility withdrawn
and outstanding as of the effectiveness of the credit and all unpaid charges thereon.
Statements of Expenditure
Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditure (SOE) for:
* Contracts for goods and works for less than $250,000 for the Credit Program Component;
* Contracts of less than US$200,000 equivalent for works, goods, and services under the Wind
Farm and Capacity Building components; and
* Consultants contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 equivalent
for individuals under the Wind Farm and Capacity Building components.
Special Accounts
* To facilitate disbursement of IDA and GEF funds allocated for the Credit Program, a Special
Account with an initial deposit of US$1,150,000 ($1,000,000 IDA, $150,000 GEF) would be
established.
* A special account, administered by the CEB, with an initial deposit of $150,000 ($100,000
IDA, $50,000 GEF) will be established to facilitate disbursement of IDA and GEF funds under
the Wind Farm and Capacity Building components.

Project Accounts and Audits
*  The-executing agencies (Administrative Unit and CEB) will maintain separate accounts of
Project expenditures in accordance with sound accounting practice.
*  The Administrative Unit will retain PCI documentation and withdrawal application
documentation for inspection during IDA/GEF supervision missions.
*  All statements of expenditure, together with supporting documentation, will be audited

ENERGY SERVICE DELIVERY PROJECT (ESD)
ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
January 31, 1997
Energy Services Delivery Credit Program Background and Objectives
1.    The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has proposed an Energy Services Delivery Project
targeting the implementation of renewable energy and demand side management projects. The
World Bank/GEF has assisted the GOSL in preparing the proposed Credit. The major component
of the ESD Project is an Energy Services Delivery Credit Program which would provide medium
and long-term financing to private sector firms, NGOs, and cooperatives for household solar
photovoltaic (PV) electrification, village hydro schemes, grid-connected mini-hydro plants, and
other renewable energy investments. Funds for the ESD Credit Program and associated
technical assistance would be made available under an IDA credit as well as a grant from the
Global Environment Facility (GEF). The GEF funding would primarily support off-grid (PV and
village hydro) subprojects. Credit institutions which meet specific eligibility criteria would enter into
an agreement with the GOSL to participate in the ESD Credit Program. An ESD Credit Program
Administrative Unit (AU) established within the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon
(DFCC) would administer the Credit Program on behalf of the GOSL.
Eligible Credit Institutions
2.     Private commercial banks, development finance institutions (DFIs), and other types of
private financial institutions, which meet the eligibility criteria for participation in the credit program
and are approved by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and the Ministry of Finance and
Planning (MOFP), can enter into a Participation Agreement with the GOSL. These agreements will
provide the contractual basis for access to the ESD credit funds. The AU will, on behalf of GOSL,
prepare these agreements in consultation with the Participating Credit Institutions (PCIs) for
signing by GOSL.
3.    The Participation Agreements between the GOSL and PCIs will specify the
responsibilities of the PCIs for project promotion, appraisal, supervision, repayment of financing
provided, and for compliance with relevant laws and regulations (including CBSUMOF operational
guidelines) and PCI policies acceptable to GOSL and IDA. The Participation Agreements also will
require the PCI to:
(a) Ensure that the ESD Credit Program financing provided is applied fully and exclusively for
the purpose agreed when the loan was made; and
(b) Provide such information on the progress of the subprojects and enterprises financed to
the Administrative Unit as GOSL, in consultation with IDA, may reasonably request.
Eligible Subprojects
4.     Private investment proposals, by any private enterprises, NGOs and cooperatives
operating in Sri Lanka, for (a) grid-connected mini-hydros, (b) off-grid village hydros, (c) solar
home systems, and (d) other renewable energy investments, would be eligible for financing
provided that:

AU will be responsible for:
(a) Processing disbursement requests for loans approved by PCIs under their free limit, and
processing disbursement requests for loans exceeding PCIs free limit approved by IDA;
(b) Maintaining separate disbursement records and accounts with respect to each PCI under
the ESD project; keeping on file supporting disbursement documents as well as bank
accounts relating to disbursements; and maintaining a Project Account. All records,
documents and accounts are to be maintained in accordance with sound accounting
practices for independent audits and for review by IDA and GEF missions;
(c) Maintaining the ESD Credit Program-related statistical records, incorporating, among
other things, (i) approval of subprojects and disbursement made in respect thereof; (ii)
classification of subprojects by grid-connected hydros, off-grid village hydros, solar home
systems and others; (iii) classification of subprojects by size and geographical distribution;
and (iv) classification of subloans approved by size, maturity pattern and geographical
distribution;
(d) Informing IDA from time to time regarding the progress of the Project, providing regular
reports on the progress of the Project, assisting IDA and GEF supervision and/or
evaluation missions;

periodic reports (including semi-annual PCIs' loan collection performance reports) as
required by GOSL and IDA;
(f) Monitoring timely preparation and submission of subproject completion reports;
(g) Performing such other tasks and functions as are necessary to achieve the objectives of
the project.
Administration of GEF Grant Funds
7.     The AU will be responsible for administration of GEF Grant Funds. The GEF Grant Funds
will be used to: (i) support off-grid subproject preparation activities; (ii) cofinance off-grid
subprojects; and (iii) Off-grid Project Support. The Administrative Unit will implement specific
policies and procedures for processing of GEF funds set out by GOSL in consultation with IDA.
The Administrative Unit will be responsible for:
(a) Processing requests for disbursement of GEF Grant Funding
(b) Maintaining separate disbursement records and accounts with respect to each PCI on
GEF grants; keeping on file supporting disbursement documents as well as serial
numbers for solar home systems and bank accounts relating to disbursements; and
