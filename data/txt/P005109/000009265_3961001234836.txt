LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA)
Guarantor:               Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt)
&amoupt:                 US$220 million
Ims^:                    Standard IBRD terms, with 20 years maturity
Project Objectives:      The proposed project would assist EEA in:
(i) alleviating power shortages; (ii) meeting the
growing demand for electricity; (iii) improving the
efficiency and reliability of the EEA interconnected
system; (iv) strengthening the EEA financial position;
and (v) improving the technical and managerial skills
of EEA staff.
Project Description:    The project would consist of: (a) the supply and
installation of a dual fuel-fired (fuel oil and
natural gas) thermal power station at Kureimat with a
net installed capacity of 1,200 MW (two units of net
600 MW each); (b) the supply of material and equipment
for about 162 km of a 20-inch diameter natural gas
pipeline interconnecting the power station with the
gas grid; (c) the supply and installation of about 150
km of 500-kV and about 90 km of 220-kV transmission
lines, and line loss reduction equipment of about 500
MVAR capacity; (d) the rehabilitation of Tanta
substation; and (e) technical assistance to help EEA
with engineering supervision at the power station,
providing training (including training equipment) to
EEA staff, completion of energy data bank and
management information system, computerization of EEA
financial (including cost control) management system
and introduction of efficient load management system
by procurement of special meters for industrial and
bulk consumers.
Benefits a_nd Ri_sks:    Project benefits would include: (i) an increase in the
efficiency and reliability of electricity generation,
enabling EEA to meet the future electricity demand in
Egypt; (ii) an improvement in the reliability of the
EEA interconnected system for transmitting electric



. ii -
power to the load centers; and (iii) an improvement
in the operational and managerial skills of i.EA staff.
There are no major risks associated with the project.
Delays in project implementation would have an adverse
impact on the rate of return on investment. This risk
has been addressed by allowing an eight-year
implementation period and the advanced state of
project preparation with bidding and evaluation of
bids already started on some of the bid packages of
the project components.

A. Sector Background
1.01        The Arab Republic of Egypt (Egypt) has the largest population and
second largest economy (After Saudi Arabia) in the Middle East. In the decade
1974-1984/85 (FY85), the real GDP grew rapidly by about 9 percent per annum,
stimulated by an extraordinary increase in foreign exchange earnings from oil
exports, workers' remittances, Suez canal fees, tourist receipts and foreign
aid. However, a pervasive system of pricing controls and heavy impart
protection creatwd growing distortions, resulting in the inefficient use and
allocation of resources.
1.02        Thus, by the early 1980s the economy, which became heavily
dependent on oil exports and workers' remittances, was not prepared to handle
the consequences of lower oil prices, declining workers' remittances, and
slower growth in Suez canal and tourism revenues. In spitI of declining
foreign exchange earnings, during FY83-85, overall economic growth was
maintained at 6-7 percent as the cost of rapidly worsening balance of payment
deficits and a sharp increase in foreign debt.
1.03        Since FY86, tlhe accumulation of distortions, inefficiencies and
imbalances led to a slow and unsustainable economic growth, and unmanageable
external debt. Based on the agreement reached with the IMF in 1987 regarding
measures to bc taken by the Government, the IMF agreed in 1987 for a Stand-by
and the Paris Club rescheduled its debt. While IMF Stand-by and the Paris Club
debt rescheduling in 1987 provided some temporary relief, the measures taken
by the Government in structural reforms were inadequate and the real GDP
grcwth rate further declined from 2.5 percent in FY89 to about 2 percent in
FY91 and is expected to be about 1 percent in FY92.
1.04        To stem the decline in the GDP growth rate and to stimulate
growth, the Government has recently embarked on an ambitious Economic Reform
and Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP). Energy pricing reforms is an
important component of ERSAP. The Government has agreed to bring the energy
prices to economic level by FY95. In support of the ERSAP, an IMP Stand-by
facility was approved by the Fund Board in May 1991 and a Structural
Adjustment Loan was approved by the Board in June 1991. With the
implementation of the agreed measures, the real GDP growth rate is estimated
to improve from about 1 percent in FY92 to 4 percent in FY94. Thereafter, the
GDP growth rate of 4 percent is likely to be sustained till the end of the
century.

1.05        The energy sector plays an important role in Egypt's economy.
tgypt's balance of payments is heavily dependent on petroleuml. Not only is
petrolaum the largest single earner of foreign exchange, other major sources
-- worker's remittances, Suez canal traffic and even tourism -- are closely
related to the conditions in the world oil markets. Petroleum-related exports
accounted for about two-thirds of merchandise exports in the 1980s; since
then, they have fallen to below 50 percent due to decline in both volume and
prices. As Egypt's oil production is expected to begin its decline in the
mid-1990s and domestic consumption of petroleum increases, the country may
become a net importer of petroleum oil before the end of the decade. Egypt
will therefore have to stimulate rapid growth of non-oil exports. The most
dynamic export performance is expected from non-textile manufactured goods
w7hich are projected to grow by about 9 percent annually in constant terms.
The projected rapid growth of manufacturing exports would, in turn, require an
appropriate growth in the infrastructure required for the manufacturing
sector. Adequate and reliable supply of electricity is an essential
requirement for sustaining thie projected growth in the manufacturing sector.
B.  Eeg  ReLo  m s
1.06        Egypt has proven resources of oil, gas, hydropower and to some
extent coal. As of FY88, provexi oil and natural gas reser-es were about
480 million mt and 12 trillion ft3 of gas respectively. Egypt depeads heavily
on the river Nile for its hydropower resources. Egypt's hydropower potential
is about 12,000 CWh per annum out of which about 9,500 GWh has been harnessed
with the completion of High dam and Aswan I and Aswan II power stations. The
harnessed hydropower potential would increase from 9,500 GWh to 9,900 GWh with
the completion of the New Esna Barrage Power Project in FY94. The balance
potential of 2,100 GWh is in small hydro projects on the Nile river and the
Government is studying the techno-economic feasibility of tapping the
potential. The other possible hydropower potential (about 10,000 GWh) is the
Qattara depression which is about 135 m below the Mediterranean sea level and
advantage could be taken of the difference in levels for hydropower
generation. The prohibitive cost of 160 km canal through the desert to take
advantage of the difference in level for power generation and the ecological
impact it could have, makes it unattractive for utilization of the potential
for power generation. The only coal mining project under consideration is the
Maghara coal mines in Sinai. It is estimated that about 27 million mt of
minable coal is available out of which about 21 million mt is recoverable.
However, currently, only about 3 million mt could be classified as proven coal
reserves.
1.07        Egypt has abundant solar radiation, the annual average of direct
solar radiation varying between 6 to 8 kWh/m2/day.  Except under special
circumstances, the high cost of the technology for utilization of the solar

as crude oil, lease coneensate, unfinished oils, petroleum products, natural

entergy prevents its commerciul exploitation for power generation. The
possibility of utilizing the solar energy for water heating is more attractive
and the Government is encouraging the development and standardization of the
solar water heaters. The potontial for utilization of wind power for power
generation and water pumping exists in the Mersa Matruh region on the
Mediterranean coast and the Hurgada region on the Red sea where wind speeds of
more than 20 km/hour have be i recorded. The Renewable Energy Development
Authority (REDA) under the r: -;-try of Electricity and Energy (MEE) is
establishing pilot projects fo.  development of solar and wind power in Egypt.
Even though some sites with possible geothermel potential have been identified
in the country, the low temperatures of the sources (480C to 780C) limits
their application for power generation. Egypt is not well endowed with
biomass, however, the use of biogas digester could be considered in rural
areas where the gas produced in digester could be used for domestic purposes
and the residue could be used as a source of soil nutrient.
C.   nergv Suppy and Demand
1.08        Today, Egypt exports energy, however, beyond the year 2000, it may
have to resort to energy imports. Figure 1.1 is based on the data in Annex
1.1 which gives the aet.ual (FY82-91) and estimated (FY92-99) supply, export
and demand for energy in Egypt. During FY82-91, production of commercial
energy, comprising petr-leum, natural gas and hydropower, grew by about
4 percent annually from about 40.6 MTOE to 58.0 MTOE. During the same period,
domestic consumption of energy grew at a higher rate of about 6 percent
annually from about 18.0 MTOE to 30.9 MTOE and the energy exportsl (of crude
oil and petroleum products) grew annually at a lower rate of about 2 percent
from about 20.3 MTOE to 24.8 MTOE. In the absence of any substantial new
discoveries, it is estimated that petroleum production would reach its peak
around FY93-94 and over a longer term (beyond the year 2000), Egypt could
become a net importer of energy. Figure 1.1 also gives the energy consumed
the power subsector.  The subsector accounts for about 40 percent of the tota.
domestic energy consumption. During the period FY82-91, the energy
consumption of the stubsector increased at a rate of about 5 percent annually
from about 7.2 MTOE to 10.9 MTOE. Given the declining production of petroleum
and natural gas, limited hydropower potential that could be economically
tapped, and increasing demand for energy, it is es,ential that the Government
encourages efficient use of energy through pricing of energy at economic level
and implementation of energy conservation measures by the energy users.
1.09        Apparently, no clear relationship exists between the annual GDP
growth rates and growth rates of domestic energy consumption or those for the
electricity consumption by the end users. One possible reason for this
situation could be wrong signals given to the country's economy by the low
energy prices compared to their economic values. Figure 1.2 below gives the
actual (FY82-91) and estimated (FY92-99) growth rates for GDP, energy
consumption and electricity consumption. During the period FY82-91, GDP
1/ Petroleum exports includes exports by the Governnient and those by the
partners assisting the Government in production of crude oil.

growth rate slid from about 11 percent in FY82 to 2 percent in FY91 in three
stages. GDP growth rate went down from 11 percent in FY82 to 6 percent in
FY84 and after hovering around 6 percent during FY84-85, it again continued
the slide and was 2.5 percent in FY87. After a short upward move to 4 percent
in FY88, the GDP growth rate slid again to 2 percent in FY91 and is estimated
to be 1 percent in FY92.

Figure 1.3.
There appears to be a time lag of about one to three years in the downward
movement of the growth rate of energy consumption.  Thus, after attaining a
peak of about 14 percent in FY83, the growth rate for energy consumption
dropped to about 2 percent in FY86 and after reaching a smaller peak of about
8 percent in FY87, it continued its downward trend till it was about minus
0.5 percent in FY90. Thereafter, while the GDP growth rate is expected to
reach its lowest (1 percent) in FY92, the growth rate for energy consumption,
after a series of wide fluctuations during FY91-94, is expected to reach its
lowest (about 0 percent) in FY95. The growth rate of the electricity
consumption by the end users appears to be the slowest to respond to the
changes in the GDP growth rates. After attaining a peak of about 15 percent
in FY84, the growth rate for electricity consumption slid to about 7 percent
in FY85 and rose to a smaller peak of 10 percent in FY86 before continuing its
gradual decline to about 5.2 percent in FY91. During the period FY92-99 the



annual growth rate for electricity consumption is expected to be about 5

Notes:
1/ The Goverrnent increased, as of January 4, 1992, the prices of gas oil and kerosene by 50
percent to LE 360/mt and LE 378/mt respectiveLy.
2/ Electricity prices for FY83-89 are the weighted average tariffs applicable to the end users.
For FY90-91, however, the columns "FV90" and "IFY911 take into account the May 1990 and May 1991
exchange rates and price increases in the petrolewn, natural gas, and electricity prices announced
by the Government. Actual increase in revenue on account of these increases would basicatly accrue
in FY91 and FY92.
1.11        Despite recent substantial energy price increases (para. 1.12) the
energy prices in Egypt are below the economic levels. Historically, the
conception of abundance of petroleum, natural gas and hydropower allowed the
Government to maintain domestic energy prices below the economic levels. The
low energy prices gave wrong signals to the consumers and resulted in the: (i)
inefficient use of energy by the end users; (ii) high energy growth rates,
depletion of domestic energy resource base and diminished export capacity;
(iii) establishment of energy intensive industries such as Nag Hammadi
aluminum plant and Kima :-rtilizer plant which uses electrolysis process
instead of natural gas for ammonia production; (iv) lack of incentive for
adoption of energy conservation measures in industry; (v) inefficient resource
allocation and sub-optimal growth of GDP; and (vi) increase in environmental
pollution. In addition, high consumption of non-renewable domestic energy
resources may make the country a net importer of energy beyond the year 2000
(para. 1.08).
1.12        Since 1980, the Bank was involved in a dialogue with the
Government regarding the issue of energy price increases. The Government
decided to take steps to correct the situation and during FY84-91, the
weighted average electricity tariff was increased by about 470 percent i.n
current terms. DurJ.ig the same period, the Government increased the prices
(in current terms) of natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, gas oil, gasoline and
LPG by 1,106 percent, 913 percent, 600 percent, 567 percent, 536 percent and
285 percent, respectively. As a result of the understanding reached under the
SAL and the IMF Stand-by agreements, and the May 1991 increases of energy
pri^es, the weighted average tariff for electricity was about 59 percent of
the average tariff based on long-run marginal cost (LRMC) and the weighted
average petroleum product price (including bulk natural gas sales) was about
56 percent of internationally traded equivalent. Effective January 4, 1992,
the Government increased the prices of gas oil and kerosene by about 50
percent. As a result, based on the current exchange rate of LE 3.33/US$, the
weighted average petroleum price in Egypt is 64 percent of the internationally
traded equivalent thus exceeding the agreed target of 56 percent by December
1991. Annex 1.2 gives the definition of internationally traded equivalent



-7-
(twelve months rolling average of petroleum product prices) as agreed by the
Government during SAL negotiations. Based on this formula, the Government
intends, by June 1995, to adjust the weighted average domestic prices of
petroleum products and natural gas' to their internationally traded
equivalents, and electricity prices to cover LRMC cost. For petroleum
products, the Government intends to adjust nominal petroleum prices by June
1992, to reach the 67 percent target of international prices. Further, the
Government agreed that the weighted average price as a percentage of
international equivalents will be increased an additional 11 percentage points
by May of each following year (1992 - 1995, inclusive). The price increase
applied to bulk natural gas supply will be equivalent to that for domestic
fuel oil prices. For electricity prices, the Government agreed that the
weighted average price as a percentage of LRMC will be increased by about 10
percentage points at least annually to move the prices already announced for
May 1991 ( 59 percent of LRMC) to 100 percent by June 1995. The basis for
LRMC prices is explained in para. 2.07 and Table B, Annex 2.3.
E. Issues in Energy Sector
1.13        The main issues in the energy sector are: (i) energy pricing;
(ii) financial health of the petroleum and power subsector institutions;
(iii) need for energy conservation; (iv) improvement of operational
efficiency; (v) reduction of line losses; and (vi) introduction of load
management techniques. Actions to resolve these issues are ongoing under the
SAL, the Bank-financed Fourth Power Project and under the bilateral programs.
The issue of energy pricing is being addressed under the SAL. Resolution of
this issue will in turn help to solve the problem of weak financial
performance in the power and petroleum subsectors (para. 1.14) and will also
induce energy users to focus their attention on energy conservation (para.
1.15). The proposed project would provide technical assistance to improve EEA
operational efficiency through: implementation of effective cost control
systems; procurement of line loss reduction equipment; and rehabilitation of
equiprpnt in the EEA electrAcal network (paras. 1.14 and 1.16). In addition,
assisL nce to reduce line losses is also being pursued under the bilateral
programs (para. 1.16).
1.14        Implementation of the agreed (para. 1.12) increases in petroleum
products and electricity prices would assist the petroleum and the power
subsector institutions in improving their financial health. Performance of
the petroleum subsector institutions depends primarily on two factors:
international and domestic energy prices. Declining oil prices and low
domestic prices compounded by the anticipated decline in oil production levels
and rising cost of gas supply has affected the financial health of the
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPG). The Gas Investment Project
/ Natural gas is expected to be supply-constrained for the medium and
possibly long term, largely due to substantial demand for power plants and
heavy industries. Any marginal change in natural gas availability would
impact fuel oil consumption. Therefore, the Government has agreed to tie the
price of natural gas supplied to bulk consumers to the fuel oil equivalent.



8-
approved by the Board in June 1991 would address some of the issues related to
the petroleum subsector. Increasing the electricity prices to match LRMC
costs would assist the power subsector institutions in improving their
financial performance. However, to ensure compliance with the financial
covenants1 under the ongoing Fourth Power Project and to minimize the future
tariff increases, EEA would have to take measures such as minimizing operating
expenditures, reducing system losses, delaying investments by ensuring maximum
utilization of existing generating capacity and introducing effective cost
control system. Agreement has been reached with EEA that the technical
assistance component of the project should include assistance in implementing
a computerized cost accounting system and training of its staff in cost
analysis and preparation of management reports (paras. 5.02 and 5.24).
1.15        The .Jovernment intention of increasirg energy prices to economic
levels by FY95 acid the fact that, in future, Egypt is likely to be a net
importer of energy (para. 1.08), would focus the attention of the institutions
in the energy sector and the end users of energy to the importance of energy
conservation and efficient utilization of energy. The Government has already
established by Decree Number 112 of 1983 the Organization for Energy Planning
(OEP) to develop and implement energy programs that leaa to rational energy
resource utilization in residential, commercial, transportation and industrial
sectors. However, OEP has not yet become effective due to lack of inter-
sector discipline and coordination. To promote energy conservation in the
industrial sector, the Government established an Industrial Energy
Conservation Center within the framework of Tebbin Institute for Metallurgical
Studies (TIMS). The center under TIMS generally caters for energy
conservation and efficiency improvement measures for the public sector
industries while the Development Research and Technological Planning Center
(DRTPG) established in the Cairo University caters for similar measures to be
taken in the private sector industries.
1.16        To minimize the operating expenditures (para. 1.14), EEA would
have to improve its operational efficiency, reduce line losses, ensure maximum
availability of its installed generating capacity and implement effective load
management systems. The Government of Finland and the U.S. Agency for
International Assistance (USAID) are assisting EEA and the Electricity
Distribution Authority (EDA) in their efforts for reduction of line losses in
their electrical systems. The ongoing Fourth Power Project has provided
technical assistance to assist EEA in load management techniques which were
initiated under the technical assistance funded by the Bank under the Shoubrah
El Kheima and the Third Power Projects. The proposed project provides funding
for procurement of special meters for bulk and major industrial consumers,
installation of transmission lines, procurement of line loss reduction
equipment and Tanta substation rehabilitation to enable EEA to improve the
efficiency and reliability of its electrical system.
I/ The financial covenants require EEA to achieve self financing ratios of
20% in FY92, 30% in FY93, and 35% from FY94 onwards. In addition, EEA should
achieve every year a debt service ratio of 1.5.



-9.
F. Energy Sector Institutions
1.17        The Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources (MOP) and the
Ministry of Electricity and Energy (MEE) are responsible for Egypt's energy
sector. In addition, OEP was established in 1983 (para. 1.15) to develop and
implement energy programs that lead to rational energy utilization. OEP is an
autonomous organization under the Supreme Energy Council (SEC) which includes
all Cabinet Ministers concezned with production and consumption of Energy.
1.18        In the petroleum subsector, the Government-owned EGPC functions as
a holding company under the control of MOP. The primary responsibility for
all exploration, production, refining and transportation of petroleum and
natural gas rests with EGPC which carries out these functions through its
subsidiaries. Some of these subsidiaries have partnerships in oil production
with foreign companies, The marketing and distribution of oil and gas is
largely carried out by EGPC and its subsidiaries, but private companies are
involved in distribution of gasoline and LPG.
1.19        Annex 1.3 gives the organization chart for Egypt's power
subsector. MEE oversees the power subsector through: (i) the Egyptian
Electricity Authority (EEA), a publicly-owned enterprise responsiblo for
almost all the power generated and transmitted in Egypt; (ii) the Electricity
Distribution Authority (EDA) which coordinates the distribution activities of
eight regional Electricity Distribution Companies (EDCs) responsible for
distribution of electricity to medium and low voltage consumers; (iii) the
Hydropower Plants Executive Authority (HPPEA) responsible for construction of
new hydropower projects in coordination with the Ministry of Irrigation;
(iv) the Rural Electrification Authority (REA) responsible for construction of
distribution networks in urban and rural areas; (v) the Nuclear Power Plants
Authority, Atomic Po¢er Authority and Nuclear Material Authority responsible
for planning construction and operation of nuclear plants; (vi) the Renewable
Energy Development Authority (REDA) responsible for introduction of the
renewable energy projects in the country; and (vii) the Organization for
Construction and Manufacture of Electrical Equipment which is involved through
its four affiliates in manufacture of electrical equipment and providing
support for the construction activities concerning transmission and
distribution lines.
G. Poverty Impact Minimization
1.20        Power projects are not the means to directly combat poverty.
However, an adequate supply of electricity is an important prerequisite for
the development of competitive industrial, commercial and trade structures.
The power projects, therefore, are an essential tool for promotion of economic
growth in the developing countries. Improved economic conditions in the
country would assist the Government's objective of improving living conditions
for the poor. Further, the Government intends to maintain a lower level of
tariffs for the average domestic consumer and small commercial consumer using
about 100 kWh of electricity per month (para. 2.07).

II. POWER SUBSECTOR
A. BRakground
2.01        EEA is responsible for generation and transmission of almost all
the electricity in Egypt. It also distributes electricity directly to:
(a) eight major industrial consumers at 220-kV/132-kV; (b) fourteen industrial
and two agricultural consumers at 66-kV; and (c) five industrial and two
agricultural consumers at 11-kV. EDA through its eight EDCs is responsible
for bulk purchase of power from EEA for distribution of electricity to medium
and low voltage consumers.
2.02        Except for about one percent of EEA installed generation capacity
characterized by isolated islands of power generation and transmission, EEA
installed generation capacity is connected to the Unified Power System (UPS).
Hydropower generation at Aswan (High Dam, Aswan I and II) is transmitted to
the major load centers in the Cairo region at 500 kV. Most of the thermal
power generation (including combustion turbines and combined cycle plants)
located in Lower Egypt is transmitted to the load centers at 220 kV. Except
for 500-kV transmission from Aswan to Cairo, power transmission in Upper Egypt
is at 132 kV. Due to increase in power demand in Upper Egypt, EEA is planning
to install 220-kV transmission lines in Upper Egypt.
2.03        EDCs purchase power in bulk, at 66-kV and 33-kV, from EEA at 772
points of supply. EDCs, normally, step down the power purchased from EEA to
ll-kV for distribution of electricity.
B. Electricity Supply and Demand
2.04        Annex 2.1 gives EEA generation and sales data. actual for FY82-91
and estimated for FY92-99. The isolated system hardly accounts for one
percent of EEA generation and sales, and after FY96 its size would be reduced
as more and more areas would be connected to UPS in future. The following
paragraphs would, therefore, concentrate on the analysis of the UPS. Figure
2.1 below gives the installed capacity and demand of UPS from FY82-99.
Hydropower dominated UPS installed generation capacity till FY84 when the
installed thermal generating capacity overtook that of the hydropower
capacity. With the expectation of availability of natural gas, EEA installed
combustion turbines till FY87 and later took advantage of more efficient
combined cycle plant which normally requires assured supply of natural gas or
diesel oil. Except for start-up and emergency operations, it is uneconomical
to use diesel oil (gas oil) for a combined cycle plant which normally would be
used as a base load plant. In FY90, the installed capacity of the combustion
turbines and combined cycle plants exceeded the hydropower capacity. However,
with the restricted availability of natural gas in future and after completion
of the ongoing combined cycle plants by FY95, the new generation capacity to
be installed would most likely be dual-fuel fired (natural gas and fuel oil)
thermal power plants. If availability of adequate natural gas to comply with
the environmental standards cannot be assured for the dual fuel fired power
plants, power plants using other fuels such as coal may have to be considered
in future. Annex 2.2 gives details of EEA existing (FY82-91) and estimated



- 11 -
(FY92-99) installed generation capacity by type after taking into account the
retirement (about 750 MW) of the old plants. It is seen that during FY82-91,
EEA installed generation capacity in the UPS prew annually by about 10 percent
and is estimated to grow annually by about 4 percent during FY92-99. The
lower growth rate for FY92-99 is due to the anticipated macroeconomic
situation during the period and the proposed energy price increases which
would bring the energy prices to their economic levels by FY95. The existing
installed generation capacity in UPS system is 11,707 MW, of which about 50
percent is in thermal steam, 26 percent in combustion turbines/combined cycle
and 24 percent in hydropower plants. By FY99, the installed generation
capacity would be 15,678 MW, of which about 62 percent would be in thermal
steam, 20 percent in combustion turbines/combined cycle and 18 percent in
hydropower plants. Thus during FY92-99, thermal steam plants would increase
their share of installed capacity from 50 percent to 62 percent while the
share of combustion turbines/combined cycle and hydropower plants in the
installed capacity would decline during the same period.

2.05        Figure 2.2 below gives the units generated by type -- thermal
steam, combustion turbines (including combined cycle) and hydro -- in the UPS
system. It is seen that, from FY83 onwards, generation from thermal plants
exceeded that from the hydropower plants. For the period FY82-90, which has
also seen the seven-years drought in the region, the average annual generation



- 12
from hydropower plants was about 9,500 GWh. For the same period, generation
from the combustion turbines/combined cycle plants was lower than the
hydropower plants due to lower natural gas availability. With the increased
availability of natural gas, the generation from the combustion
turbine/combined cycle plants is estimated to exceed the generation from
hydropower plants from FY93 before levelling off from FY95 onwards due to
restricted availability of natural gas (para. 2.04). In FY91, the UPS
generation was about 43,888 GWh, of which about 70 percent was from thermal
steam, 22 percent from hydropower and 8 percent from combustion turbines
plants. In FY99 the UPS generation is estimated to be about 64,324 GWh, of
which about 58 percent would be from thermal steam, 27 percent from combustion
turbines and combined cycle, and 15 percent from hydropower plants. Thus,
during FY92-99, the share of generation from thermal and hydropower plants
would decrease while the share of generation from the combustion
turbines/combined cycle power plants would increase substantially.

also sells directly to some of the major industrial and agricultural consumers
(para. 2.01). Thus, electricity sales to the end consumers are those from EDA
and EEA. During FY82-91, total electricity sales to the end consumers more

than doubled and grew at about 9 percens. During FY92-99, the electricity
sales to the end consumers are estimated' to grow annually at about 5

Figure 2.3
In FY91, electricity sales to the end consumers were about 36,287 GWh, of
which about 48 percent were to the industrial consumers, 32 percent to the
domestic consumers, 7 percent to the common public services and the balance of
13 percent to other consumers. In FY99, electricity sales to the end
consumers are estimated to be 54,571 GWh, of which 46 percent would be to the
industrial consumers, 33 percent to the domestic consumers, 7 percent to the
common public services and the balance of 14 percent to other consumers.
Therefore, it is seen that the pattern of electricity consumption by consumer
categories does not change much during the period of 8 years. There appears
to be no direct relationship between GDP growth rates and growth rates of
electricity sales to the end consumers (Figure 1.2). One of the reasons could
1/ Based on the GDP growth rates and other macroeconomic indicators projected
under the Structural Adjustment Loan to Egypt, the appraisal mission reviewed
with EEA and revised the forecast for electricity sales to the end consumers
for FY92-99.

be wrong signal (para. 1.09) given to the end users due to the low
electricity tariffs which do not reflect its economic value.
C. letggrJ.citv Pricing
2.07         Weighted average electricity price charged to the end users is
below the LRMC based costs (para. 1.12 and Table 1.1). During FY83-87
weighted average electricity price doubled in current terms and with the
latest tariff increases (May 1991), the weighted average electricity prices
nearly trebled during FY88-91. Table A, Annex 2.3 (page 1 of 2) gives
weighted average electricity tariffs for major groups of end users, and
weighted average tariffs for EEA and EDA. Table B, Annex 2.3 (page 1 of 2),
gives the breakdown for the LRMC cost of 4.31 US Cents/kWh assumed during
negotiations for SAL. The table also gives LRMC projections for FY92-99.
Annex 2.3 (page 2 of 2) gives in detail the electricity tariff rates and
increases implemented for important groups of end users and includes the
effect of May 1991 increases on these end users. The Government intends to
increase, by FY95, tl.a weighted average electricity tariffs to reflect the
LRMC costs. However, for rationalizing the future tariff increases, EEA is
carrying out a tariff study financed by USAID. The report is scheduled for
June 1992. The Government would review the report and take into account the
recommendations of the report while carrying out the future tariff increases.
The Government intends to maintain a lower level of tariff for the average
domestic consumer and small commercial consumer using 100 kWh of electricity
per month compared to consumers falling into higher levels of electricity
consumptions. Thus, for domestic and commercial consumers using 4,000 kWh or
more of electricity per month, the electricity tariff is 5 to 6 times that of
consumers using 100 kWh/month or less.
2.08         Increasing the electricitv prices to match LRMC costs would assist
EEA and EDA to improve their financial performance (para. 1.14). However, to
keep the future tariff increases to the minimum, EEA and EDA need to take
measures to reduce system losses. Reduction of losses in their transmission
and distribution systems is an essential step in this direction. EEA and EDA
are aware of the issue (para. 1.16). EEA, with the assistance from the
Government of Finland, carried out a study in 1983 for reactive compensation
required to reduce line losses in its system and based on the recommendations
in the study, EEA is procuring capacitors of about 900 MVAR total capacity
under bilateral credit from Finland. The first phase of installation of
capacitors of about 400 MVAR capacity was completed in 1987 and the second
phase comprising installation of capacitors of about 500 MVAR capacity is
scheduled for completion in 1992. To achieve its objective of reduction of
line losses, EEA needs to install additional capacitors of about 500 MVAR
capacity (a component of the project). EEA line losses (Annex 2.1, Page 2 of
2) which stood at about 10 percent in FY82 were brought down to 7 percent in
FY91 and are estimated to be reduced to about 5.5 percent by FY99. USAID has
assisted EDA in its efforts to reduce line losses in its system. It provided
funding for rehabilitation of urban distribution systems and is providing
expert assistance for EDA efforts to reduce line losses. Line losses in the
EDA systems, which stood at about 13 percent in FY82, were reduced to
11 percenc in FY91 and are estimated to be reduced to less than 9 percent by



15.
PY99. The total (EEA plus EDA) line losses were reduced from about 19 percent
in FY82 to less than 15 percent in FY90 and are estimated to be reduced to
about 12 percent by FY99.
D. EEA Investgmnt-Plan
2.09        Annex 2.4 gives the revised EEA least-cost investment plan for
FY92-99 which amounts to about LE 36,766 million out of which LE 30,282
million (about 82 percent) is in foreign exchange. About 74 percent of the
plan investment is in generation, 24 percent is in transmission and the
balance of 2 percent is for training and other miscellaneous items. The
scheduling of new power stations or extension to the existing power stations
depends on the load forecast and the available capacity of the existing power
stations. The investment plan takes into account replacement required for
retirement of about 750 MW of total capacity.
2.10        The Government has a long-term goal of regional exchange of power
between Arab and African countries through interconnection of electrical
systems of the countries. The feasibility study for interconnecting the
electrical systems of Egypt and Jordan has been completed. Further, the
consultants, Canadian Interconnection Consortium, are carrying out the
feasibility study for interconnection of the electrical systems of Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Turkey. Political stability in the region would be
one of the important factors if full economic benefits from such
interconnections are to be realized.
E. Issues in Power Subsector
2.11        The main issues in the power subsector are: (i) low electricity
tariffs which do not cover LRMC costs; (ii) high line losses; (iii) financial
health of EEA; (iv) lack of effective cost analysis, control and monitoring;
(v) inadequate computerization of EEA accounts; and (vi) lack of effective
management information system (MIS) and inter-departmental coordination within
EEA. The issues (i), (ii) and (iii) have been covered in paras. 1.13 through
1.16, Section I and para. 2.08; therefore, the remaining issues (iv) through
(vi) are discussed in the following paragraphs.
2.12        With implementation of energy price increases agreed under the
SAL, the EEA financial viability would improve. However, to minimize the risk
of not achieving the financial targets under the covenants under the ongoing
Fourth Power Project and to minimize the future tariff increases, additional
efforts by EEA are required to minimize operating expenses and improve its
operational efficiency. To minimize expenses, effective cost analysis,
control and monitoring of elements of cost of production and supply of
electricity is essential. The proposed project would provide technical
assistance for training EEA staff in cost analysis and preparation of
management reports so as to improve cost control (para. 5.02 . To improve
liquidity, EEA needs to make special efforts to improve collection of accounts
receivable. As of June 30, 1991, EEA accounts receivable represented about
5.6 months of average electricity sales (para. 5.13) and are to be reduced, by
June 30, 1992, to 3 months of electricity sales. Thereafter, at any point in



- 16 -
time, EEA accounts receivable would be maintained within the limit of 3 months
according to the financial covenants under the Fourth Power Project. With the
agreed tariff increases in future, the si.tuation is likely to worsen unless
EEA makes special efforts to maintain its accounts receivables within the
limit of 3 months.
2.13        EEA has installed modern office equipment and has access to modern
office technology; however, except in limited areas of technical power system
analysis, it has not taken full advantage of the available equipment.
Computerization of the financial and cost accounting systems has been
initiated but is incomplete and inadequate (para. 5.01).
2.14        EEA has the basic requisites for introduction of MIS.  However,
lack of interdepartmental coordination and effective system for collection of
data has delayed the implementation of the MIS system. In the absence of
coordination between its technical and financial departments, especially in
planning matters, it is not able to make effective use of MIS system (hardware
and software) installed under Project EGY/81/037 funded by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP). The proposed project provides additional
technical assistance to assist EEA in implementing MIS.
F. Role of IDA/Bank in the Power Subsector
2.15        The World Bank group has been involved in ten operations in the
energy sector, of which five operations are in the power subsector. The
operations in the power subsector are:
FY77 - Loan 1453-EGT, Regional Electrification Project (US$48 million)
FY79 - Loan 1733/Credit 935-ECT/Special Action Credit 20-EGT, Shoubrah El
Kheima Power Project (Loan US$102 million, Credit US$37 million and
Special Action Credit US$35 Million)
FY80 - Loan 1886/Credit 1052-ECT, Third Power Project (Loan US$7 million and
Credit US$120 million)
FY84 - Loan 1886-1-EGT, Power Supplemental Loan (US$59 million)
FY89 - Loan 3103-EGT, Fourth Power Project (US$165 million)
The Project Performance Audit Report for Loan 1453-ECT (No. 5110) dated June
5, 1984 was submitted to the Board on June 19, 1984 and a combined Project
Performance Audit Report for Loans/Credits 1733/935, 1886/1052 and 1886-1-EGT
(No. 8819) was submitted to the Board on July 26, 1991. The Fourth Power
Project is under implementation.
2.16        The completed operations have made substantial contributions to
the development of Egypt's power subsector. They have: (a) facilitated the
extension of electrical supply to the rural and urban areas; (b) supported
installation of three units of 300 MW each at Shoubrah El Kheima thermal power
station and four units of 67.5 MW each at Aswan II hydropower station located
at the old Aswan dam; (c) supported installation of a combined cycle power
plant of about 1,100 MW capacity located at Faraskur (Damietta); and
(d) assisted institutional development through financing of technical
assistance for project management, planning, training of technical and



- 17 -
financial staff, manpower development, and load research and load management.
The ongoing Fourth Power Project when completed would, in addition to (c) and
(d), improve the efficiency and provide 138 MW net additional generating
capacity by conversion to combined cycle of the existing combustion turbines
at Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations.
2.17        From these operations, four important lessons have been learnt.
The first important lesson learned was that it is unrealistic to set financial
objectives for EEA in isolation without regard to the system of subsidies and
controlled prices that pervades the Egyptian economy and have cross-sectoral
impact. As a result of this lesson, the Bank decided in FY87 to seek
agreement on the medium-term energy price reform goals and sought up-front
energy price action consistent with reaching the end objective, prior to each
energy sector lending operation. Thus, the Fourth Power Project was approved
after the end objective of reaching economic levels by June 30, 1995 was
agreed and an up-front energy price increase action was taken. The Gas
Investment Project was approved after annual targets for reaching the end
objective were agreed under the SAL (para. 1.12) and the FY91 action
consistent with the target was taken. This project is being presented to the
Board for approval after the Government has taken measures necessary to
achieve, for petroleum products, the target ratio of 56 percent between the
domestic and international prices (para. 1.12). In fact, as a result of the
January 4, 1992 energy price increases carried out by the Government, the
average weighted petroleum product price in Egypt is about 64 percent of the
internationally traded equivalent, thus exceeding the target of 56 percent for
December 1991. The second important lesson learned was that proper
arrangements should be in place before making any major organizational changes
in the existing set-up of the administrative functions of an institution.
This was the case when the Government decided to divest EEA of the function of
distribution of electricity and hand over the function to the EDA/EDCs. As a
result, the intention of improving the service rendered to the electricity
consumers could not be achieved. The third important lesson learned was that
the targets for measuring financial performance should be der!.ved from
concepts which are fully understood and accepted by both parties and
operational methodologies for calculating these targets should be clearly
defined during appraisal and agreed during negotiations. As a result of this
lesson and to avoid any misunderstanding, the financial covenants for the
Fourth Power Project were appropriately drafted and discussed in depth with
EEA during appraisal and negotiations. EEA is currently in compliance with
these covenants. The fourth important lesson learned was that executing
agencies should give more attention to the interaction between the activities
of the different contractors and agencies at site to ensure smooth performance
of critical activities at site. This was one of the reasons for complaints
about delays at the site by the contractor for civil works for Aswan II
hydropower station. To avoid such a situation, EEA intends to appoint the
engineering consultant for the project early (by the end of March 1992) to
coordinate the activities of the contractors and other agencies at site.
Further, care would be taken during preparation of the bidding documents to
clearly spell out, as far as possible, such interface activities in the
bidding documents.

1II. THE BORRONqER
A. Background
3.01        The borrower of the proposed loan would be the Egyptian
Electricity Authority (EEA).
3.02        Until 1964, generation, transmission and distribution of
electricity in Egypt was in the hands of governmernt, municipal and private
organizations. In 1964, the Ministry of Electricity was formed in accordance
with the Law No. 60 of 1963, consolidating all of the generation, transmission
and distribution facilities under one state-controlled organization. In 1965,
Presidential Decree No. 3726 was issued establishing the General Egyptian
Electricity Corporation (GEEC) to: own and operate public power systems; plan
power system expansion; and execute the required generation, transmission and
distribution projects for the country. In 1971, the Rural Electrification
Authority (REA) was created to plan and supervise the construction of rural
electrification projects. Operation and construction of power system
facilities were in the hands of CEEC and REA until in early 1976 Law
No. 12/1976 was passed creating EEA which superseded GEEC'. In addition, Law
No. 27/1976 was passed in 1976 redefining the organizational structure of REA.
In the same year two more authorities -- Nuclear Power Plants Authority and
Qattara Depression Authority (now HPPEA) -- were established in the power
subsector.
3.03        In 1978, the organizational structure of EEA was changed by a
Cabinet Decree of March 6, 1978 with the creation of seven Electricity
Distribution Companies (EDCs) as subsidiaries of EEA. The EDCs were formed to
take over distribution of electricity while EEA provided certain specific
services to EDCs such as research, training, foreign borrowing and
procurement, long-range planning and major maintenance assistance. The EDCs
commenced operation in 1979 without adequate preparation for transfer of
authority inevitably causing some disruption in operations. This
unsatisfactory situation continued till 1983 when by Law No. 97 of 1983 EDA
was created and made responsible to oversee the operations of EDCs. EEA now
is responsible for generation and transmission of electricity while EDA with
EDCs is responsible for electrical distribution activities within Egypt.
B. Organization
3.04        Annex 3.1 gives the organization chart for EEA.  EEA is a
government-owned enterprise regulated by MEE. It is managed by the Chairman
of the Board of Directors and assisted: (i) at the headquarters by five Deputy
Chairmen (planning, project construction, operation, finance and
administration); and (ii) in the field by Presidents of seven zones (Cairo,
I/ Since EEA was not established under Law 97, it does not fall within the
scope of public enterprises reforms envisaged under the SAL.



19 -
Alexandria, Canal, Middle Delta, West Delta, North Upper and South Upper
Egypt). In FY90, EEA had five zones; however, in view of increasing activity
in Delta and Upper Egypt zones, EEA split the Delta zone into Middle and West
Delta zones, and the Upper Egypt zone into North Upper and South Upper Egypt
zones.
3.05        EEA needs to further improve its administration systems,
delegation of authority and coordination between its various disciplines,
especially between technical and financial sections in the matters related to
the planning. With the assistance from UNDP under the Data Bank Program, LEA
has acquired office equipment for introduction of MIS (para. 2.14). However,
except for certain technical planning and operation functions, adequate use of
the facilities provided under the program has not been made. The proposed
project would provide technical assistance for improving EEA financial and
cost accounting systems and for training its staff in cost analysis techniques
which are essential for reducing operating expenses.
3.06        Currently, EEA has about 37,800 employees, of which about 65
percent are technicians and craftsmen, 12 percent are engineers and chemists,
and the balance of 23 percent are service and clerical staff. EEA carried out
a manpower and training management study (April 1990) to review the surplus
staff position. According to the findings of the study, by PF99, EEA would
have a staff of about 47,100 out of which about 66 percent would be
technicians and craftsmen, 13 percent would be engineers and chemists, and the
balance of 21 percent would be service and clerical staff. At present, one
out of nine employees is employed at the headquarters and this represents a
high ratio that EEA is trying to reduce by decentralization of activities and
delegation of asponsibilities.
3.07        EEA was successful in attracting participation of cofinanciers for
establishment of training centers at Cairo North (Bank), Cairo South (Bank,
USAID and Canada), Abu Qir (Bank), Fayid (Germany), Talkha (Japan) and Aswan
(Sweden). EEA aims at establishing additional training centers in the newly
created zones (para. 3.04) and expanding scope of activities in the existing
training centers. A few of the important ongoing training activities are:
transmission training facility, funded by CIDA, Canada, scheduled for
completion by December 1991; Abu Qir and Attaq power plant training
simulators, funded by the Bank under the Vocational Training Project,
scheduled for completion by December 1992; management development project,
funded by USAID, scheduled for completion by the end of 1994; and live-line
training project funded by France, scheduled for completion by December 1992.
In addition, EEA sends its staff for training overseas under various supply
and erect contracts for power stations, and transmission lines and
substations.
C. EEA Existing Facilities
3.08        The power subsector in Egypt has grown substantially compared to
1952 when the power demand was only 110 MW. In FY91, the maximum demand of
UPS was about 7,100 MW. In FY91, EEA had: (i) an installed generation
capacity of 11,707 MW in its UPS distributed in three hydropower stations,



v 20 -
14 thermal steam power stations, and 21 combustion turbine and combined cycle
power stations; (ii) an installed capacity of about 119 MW in its isolated
system distributed in 11 combustion turbine/thermal power stations and ore
diesel power plant; (iii) 1,594 km of 500-kV, 4,720 km of 220-kV, 2,200 km of
132-kV and 4,470 km of 66-kV transmission lines; and (iv) substation
capacities of 5,280 MVA at 500-kV, 12,430 MVA at 220-kV and 2,736 MVA at 132-
kV. In FY91, EEA generated about 44,254 GWh of electricity and had
electricity sales of about 39,529 GWh.
3.09        During FY85-91, EEA assets increased about six-fold from LE 1,731
million to LE 10,035 million. Its electricity sales during the same period
increased by about six-fold from LE 288 million to LE 1,711 million.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.    oiect Oiin and Obiective
4.01        Project Origin.  To meet future demand for electricity, EEA, in
1984, initiated a feasibility study (funded by USAID) for Kureimat coal-fired
thermal power station with a net installed capacity of 1,200 MW. Given the
high petroleum prices in 1984 and the uncertainty of availability of natural
gas for power generation, coal was the natural choice for the future power
stations in Egypt. The consultants, Stone & Webster (S & W) completed the
study in December 1985. However, the fall in petroleum prices in early 1986
and the incentives to the drilling companies given under the new "gas clause"
approved by the Egyptian Parliament in early 1988, changed the Government's
views regarding availability of natural gas for power generation. The
Government/EEA approved the Damietta and Cairo South combined cycle power
stations, and conversion to combined cycle of the existing combustion turbines
at Talkha, Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stations. EEA also, through USAID
funding, carried out a supplemental study with the objective of evaluating
future availability of natural gas for power generation and appropriately
modifying the feasibility study for Kureimat power station. The study
indicated restricted availability of natural gas for use in power stations.
In view of this, and environmental limitations imposed by use of fuel oil
alone for the power station, the consultants revised the feasibility study in
June 1989. The revised study, which compared the costs of installing a fuel
oil, gas, coal and combined- cycle power station at each of the five potential
sites' (Annex 4.1, para. 2), recommended installation of a dual fuel (fuel
oil and natural gas) fired thermal power plant at Kureimat as the lowest-cost
solution for meeting the future demand in FY96-97.
4.02        Proiect Objectives.  The project objectives are to assist EEA in:
(a) alleviating power shortages; (b) meeting the growing demand for
electricity; (c) improving the efficiency and reliability of the EEA
interconnected system; (d) strengthening the EEA financial position; and
1/ The five potential sites considered being: (a) the four inland sites of
Attaq, Cairo Nlorth, Gamasa, Mit Ghamr and Kureimat; and (b) Gamasa located on
the Mediterranean coast in the North Delta region.

(e) stm.-ngthening the institutional capabilities by improving technical and
managerial skills of EEA staff.
B. Rationale for Bank Involvement
4.03        The Bank's country assistance strategy gives high priority for
lending to the energy sector, considering the sector's effect on balance of
payments and GDP growth. Rapid development of electricity and natural gas
production is the key to supporting development of production sector in a
sustainable way. However, given the low domestic energy prices (paras. 1.11
and 2.07), the Bank lending in the energy sector is designed to support energy
pricing reforms to achieve economic levels (paras. 1.12 and 2.17). With the
approval of IMF Stand-by (May 1991) and SAL (June 1991), the Government is
committed to increase the petroleum, natural gas and electricity prices to
economic levels (para. 1.12) by FY95. The Bank's involvement in this project
and the power subsector enables the Bank to: (i) assist the Government in
increasing the weighted average electricity price to attain LRMC costs by
FY95; (ii) ensure rational least-cost investments in power subsector;
(iii) help the Government to mobilize foreign financial resources for power
subsector development through effective cofinancing; and (iv) ensure, through
technical assistance, efficient institutional development of EEA which is a
prerequisite for ensuring efficient and reliable supply of electricity -- an
essential infrastructure for stimulating growth of non-oil exports to improve
Egypt's economy.
C. Proiect Description
4.04        The project would consist of the following components:
(i) The supply and installation of a dual fuel-fired (fuel oil and
natural gas) thermal power station with a net installed capacity
of 1,200 MW at Kureimat located on the east bank of the river
Nile, about 95 km south of Cairo in the Giza Governorate.
(ii) The supply of material and equipment for about 162 km of a
20-inch diameter natural gas pipeline (including a pressure
reducing and metering station) interconnecting the power station
with the gas grid.
(iii) The supply and installation of: (a) about 150 km of 500-kV
transmission lines interconnecting the power station to UPS; (b)
about 90 km of 220-kV transmission lines to assist EEA in
transmission of power to the load centers; (c) the equipment for
rehabilitation of the Tanta 220-kV/66-kV substation located in the
Delta zone and thereby assisting EEA in improving the reliability
of its electrical transmission system; and (d) the line loss
reduction equipment (capacitors) with a total capacity of about
500 MVAR for improving the efficiency of transmission of power
from power stations to the load centers.



- 22 -
(iv) technical assistance for the: (a) preconstruction and
construction phase engineering consultancy services;
(b) consultancy services for training of EEA staff and procurement
of training equipment; (c) consultancy services and equipment for
electricity/energy data bank and provision of software and
hardware required for project management system; (d) consultancy
services and hardware and software for implementation of a
computerized financial management system with a special emphasis
on implementation of an effective cost control management system;
and (e) procurement of about 1,000 special meters for introduction
of an efficient load management system.
A full description of the four project components is provided in Annex 4.1.
4.05        Compnent X.  Kureimat power station would have:  (a) two steam
turbine generators each of 600 MW net capacity with auxiliaries and peripheral
facilities; (b) two steam generators (boilers) with auxiliaries and having
full load capability using either natural gas or fuel oil; (c) fuel oil and
natural gas handling system; (d) water and wasta treatment plants, electrical
switchyard and miscellaneous electrical facilities; (e) mechanical piping and
miscellaneous mechanical equipment; (f) circulating (cooling) water system;
and (g) buildings, service and maintenance facilities, colony and other civil
works. Assuming a 50:50 fuel mix, the power station would annually consume
about 936 million m3 of natural gas and about 0.9 million tons of fuel oil to
generate 7,730 GWh of electricity. The make up and circulating water
requirements of the power station and colony would be met from the Nile river.
Fuel oil requirements for the power station would be met from the 14-inch oil
pipeline (from Mostorod refinery to Beni Suef) which runs by the Kureimat
site. Component II covers the requirements for supply of natural gas to the
Kureimat site.
4.06        Component II.  Natural gas to the power station would be supplied
by tapping (at Zafarana) the existing Ras Shokir-Port Said natural gas
pipeline running along the Gulf of Suez coast. The component provides for
supply of material and equipment for the installation of about 162 km of a 20-
inch diameter natural gas pipeline from Zafarana to the Kureimat power station
site. In addition, the component includes the cost of the equipment for
pressure reducing and metering station to be located at the power station
site. For reasons given in para. 4.09, the installation of the pipeline is
considered reserved procurement and is excluded from the component.
4.07        Component III.  With the additions of new generation capacity and
increase in demand for power, the EEA interconnected system needs to be
strengthened. In addition, some of the equipment in the substations needs to
be replaced/rehabilitated. Accordingly, the component provides for: (a) about
150 km of 500-kV transmission lines to interconnect Kureimat power station to
UPS; (b) about 90 km of 220-kV transmission lines (Tanta-Kalyobea and Abu
Sultan-Manayef) to transmit electrical power to che load centers which cater
for the consumer demand for electricity; (c) rehabilitation of Tanta
substation and replacement of the existing low-capacity switchgear at the
substation with that of a higher capacity to meet the increased power



- 23 -
requirements in the Delta zone; and (d) installation of ebout 120 capacitor
banks, with a total capacity of about 500 MVAR at about 50 substations in the
UPS, to assist EEA in improving efficiency of transmission of power from power
stations to the load centers.
4.08         Component IV.  The component includes preconstruction and
construction phase engineering consultancy services (1,500 foreign and 1,000
local expert-months), funded by USAID, to assist EEA in timely procurement,
installation and commissioning of equipment at the power station site. In
addition, the engineering consultant would be responsible for procurement,
installation, operation and maintenance of the equipment at environmental
monitoring station to be established at the power station site for taking
meteorological measurements and measurements of background pollution at the
site for a period of at least one year during the preconstruction phase (Annex
4.7, para. 8). In addition, the engineering consultants would also be
responsible for measurements regarding the physical conditions at the site and
the hydrology of the Nile river.   To minimize the risk of not achieving the
financial targets in future and to keep the future tariff increases to the
minimum (paras. 1.14 and 1.16), EEA needs to minimize its operating expenses
by controlling costs. Accordingly, consultancy services (about 100 expert-
monthls) are provided under the component for assisting EEA in implementation
of computerized financial management system with a special emphasis on
effective cost control systems. EEA has the basic equipment for MIS system
(para. 2.14). However, the introduction of MIS system has been delayed. The
component provides for about 10 expert-months of consultancy services, and
hardware and software to cover EEA's immediate needs for introducing MIS and
project management systems. With the increase in electricity tariffs, EEA
proposes to procure about 1,000 meters for introduction of special tariffs for
major industrial consumers and EDCs which obtain bulk supply of electricity
from EEA at various points (para. 2.03). The procurement of special meters
would also assist EEA in implementing load management measures. The
supplemental loan for the Third Power Project provided funds for the first
phase of training EEA staff and trainers in instrumentation and controls which
is an important feature of a modern power station. In addition, the component
provides for: (i) about 12 expert-months of consultancy services and 60
trainee-months of training overseas of EEA staff under the second phase of
training of EEA staff and trainers in instrumentation and controls; and (ii)
training equipment for the training center to be established at Minia in the
North Upper Egypt Zone.
D. Implementing Agencies
4.09         EEA would be the implementing agency for components I, III and IV
while EGPC would be the implementing agency for the component II (natural gas
pipeline). The cost of material and equipment for the natural gas pipeline is
included in the project cost. However, the project cost excludes the cost of
installation of the pipeline (which is considered as reserved procurement)
since EGPC would follow its normal practice of awarding the installation
contract to PETROJET, a company under its control. Therefore, even though the
installation cost is not included in the project cost, it is included in the
total financing required for the project (Table 4.1). The natural gas



- 24 -
pipeline, which is essential for assuring timely and adequate supply of
natural gas for the project, would be wholly owned and operated by EGPC.
Therefore, EEA would enter into a subsidiary loan agreement (para. 4.12) for
onlending the Bank funds to EGPC for the cost of material and equipment
required for the installation of the pipeline. The financial performance of
EGPC, carried out under the Gas Investment Project approved by the Board in
June 1991, is given in Section VI, Finance (EGPC).
E. Cost Estimates
4.10        The total project cost, excluding interest during construction
(about US$119.3 million), is estimated to be about US$1,260.9 million of which
about 79 percent amounting to about US$1,000.1 million is in foreign exchange.
An exchange rate of 1 US$ - LE 3.33 as of July 1, 1991, has been used for
converting base costs and physical contingencies from one currency to another.
However, calculation of the total project cost (including contingencies) has
been based on the assumption that purchasing power parity would be maintained
over the project implementation period. A summary of the cost estimates for
the project is given below in Table 4.1 and detailed in Annex 4.2.

The cost estimates are based on experience with recent contracts for similar
equipment and are considered to be reasonable for this type of project. The
cost estimates include duties and taxes paid to the Government by EEA.
Overall physical contingencies of 10 percent are added except for: (a) the
civil works for which about 15 percent physical contingencies have been added;
and (b) the consultancy services' portion of the technical assistance
component for which no physical contingencies are included. Price
contingencies have been added to the base cost plus physical contingencies on
the following annual inflation rate projections (based on the Bank estimates):
EEA's Fiscal Year    FY91  FY92  FY93  FY94  FY95  FY96  FY97  FY98  FY99
Costs expressed in:

It is estimated that about 1,620 foreign expert-months and 1000 local expert-
months are required for the consultancy services included in the technical
assistance component. The project cost includes duties and taxes amounting to
LE 215.7 million (about US$45.1 million).
F. Project Financing Plan
4.11         The financing plan for the project is summarized in Table 4.2
below. During negotiations, EEA informed that: (a) the agreement with the
African Development Bank (ADB) for a loan amount of about US$350 million was
signed on May 30, 1991; (b) the agreement with the Arab Fund for Economic and
Social Development (AFESD) for an amount of about US$125 million was signed on
June 13, 1991; (c) the agreement with the Saudi Government for a grant of
about US$50 million is effective; and (d) the first amendment to the grant
agreement with USAID for an amount of US$100 million for the Kureimat power
station signed in August 1990 is operative and the second amendment to the
grant agreement for an additional amount of US$100 million for the power
station was signed on September 9, 1991. Based on the above information, the
financing plan is given in Table 4.2 below. During negotiations. assurances
were obtained from the Egyptian delegation that EEA/EGPC would finance the
local currency cost of the project (US$266.8 million)', and the foreign
exchange requirements for: (i) project wrap-up insurance (US$7.6 million);
(ii) colony civil works (US$1.7 million); (iii) interest during construction
for the project (US$119.3 million); and (iv) any foreign exchange gap for the
project (currertly estimated at US$52.0 million) taking into account the
agreements reached with the cofinanciers. Assurances were also obtained from
the Government that it would take all necessary measures to enable EEA to
cover any financing gap.
1/ EEA/EGPC would generate adequate cash to cover the local currency cost of
US$266.8 million (about LE 1,272.6 million) of the project. In the event of
failure of EEA/EGPC to do so, it was agreed that the Government would cover
the shortfall in the local currency requirements of the project.

I/  Though USAID funding of US$200 million would be available for the project,
only the amount estimated for funding of USAID bid packages is included in
the financing plan.
G.  On-lending Arrangement
4.12        For reasons given in para. 4.09, the Bank funding for the natural
gas pipeline would be for supply of material and equipment for the pipeline
and would exclude the cost of installation of the pipeline. The pipeline
would be fully owned, operated and maintained by EGPC, and agreement has been
reached that the Borrower, EEA would enter into a subsidiary loan agreement
with EGPC for the on-lending of Bank funds for the cost of materials and
equipment required to construct the pipeline for supplying the required
quantity of natural gas to the power station (para. 4.34). EGPC would repay
the amount on-lent to it over a period not more than 20 years including a 5-
year grace period. The interest rate (currently at 7.73 percent), the
commitment charges and amounts of currencies in which debt service payments
would be made would be the same as paid by EEA to the Bank for the loan. EGPC
would also bear the foreign exchange risk with respect to the on-lent amount.
EGPC may, therefore, make debt service payments in:   (i) the same currency or
currencies in which EEA would make payments to the Bank; or (ii) the local
currency equivalents calculated at the time of making the debt service
payments. During negotiations. agreement was reached with the Egyptian
delegation that the signing of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to
the Bank, for the money on-lent by EEA to EGPC would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.
H. Procurement
4.13        All Bank-financed procurement for civil works, and the supply and
installation of materials and equipment would be according to the Bank's



- 28 -
Procurement Guidelines, Procurement of technical assistance services would
follow the Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants in Bank-financed projects.
4.14        The Bank fJ.nancing is proposed for the following 16 main bid
packages:
(a) supply of non-critical piping and valves and installation of
pump drives, feed water heaters, deaerators, condensers, waste and
water treatment system, piping and valves and other miscellaneous
equipment;
(b) supply of instruments and controls;
(c) supply and installation of training simulator;
(d) supply of gas piping, material, fittings and tools;
(e) supply of pressure reducing and metering equipment;
(f) supply of pipe coating material;
(g) supply and installation of Tanta substation rehabilitation
equipment;
(h) supply of 220-kV transmission line materials;
(i) supply of line loss reduction equipment;
(j) supply and installation of data bank/MIS equipment;
(k) & (1) supply of training and load management equipment;
(m), (n) & (o) consultancy services for training, data
bank/MIS and financial management systems; and
(p) training overseas of EEA staff.
Except for small value items under packages (a), (g), (j) and (k),
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures, according to the Bank's
Procurement Guidelines, would be followed for packages (a) through (1). For
procurement of goods under ICB, bidders offering domestically manufactured
goods and satisfying the criteria for the margin of preference, would receive
a margin of preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF price of the
imported goods offered by the competing bidders or the prevailing customs duty
applicable to the non-exempt importers, whichever is less. Procurement of
technical assistance services under packages (m), (n) and (o) would follow the
Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers.
4.15        International Shopping, according to the Bank's Procurement
Guidelines, would be followed for procurement of the small value items under
packages (a), (g), (j) and (k) for: (i) valves and tees and special pipe
joints required for piping supply and erection; (ii) instruments, relays and



- 29 -
testing equipment required for rehabilitation of the Tanta substation; and
(iii) tools and instruments for training and data bank/MIS equipment.
Procurement following International Shopping Procedures would involve
obtaining at least three price offers for the required goods from at least two
eligible source countries and would be limited to US$70,000 per contract and
US$500,000 in aggregate.
4.16        Direct contracting following Bank's Procurement Guidelines would
be followed for obtaining relays, instruments, recorders required to match
existing equipment at the Tanta substation proposed for rehabilitation under
package (g), para. 4.14. Total foreign exchange expenditure under this
procedure would be limited to about US$100,000.
4.17        EEA would follow its own bidding procedures for award of contract
(financed by EEA) for the installation of material for transmission lines
procured under item (h), para. 4.14. Similar arrangement is being followed
for the transmission line component under the ongoing Fourth Power Project.
As regards items (i) and (1), para. 4.14 (line loss and load management
equipment), EEA staff has the necessary experience and would install the
equipment. In view of the scattered nature of the works, the proposed
arrangement is satisfactory.
4.18        As mentioned in para. 4.09, EGPC would award contract to PETROJET
(a company controlled by EGPC) for installation of the natural gas pipeline
material and equipment procured under packages (d), (e) and (f) which are
funded by the Bank. PETROJET has been installing natural gas pipelines and
has a good track record for the quality of work and timely completion of the
job. Since EGPC would be directly awarding the contract for installation of
the pipeline to PETROJET without inviting offers from other firms, the
installation contract for the pipeline is considered as reserved procurement
and does not form part of the project.
4.19        All documents relating to the procurement of Bank-financed
consultancy services would be subject to the Bank's prior review. All bidding
packages for works and goods estimated to cost US$300,000 equivalent or more
would be subject to the Bank's prior review of the bid packages. These limits
would result in prior review of about 99 percent of the loan amount. Other
contracts for works and goods would be subject to the Bank's review after
award of the contracts. In view of the importance of proper installation of
the mechanical system for efficient and reliable operation of the power
station, prequalification procedure according to the Bank's procurement
guidelines would be followed for the bid package (a) supply and installation
of piping and mechanical equipment. Similarly because of the explosive nature
of the gas handled by the natural gas pipeline, it is essential that the
quality of material and equipment procured for the pipeline is assured.
Therefore, it was agreed with EEA/EGPC that prequalification procedure
according to the Bank's Guidelines would be followed for the bid packages (d),
(e) and (f). Detailed project cost tables (Annex 4.2) provide the local and
foreign cash flow for the bid packages. The procurement timetable for the
project is given in the project implementation schedule (Annex 4.4). The
details of the implementing agencies are given in Section III, and paras. 1.18
and 4.09. Both the implementing agencies (EEA and EGPC) have adequate



. 30
experience of Bank-funded projects. ERA is famlliar with the technology used
in the project and has had 300-MW units in operation in its system since 1985.
The 600-MW unit size is being introduced for the first time in EEA's system.
Therefore, to reduce the risk of implementation delays, EEA would be assisted
during the preconstruction and construction phases of the project by an
engineering consultants  (funded by USAID)  who would provide procurement
assistance to EEA from preparation of the bid documents to award of the
contracts. EGPC has adequate experience in preparation of the bid documents
for the natural gas pipeline and installation of the pipelines; therefore, no
assistance is needed for implementation of Component II for which EGPC is the
implementing agency.

local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for supply and installation
of the mechanical piping/erection, training simulator, substation
rehabilitation and Data Bank/MIS equipment contracts;
(b) 100 percent of the foreign (c.i.f.) expenditures and 100
percent of the local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for supply of
instrumentation and controls, natural gas pipeline material and
equipment, transmission line material, loss reduction equipment
and training and load management equipment contracts;
(c) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures for training, Data
Bank/MIS and financial management consultancy services;
(e) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures for overseas training
of EEA staff; and
(f) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures and 100 percent of the
local expenditures (ex-factory cost) for supply of small value
items procured for mechanical/piping, substation rehabilitation,
training equipment and Data Bank/MIS equipment contracts awarded
tollowing international shopping/direct contracting procedures.
4.22        The disbursement schedule (Annex 4.3) follows the EMENA (MENA and
ECA) power sector profile modified to take into account advance payment made
while opening of the Special Account. In order to enable EEA to effectively
implement the project and to ensure prompt payments to the contractors and
consultants, the Bank would advance funds as needed to a Special Account, to
be opened at a commercial bank in Egypt for a maximum amount of US$9.0
million, which is expected to cover the Bank's share of eligible expenditure
over a period of four months. Payments from the Special Account would only be
made for eligible expenditures indicated in the loan agreements. The account
would be denominated in US dollars and replenished against withdrawal
applications of at least US$500,000. Applications with appropriate supporting
documentation should be submitted when approximately half of the maximum
allocated amount of the Account has been spent or quarterly, whichever occurs
first. Disbursements under the project would be made against standard
documentation except for contracts of US$50,000 equivalent or less, which
would be claimed under Statements of Expenditures (SOE). Related supporting
documents for SOE claims would be retained at EEA's headquarters and made
1/  The Disbursement Tetter to be furnished by the Bank to EEA would propose
that until the Special Account is in operation, EEA would submit to the Bank,
to the extent possible, withdrawal application each for a minimum amount of
US$220,000 equivalent.

available for inspection by the Bank missions and project auditors. The Loan
Closing Date would be June 30, 1999.
J. Project Status and Implementation
4.23        En2ineerine Consultancy Services.  The preconstruction and
construction phase engineering consultancy services are funded by USAID
(para. 4.08). EEA has evaluated the offers from the short-listed consultants
and the award of contract for engineering consultancy services is scheduled
before the end of March 1992. The consultants would provide assistance to EEA
for activities related to procurement, supervision during construction and
comamissioning of the power station and 500-kV transmission lines, and supply
and installation of environmental monitoring equipment (para.4.08). Further,
during negotiations, EEA agreed that the consultants would take measurements
of background pollution at regular intervals and submit, to the Bank, semi-
annual reports regarding their findings. The background pollution
measurements are scheduled to be started by March 1993, the first semi-annual
report is due by October 1993 and the final report would be submitted by the
consultants by March 1994. EEA would ensure that the consultant's reports are
submitted to the Bank semi-annually. During negotiations. assurances were
obtained from EEA that it would continue to employ engineering consultants
throughout the project implementation period for pre-construction,
constructi,n and commissionine services. EEA, through its Deputy Chairman for
Projects, would be responsible for the engineering services required for the
220-kV transmission lines and 220-kV/66-kV substation rehabilitation and
installation of the line loss reduction equipment at the substations. The
Vice Chairman, Natural Gas, EGPC would be responsible for the procurement and
installation activities under Component II.
4.24        Consultancv Services for Proiect Management System and Data
Bank/MIS. The consultancy services for Data Bank/MIS and project management
system would provide supplemental. assistance in implementation of MIS system
funded by UNDP (para. 2.14), and would include assistance to EEA in
preparation of bid documents, evaluation of offers received and award of
contract for the equipment, hardware and software required for the system.
4.25        Project Management.  The Deputy Chairman for Projects located at
EEA headquarters would be responsible for Components I, III, engineering
consultancy services under Component IV and overall coordination with EGPC,
the implementing agency for Component II. The day-to-day construction
activities in the field would be the responsibility of: (a) the President,
North Upper Egypt Zone, assisted by the power station superintendent for
Kureimat power station and the 500-kV transmission line interconnection with
UPS; and (b) the Presidents of Middle Delta and 'lest Delta Zones for the
transmission lines and substation rehabilitation under Component III located
within their zonal boundaries. The Deputy Chairman for Studies, Research and
Planning located at EEA headquarters would be responsible for the Data
Bank/MIS system and load management subcomponents under component IV. The
Deputy Chairman for Administration Manpower and Training would be respons'ble
for the training subcomponent under component IV. The Deputy Chairman for
Finance would be responsible for the activities associated with the



- 34 -
consultancy services for computerized financial management with a special
emphasis on cost control systems. These arrangements have been employed by
EEA for the previous Bank-financed projects and are satisfactory.
4.26         Land Acquisition.  EEA has acquired about 840,000 m2 (about
200 faddans) of land required fol the power station and the colony out of
which about 210,000 m2 of land along the river was occupied by about
96 farmers for cultivation. There is no relocation of people involved.
During negotiations, EEA confirmed that it has followed the law of the country
for expropriation of private property for public purposes in acquiring the
agricultural land for the power station. EEA deposited with the Egyptian
Survey Authority (ESA) the amount of about LE 950,000 determined by ESA as
necessary to compensate all 96 farmers for the agricultural land acquired for
the power station. The law requires that: (i) the decree to acquire the land
be issued by the Prime Minister; (ii) the compensation be determined according
to the fair market value of the land being acquired; and (iii) the amount so
determined (by ESA) be open for judicial review. Further, ESA has issued a
public notification regarding the compensation on December 14, 1991 giving a
period of two months for receiving any objections for payment of compensation
to 96 farmers. Soon after the expiry (on February 14, 1992) of the two-month
waiting period required by Egyptian law to ensure that the compensation is
paid to the lawful occupiers of the land, ESA expects to complete the payments
to the farmers. In addition, EEA has agreed to abide by the court decision in
the event of any complaint (against the compensation) lodged by any farmer
whose agricultural land has been acquited for the power station. Further, EEA
has agreed to give priority for employment of the farmers or their children
for works at the power station site and has agreed to let the farmers raise
crops on the land till the portion of the land is required for the
construction activity at the site.
4.27          Switchyard.  Bids for the power station switchyard (funded by
Saudi Arabia) were received in April 1991 and contract award finalized on
August 25, 1991.
4.28         Environmental Impact Assessment Report (EIAR.  The EIAR summary
furnished by the borrower was submitted to the Board on July 11, 1991 and the
final report incorporating the comments of the Bank, USAID and EEA was found
to be satisfactory to the Bank.
4.29         Proiect Implementation Schedule.  The project implementation
schedule is given in Annex 4.4. The project is scheduled for completion by
June 30, 1997. Annex 4.5 gives the broad reporting requirements for
monitoring the project. These requirements would assist EEA in: (i)
providing the Bank with monthly and semi-annual progress reports based on the
outline agreed during negotiations; and (ii) monitoring key performance
indicators such as auxiliary consumption and fuel consumption rate in its
power stations, availability and capacity factors of the generating units,
transmission line losses and quality of service. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with EEA regarding the proposed reporting arrangements.

K. Proiect Supervision Plan
4.30        The Bank would normally supervise the project twice a year.  The
core team for the mission would comprise a power engineer and a financial
analyst.  The core team would be supplemented, as necessary, by:   an
economist; a technical expert in generation, transmission and distribution;
and an expert in environmental management. About 14 supervision missions are
scheduled during the project implementation period and the total supervision
effort is estimated to require an average of 10 staffweeks per year. Annex
4.6 gives the tentative supervision plan.
L. Environmental Aspects
4.31        The project falls under the environmental screening category "A".
The environmental issues involved relate to: (a) compensation to the farmers
for the agricultural land acquired for the project; (b) establishment of an
Environmental Management Unit (EMU) at the power station site to ensure
compliance with the environmental mitigation measures during preconstruction,
site preparation, construction and operational activities related to the power
station, natural gas supply and transmission lines; (c) land use; (d) water
use and quality; (e) waste and water treatment; (f) stack emissions; (g)
ambient air quality; (h) noise pollution; and (i) natural gas pipeline and
transmission line corridors. The issues are discussed in detail in the EIAR
and are summarized in Annex 4.7. The proposed site was selected after
comparing the economics and environmental aspects of five sites. Kureimat
site, which is located in a relatively undeveloped area, has a minimal
floodplain and was found to be environmentally acceptable provided certain
steps mentioned in paragraphs below are observed.
4.32        Land Use.  No resettlement issues are involved and EEA has
compensated the 96 farmers whose agricultural land has been acquired for the
project according to the law of the country (para. 4.26). It is estimated
that a staff of about 530 would be required for the operation and maintenance
of the power station. Considering that some of the unskilled staff would
reside in the nearby villages, a colony comprising 418 housing units has been
provided. Since adequate public services are not available in the nearby
villages, provision has been made for facilities such as: telephone, telegram
and post offLne; police and fire station; nursery and primary school;
commercial aL. shopping center, and religious and recreational centers;
utilities and transportation units; and colony administration unit.
Offices of EEA and its contractors would be located at the power station site.
Housing for the construction force, estimated at 3,000 during the peak of the
construction period, would be located within or adjacent to the colony site.
4.33        Water Use and quality.  The water requirements for the power
station and the colony would be drawn from the Nile river. Currently, the
controlled seasonal river flows passing the Kureimat site vary from about
52,000 to 97,200 m: per minute. The water requirement for the power station
and the colony are of two types: (a) circulating water required for
condensers which condense the exhaust steam from the steam turbines into
water; and (b) water required for boiler make-up, plant services and the



36 -
colony. The circulating water drawn from the river flows through the
condensers and picks up the heat from the exhaust steam (and in the process
increases its temperature by about 100C above the inlet water temperature)
before being discharged in the river. Thus, the quantity of 2,400 m3 per
minute required for the circulating water is a non-consumptive use of the
river water. Circulating water discharged in the river forms a thermal plume
in the river with a surface temperature of about 30C above the ambient water
temperature. Even under the worst-case scenario in summer (on occasions
during August through October), the surface temperature of water would not
exceed 350C and would be within the limits acceptable to the Bank and as laid
down by the Government under its Decree No. 8 of 1983 concerning Law No. 48 of
1982 issued by the Ministry of irrigation. To avoid fouling of the condenser
tube surfaces with marine organisms, the river water prior to circulation
through the condensers would be chlorinated. The reaction time for the
chlorine in the circulating water flowing through the condensers is adequate
to decompose the chlorine so that the residual chlorine content in the
circulating water discharged in the river would be well within the Bank
guidelines of 0.3 mg/liter. About half of (2 to 5 m3 per minute) the water
Xecuired for the boiler make-up, plant services and the colonv is used up
while the balance, 1 to 2.5 m3 per minute, is discharged into the river after
being processed through the waste treatment system. The service water,
potable water and boiler make-up water would be appropriately treated. The
wastewater from the plant would be processed in the wastewater treatment
system, and the impurities in the treated and clarified effluent would be
within the limits stipulated by the Bank guidelines.
4.34        Stack Emissions - NOSO >and Particulate.  The basic stack
emission standards relate to nitrogen oxides (NO,), sulphur oxides (SO,) and
particulate (dust). The boilers would be dual fuel-fired (natural gas and
fuel oil) and would be provided with appropriate NO, control equipment. The
boilers would be provided with individual 126 m tall stack. The environmental
assessment indicates that with proper NO, measures being taken during the
boiler design and drafting of the bid specifications for boilers, it is
possible to burn fuel oil or natural gas alone in the boilers without
exceeding the Bank stipulated NO, limits of 86 nanograms/joule for natural gas
and 130 nanograms/joule for fuel oil. As regards SO, limitations, burning
natural gas in the boiler poses no problem; however, to be within the
stipulated limits for SO, emissions, sulphur content in the fuel oil should
not exceed 3.3 percent. Normally, the sulphur content of fuel oil in Egypt is
about 2.5 percent and the Bank stipulation regarding SO, emissions of
500 mt/day for unpolluted areas like Kureimat plant site would not pose any
problem. As regards particulate emissions, burning of 100 percent natural gas
in the boilers does not pose any problem; however, burning of 100 percent fuel
oil in the boilers would result in particulate emissions (comprising fuel ash,
fuel additives, acid mist, unburned carbon and soot) of about 252 mg/Nm3 and
would exceed the Bank guidelines of 150 mg/Nm3 for the Kureimat plant site
located in rural area with a low level of background dust pollution.
Therefore, to keep the particulate emissions from the stacks within limits, at
least 40 percent or more of the fuel used in boilers in the power station
should be natural gas and the balance of 60 percent or less being fuel oil
with a maximum sulphur content of 2.5 percent. Taking into account likely



- 37 -
variation of sulphur in fuel oil supplied for the power station, EGPC has
assured EEA that it would supply natural gas to the Kureimat power station to
cover 50 percent of the fuel requirement, of about 3 million ma per day, for
the lifetime of the Kureimat power station. During negotiations, the Egyptian
delegation agreed to incorporate a clause in the subsidiary loan agreement
(para. 4.12) to be signed by EEA with EGPC, requiring EGPC to supply natural
gas to the power station to cover at least 50 percent of the fuel
requirements, estimated at 3 million m3 per day, for the lifetime of the power
station. In addition, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from EEA
that it would keep adequate space (during boiler design) for installation of
particulate collecting devices such as electrostatic precipitators which would
be needed for compliance with the environmental standards, in case due to
circumstances beyond the control of EGPC, adequate quantities of natural gas
may not be available for the power station in future.
4.35        Ambient Air Quality and Noise Pollution.  A mathematical
dispersion model was used to predict the potential air quality impact of
Kureimat power station stack emissions. The results indicate that even under
the worst-case scenario of burning fuel oil to cover 100 percent fuel required
for the power station, the NO,, SO, and particulate standards of the Bank, the
Ministry of Health and the United States Environmental Protection Agency are
fully complied with (para. 8 of Annex 4.7). Noise pollution from the project
would originate from the construction activities and activities during
operation and maintenance of the power station. The greatest impact of noise
pollution would be on the nearest village of Mimone situated about one
kilometer from the power station site. Agreement was reached with EEA that
during the engineering design stage care would be taken to ensure that the
power station equipment meets the Bank's guidelines for acceptable noise
levels in the power station. Further, the bid documents would stipulate
conditions requiring successful contractor to abide by the Bank's guidelines
for noise pollution while using construction equipment. In addition, the bid
documents would stipulate conditions regarding control of dust, and disposal
of waste and debris generated during the construction period. During
negotiations, EEA assured that it would take adequate measures during design,
construction and operation of the power plant to ensure compliance with the
environmental standards regarding stack emissions, ambient air quality, water
quality, effluent treatment, discharge of water in the river and noise
pollution at the Kureimat power station site.
4.36        Gas Pipeline and Transmission Line Corridors, and Use of PCB.  An
environmental screening of the natural gas pipeline and the transmission line
routes found that the corridors are environmentally acceptable. Agreement was
reached with EEA that, during installation of the gas pipeline and the
transmission lines, it would keep to the minimum adverse impact on
agricultural lands and other land resources. The Bank prohibits use of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in the Bank-funded projects and requires that
the borrower takes appropriate care during handling, dismantling and disposal
of old substation equipment that may contain PCB. During negotiations, EEA
agreed to comply with these requirements, and would take special care to
stipulate these requirements in the bid documents for procurement of equipment



- 38-
for rehabilitation of Tanta substation, transmission lines and capacitors for
reduction of transmission line losses.
4.37        Environmental Management Unit (EMU).  During negotiations,
agreement was reached with EEA for the establishment of EMU as an integral
part of the power station organization. The main duties and responsibilities
of the unit would be to design, implement and monitor: (i) an environmental
management plan including an emergency/contingency plan; (ii) a water and air
monitoring program; and (iii) a health and hazard safety plan. The unit would
be operational during preconstruction and construction phases and during
operation of the power station. In addition to the training provided by the
vendors of the environmental monitoring equipment and by the engineering
consultants responsible for taking measurements of background pollution at the
power station site (para. 4.23), USAID would be providing funding for training
of the unit personnel. In addition, during negotiations, EEA agreed to
establish EMU no later than December 31, 1992, so as to be operational during
the pre-construction phase of the power station and would continue to maintain
EMU during the life of the project. EEA would furnish to the Bank, for its
review, semi-annual progress reports regarding the establishment and
activities of the EMU.
'M. Women in Development
4.38        EEA encourages participation of women in the activities of the
power subsectors. The participation of women in the power subsector
activities is more in the urban areas than in the rural areas where social and
cultural influences limit their participation in the developmental activities.
Thus, out of the total staff of about 37,000 in FY90 about 12 percent were
women. However, if we compare the staff at EEA headquarters, out of a total
staff positions of about 4,200, about 38 percent were women. Figure 4.1 gives
the distribution of EEA headquarter staff by sex and by categories. It is
seen that about 40 percent of the technical positions at the headquarters were
occupied by women and at clerical level about 74 percent of the positions were
filled in by women. It is hoped that in future, with the economical and
social developments in the rural areas in Egypt, rural women would also have
an important role in the development of the power subsector in the country.

N. Risks
4.39        There are no major risks associated with the project.  Delays in
project implementation would have an adverse impact on the rate of return on
investment. The risk of project cost overruns is minimized since the project
cost estimates (including price contingencies) are spread over a period of
eight years, even though a similar project could be completed in five years.
Further, to reduce the risk of project implementation delays, the project
includes engineering consultancy services to assist EEA in procurement,
installation and commissioning activities under the project. To ensure that
the pollution from the power station is within the acceptable limits, the
subsidiary loan agreement to be signed by EEA with EGPC would include a clause
requiring EGPC to provide adequate quantities of natural gas cover at least 50
percent of the fuel requirement, estimated at 3 million m3 per day, for the
lifetime of the power station (para. 4.34). Further, EEA has agreed that in
the design of the boilers, adequate space would be kept for the installation
of particulate collecting devices to comply with environmental standards in
case ECPC is unable to supply the required quantity of natural gas to the
power station. In addition, the engineering consultants (to be appointed by
the end of March 1992) have been asked to provide equipment and services for
timely commencement of background pollution measurements at the site (para.



- 40 -
4.23). Further, to monitor the environmental matters, EEA has agreed to
establish an EMU at site (para. 4,37). EEA is familiar with the technology
used in the project and has 300 MW units in operation in the system since
1985. To ensure smooth introduction of the unit size of 600 MW (being
introduced for the first time) in the system, provision would be made in the
contracts of equipment suppliers to provide for offshore and onshore training
to EEA's staff that would operate the power station.
0. Project Action Plan
4.40        During appraisal agreement was reached on the principal
implementation arrangements, as described above, to ensure efficient
implementation of project and environmental management activities. During
negotiations, agreement was reached with EEA on an action plan, satisfactory
to the Bank, for timely completion of such activities. The following
paragraph summarizes the key actions included in the Action Plan.
4.41        Project Action Plan.  During negotiations, agreement was reached
with EEA that it would take the following measures in a timely manner to
implement the project and achieve its objectives:
(a) EEA would continue to employ engineering consultants throughout the
project implementation period for the activities related to the Kureimat
power station, and the 500-kV transmission lines interconnecting the
power station to the electrical system (para. 4.23);
(b) EEA shall cause the engineering consultant (scheduled to be
appointed by the end of March 1992) to: (i) install the pollution
monitoring equipment and start background pollution measurement by March
1993; (ii) furnish to the Bank, starting October 1993, semi-annual
reports on background pollution at the power station site; and (iii)
furnish to the Bank the final report on background pollution by March
1994 (para. 4.23);
(c) EEA would ensure, during engineering design of steam generators,
that adequate space is provided to for installation of particulate
collecting devices at a later date if required (para. 4.34);
(d) EEA would ensure that adequate measures are taken during design,
construction, operation and maintenance of equipment at the power
station to comply with the environmental standards regarding stack
emissions, ambient air quality, water quality, effluent treatment and
discharge of water in the river and noise pollution at the Kureimat
power station site (para. 4.35);
(e) EEA would ensure that the equipment procured for the transmission
lines and substations component of the project does not use PCB and the
contractor/EEA staff would take appropriate care regarding handling,
dismantling and disposal of old sub-station equipment that may contain
PCB (para. 4.36);



- 41 -
(f) EEA would establish, not later than December 31,1992, EMU as an
integral part of the power station and that the unit would be
operational during the life of the power station beginning with the pre-
construction phase. EEA would also assure that progress reports
covering the EMU activities are prepared and furnished to the Bank at
six-monthly intervals (para. 4.37); and
(g) EEA would maintain adequate records and reports necessary to monitor
the progress of the project and would submit to the Bank monthly and
semi-annual progress reports in a form satisfactory to the Bank
(para. 4.29).
V. FINANCE - EEA
A. Accounting and Management Information Systems
5.01        EEA financial, cost and management accounting systems fulfill
their role of recording, summarizing and communicating financial data
reasonably well. Further, the systems incorporate, at the minimum, internal
control features which are essential to ensure the integrity of financial data
and to facilitate the safeguarding of the utility's assets. Overall the
systems are reasonably satisfactory in comparison to utilities of similar size
in other developing countries, although some deficiencies do exist,
particularly with regard to the preparation of management reports, cost
accounting, and financial planning and budgeting. EEA has initiated actions
to improve: (a) management reporting through improvement of supporting
information systems; and (b) financial planning and budgeting through training
of its staff and acquisition of computers and computerization of some of its
accounting functions. Thus, under the UNDP Electricity and Data Bank Project,
whose primary focus is to strengthen the power subsector's capacity to plan
and manage its operations on the basis of accurate, relevant and timely data,
EEA manual cost accounting system was to be re-analyzed, modified in the light
of identified management needs and computerized. Financial planning software
and training in its use was to be provided to EEA staff. However, EEA manual
cost accounting system was partially computerized (extent of computerization
varies among zones) without any evaluation of its relevance and without any
modifications. Financial forecasting software was provided, but no training
was provided and EEA has so far not utilized the software. The Bank also
provided financing under Loan 1886-1-EGT for overseas training of 30 mid-
level, 10 top-level management staff and 1 trainer. EEA was fully satisfied
with the results of this training and has recently concluded another contract
for further training (financed under Loan 3103-EGT) of a new group of its
managers by the same consultant.
B. Financial Management
5.02        The main outstanding actions required to improve EEA accounting
and management systems include: (a) review, analysis and design modification
of existing financial and cost accounting systems; and (b) computerization of
the redesigned systems and of the loan management system. About US$1.2
million would be provided under this project to cover the foreign cost of



- 42 -
consultancy services for a thorough review of EEA existing financial and cost
accounting systems, modification and computerization of the systems and
training of a select group of EEA staff in modern cost analysis techniques and
preparation of management reports. The draft terms of reference for the
proposed consultancy services are provided in Annex 5.7. Computerization of
the loan management system is already under way and is being implemented by
EEA staff as part of a Government-wide program to improve the management of
external debt. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from EEA that it
would develop and implement a program to modify and computerize its cost and
financial accounting systems by December 31, 1994.
C. Auditing
5.03        EEA financial statements are audited by the Central Organization
for Auditing and Control (COAC). The auditing procedures are comprehensive
and generally acceptable to the Bank. In the past, submission of audited
financial statements to EEA Board of Directors and to the Bank (including
proforma consolidated statements of EEA and EDCs) has experienced delays, EEA
and the auditors attribute the delays to the volume of work involved and the
dispersion of accounting records in the zones and the Head Office relative to
the audit manpower available, A more important reason, however, lies in the
transaction-oriented approaches employed by the auditors with their emphasis
on verification of individual transactions instead of more modern audit
approaches which place more reliance on internal controls and statistical
analyses, COAC has informed the Bank that it is embarking on new training
programs for its staff which would enable COAC to adopt modern audit
techniques and thus improve its rate of audits completion. COAC considers
that it has adequate resources to implement these programs and that with their
completion, it would have both adequate capacity and expertise to handle its
workload without the need to subcontract (as suggested by the mission) a part
of it to private sector auditors. During processing of this project, a more
formalized audit planning process was agreed for FY91. As a result EEA
audited financial statements, including proforma consolidated statements of
EEA and EDCs, for FY91 were submitted to the Bank by the due date of December
31, 1991.  Further, during negotiations, assurances were obtained from EFA
that in future years these reports would be submitted to the Bank within six
months of the end of each fiscal year.
D. Insurance
5.04        EEA insures through a Government-owned corporation to cover such
risks normally covered by the Government and public utilities in Egypt, e.g.,
motor vehicles, materials and stores, However, EEA does not provide insurance
coverage against business risks normally covered by public utilities in other
countries, e.g., fire and machinery breakdown. It is necessary for EEA to
safeguard its assets, particularly the major generation assets against these
types of risks. For this purpose, EEA has agreed, with financing provided
under the Fourth Power Project (Loan 3103-EGT), to identify and quantify the
risks associated with its operations and to recommend the most appropriate
methods consistent with industry practice for minimizing and managing such
risks. EEA is currently in the process of obtaining offers from prospective



- 43 -
consultants for the insurance study. It was agreed, during negotiations, that
following completion of this study by December 31, 1992, and based on its
recommendations, EEA would gradually provide insurance coverage for its
assets, so as to ensure completion of the required coverage by June 30, 1996.
E. Recent and Present Financial Performance
5.05        EEA past financial performance (FY85 through FY90) is provided in
detailed financial statements provided in Annexes 5.1 through 5.6. The
principal features, tronds and causes of EEA financial performance during this
period are summarized below.
5.06        A number of primary profitability indicators which summarize EEA
recent and current financial performance are provided in Figure 5.1 below.
Annex 5.5 provides more detailed financial performance indicators. These
indicators are the net profit margin (NPM) arrived at after accounting for all
expenses including interest - net income as a percentage of sales revenue, net
profit margin before interest (NPBI), return on net worth (RNW), return on
fixed historical assets (RFA) and return on total historical assets (RTA).
The trend of these ratios over the years rather than their absolute values
does provide some indication of EEA profitability. The NPM is used here to
capture the operational efficiency of EEA investment, production, procurement,
pricing and financing decisions in one measure. The NPBI is used to assess
the operational efficiency of EEA and all other decisions with the exception
of the financing decision. The RNW, RFA and RTA are used to confirm the
findings derived from the NPM and NPBI analysis.

Figure 5.l
5.07        Four of the indicators, the NPM, the RNW, the RFA and the RTA
clearly show that EEA overall profit performance during the past six years
remained broadly unchanged despite the tariff and fuel price increases that



- 44 -
were implemented in this period. The other indicator, the NPBI, suggests that
there was an improvement in the operational efficiency, mainly due to
increases in electricity prices (para. 5.08).   However, as indicated by the
NPM indicator, the impact on overall profit performance was reduced by the
increases in interest expenses (para. 5.11). Further, the NPBI indicates that
some marginal gains did occur in terms of the total returns accruing to EEA
long-term stakeholders (shareholders and lenders), Thus, the NPBI increased
from 17.9 percent in FY85 to 25.1 percent in FY90. Since the RNW indicates
that there was no substantial gains made by the shareholders, all the gains
must have accrued to the long-tarm lenders in the form of higher interest
payments. Indeed interest as a percentage of income increased from 14.6
percent in FY85 to 23.0 percent in FY90 (Figure 5.5 and para. 5.11).
5.08        The improvement in operational efficiency indicated by the NPBI
ratio during FY85-90 was attributable to an annual increase of about 22.7
percent in the average price of a kWh of electricity (Annex 5.4) com'pared to
an annual increase of about 17.1 percent in the average unit cost of producing
and supplying a kWh of electricity to the consumer (Figure 5.2). The
increases in the average price of electricity were principally (since changes
in sales mix were minimal) due to implementation of tariff increases during
FY86-901. The increases in the average unit cost of producing and supplying
electricity were mainly because of increases in fuel oil and diesel oil prices
during the same period2. The non-fuel cost component of the average unit
cost of producing and supplying electricity increased by about 14.9 percent
per year during the same period.
1/ The FY86 tariff and fuel price increases were implemented at the beginning
of the fiscal year, whereas the increases for subsequent years were made
effective about two months before the end of the relevant fiscal year.
2/ Although no increases in fuel prices took place in FY88, u.lit fuel costs
increased significantly in that year (Figure 5.2) reflecting the reduction in
energy generated from hydropower stations (because of low water level in the
Nile river) and the high proportion of thermal generation in total generated
energy.

5.09        However, despite the improvement in operational efficiency noted
above, the improvement in NPBI was not adequate to enable: (a) EEA and EDCs
to achieve a modest 5 percent rate of return on revalued assets as agreed with
the Bank under Loan 1886-EGT; (b) cover its debt service; and (c) contribute
sufficient cash from internal operations to finance the local cost portion of
its investment program.
5.10        The actual subsector rates of return on revalued assets were
negative in FY85, 1 percent in FY86 and 1.6 percent in FY88.1 EEA rates of
return even on historical assets were quite low as indicated in Figure 5.1
above and in Figure 5.3 below. That these rates of return were too low is
also confirmed by the fact that since FY86, EEA has not been able to fully
service its debts from internal cash generation (Figure 5.3 and Annex 5.3).
Its self-financing ratios (SFRs) were, therefore, negative since during the
period FY86-90 as shown in Figure 5.3.
I/ The rate of return covenant was replaced, under the Fourth Power Project
(Credit 3103-EGT) appraised in April/May 1989, by a requirement for EEA to
achieve self-financing ratios of 20 percent in FY92, 30 percent in FY93 and 35
percent in FY94 and all subsequent years.

5.11        The problem of servicing debts was worsened by the increasing
amount of debt falling due for repayment as the grace periods for major
construction debts expired and by increases in the exchange rate. The rapid
escalation in EEA long-term debt, particularly the component denominated in
foreign currency during FY85 through FY90 is illustrated in Figure 5.4.
Figure 5.5 shows the increasing interest expenses which explain the reduction
in EEA net profit margin (NPM) from 3.5 percent in FY85 to 2.1 percent in FY90
whereas the NPBI increased during the same period (para. 5.07). The total
debt service increases are also shown in Figure 5.5.

5.12               A maior problem which has contributed to EEA liquidity problems is
the difficult in collecting cash for electricity sales from consumers on a
timely basis. Up to FY85 EEA made substantial gains in improving the rate of
collecting cash due from consumers for electricity sales. Thus in FY85, EEA
total receivables represented about 2.9 months sales revenue compared to about



48 -
8 months sales revenue in 1979. Since then, however, receivables have
accumulated gradually, reflecting, in part, the difficulties faced by
industrial and Government consumers in meeting rising electricity bills as
tariffs were increased almost every year starting in FY86. This accumulation
of arrears is apparent from the growth trend of sales and receivables as shown
in Figure 5.6 below. An analysis of the sales and receivables figures for
FY90 indicates that EDCs accounted for about 79.4 percent of EEA total sales
and 67.5 percent of its outstanding receivables at the year end; large
industrial consumers accounted for 18.2 percent of sales and 23.8 percent of
receivables and agricultural consumers accounted for 2.4 percent and 8.7
percent of sales and receivables respectively. Thus, relative to their sales
contribution (Table 5.1 below), both industrial (mainly public sector
companies) and agricultural (irrigation and land reclamation schemes) impose a
higher cash flow burden on EEA than the EDCs.

5.13        As a result of persistent efforts by EEA to resolve the arrears
problem, the Government agreed to provide about LE 50 million per year for
three years starting in FY89 for settling arrears from public sector and
Government consumers. This amount was, however, not adequate to bring the
accounts of these consumers into a current status and to enable EEA to fully
comply with the requirements under the Fourth Power Project (Loan 3103-EGT) to
reduce its arrears to no more than three months sales revenue. During
appraisal, EEA provided the mission with an action plan for reducing its
accounts receivable from 5.6 months, as of June 30, 1991, to about 3 months
sales revenue by June 30, 1992. During negotiations EEA progress in
implementing its plan during the first half of FY92 was reviewed with the
Bank. Further, assurances were obtained, during negotiations, that from the
end of FY92 onwards, EEA would ensure that the accounts receivable do not
exceed 3 months sales revenue. An action plan for this purpose was agreed
(para. 5.24 and Annex 5.6).

F. Future Financial Performance
5.14       Financial Projections.  EEA financial projections for fiscal years
1991 through 1999 are showr. in Annexes 5.1 through 5.6. The underlying
assumptions are summarized in paras. 5.15 through 5.19 below and given in
detail in Annex 5.6. The principal assumptions on which the financial
projections are predicated relate to energy pricing reforms agreed to be
implemented by the Government in the context of its EcoLlomic Reform and
Structural Adjustment Program (ERSAP), expected growth in electricity sales
and the size and content of EEA investment program during this period.
5.15       Energy-Pricing Reforms.  The financial projections are predicated
on implementation of comprehensive energy pricing reforms aimed at raising the
weighted average domestic prices of petroleum products and natural gas to
their internationally traded equivalents and electricity prices to cover Long-
Run Marginal Costs (LRMC) by June 1995. This will be done by eliminating the
difference between the domestic prices existing at the beginning of the ERSAP
in 1990 and the target prices by five equal annual percentage point steps for
petroleum products, electricity and natural gas. The January 4, 1992 price
increase of petroleum products has resulted in the domestic weighted average
petroleum products price being 64 percent of the internationally traded
equivalent (para. 1.12). The remaining four point steps would require that
the weighted average prices of petroleum products should reach 67 percent, 78
percent, 89 percent and 100 percent of internationally traded equivalents by
June 30 of each of fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995 respectively. The
weighted average electricity price has already been increased to 59 percent of
LRMC in May 1991 and would need to be further increased to reach 69 percent,



- 50 -
79 percent, 89 percent and 100 percent of LRMC by June 30 of each of fiscal
years 1992 through 1995.
5.16        Fuel Prices.  The prices of fuel oil, natural gas and diesel oil
used for power generation would be increased together with those of other
petroleum products so as to raise the weighted average price to economic
levels by FY95. The first step has already been taken in May 1991 by
increasing the weighted average price of petroleum products by about
53 percent raising the average price to about 45 percent of the international
equivalency and another increase announced in January 1992 brought the average
price to about 64 percent of international prices. On the basis of the Bank's
projections of crude oil prices, annual prices of the principal fuels used for
power generation - heavy fuel oil, diesel oil, and natural gas - were
estimated and used for projected future fuel expenses. The assumptions
relating to both crude oil and fuel prices are provided in details in
Annex 5.6.
5.17        Electricity Prices.  At the same time that petroleum products were
increased in May 1991, the average electricity price was raised by about 50
percent, bringing it to about 59 percent of LRMC. The remaining four point
steps for raising electricity prices to LRMC would be based on the findings of
EEA USAID-financed tariff study which is expected to be completed by June 30,
1992. For the purposes of these projections, LRMC estimates were first
developed in US cents/kWh for each year up to FY99 and then converted into
Egyptian Pounds at the exchange rate of the Pound vis-a-vis the US Dollar.
The LRMC estimates were produced on the basis of the latest available
estimates of crude oil prices for the fuel cost component and international
inflation for the generation cost (including O&M), and the transmission and
distribution (including O&M) cost components (Annex 5.6). The system average
tariff required to comply with the agreed target for raising the average
tariff to LRMC was then determined by applying the percentage targets to the
projected LRMC. EEA average tariff was calculated on the assumption that the
present practice of determining the internal transfer price for sales to EDCs
on the basis of the financial requirements of both EEA and EDCs would
continue. This currently shows EEA average tariff at about 65 percent of the
system average tariff. Details of these calculations are provided in Annex
5.6.
5.18        Sales and Investment Program.  Sales were projected to grow at an
average rate of about 5 percent for the period FY92 through FY99 compared to
an average annual increase of about 7.4 percent during the previous five
years. The slowdown in sales growth is expected because of the impact of
price increases on demand as electricity prices are gradually raised to LRMC
by FY95, the lack of significant electrification programs to reach new
consumers and the modest growth in the economy.
5.19        Conversion of EEA Local Currency Loans into Government_Equitv.
The financial projections are based on the understanding that the Government
would convert about LE 1.14 billion of EEA debt to the National Investment
Bank (a wholly Government-owned Bank) into equity. During negotiations.
agreement was reached with the Egyptian delegation that the conversion of



- 51 -
about LE 1.14 billion EEA debt into equity, shall be a condition of loan
effectiveness. The Government has informed the Bank on January 21, 1992, that
the Government has already approved the conversion of about LE 1.14 million
into equity effective July 1, 1992. Implementation of this action would be a
condition of loan effectiveness.
Prooected Financial Results
5.20        Profitability.  EEA unit sales volume is expected to grow at an
annual rate of 5.1 percent during FY91 through FY99. During the same period
the average revenue per unit sold is projected to increase by about 22.4
percent per annum from 30.54 milliemes/kWh to 188.70 milliemes per kWh as a
result of the expected adjustment of electricity prices to reach the LRMC
level by FY95, and their maintenance in real terms thereafter. In 1990, about
29.1 percent of the average revenue per unit of electricity sold was used to
cover fuel expenses, 45.9 percent to cover non-fuel operating costs, 23.0
percent to meet interest expenses and the balance was profit. With the
planned adjustment of fuel prices co internationally traded equivalents by
1995, the fuel cost per unit sold would rise at an average annual rate of
about 29.5 percent per year between FY90 and FY99. Including the non-fuel
costs and interest expenses, the total expenses would increase at an average
annual rate of about 20.7 percent compared to about 22.4 percent increase in
the average revenue per unit sold. Thus EEA profitability would improve.
5.21        Self-Financing Performance.  At the same time, however, EEA gross
fixed assets are expected to increase from about LE 8,472 million in FY90 to
about LE 40,833 million in FY99, an average annual growth rate of about 19.1
percent. The corresponding capital expenditures (FY91-FY99) including
balances in work in progress at the end of the period would be about LE 40,872
million. EEA surpluses (adjusted for depreciation and debt service) would
finance about 28 percent of the capital expenditure program. The surpluses
would, thus, for the period as a whole, exceed the levels required to finance
the local cost portion (about 17.6 percent) of the capital expenditures
program. The self-financing ratios for each year calculated as a proportion
of the year's surplus to the average capital expenditures for three years
(previous, current and next year) are expected to be -8 percent in FY91, 22
percent in FY92, 30 percent in FY93, and range between 36 and 39 percent
during FY94 through FY99.
5.22        Debt Service Coverage.  EEA annual debt service requirements would
increase from about LE 752 million in FY90 to about LE 2,231 million in FY99,
an increase of about 12.8 percent per year. EEA debt service capacity as
measured by debt service ratios (profits plus depreciation as a proportion of
debt service payments) would be strong from FY92 onwards. The debt service
ratios (DSRs) are projected to vary between 1.96 to 2.2 during FY93 through
FY99.
G. Financial Covenants
5.23        Principal Financial Obiectives to be pursued by EEA under this
project would be similar to those agreed under the Fourth Power Project and



. 52 -
are defined in terms of: (i) the self-financing or internal cash generation
ratio; (ii) the debt servicing ratio; (iii) the number of months' sales
represented in accounts receivable; (iv) the submission of audited financial
statements of EEA and proforma consolidated statements for the subsector (EEA
and EDCs) within six months of the end of each fiscal year; and
(v) implementation of adequate insurance arrangements in accordance with
industry practice. In addition, to strengthen EEA ability to achieve
indicators (i) through (iv), EEA agreed to implement improvements in its
financial and cost accounting systems with financing provided under the
technical assistance component of this project. These principal financial
objectives and some of the key measures to accomplish them were agreed during
the negotiations.
5.24        During negotiations, assurances were obtained from EEA that it
would take all measures needed to achieve the following financial performance
targets:
(a) ensure appropriate modification and computerization of its financial
and cost accounting systems by December 31, 1994 with a view to
providing management with a tool to analyze the financial performance of
its operating units and control operating costs (para. 5.02);
(b) implement its action plan (as detailed in Annex 5.6) on a continuous
basis with the objective of reducing and maintaining its accounts
receivable at levels no more than three months sales revenue from the
end of FY92 onwards (para 5.13);
(c) self-financing ratios of 20 percent in FY92, 30 percent in FY93, and
35 percent in FY94 and all subsequent years (para. 5.21);
(d) debt service ratios of at least 1.5 times in each year, failing
which it would not contract new long-term debt without the Bank's prior
concurrence (para. 5.22); and
(e) complete its insurance study being financed under the Fourth Power
Project (Loan 3103-EGT) by December 31, 1992 and gradually provide
insurance coverage for its assets, so as to ensure full coverage for the
required assets by June 30, 1996 (para. 5.04).
5.25        During negotiations, assurances were also obtained from EEA that
it would submit to the Bank its audited financial statements and proforma
consolidated accounts of the power subsector (EEA and EDCs) within six months
of the end of each fiscal year (para. 5.03).

of which LE 42,032 or about 82 percent represents foreign costs. The balance
of the investment program, LE 8,978 million would be financed by cash
generated from internal operations except during FY91 when local loans were
used to finance local expenditures. Funds generated from internal operations
are expected to amount to about 28 percent of EEA investment requirements
during FY91-99. The foreign currency costs are expected to be financed from a
combination of foreign loans, (iclclding suppliers credits) and grants as
indicated in the above table. A detailed financing plan on a year-by-year
basis is provided in Annex 5.3.
VI. FINANCE - EGPC
Introduction
6.01        This section contains the Bank's assessment of the financial
viability of EGPC which is to be a recipient of about US$41.2 million of the
proceeds of the Bank loan to be on-lent by EEA for the procurement of
materials and equipment required to construct the gas pipeline (para. 4.09).
A complete financial viability assessment of EGPC was recently carried out
under the Gas Investment Loan approved by the Board on June 21, 1991.   The
results of that assessment have been updated to incorporate the impact of
changes in crude oil prices since the appraisal of the Gas Investment Loan.



- 54 -
These changes do not materially alter the conclusion that EGPC is expected to
remain financially viable during the period up to 1997. Financial viability
of EGPC will be monitored through debt service coverage ratio and financial
reporting (including audit) covenants agreed under the Gas Investment Loan.
It is therefore proposed not to seek further financial conditionalities under
this operation. The financial viability assessment carried out under Loan
3354-EGT as updated by the mission is given below.
6.02        The financial organization of the gas subsector is essentially
that of a single profit center (EGPC) with numerous functional subsidiaries,
which operate on a cost basis. EGPC acts as the financial coordinator and
implicitly sets transfer prices between subsidiaries (functions), which cover
costs (including depreciation) plus commission.
Historic Financial Performance of EGPC
6.03        The financial performance of EGPC has been historically secure due
to the fact that, as the Government's rent collector in the petroleum
subsector, EGPC has low costs relative to revenues. EGPC has little debt
(US$300 million as of June 30, 1990 or less than 10 percent of long-term
capital) as cash flow has been generally sufficient to cover investment
requirements (Table 6.1 outlines past EGPC performance, with details in
Annexes). EGPC financial performance depends primarily on two factors:
international and domestic energy prices and the costs of production under
concession agreements. Traditional indicators of financial performance are
generally misleading because EGPC acts as rent collector; as such returns
self-financing levels and debt service coverage ratios are all very high.
Nevertheless, EGPC has experienced deteriorating profit levels over the past
six years (net profit margin fell to 21 percent in FY90 from 39 percent in
FY85) largely due to declining crude oil prices.
6.04        These conditions, compounded by the anticipated decline in oil
production levels and the rising cost of gas supply (which are payable in
foreign currency) could result in a net loss in the EGPC foreign currency
account during the next decade. The two avenues EGPC has to control these
problems are to increase domestic product prices (to increase revenues and
reduce demand) and to expand gas supply to substitute for exportable petroleum
products.

6.05         As a result of the energy price reform program, high export prices
of crude oil in FY91 and increases in the supply of natural gas, EGPC
financial position has improved substantially. This improvement has resulted
in increased transfers from EGPC to the government budget of about LE
2 billion in FY91 and is forecast to increase by in excess of LE 2 billion in
FY92. A similar increase in transfer to the government's budget is forecast
for FY93 largely due to the energy price reform program. The domestic energy
price increases and increased gas supply would continue to have a considerable
impact on the government budget.
Accounts and Audit
6,06         EGPC accounts are subject to an annual external audit by the
Central Audit Organization. Aside from documentary audits this review is
effected in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance to ensure that
expenditures are in accordance with authorized budget amounts. Under the Gas
Investment Loan, EGPC agreed to have its financial statements audited by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to supply such statements to
the bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year. EGPC also agreed
to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5. The government, as
guarantor, agreed to take all necessary measures to enable EGPC to comply with
these financial objectives.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
7.01         The project is an integral part of EEA least-cost investment plan
for FY92-99 and would assist EEA in efficiently meeting the future demand of
electricity. The investment plan (of which the project is an integral part)
yields an internal economic rate of return (IERR) of 10 percent.



5 56 -
7.02        Load Forecast.  EEA's historical generation and sales data for
FY82-91 and estimated data for FY92-99 is given in Annex 2.1. During FY82-91,
electricity sales to the end consumers grew at about 9 percent (para. 2.06)
and taking into account the forecast for FY92-99 of the macroeconomic
situation in the country, the electricity sales to the end consumers are
projected to slow down to around 5 percent. With the Government's resolve to
increase, by FY95, the weighted average electricity price to reflect LRMC
based tariffs, it is estimated that the growth rates for electricity sales to
the industrial and domestic consumers (which account for about 80 percent of
electricity sales) would decline from 7 percent and 12 percent duritg FY82-91
to 5 percent and 6 percent for FY92-99.
7.03        Least-Cost Analysis.  EEA revised investment plan is based on the
revised load forecast reviewed by the mission and was found to be the least-
cost solution to meet the future demand for FY92-99. The investment plan also
takes into account additional capacity needed for replacement of old
generating units (thermal and combustion turbines) of about 750 MW total
capacity. As mentioned in para. 4.01, the consultants, S & W, carried out a
feasibility study in 1985 and based on the restricted availability of natural
gas, revised the study in 1989. After comparing five potential sites from
techno-economical and environmental aspects, the consultants concluded that
the dual fuel fired power plant of 1,200 MW net capacity was the lowest cost
solution to meet the future demand for electricity in FY96-97.
7.04        Rate of Return Analysis.  The project is a part of EEA's FY92-99
least-cost investment plan. The IERR was calculated on the required
investment program for the incremental sales and demand to be met for FY92-99,
and is 10 percent. Measurable costs include: (a) the capital cost of EEA
investment plan for FY92-99; (b) operation and maintenance costs; and (c) the
fuel cost. The electricity tariffs for FY92-99 reflect the agreement reached
with the Government under the SAL. Thereafter, the weighted average
electricity tariff is presumed to remain constant during the life of the
project. The fuel cost projections, for FY92-99, are based on the agreement
reached with the Government under the SAL for energy price increases and
thereafter the Bank's current forecast for the prices of petroleum is
presumed. Measurable benefits are revenues due to incremental sales for the
period FY92-99. Annex 7.1 gives in detail the assumptions in calculation of
IERR.
7.05        Sensitivity Analysis.  The IERR for the time slice of the EEA
investment plan for FY92-99 is at 10 percent since: (i) heavy investment in
generation are required to cover the cost replacement of about 750 MW of old
generation capacity in addition to the cost involved in providing generation
capacity to meet the incremental demand for electricity for FY92-99; (ii) the
benefit stream includes only the revenues due to incremental electricity sales
and the IERR is more an evaluation of adequacy of electricity tariffs than of



- 57 -
the true economic worth of the investment plan; and (iii) other benefits1
difficult to quantify are not included. The IERR is within the range typical
of other power projects and is in line with that projected under the Fourth
Power Project approved by the Board in June 1989. Sensitivity analysis
determining the effect of a 20 percent increase in the generation costs over
the base case (Alternative I), 20 percent increase in the transmission costs
over the h'ase case (Alternative II), 20 percent decrease in revenue earnings
compared to the base caso: (Alternative III) and 20 percent increase in fuel
costs over the base case (Alternative IV).  The IERR for the four alternatives
were:
- Alternative I                about 8 percent
- Alternative IX               about 9 percent
- Alternative III              about 5 percent
- Alternative IV               about 8 percent
The analysis indicates that the IERR is most sensitive to changes in the
electricity tariffs and is least sensitive to changes in the investments for
transmission lines and substations. It is therefore essential that the
Government carries out the electricity price increases agreed under the SAL.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01        During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government as
Guarantor of the loan would take all necessary actions to:
(a) enable EEA and EGPC to cover the financing requirements, including
any cost overruns, for the project (para. 4.11);
(b) enable EEA to reduce its accounts receivable to less than three
months of sales revenue (para. 5.13); and
(c) convert about LE 1.14 billion of EEA debt to the National Investment
Bank into equity prior to loan effectiveness (para 5.19).
8.02        During negotiations, assurances were obtained from EEA that it
would:
(a) provide all necessary funds to complete the financing of project
costs, including any cost overruns (para. 4.11);
/  For example, while it is generally accepted that the economic value of a
shortfall in electric supply is very high (estimates ranging from US$0.5/kWh
to US$2.0/kWh) there is no rigorous and consistently applicable methodology
available for calculating this value.  Therefore, it is not possible to
determine the true economic benefit on this account. It is estimated that in
case of developing countries, an unreliable electric supply could result in a
loss of one to five percent of estimated electricity sales.  Assumption of a
value of US$0.5/kWh for the shortfall and a figure of one percent for the loss
of electricity sales would give an IERR of about 22 percent for the project.



- 58 -
(b) pass on part of the loan proceeds intended for construction of gas
pipeline to EGPC and enter into a subsidiary loan agreement,
satisfactory to the Bank, for this purpose (para. 4.12);
(c) take all necessary measures to implement a Project Action Plan,
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.41);
(d) submit its audited financial statements within six months of the end
of each fiscal year (para. 5.03); and
(e) take all necessary measures to comply with the financial targets
included in para. 5.24.
8.03        The following are proposed as the conditions of loan
effectiveness:
(a) EEA to sign with EGPC a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to
the Bank, for onlending of Bank funds toward the foreign exchange cost
of the supply of materials and equipment for the natural gas pipeline
(para. 4.12); and
(b) the Government converting about LE 1.14 billion of EEA local
currency debt into equity (para. 5.19).
8.04        Subject to the above, the proposed project is recommended for an
IBRD loan of US$220 million equivalent to EEA at the standard variable
interest rate and for a term of 20 years including a 5-year grace period. EEA
would onlend to EGPC about ;'S$41.2 million (required for the natural gas
pipeline) for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.
8.05        Annex 8.1 gives the list of selected documents and data available
in the project file.

KUREIMAT POWER PROJECT
Petroleum Product Price Increase FoXMulation
As agreed, the weighted average domestic petroleum product prices will
be increased at least annually to achieve 100% of internationally traded
equivalents by June 1995. Interim targets of 45%, 56%, 67%, 78% and 89% by
May i991, December 1991, May 1992, May 1993 and May 1994, respectively were
agreed upon. The conversion of local prices to international equivalents will
be based on the commercial exchange rate at the time the price increase action
is undertaken. Internationally traded equivalents would be based on the most
recently published preceding twelve month rolling average of petroleum
products FOB Italy and, where necessary, FOB NW Europe as published by Platt's
(see details below). On the basis that ex-refinery products should be priced
in such a manner to reflect an indifferenc6 between the international and
domestic markets, transportation costs1 should be subtracted from
international equivalents for all products except for gas oil (for which Egypt
is a net importer) and LPG (which has a much higher transport cost). A
transport cost will be added to gas oil prices and $20/ton is for the time
being to be subtracted from LPG prices to account for these differences. The
focus of future price increases will be to continue to reduce not only the
subsidies to the sector, but also the cross-subsidies among products. The
product-by-product basis for calculating the internationally traded
equivalents of domestic petroleum product prices is as follows:
(i)    Premium Gasoline - Premium Gasoline FOB Italy -
Premium Gasoline FOB NW Europe +
Regular Gasoline FOB NW Europe2
(ii)   Regular Gasoline - Average of Premium Gasoline (above)
and Naphta FOB Italy
(iii)  LPG              - LPG FOB Italy
(iv)   Kerosene         - Jet Kerosene FOB Italy - $5/ton3
(v)    Gas Oil          - Gas Oil, FOB Italy
(vi)   Fuel Oil         - 3.5% sulphur Fuel Oil, FOB Italy
(vii)  Diesel Fuel      - 85% Gas Oil + 15% Fuel Oil
(viii) Bulk Natural Gas - Fuel Oil equivalent (fuel oil + 20%)
I/ At the present time, transportation costs of $7/ton are based on a
conservative estimate of shipping costs from Egypt to southern European
markets. Local transportation costs to deliver products to port are assumed
to be approximately equal to local transportation costs for domestic sales.
V Egyptian premium gasoline is only about 90 Octane, equivalent to European
regular. Since regular gasoline FOB Italy is not quoted, the differential
between premium gasoline FOB Italy and premium gasoline FOB NW Europe is
subtracted from regular gasoline FOB NW Europe to arrive at an equivalent of
regular gasoline FOB Italy.
i/ The subtraction of $5/ton reflects the differential in quality between jet
kerosene and regular kerosene.

RUREIMAT POWER PROJLCT
Details of the Projiect CoMr-nent,
A. General
1.          The project is designed to assist EEA in:  (i) alleviating power
shortages; (ii) meeting the growing demand for electricity; (iii) improving
the efficiency and reliability of EEA's interconnected system; (iv) improving
EEA's financial position; and (v) improving technical and managerial sl11s of
EEA's staff. The project consists of four components, namely: (a) Kureimat
power station; (b) gas interconnection (pipeline); (c) transmission lines
(including substations); and (d) technical assistance. The components are
described in detail in the following paragraphs.
B. ComRonent I (Kureimat Power Station)
2.          Prolect Origin.  To meet future demand for electricity, EEA with
the funding from USAID initiated a feasibility study for a coal-fired thermal
power station with a net installed capacity of 1,200 MW. In 1984, with the
high oil prices and uncertainty about availability of natural gas, coal was
considered as an economic option for generation of electricity in the power
stations. This was also the conclusion of the "Power Generation Investment
Review" (October 1985) carried out by the Bank. The feasibility study was
completed in 1986. However, the fall in petroleum prices in 1986 and the
incentives given to the drilling companies under the new "gas clause" approved
by the Egyptian parliament in early 1988, changed the Government's views
regarding availability of nacural gas for power generation. The change in
view led to the Government/EEA approval of: Damietta and Cairo South combined
cycle power stations; and conversion of the existing "open cycle" combustion
turbines at Talkha, Mahmoudia and Damanhour power stutions into more efficient
combined cycle mode of operation of the turbines. In parallel, EEA with USAID
funding carried out a supplemental study (with the consultants, S & W,
appointed for the feasibility study) for evaluating the future availability of
natural gas for power generation. The supplemental study indicated that the
availability of natural gas was restricted and was not adequate to assure
100 percent availability for the generation of electricity in the combined
cycle plants. Therefore, generation of electricity in a dual fuel (natural
gas and fuel oil) fired thermal plant would be the least-cost solution.
Accordingly, the consultants, S & W, revised the feasibility study and after
comparing the costs for oil, gas, coal and combined cycle plants located at
five potential sites (Attaq, Cairo North, Gamesa, Mit Ghamr and Kureimat)
concluded that the dual fuel fired thermal power station at Kureimat is the
lowest cost solution to meet the future electricity demand in FY96-97.
3.          Site Selection.  The generation expansion analysis carried by
S & W confirmed that 600 MW was the appropriate size for UPS. Accordingly the
cost analysis for installation of a net 1,200 .MW (2x600 MW) dual fuel fired
power station at the five potential sites (para. 2) was carried out taking

AnUex 4

into account the costs of: (i) fuel surply; (ii) water supply; (iii) power
transmission connecting the power station to the electrical network;
(iv) infrastructure (site preparation, demolition, access roads, foundations,
final grading, security wall, colony, transportation of conatruction equipment
and materials, size of labor force and establishment of labor camps); and
(v) environmental control. The methodology for site selection also included
sensitivity and risk analysis. Expected values of present worth site costs in
US$ million for the five sites were: Kureimat (located on the Nile) -
US$359.2; Ataq (located on the Gulf of Suez) - US$403.1, Cairo North -
US$412.5, Hit Ghamr (located in the Delta region) - US$438.0; and Gamasa
(located on the Mediterranean) - US$577.3. Based on the analysis, Kureimat
power station site was found to be the lowest cost solution for establishment
of the future generation capacity.
4.          Kureimat Power Station Site.  The proposed power station site is
located on the east bank of river Nile about 95 km south of Cairo in Giza
Governorate, and is 30 km north of Beni Suef and just downstream of Kureimat
Island. EEA has acquired about 840,000 ml of land for the power station and
the colony, out of which about 210,000 m' of land along the river was occupied
by 96 farmers for cultivation. The land was used for cultivation by the
farmers living in the nearby villages. EEA deposited with ESA the amount of
about LE 950,000 determined by ESA as necessary to compensate all 96 farmers
for the agricultural land acquired for the project. In addition, to avoid any
social stress caused by the land acquired for the power station, EEA, local
members of the Parliament and the Village Council reached an agreement that:
(a) EEA would give priority to the farmers and/or their children while filling
in jobs at the site; (b) EEA would allow the farmers to raise crops on the
piece of land cultivated by the farmers till the pfece of land was required
for the works for the power station; and (c) EEA would try to use its
influence with the Giza Governorate in obtaining priority for allocation of
the newly reclaimed land by the Governorate in the nearby areas.
5.          Steam Generators.  Under full load conditions ( about 1260 NW),
the two dual fuel-fired reheat steam generators (boilers) would have a heat
input of 2.97xlO9 kcal/hr while burning natural gas and 2.87x109 kcal/hr while
burning fuel oil. It would generate superheated (live) steam at 180 bar
(about 2,600 psig) and 5380C. The reheat steam from the steam turbine at 41
bar (597 psig) and 4500C would be reheated in the boiler and sent back to the
turbine at a tenw.erature of 5380C. The efficiency of boiler on Higher Heating
Value basis woula be about 88 percent for fuel oil and about 85 percent for
natural gas. Fuel usage, per boiler, based on 70 percent plant capacity
factor would amount to 936 million m' of natural gas (having a HHV of 9,718
kcal/nP or 12,423 kcal/kg) or about 0.9 million mt of fuel oil (having a HHV
of 10,060 kcal/kg). The fuel oil supply would be from a 14-inch fuel oil
pipeline (from Mostorod refinery to Beni Suef) which runs by the power
station. Component II (para. 10) covers the supply of material and equipment
for installation of the pipeline supplying natural gas to the power station.
The steam generators would be of pressurized furnace design and provided with
fuel gas recirculation to control the heat absorption pattern under varying
operating conditions. Air input rate to the boiler is estimated at 4,656

6.          Steam T-urbines.  The two tandem compound, four flow, single reheat
steam turbines with a net capacity of 600 MW each (about 630 MW gross) would
each be supplied with about 1,935 mt/hr of live steam at 175 bar (about
2,500 psig) and 5380C, and reheat steam at about 37 bar (540 psig) and 5380C.
The exbaust steam flowing into the condensers at a pressure of 2.5 inches of
mercury absolute (about 1.2 psig) would be condensed by the circulating water
flowing through the condensers at the rate of 1,200 mn/min). In the process,
the circulating water temperature rises by about 100C above the circulating
water intake temperature. The turbine cycle heat rejection rate is
1.44x109 kcal/hr. The plant heat rate (based on net generation and HHV) is
estimated to be 2,473 kcal/kWh for natural gas and about 2,389 kcal/kWh for
fuel oil. The power station auxiliary consumption is estimated at 5 percent
of the gross generation.
7.          Station Auxiliaries.  The power station would be provided with
auxiliary equipment for: (a) the fuel handling system; kb) the circulating
water system; (c) the circulating water, potable water, boiler make water,
service water, and wastewater treatment system; (d) the seven stage (including
deaerator) feedwater heating system; (e) the condensate polishing system;
(f) the hydrogen, nitrogen and bulk carbon dioxide storage systems; chemical,
and instrumentation and controls laboratories; (g) the plant waste treatment
system; (h) the fire protection system, heating, ventilation and air
conditioning system, and other miscellaneous auxiliary equipment.
8.          Colony.  The colony would provide housing units and facilities for
418 out of 533 staff members based on an average occupancy of five persons per
unit. The balance staff (mostly unskilled) is presumed to come from nearby
villages.  Since adequate public services are not available in the nearby
villages and to avoid overloading the existing services in the villages,
public ser"-ices to be provided for the colony would comprise: (a) telephone,
telegram and post office; (b) police and fire department; (c) colony
administration building; (d) nursery; (e) primary school (including
playgrounds) for about 400 students; (f) commercial center; (g) hospital,
guest house, and religious and recreational facilities; and (h) potable water
supply, sanitary drainage, telephone exchange and electricity.
0.                                ugtutruction Infrastructre.  Offices for EEA and its contractors
would be located at the site. During the peak of activity, construction labor
force of about 3,000 is estimated. An area would be designated for each
contractor for construction of his site office and camp for his labor force.
Colony housing activity would be initiated early to ensure housing for EEA
staff at site. Construction requirements for electricity, water and sanitary
drainage system would be provided. Equipment would be transported by road and
use of the Nile river would be made, especially, for transportation of heavy
equipment.

Zafarana) the existing Ras Shokir-Port Said natural gas pipeline and laying
about 162-km of a 20-inch diameter natural gas pipeline to the power station
site. Natural gas supplied at about 100 bar (about 1,450 psig) would be
reduced at the pressure reducing and metering station to about 7 bar (about
100 psig) for use in the boilers. EGPC would provide alternate natural gas
supply by laying a 90-km of 24-inch diameter natural gas pipeline from El
Tebbin to Kureimat is also planned by EGPC. Natural gas at a pressure of
30 bar supplied from the pipeline would be reduced to 7 bar (for use in the
boilers) at the pressure reducing and metering station provided at the power
station site. The pipeline would be chemically coated from inside and outside
to prevent corrosion. As mentioned in para. 4.06 of the main report, the Bank
funding would be for supply of material, tools, fittings and equipment
required for the pipeline and pressure reducing station. EGPC would award the
installation contract to PETROJET, a company under EGPC's control, and for
reasons given in paras. 4.09 and 4.18, the installation of the pipeline is
considered as reserved procurement.
D. Component III (Transmission Lines and Substation)
11.         The component provides for supply and installation of:  (a) about
150 km of 500.kV transmission lines for interconnecting the power station
switchyard with the existing 500-kV Aswan High Dam-Cairo transmission lines;
(b) about 60 km of 220-kV Tanta-Kalyobea transmission line; (c) about 30 km of
220-kV Abu Sultan-Manyef 200-kV transmission line; (d) replacement of the
existing 220-kV circuit breakers of 7,000 MVA rupturing capacity with 13
220-kV GIS breakers of 15,000 MVA capacity and addition of a 220/66/11-kV
125 MVA capacity transformer to meet the increased demand for power; and
(e) installation of about 76 3.6 MVAR capacitor banks and 42 5.4 MVAR
capacitor banks at 53 substations in EEA's interconnected system to assist EEA
in reduction of line losses ind improvement of voltage conditions at the
substations.
E. Component IV (Technical Assistance)
12.         Engineerin2 consultancv Services.  The subcomponent provides for
the engineering services (funded by USAID) for preconstruction, construction
and commissioning phases of Component I and 500-kV transmission lines under
Component III. The engineering consultant would also be responsible for
procurement, installation, operation and maintenance of environmental
monitoring stations, and meteorological equipment for: (a) taking
measurements of background pollution for at least one year before the start of
construction at the site; (b) taking measurements of physical conditions and
hydrology of the Nile river at the site; (c) submission of semi-annual
environmental report till the construction activity starts at the site; and
(d) training EEA staff in so that the staff would continue the environmental
measurement activities during the operation of the plant. It is estimated
that about 1,500 foreign and 1,000 local expert-months would be required for
the activity. The schedule for important environmental activities to be
carried out by the consultants is as follows: (a) signing of the consultancy
contract by December 1991; (b) receipt of the environmental equipment at the
site by December 1992; (c) start environmental measurement at the site by

Page 5 of 6
March 1993; (d) submission of the first semi-annual report by October 1993;
and (e) the end of measurement and submission of the final background
pollution report for the site by March 1994.
13.         Training Consultancv Services and EauiRment.  To train EEA staff
and trainers in instrumentation controls practices necessary for efficient
operation of a modern power station, the Bank had funded the first phase of
training EEA staff in instrumentation and controls under the supplemental Loan
1886-1-EGT for the Third Power Project. Second phase of training for EEA
staff in tistrumentation and controls would be provided under the subcomponent
and, accordingly, would include funding for about 12 expert-months and
60 trainee-months. In addition, the funding for the training equipment for
the training center to be established in North Upper Egypt is provided under
the subcomponent.
14.         Data Bapi/Mana%ement Information System (MIS).  EEA has the basic
equipment for the data bank1'.±S system (para. 2.14 of the main report),
however, additional hardware, and application and communication software is
needed for efficient data collection from various data centers. At present
MIS available with EEA lacks hardware and software for a project management
system which would provide for monitoring of construction activities of
projects and would include systems for: (a) PERT/CPM, Gnatt chart, precedence
and other techniques; (b) resource levelling and project costing; and
(c) progress report generation systems. To ensure timely implementation of
these activities, funding for About 10 expert-months of consultancy services
is provided.
15.         Financial Management Consultangy Servi         To minimize the risk
of EEA not achieving the financial targets in future and to keep the future
tariff increases to the minimum, EEA needs to minimize operating expenses by
controlling costs.  Accordingly, about 100 expert months of consultancy
services (including training of EEA staff) is provided for assisting EEA in
implementation of a computerized financial management system with a special
emphasis on introduction of effective cost control systems.  More details are
given in the Terms of Reference in Annex 5.7.
16.         Load Mana8ement Equipment.  With the implementation of weighted
average electricity price increases to reflect the LRMC based tariffs by FY95,
implementation of load management techniques and energy conservation measures
would be essential. The previous Bank-funded power projects in Egypt provided
funds for load research and load management studies. In addition, the initial
draft report of the Tariff Study funded by USAID (scheduled for completion by
December 1991) recommended the use of special metering for bulk consumers and
bulk supply points for EDCs. Accordingly, funding for procurement of about
1,000 special meters is provided under the subcomponent.
17.         Funding of Bid Packages.  Table 1 below gives the funding for
various bid packages for the project.

KUREIMAT POWER PROJECT
Environmental Impact Assessment
A. General
1.          In 1985, the Environmental Assessment Report (EIAR) for the
Kureimat power station site was prepared on the basis of a feasibility study
for a coal-fired power station. However, with the change in the availability
of natural gas (para. 4.01 of the main report), the feasibility study for the
Kureimat power station was revised on the basis of a dual fuel (natural gas
and fuel oil) fired power station.   The EIAR was accordingly revised in 1990
by the consultants, S & W. The Bank received the draft report in May 1991 and
the environmental assessment summary (based on the draft EIAR) submitted by
EEA was circulated to the Board on July 11, 1991. The appraisal mission
reviewed with EEA and USAID the draft final report submitted by the
consultants. The consultants, after incorporating the comments furnished by
the Bank, USAID and EEA, submitted the final Environmental Impact Assessment
Report (EIAR) by the end of July 1991. The final report and recommendations
of the consultants, that the Kureimat site is environmentally acceptable for
location of the Kureimat power station, were found to be satisfactory by the
Bank. The final EIAR is available in the project files. The project falls
under the category "A" in accordance with Annex A of the Operational Directive
4.0. Paras. 4.31 through 4.37 of the main report give the important
environmental issues involved in the project. The following paragraphs give
additional details about the environmental aspects involved in the project.
B. Location
2.          Para. 4 of Annex 4.1 gives details about the geographical location
of the power station site. The site is on the eastern banks of the Nile river
and occupies the western edge of a relatively undeveloped Galala Plateau which
has a desert environment. Three Wadis -- Wadi Ramliya, Wadi Mitin El Bahry
and Wadi Mitin El Quibly -- near the site drain into the Nile river from the
west slope of the plateau. The riverbank near the plant site is generally
steep and consists of small floodplain areas. The power station is located
just above the floodplain and is downstream of the Kureimat island. No
villages or individual residences are located on the site. EEA is in legal
possession of the land acquired for the power station and as mentioned in
para. 4.26 of the main report and para. 4 of Annex 4.1, about 210,000 m' of
land along the river out of 840,000 mt of the land acquired by EEA for the
Kureimat site, was cultivated by about 50 farmers. EEA is willing to pay
compensation to the farmers as determined by the committee appointed by ESA
and, to minimize social stress to the farmers, EEA has agreed to give priority
to the farmers or their children for employment at the project site. EEA has
also agreed to use its influence with the Giza Governorate to give priority to

the farmers for allocation of the reclaimed land in the nearby areas. The
nearest village to the site is El Mimone (population 1,259) about 1 km to the
south of the site. The nearest commercial and the Government center to the
site is the Kureimat village (population 1,787) about 2 km north of the site.
C. Cultural Resources
3.          Based on the Preliminary Archeological Assessment carried out by
the consultants, no known cultural resources occur near the site. This
conclusion was also supported by the background research carried out by the
office of Public Archeology at the Boston University. The list of wildlife
that are designated by USAID as endangered species was reviewed for the site.
Considering the present situation, the list narrows down to review of the five
species, namely: (a) the desert monitor, (b) the Nile crocodile, (c) the
Dorcas and slender horned gazelle, (d) the cheetah and (e) the migratory
Eurasian peregrine falcon. The chances of occurrence of (a), (b), (c) and (d)
near the site are very rare. The falcon (d) might be attracted to the
wintering water fowl and other bird prey species that frequent the Nile
valley. However, there are no unique features of the Kureimat site that might
specifically lure the peregrines or their prey and, therefore, the probability
of peregrines using the resources of the site are very low.
D. Land Use
4.          The present land use at the site is limited to agriculture in the
wedge-shaped floodplain between the marsh area and the plateau, and in the
Wadi confluences. EEA has acquired the land for the power station and the
colony. Details of the land use are given in paras. 4, 8 and 9 of Annex 4.1.
About 73 percent of the total site surface that would be modified during
construction is located on the desert plateau. The vegetation is sparse on
the desert plateau, and the wildlife use on the desert plateau is minor and
sporadic. The balance of 27 percent of the site surface that would be
modified is in the floodplain along the river. Within the Nile river valley,
the floodplain vegetation is primarily agricultural and is the primary habitat
for resident and migratory wildlife. The loss of wildlife habitat at the
Kureimat site due to construction activities is minor in terms of total
habitat available in the reach of the valley. Hence, the vegetation and
wildlife habitat that would be modified as a result of construction and
operation of the power station is insignificant in terms of the total amount
of similar habitat available in the Kureimat area and in the reach of the Nile
river valley.
E.  Wate'  Use and Water Quality
5.          The main source of water intake for the power station and the
colony is the Nile river and consists of: (a) circulating water required for
the condensers (para. 4.33 of the main report); (b) service water for boiler
make-up and plant services including fire protection water; and (c) potable
water for the colony and the power station. To avoid fouling of condenser
tube surfaces with marine organisms, the river water prior to circulation

through the condensers would be chlorinated. Boiler make-up water would be
appropriately treated (pre-treatment, clarification and demineralization) in
the water treatment plant for use in the high pressure boilers. Potable water
would be appropriately chlorinated, clarified and filtered. Currently, the
controlled seasonal flow of the river passing the site varies from about
52,000 m3/min to 97,2003/min. The circulating water requirement of about
2,400 m3/min is a non-consumptive use, and about half of the service and
potable water requirement (of about 2m'/min to 53/min) would be returned to
the river after use and after being treated in the wastewater treatment plant.
6.          The reaction time for the chlorine in the circulating water
flowing through the condensers before discharging in the river is adequate to
decompose the chlorine so that the residual chlorine content in the
circulating water discharged in the river would be well within the limits
stipulated by USEPA and the Bank (0.1 mg/liter and 0.3 mg/liter respectively).
All wastewater from the power station would be treated in the wastewater
treatment plant comprising: (a) lined waste holding ponds (to limit lechtate
discharge to groundwater) to receive all non-sanitary plant wastewater
comprising floor and equipment drainage, make-up demineralizer regeneration
wastewater, boiler blowdown, condensate polisher regeneration wastewater,
service water clarifier underflow, boiler washing wastes and boiler chemical
cleaning wastewater; (b) an oil/water separator for removal of floating oil
from floor and equipment drainage prior to the waste holding ponds; (c)
chemical feed systems; (d) a clarifier system; and (e) a sludge dewatering
system. The quality of treated wastewater discharged in the river would be
within the Bank and Egyptian guidelines.
7.          Circulating water (which increases its temperature by about 10°C
while extracting heat from the exhaust steam in the condensers) discharged in
the river forms a thermal plume with a surface temperature of about 30C above
the ambient river water temperature. Under the worst case scenario in summer
(on occasions during the months of August through October) the surface
temperature of the river water woulc' not exceed 350C in the immediate area of
discharge and is within the limits laid down under the Governmental Decree
No. 8 of 1983 concerning Law No. 48 of 1982. The temperature of 350C is
tolerated by the fish life in the river except the tilapia fish which has a
tolerance level of about 300C. During the remaining months of November
through July, the plume temperature in the vicinity of discharge will not
exceed 300C and would pose no problem for the tilapia fish. Therefore, the
telapia fish which would avoid the small high temperature area on occasions in
summer months is likely to actively seek the warmer temperature water in the
thermal plume during winter days.
F. Ambient Air Quality
8.          At present there is no air quality monitoring stations in the site
vicinity. Therefore, the project provides for the establishment of
environmental monitoring stations at the site during the preconstruction phase
of the project to ensure that measurements of background pollution are
available for at least a period of one year prior to the commencement of
construction activities at the site (para. 12, Annex 4.1). A mathematical

dispersion model was used to calculate 24-hour and annual-average ground level
pollutant concentrations as a function of downwind distance and direction from
the power station.  The maximum concentrations of pollutant in micrograms/mr
as predicted by the model are given below. It is seen from the predictions of
the model that pollutant emissions from the Kureimat power station would
result in some degradation of air quality in the vicinity of the Kureimat
site; however, even under the worst case scenario of using 100 percent fuel
oil in the boilers at the power station, the air quality is well within the
acceptable limits stipulated by MOH, WB and USEPA.

G. Stack Emissions - NO,. SO, and Particulates
9.          The Bank standards for Nitrogen oxide (NO,) emissions of
86 nanograms/joule for natural gas and 130 nanograms/joule for fuel oil would
be observed. Care would be taken during engineering design of boilers and
burners to ensure compliance with the Bank standards for NO, emissions.
10.         The total sulfur oxide (SO,) emissions are almost entirely
dependent on the sulfur content of the fuel used in the boilers. The sulfur
content in the natural gas (maximum 10 parts per million by weight) and fuel
oil (2.5 percent to 3 percent by weight) available in the country does not
pose any pr3blem for compliance with the Bank standards even if the boilers
are fired with 100 percent fuel oil or natural gas. Under the worst case
scenario, burning 100 percent fuel oil (containing 2.5 percent sulfur) in the
boilers would result in SOX emissions of 380 mt/day against the Bank
stipulations of 500 mt/day for Kureimat power station located in the
unpolluted rural area. The Bank limit would be exceeded only when burning 100
percent fuel oil having 3.3 percent sulfur.
11.         The particulate emissions from the stack of the boilers comprise
fuel ash, fuel additives, acid mist, unburnt carbon and mist. The Bank limit
for particulate emissions for sites like Kureimat located in rural areas
having low background pollution levels is 150 mg/mS. The firing of 100



- 125 -
Anngx 4.7
Page 5 of 5
percent natural gas in the boilers at the Kureimat site poses no problem;
however, firing of 100 percent fuel oil (with 2.5 percent sulfur) in the
boilers would result in particulate emissions of 252 mg/ms against the Bank
stipulation of 150 mg/r.  Therefore, taking account the likely variation of
sulfur (2.5 percent to 3 percent) occurring in the fuel oil available in Egypt
and to ensure compliance with the Bank emission standards, EGPC has agreed to
supply adequate quantities of natural gas to cover at least 50 percent of the
fuel required for the lifetime of the operation of the Kureimat power station.
In addition, EGPC would supply adequate quantities of fuel oil to cover the
balance 50 percent of the fuel requirements of the power station.
H. Noise Pollution
12.         Noise pollution would result from activities during the
construction and operation of the power station. The greatest impact of noise
pollution would be on the nearest village of Mimone situated about one km from
the site. During the engineering design phase, care would be taken to ensure
that the power station equipment meets the Bank guidelines regarding
acceptable noise levels in the power station. Further, in addition to the
stipulations regarding control of dust, and disposal of debris and waste, the
bid documents would stipulate conditions requiring the contractors to abide by
the Bank guidelines while using construction equipment at the site. EEA would
also ensure that the construction activities at night causing dust and noise
pollution would be kept to the minimum.
I. Gas Pipeline and Transmission line Corridors
13.         The proposed gas pipeline and transmission line corridors for the
project were reviewed by the consultants and were found to be environmentally
acceptable. During the construction phase, EEA/EGPC would ensure that the
damage to the agricultural produce is kept to the minimum and compensation for
the damage is expeditiously paid to the farmers.
J. Environmental Management and Training
14.         To effectively manage the environmental activities at the site,
EEA has agreed to establish an Environmental Management Unit (EMU) as an
integral part of the power plant organization (para. 4.37 of the main report).
During the preconstruction and construction phases, the unit would coordinate
environmental activities with the engineering consultants responsible for the
procurement and installation of environmenatal monitoring stations, and
measurements of background pollution at the site. During the commissioning
and operation phases of the power station, EMU would take control of the
environmental activities at the site and design, implement and monitor a
health and hazard safety plan for the power station. To ensure that qualified
and experienced staff is available for the activities of EMU, USAID has agreed
to provide funding for the training of EMU staff. In addition, the suppliers
of the environmental monitoring station equipment provide training to EEA
staff for operation and maintenance of the equipment.

1.  -perating Revenues consist of revenues from EEA's sales of electricity to
Electricity Distribution Companies and to a few major industrial and
agricultural consumers. Revenues from these sales have been projected on the
basis of expecced future sales priced at tariffs consistent with the
Government's stated objective of raising the average electricity tariff to
reach the long-run marginal cost by June 30, 1995. For the years FY96 through
FY99, the average electricity tariff has been adjusted for variations in crude
oil prices, international 'nflation and exchange rate movements so as to
maintain it at the LRMC level.

system average tarift.  -i;o averags electricity tariffs shown in Ce) are higher than those in (a) becauas the
average tariffs in (C) are those that are expected to be in offect after the annual increases (assumed in May)
whereas the tariffs in Ca) are the averages for the fiscal year which ore used for revenue generation purposes.

2. Fugl Exggases. Fuel expenses have been projected on the basis of
consumption forecasts of the principal fuels (fuel oil, natural gas and diesel
oil) prepared by EEA and reviewed by the Bank appraisal mission and on price
increases needed to raise tne average priues of petroleum products to their
international equivalent by FY95 as agreed with the Government. These
assumptions are shown in detail below.

jI Natural gas prices are given per ton of natural gas which is equivalent to 1.2 tons of heavy fuel oil.
Thus, on a calorific basis natural gas is priced at the same level as heavy fuel oil.
3. Salaries and Wages are based on EEA's salaries and wages bill in FY90 and
escalated at the annual rate of local inflation (20% in FY91 decreasing to
about 5% by FY96) as adjusted for an annual average increase in EEA employees
of about 3%. The modest increase in employees is required because of EEA need
to employ specialized staff to implement new projects.
4. Materials and Services are assumed to increase at the consumption weighted
annual rate of local and foreign inflation, ranging from about 8.1% in FY92 to
about 4.1 from FY96 when local inflation is expected to be lower.
5. Adinistration ExSense  (mainly local costs) are assumed to increase at
the annual rate of local inflation.
6. DM1regJat.an is computed at an average annual rate of 3.0% of average
gross fixed assets in service during the year.
7. Interest Expenses on all existing foreign loans has been calculated at the
rate on the basis of data on loan amounts, repayment terms and interest rates
provided by EEA. Interest on new loans is assumed at 16% for local loans from
the National Investment Bank and the Treasury. These local loans are,
however, expected to be minimal since EEA is projected to generate adequate
cash to finance the local cost component of its investment program. All
interest incurred during construction is added to work-in-progress.

The  three months  sales  target  for accounts  receivable  is expected  to be
achieved in FY92 on the basis of EEA action plan which consists of securing
Government's agreement for settlement of outstandings of major public sector
enterprises and close monitoring of payment of rescheduled arrears. EEA
detailed action plan would consist of the following measures to be implemented
on a continuous basis:



- 134 -                     Annex 5.6
Page 4 of 4
(a) implementation of EEA disconnection policies which require that
supplies to consumers with balances outstanding for more than 30 days
from date of submission of the bill should be discontinued until the
balances and applicable re-connection fees have been paid;
(b) unified policy on charging interest on overdue accounts to be
adopted;
(c) arrears to petroleum sector companies to be settled through
periodic offsetting against balances owed by EEA to EC-PC for fuel
purchases; and
(d) EEA to seek agreements with its major customers for settlement of
their accounts through a direct debit system in which EEA would submit
its bills to customer banks for payment and possibly provide
appropriate discount incentives for customers.
With implementation of these measures, EEA receivables are expected to be
reduced to about 3 months sales revenue by the end of fiscal year 1992
according to the schedule shown below and to be maintained at levels not
exceeding 3 months in all subsequent fiscal years.

EGYPT
KUREIMAT POWER PROJECT
Draft Terms of Reference
for Consultancv Services for Financial Management and Training
Introduction
1.          The Egyptian Electricity Authority (EEA) is responsible for almost
all the generation and transmission of electricity in Egypt. EEA sells the
bulk of its electricity to eight distribution companies but also distributes
some electricity directly to major industrial and agricultural consumers at
220-kV/132-kV, and 11-kV. F,,r administrative purposes EEA is divided into
seven zones plus the head office, each of which is a self-accounting unit with
separately identifiable income and revenue expenditures; and assets and
liabilities.
2.          EEA has reasonably well-developed financial, cost and management
accounting systems compared to utilities of similar size in developing
countries. These systems have been developed as a result of several technical
assistance efforts. A UNDP sponsored Power Sector Survey in 1976 first
identified major deficiencies in EEA accounting and financial management
systems. Under the First Power Project (Loan 1453-EGT) the Bank IDA provided
6 man-years of consultancy services to assist EEA improve its management
information systems. This was followed up by further assistance under Loan
1733-EGT for consultancy services to modify EEA accounting and management
information systems and coordinate them with those of the distribution
companies. This task was continued by different consultants (NRECA, USA)
under the Bank's Loan 1886-EGT, approved in 1980.
3.          Further efforts were made under the UNDP Electricity Data Bank
Project to improve EEA management information system, particularly through the
introduction of computerization. However, because the Data Bank Project had
as its primary focus collection of sector data in a systematic manner so as to
facilitate planning and involved other agencies outside EEA, the emphasis
placed on financial and cost accounting modules of the information systems was
not adequate. As a result, only the cost accounting system was computerized
under the Data Bank Project. However, this computerization was carried out
without adequate prior analysis of the relevance of the manual systems and was
not evenly implemented in the different zones. The financial accounting
systems computerized with the help of a local contractor suffers from several
design features and the extent of its implementation differs among the zones.
As such EEA staff confidence in the system is low and hence they continue to
rely on manual systems and thus inefficiently use resources through
duplication. The inventory system remains uncomputerized and the value and
variety of items involved makes efficient inventory management difficult. The



- 136 -
Annlexc 5.7
Page 2 of 3
debt management module is being computerized by EEA staff as part of a
Government-wide program to improve the effectiveness of debt management within
the Government and the public sector.
4.          Because of the remaining deficiencies in the financial and cost
accounting systems, the production of quarterly management reports is always
so behind schedule as to render the reports of little value. Similarly the
production of financial statements is usually delayed, thus delaying the
completion of year-end audits. Another major problem is the lack of analysis
of the variances between actual and budgeted results in the management
reports. This problem is principally because of the lack of relevant skills
within EEA.
Objectives
5.          The objective of the consultancy services are to assist EEA in:
(i) carrying out a detailed analysis of the existing financial and cost
accounting systems; (ii) modifying the systems design so as to enable them to
form the basis for timely communication of relevant information to management,
Government, lenders and other users; (iii) implementing the modified systems;
(iv) providing on-the-job training to EEA staff in the head office and the
zones; and (v) defining a specialized training program for a select group
(2 from each zone plus 4 from head office) of EEA staff in cost analysis and
management accounting and reporting. The specialized training program should
include overseas visits to well-managed utilities for short durations.
SCOR0 of Work
6.          The scope of work should cover a review of the existing financial
and cost accounting systems, recommendations and design of improved procedures
for data processing and production of internal management reports and
financial statements, implementation of recommendations, on-the-job training
and design of a specialized training program for a select group of EEA staff.
7.          Existing Financial and Cost Accounting Systems.  The review should
include an analysis of the weakness of these systems in the light of corporate
objectives. Specifically, the review should examine the following major
subsystems:
- general ledgers;
- sales and revenue accounting;
- procurement (purchasing);
- inventory procedures and materials management;
* the definition and appropriateness concepts of cost centers;
- fixed asset registers;
- payroll accounting.
The review should also examine the compatibility of the accounting and
budgetary systems, the integration of financial and cost accounting sub-
systems, the system of monitoring and controlling project costs and



- 137 -
Annex 5.2Z
Page 3 of 3
expenditures, the adequacy of internal control systems and the status of
computer utilization and management information.
8.          Recommendations and Design of Modified Systems.  The consultant
should produce his recommendations including systems documentation for the
proposed modified system for discussion and agreement with EEA and the Bank
prior to implementation.
9.          Imnlementation.  The consultants will be responsible for
implementation of the modified system throughout EEA. The systems should be
fully tested and completely de-bugged during the changeover period. On-the-
job training should be conducted throughout all phases of the assignment
including implementation. The consultant should provide adequate program
documentation including all documentation necessary to facilitate system
maintenance.
Outputs
10.         The consultant should provide the following written reports:
- report on recommendations and proposed system design;
- computer programs documentation;
- report on proposed training program for specialized training of
select group of EEA staff.
Estimated Manmonths
11.         The estimated 67 manmonths would be utilized as follows:
- Review and analysis of existing financial and
cost accounting systems and proposals for
modified system                                      20 manmonths
- Implementation of modified system including
on-the-job training                                  46 manmonths
- Preparation of a program for selected training
of a select group of EEA staff                        1 manmonth

KUREIMAT POWER PROJECT
Internal Rate of Return Analysis
1.          The economic analysis was carried out on the basis of the time
slice of EEA's Investment Plan for FY92-99 as reviewed by the mission. The
proposed project forms an integral part of the investment plan and, therefore,
it would not be convenient to separately calculate the Internal Economic Rate
of Return (IERR) for the project. The IERR was calculated for the Base Case
and sensitivity analysis was carried for four alternative cases. The Base
Case gave an IERR of 10 percent. Basic assumptions for calculating the IERRs
for the Base Case and the four alternatives are given in the following
paragraphs.
2.          Costs.  All costs are based on July 1991 prices and calculated at
an official exchange rate of LE 3.33 per US$. The generation and transmission
costs include taxes and physical contingencies but exclude price
contingencies. Operation and maintenance costs (O & M) were estimated at 2
percent of cumulative costs for generation and 1.5 percent of cumulative costs
for transmission. Fuel costs in (FY92) constant terms were used for IERR
calculations and are based on the agreement reached with the Government under
the SAL (para. 1.12 of the main report) and the Bank short- and long-term
forecast (July 1991) for energy prices. The prices, in current and constant
terms for fuel oil and diesel oil for FY92-99 are given below:
FY92  FY93   FY94  F95  FY96   FY97  FY8  FY99
Fuel Prices
A. In Current Terms
1. Fuel Oil (LE/mt)             89   142   190   246   299   330   368   410
2. Diesel Oil (LE/mt)          320   511   686   886 1,076 1,188 1,325 1,477
B. In Constant Terms
1. Fuel Oil (LE/mt)             89    98   115   136   156   165   175   185
2. Diesel Oil (LE/mt)          320   355   415   492   563   592   629   668
Note:  The natural gas availability is expected to be supply-constrained for
the medium and possibly long term (para. 1,.12 of the main report). Therefore,
the Government agreed to tie the price of natural gas supplied to the bulk
consumers to the fuel oil equivalent.
3.          Benefits.  Measurable benefits include incremental electricity
sales revenues for FY92-99 calculated by using the weighted average
electricity price increases to reflect LRMC based tariffs by FY95 (para. 1.12
of the main report and Table B of Annex 2.3). The weighted average
electricity tariffs in current and constant terms for FY92-99 are given below:
FY92    FY93    FY94 -  FY95         _FY96     FY97    Y28    XFY99
Weighted Average
Electricity Tariffs
for EEA (mills/kWh)
A. In Current Terms    79.77  105.43  130.40  154.92  164.40  175.07  186.62  198.86
B. In Constant Terms   79.77   90.11   97.44  106.22  106.33  107.84  109.45  111.11

Annex. 7.1

Beyond FY99, the tariffs are presumed to be constant in real terms till the
life of the project. Non-measurable benefits to the economy not included in
the analysis relate to benefits of the increased reliability of supply which
is essential for the industry, the reduced cost of unserved energy and
improved operational and managerial efficiency translating into better and
efficient consumer service.
4.                 Sensitivity analysis.  IERR was recalculated to determine the
effect of: (i) an increase of 20 percent in the investment plan for
generation (Alternative I); (ii) an increase of 20 percent in the investment
plan for transmission lines and substations (Alternative II); (iii) a
20 percent reduction in revenue earnings (Alternative III); (iv) a 20 percent
increase in fuel cost over the Base Case (Alternative IV). The results are
given below:
Base Case                    10.10 percent
Alternative I                  8.16 percent
