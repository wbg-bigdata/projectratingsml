INTERNATIONAL BA-NK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC' OF PERU
FOR AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.         I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$24 million to help
flinance an education project. The loan would have a term of 25 years,
including 10 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - TE ECONOMY
2.         A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Peru" (No. 136-PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors uon May 25,
1973 (R73-115). A description of economic developments in recent years in
Peru and a statement of the case for Bank lending were contained in para-.
graphs 2 - 14 of rm report on a proposed loan to the Banco de Fomento Agro-
pecuario del Peru for an agricultural credit project, dated July 9, 1973 (R73-185).
These paragraphs are attached as Annex I, which also includes a Country Data
Sheet. In summary, the analysis of the economic prospects of Peru pointed
to some difficult years initially, with heavy debt service obligations and
limited prospects for export growth, but with medium term prospects much
more favorable, with important new mineral resources being developed and
promising indications of petroleum in the Amazon area.
3.         Developments during this year support the earlier evaluation. The
fishmeal prospects,which accounted for nearly a third of merchandise exports in
1970-72, are still surrounded by uncertainty, but it now appears that the
current very high world market prices for most Peruvian export commodities (such
as copper, zinc, and others) will increase export earnings sufficiently to com-
pensate for this year's shortfall on account of fish products. Meanwhile, further
progress has been made in securing the needed mining investments. Financing
appears now assured for Southern Peru's large Cuajone copper project, according
to all interested parties - the company, the banks involved, and the
Government - although the final details of supplier financing remain to be
settled. In addition, the company has announced that it also plans a
significant expansion of its existing operations in Toquepala. Including
the state mining agency's Cerro Verde project, mining developments now
taking place are expected to about double Peru's copper export capacity in
three to four years' time. The news from the petroleum explorations is
also encouraging. Eight new exploration contracts have been signed with
companies from the USA, Japan, Germany, France, Spain and Norway, and the
two companies that are actually drilling already have reported several new
strikes with commercial quantities. It thus now appears only a matter of
time until there will be sufficient evidence of large-scale deposits to
warrant the construction of a pipeline to the coast, for shipment abroad.



-2-
Peruts recent success in securing external loans is summarized
in paragraph 13 of Annex T. Since then, Peru ha,s contracted some addi-
tional $160 million in loans from suppliers and cormmercial banks, of which
some $90 milion were for prepayment of existing obligations. Also,
recently the Board of Directors of the Inter-American Development Bank has
approved two loans for a total amo-unt of $12.3 million:  one in support of
a public health prograrm, and the other for a project to control livestock
disease.  Several loans are likely to be signed shortly with the Government
of the Federal Republic of Germany.
PART 1I - BAN(K GROUP OPERUTIONS IN PERU
5.         The proposed l-,ar, would be the Bank's 26th operation in Peru.
With the $O5 rLillion loan for the agricultural credit project, signed on
September 12, 1973, total Bank lending, net of cancellations, to Peru has
reached $268 million. Cf this amount, 43 percent has been for transporta-
tion (mainly highways and ports), 32 percent for agricultuire, 25 percent
for electric power. In addition, a sma-ll loan was made for industry. For
a review of Bank lending to Peru, reference is made to paragraphs 15 - 7,
of my report on uhe agricullitural credit project.  These paragraohs are
included in Annex I. Annex II contains a sumLary statement of Bank loaxns
and IFC invest,ments as of August 31, 1973, and notes on the execution of
ongoing project,s and outstanding issues on executed projects.
6.         Tn my report o-the agricultural credit project, I indicated
that the resur.ption of Barnk lending to Peru cr a moderate scale was warranted
in view of the progress being made in settling inves-ment disputes and that
we would revie.w the status of investment disputes before presenting further
projects to the Board.  Since my report, the Peruvian and U. S. governments
announced a decision to hoold high level discussions on the disputes, and
these are noa uLnder way. After the exPropriatiOn of the fishmeal and fishoil
industry of last May, the Govern-ment issued a Decree establishing detailed
gaidelines for valuation of properties of the expropriated coYRmanies; auditing
of their boooks has largelvy been completed, tLere1by making it possible to
complete shortly the valuattion prucess for the purpose of compensation. No new
disputes have arisen since myr last report, although the Government has now
stated its inuent to nationalize through a negotiation process the Cerro
Corporation's wMolly owned subsiciary.  Taking into account the progress
made towards settlerment of investerit disputes, I conclude that the Bank
should respond by proceeing with the proposed loan, and that further lend-
ing await a review- of progress on tnhe investment disputes issue.
PAPRT TII - EDUCATIONT IN PERU
7.         The present eC6ucatCion and training systeei in Peru is similar in
many respects to that of other Latin American countries.  It consists of
six years of prirwr and f7ivJe years of general secondary education,
followed by higher education and training, whiich is offered in courses of



varying duration in universities, teacher training colleges and technical
institutes.  Sub-professional technical and commercial training is provided,
for those who fail to qualify for general secondary education and for adults,
in non-formal training programs mainly by semi-autonomous Government agencies
through on-the-job courses. Higher level education is concentrated irk 33
universities, mainly in the Lima area. They are autonomous institutions with
broad powers to determine their own curricula and procedures.
8.         Salient among the weaknesses of Peru's current education system
are the geographical imbalances of educational opportunities and the
system's low efficiency. Most of the student places are concentrated
in Lima, which although accounting for about 25 percent of the country's
population, has some 45 percent of total enrollment in general secondary
and vocational education. This problem is compounded by a centralized
administrative control in Lima, which makes inadequate use of local contrib-
utions through regional participation in education planning, which would
make education more respcnsive and relevant to the needs of the outlying
areas. As to the efficiency of the system, less than 40 percent of children
starting school complete primary education and, of those who continue
secondary education, less than 60 percent successfully complete the
secondary program. Retention rates for universities are also low, reaching
only 35 - 40 percent. The problem is particularly acute outside the Lima
area, where the completion rates are as low as 15 percent for primary
education, and 20 percent for secondary education - largely the result of
the high proportibn of schools with only two or three grades, the low econ-
omic standards of the rural population, and the easy access of rural children
to agricultural employmrent. The high dropout wastes scarce resources, raises
the costs    incurred for each graduate and reduces the output of the system.
9.         Aware of the problem, the Government appointed in 1969 an educa-
tion reform commission to examine the needs of the system and suggest appro-
priate changes.  After a thorough study, the commission concluded that the
system was also beset by acade-mic-oriented curricula not tailored to
the manpower requirements of the economy;   lack of teaching and learning
equipment throughout the country and scarcity of instructors of practical
subjects, which makes instruction excessively theoretical and at the same
time of low quality; and by a fragmented and rigid structure that does not
allow a proper flow of students between levels and programs. To overcome
these difficulties the commission recommended an overhaul of the educational
system to give more emphasis to non-formal education and training outside
the schools, improve the quality of teacher training programs, provide
more   teaching and learning aids, and integrate practical and academic
courses in an upper secondary school system. In order to encourage com-
munity participation and relate education to regional needs, the commission
also recomrmended the decentralization of education administration and leader-
ship through the establishment of educational regions and the creation of
a "national service corps of graduates",by which graduating seniors at the
upper secondary level will be required to engage in practical assignments
in their communities as a prerequisite for graduation.



10.        In terms of structure, the principal changes suggested included
a reduction in the number of levels of education in the formal system, the
establishment of a work oriented program in the informal system, and a
streamlining and coordination of existing dispersed types of adult educa-
tion.  The pre-primary education level would have the objective of counter-
balancing the negative influence of adverse econonic, social, cultural and
nutritional conditions in the early stages of the childrens' development and
of assisting families in bringing up their children. These objectives would
be reached through educational activities closely coordinated with housing,
labor, health and other social programs, and carried out through the partic-
ipation of local communities, who would have almost exclusive responsibility
for these activities. A basic general education level would include the
former primary and the lower secondary schools. Several practical
subjects would be taught, in order to develop rudimentary work skills. In
order to correct imbalances of education opportunities, both between Lima
and the provinces,as well as between the different age groups, the basic
general education level would be organized in two programs, "tbasica regu-
lar" (formal) for day pupils under 15 years of age, and "basica laboral"
(informal) for adult students of 15 to 39 years of age, which will emphasize
practical and pre-vocational subjects. This level will cover particularly
the rural and Indian population, which has been largely neglected in the
past. The upper secondary schools for professional training, called ESEP,
will be open to all basic education graduates and will replace the former
upper secondary schools and the preparatory year of the university. The
ESEP curriculum will integrate practical and academic courses in a compre-
hensive program, and will concentrate on major occupational fields such as
service occupations. Flexibility will be built into the system to permit
the ESEP curriculum to be structured in accordance with local needs. In
agriculture, for example, the courses offered (animal husbandry, forestry,
industrial, fishing) will be related to the regional needs. In addition,
this flexibility would allowq university-oriented students to concentrate
on a more academic oriented program (with elective courses in mathematics,
science, social sciences, and foreign languages), while the students planning
to enter the labor market will follow the more practical-oriented courses.
The higher level education will remain largely the same as under the present
system, excepic that universities will have to adjust their curriculum to the
different levels of preparat'ion of ESEP and other secondary graduates.
11.        On the administrative side,and in order to offer greater education
opportunities and to ensure community involvement in the process, the Govern-
ment has decentralized the system through the establishment of nine educa-
tional region,, 33 school zones and about 950 "school nuclei", each with a
central school with complete basic grade programs and facilities, and several
satellite elemqenctary schools.  In order -co enable the Ministry of Education
to carry out ;he reform, the Government has issued legislation to define
acbninistrative and operatiornal procedures, particularly those concerning the



role and responsibilities of the educational regions established by the
new system. In addition, the Minister of Education has been given special
powers to reorganize and strengthen the Ministry of Education, mainly in
those Departments (Planning, Supervision and Teacher Training) which are
critical for the implementation of the reform. Vested with these powers,
the Minister of Education has accordingly reorganized his Ministry by:
(i) establishing a higher council on education, with functions covering
supervision and overall coordination of all major Departments of the
Ministry;  (ii) reorganizing the national inspectorate, which is in charge
of coordinating regional inspectors; and (iii) establishing an education
planning office, to be strengthened by the setting up of a new office of
systems analysis.
12.        With these steps, the stage has been set in Peru to carry out
a far reaching education reform. A number of elements of it need, however,
further examination, in particular the implications of the ref-orm in the
admission procedures of the universities, the detailed curricula and
syllabi for the ESEP system, and the rate of transformation of th, tradi-
tional secondary schools into the ESEP system and the detailed financial
implications of the reform. Although the Government has prepared broad
outlines for these matters, technical assistance, as proposed in paragraph
16 below,will be critical for their solution and in the final analysis for
the success of the reform.
13.        The reform is proposed to be carried out in three phases.  The
first phase, now in its initial stages of implementation, is concentrating upon
insuitutional changes, reforms in educational administration and primary educa-
tion. The second phase will cover the transformation of the seconday education
into the ESEP system in certain key areas of the country,and the third will ex-
tend the reformed system countrywide by 1985-1990. The reform would concentrate in
its initial stages on preparing readily trainable graduates, rather than
specialists in specific skills and, in view of the very low retention
rates of the present system, on improving the flow of students at the lower
levels. Thus, in the first stages, the reform will be particularly respon-
sive to the needs of students unable to proceed to higher levels of academic
education and to workers who want to continue their education by providing
a labor market-oriented program, sufficientjly flexible to give students an
opportunity to develop their skills as their capabilities allow.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
lit.       This would be the first project in Peru's education sector fi-
nanced by the Bank. It is based on the recommendations of a UNESCO project iden-
tification mission that visited Peru in March, 1972. A Bank reconnaissance mis-
sion reached agreement in principle with the Government on the items to be
considered for Bank financing in May 1972 and the project was subsequently
prepared in June 1972, with assistance from UNESCO. The project was ap-
praised in September - October 1972. Negotiations were held in Washington
the week of September 10, 1973, and the Borrowerts delegation was headed
by Col. Daniel Morales Bermudez, Vice-Minister of Education.



-6-
15.        An Appra1iasal Retort or thLe project (No. 177a-,E is being
distributed se-parately to) the Executive Directors. A summary statement on
the proposal is given in Annex IIIe  Bank financing of the project will
provide an opportuunity to support a well -oriented education reform, aimed
at shifting emphasis from traditional to modern curricula, which are geared to
the needs of the labor mar-ket.  Soecifically, the project will consist of:
(i)   corstructioon Ct, and furniture and equipment, for,33 new lower sec-
onoary schools within the basic general education level, to be located
an miedium sized cities, one in each of the 33 schoql zones created by
the aduinistra-zive reform. Ten of the secondary schools a,ould also
provide facilities for prirary grades. These schools would be models
in implementing the new primary school curricul-urm, now in
experimental use, which provides for new approaches in science,
mathematics, social sciences and languages. The 33 schools
will in all -provide 21,000 additional student places;
(ii)  construction of, and equipment Jfor,1 6 new ESE? schools, which will
provide trai-ning in rmajor occupational fields - agriculturne,
industry training, services and teacher training.  These
sCnools will have a total capacity of 11,500 new student
places, including 1 ,L00 bcarting places;  and
i ii) technical assistance to support project institutions in
in troducing t,he new-vT program, in particular to develop tLe
teacher trainirng programs and curricula for the first t-wo
phases of the reform.
16.        Ti7he proposed loan h.as a two-fold objective.  F;rst, itf airs at
supporting the edncational reformrr by flinancing the construction of those
schools that -ilt sErve as foreruanners of the reform ir. each education
region, and bcy providing lhie technical assistance for education planning,
curricu~lum development, suarvey7ing of ESE? graduaates. and fellowships for
over.-:-a- training of locau eoucators a-ndc administrators. To carry
out the educational refo-m, the trojeon envisages assistance to the
Ministry of Edlucation, in-. particular ;iith regatd  to costing o.f the reform
and education admnistration.   Assistance is also envisaged for developing
and inu- oducing the new curric-.laa, whch are to be defined within six
months ofSi tasure of the proposed loan agreement.   In order not to delay
this crit .cl elemrfen-t- oif the projece.t, retroactive financing of $100,000
is includied so:r tecr.lniO_i assistance expenditures incurred af-ter September 1,
1973. In or.d¢- to ssiorn the Government in the imple-mentation of the revised
curricuLI,a, tde prcject envisions -technical. assistance in teacher training,
par-ticularly  n  K. e  -.r,cin  of science and prac'ical subject teachers.
Tnis program- dli c3roip1 &a^en1.: thl,e ongoing plan for in-service training of
education ar nasurauors and lower secondary school teachers, whaich is being
carried out wath Ihe asSi sTance of UKZuDO and USAID. In view of the in-
novative character of aue education reform and iL order to learn from the
experience of its   Lation, the project willI also include technical as-
sistance tc dzesi,gn ana ue-uc_op a tracer systemL to follow-up ESEP graduates



in their career paths and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Fellow-
ships will be available to assist in the training of local personnel and
in the upgrading of educators and administrators needed for the institutions
envisioned in the project. A specific plan for the use of all the tecanical
assistance will have to be provided within six months of the signature of the
loan agreement. This plan is being prepared within a first phase assistance
program of the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), involving
some $600,000 for the planning of the implementation of the reform. The plan
will also identify the detailed components to be financed by CIDA and the
Bank. In view of the importance of the programming and implementation aspects
of the reform referred to above, the Government and the Bank have agreed to
jointly review and monitor the progress of the reform, the training of ESEP
teachers and the technical assistance provided under the project.
17.        The second objective is to directly contribute to alleviate the
shortages of education facilities where the needs are more acute, in partic-
ular in provinces where such facilities are inadequate, thereby helping in
overcoming the marked imbalances of education opportunities between Lima
and the provinces. Twenty-nine of the 33 new lower secondary schools and
13 of the 16 new ESEPs will be provided by the project outside the Lima
area. The schools will be established in those areas where the school-age
population is sufficiently large to warrant an economically viable school unit.
Where the area is too large - as in the case of the four ESEPs providing full
agricultural programs - boarding places will be provided to allow students
from outlying areas to attend the courses. The emphasis on strengthening
school facilities outside the Lima area, in particular those providing
agricultural streams, form part of a wider development effort, which is aimed
at increasing incomes and quality of life in rural areas.
18.        Since there will be an extended period of transition during
which students in two different types of schools at the secondary level
(the traditional and the ESEPs) will be competing for admission to the
universities, the Government agreed to take measures to ensure that univer-
sity admission requirements and procedures will a'ford ESEP graduates op-
portunities for admission equal to those afforded to graduates of the tradi-
tional secondary education, thereby making ESEP schools at least as attrac-
tive to good quality students as traditional schools.
19.        In the past, construction of schools has been the responsibility
of the Ministry of Housing. Under this arrangement, schools were planned
and constructed by that Ministry and thereafter transferred to the Ministry
of Education. This set-up caused problems of coordination and lack of
adequate facilities for the education purposes envisioned. In the future,
all construction will be planned and supervised by the newly established
Building Department of the Ministry of Education. The proposed project



- 8 -
would be carried out by a project unit that will be established within the
new BuiBing Department.  The unit will, however,report directly to the Vice-
Minister of Education. The proposed loan is to become effective upon the
establishment of such unit and the appointment of the project unit director
and the project architect. In view of the newly established character of
the unit, consultants will be appointed as requirecd for the design of the
buadings and facilities and the day-to-day supervision of construction works
on the project. The proposed loan envisions technical assistance to help
design the buildings and establish the specifications and procurement of
equipment and furniture.  Since poor maintenance heLs in the past been one of
the main causes of the inadequacy of existing schools, Section .h04 of the
loan agreement provides for the Government to make adequate funds available
for regular maintenance, renewals and repairs of buildings, equipment and
furniture financed under the project.
20.        The total cost of the project is estimated at $40 million, of
which $20.2 million is the estimated foreign exchange component. The pro-
posed loan would finance this component and $3.8 million equivalent of local
expenditures in line with our assessment that the resource transfer required
to support the development program is not likely to be achieved if all lending
is restricted to the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for
external financing. Except for contracts with a value below $25,000, procure-
ment is to be through international competitive bidding, with local manufac-
turers to be granted a 15 percent margin of preference or the customs duty
payable by a non-exempt importer, whichever is lower. Procurement of furniture
will be only locally advertised, in view of its relatively small amount ($1.6
million in total), its diversity and the long delivery period. The Bank
would disburse 47 percent of total construction expenditures and 130 percent
of foreign expenditures on account of technical assistance and furniture
and equipment procured abroad. The Bank would reimburse the ex-factory cost
of locally procured furniture and equipment.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a Resolution approving the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
22.        The draft Agreement contains provisions to reflect the various
arrangements described in Part IV above, and further includes the usual
covenants for education projects.



-9-
23.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
24.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

repayable in local currency.

EXCERPTS FRCM PRESIDENT'S REPORT DATED JULY 9, 1973 ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE BANCO DE FOMENTO AGROPECUARIO DEL PERU
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT (REPORT No. P-119la-PE)
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       A report entitled OCurrent Economic Position and Prospects of
Peru" (No. 136-PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 25,
1973. Annex I summarizes the main economic and social indicators.
3.       The rich and varied mineral resources have been since colonial
days one of the major sources of Peru's wealth, and in later years a limited
but quite profitable export agriculture and a large-scale fishmeal industry
have been developed. While exports are based almost exclusively on the
country's own primary production, they are nevertheless diversified, and
with major new mineral developments under way the medium-term outlook for
exports and - given a continuing good economic management - growth seems
quite favorable.
4.       The main challenge that has faced Peru for some time can be sum-
narized as the need to break the historical pattern of development without
impairing growth. In the past Peru has achieved a respectable overall
growth accompanied, however, by wide disparities in productivity, employment
opportunities and income levels, as well as other welfare indicators, between
the modern and the traditional sectors, the coast and the rest of the country,
the urban and the rural population. There are manf facets to this challenge:
the need effectively to integrate into the social and economic fabric large
groups of Indian descent who until now have hardly been touched by modern
development, the need to combat the high levels of un- and underemployment,
the need to raise the very low productivity and income of the labor force
outside the modern sectors, and the need to reduce the excessive dominance
of the Lima-Callao area in virtualy all aspects of development.    This
challenge is made all the more formidable by the country's extreme topog-
raphy and climate which make transort and communications very difficult
and costly and set narrow limits to its agricultural land use.
5.       The military Government that took over after an economic and
political criai8 in 1967-68 oas been able to restore stability and growth



ANNEX I
Page 5 of 9
:n the economy,  `t hlas also taken vigorous steps to effect structural re-
forms which it sees as necessary preconditions for a more equitable social
and economic development pattern.   "Basic legislation" has been issued,
establishing ground rules in the vrarious sectors, including agriculture,
fishing. mininv and :inctustry.  In agriculture  a new law in 1969 made the
previously existing agrarian reform legislation more comprehensive and its
n-vlementation more effective.   Specia? emphasis was given to the promotion
of cooperatives aid other forms of collective management, which are tra-
±tional among the Indian population.  In mining  the new legislation pro-
\- ded for the reversion to the State of private concessions not being ex-
m. ited and for wi-ch no agreed program for exploitation could be established
Bchio .a short period, and also for a gradual State monopoly of mineral
eèoorts.  Six "basic" industries were reserved for the public sector - iron
and Eteel, refining of non-ferrous metals, cement, petrochemicals, fertil-
iazers, and paper - while legislation on labor communities was introduced in
industry, mining and fishing to bring about workers' partic:eation in profits
and ownership. In parallel, comprehensive reforms of the public adninistra-
tion were launched and a number of State enterprises set up to implement the
new nolicies.
6.        As could be expected, the break with pest policies has caused con-
troversy and has deterred to some extent private new investment, particualarly
in industry and agric-ulture.  The Government is aware, however, that even if
the nublic sector is to play a much more important role than in the past in
the economy and the managcment of the economy is to be in Peruvian hands,
with broad popular participation, a dynamic development in Peru requires
active participation of bhe private sector and foreign capital and know-how
are indispensable in some sectors. The Government's approach has thus been
pragmatic. It has agreed to the development of the largest new copper mine
(Cuajone) by a foreign company (Southern Peru Copper Company), made arrange-
ments for fore-gn participation in the recent oil exploration in the Amazon
basir, and is actively trying to attract foreign participation in joint
venttures for important industrial projects.  A regime of 50 percent tax
exemption applies to reinvestment of profits in the industrial sector, and
even higher incentives ar- given to inivestment outside the Lima-Callao area.
Further, agrarian refolm, bonds may be used as payment of up to half the
amount their sharehco'ley.s are willing to invest in industries anid, to
overcome the un&:erta.'L id  f LL by individual farmers, a new effort has
been launched to pR - t Ue documents exempting from expropriation the owners
whose fanis are in complianc,e with the size provisions of the law, and who
ton scddition are comiplying with relevant labor and other social legislation.
Hecontly the Government inas expropriated some 90 private enterprises in the
fi.shmeal and fishoil ]indut-try, with 10 Tercent of the compensation for the
ex-propriated assets to, be paid in cash and tUhe rest in 6 percent. tax-free
conds , denominated .. a soles a:d redeemable in ten yearly equal installments.
As in the case of thte agrarian reform bonds, these bonds can be used for
financing up to half ef investmer.ts in certain priority industries. This
latest seizure is reiw cig cpen discussion of the Government policies toward
the private sector.
7.        A-fter t1ie i t4 '._ stabilization of the economy in 1969, the Govern-
ment has also been c-.-L 5Tu. to follaw a policy of moderate fiscal and monetary
expansion, and, whi.Ie the.e are now some signs of increasing pressures on
prices, the resvtmed grmz.  has on the wlole been managed without creating
serious disequili r-.7  r_etnt budget oxpenditures, including defense



ANNEX I
Page 6 of 9
oultlays, have been kept under control, and have actually decreased
as a share of national product. The need to finance a growing public invest-
vent - directly  and indirectly through transfers to State enterprises - has,
however, led to a growing fiscal deficit, and at the end of 1972 the
Government took action to substantially raise tax revenues. This includes
the substitution of a sales tax at producerst and wholesalers' level for a
large number of stamp taxes, and modifications to the income tax system.
These measures are estimated to represent an additional tax yield of at
leact S/. 3.5 billion per year on average during the 1973-74 budget period,
e,;uivalent to 9 percent of the 1972 tax revenues. The Government expects
to raise some further S/. 3 billion in 1974 by additional measures to be
Laken this year. This is largely in line with the increased fiscal revenues
estimated to be required in the 1972 Bank economic report.
;.        In the pursuit of its development goals the Government is in-
-easingly stressing the role of planning. Its first medium-term develop-
n.enL plan - covering 1971-75 -- puts the achievement of the structural reforms
and a substantial reduction of un- and underemployment as the highest prior-
-ty objectives. More employment is to be created in agriculture by better
land utilization in the refonmed areas and in industry by a vigorous indus-
trialization drive including a strong expansion of State enterprises and
joint ventures with foreign firms. in addition, mining investment plays an
important role, as it is recognized that most of the needed foreign exchange
-ill continue to originate from the mining sector. The plan also provides
for substantial investment in a number of major irrigation projects designed
to increase the available agricultural land, since even with all farms
brought in compliance with the size provisions of the reform law there will
not be enough land to provide a sufficient income base for the present rural
population.
∞.        Clearly the 1971-75 plan projected too large investment levels,
and this was due to the fact that these levels were primarily set to provide
challenges for the executing agencies rather than realistic sectoral targets.
In terms of accomplishments, the experience of the first year of the plan
period, 1971, was rather disappointing. Many agencies were new, or newly
reorganized, the lead time reouired before project execution could actually
start had been underestimated, and there was a general lack of experience
with how to actually turn the public sector into a dynamic leader of growth.
As a result, project implementation fell far short of what had been hoped
n)r, with agriculture being the sector with the worst shortfall.
20.        The record for 1972 indicates, however, a better performance,
c cverall public. investdnent i  reaoiiig about 20 percent, twice as much
'; year before.  For the         -ittr., it is import-"nt to note that Mineroperu,
Alate rining enterprise, haS :igned contraicts during 1972 with a UK
-: micate of banks, the Canabi '.-n Export Development Corporation and
-ese suppliers for finar:ing , tnèe large Cerro Verde copper mining
- ect and a copper refimnt ryri fwther mining expansion projects are
active consideration.   surQhmore, the promising indications of
`-'olcLm deposits in the Perv-ian part. Gf the Amazon basin have added a
facet to the investment progr. a. Petroperu, the State Petroleum
-terprise, has signed contracts wLth seventeen foreign companies or
jr-aps of companies for exploration investment, and has embarked on a
_;zealle program of its own.  As develcpment of Peru's mineral resources

remains the key element .or the balance of payMents prospects of the country
and its creaitworthiness, tle recent progress and rnew possibilities in this
sector are very prosin"slg. We intend to follow closely further progres, in
this field, in the context of our continuing analysis of the country's credit-
worthiness.
There was at the time of the 1967-68 crisis serious concern about
tne external debt Eituat-ior c'l Peru. External indebtedness had risen very
rapidly arn the debt serv7ce situation for the following years was going to
be difficult. Discussions had to be taken up with major creditors and some
relief was obtained in two rounds of debt renegotiations. However, debt
service requirements have continued at high level (they accounted for 78
percent of export earnirngs in 1972) and, in order to achieve the needed net
capital inflow, the Government during 1972 successfully negotiated a number
of medium-term bank loans for some $90 million for refinancing purposes,
in addition to a growing volume of direct development loans.. Meanwhile. a
successful repatriation of capital held abroad and favorable price develop-
ments for the export products during 1970 enabled Peru to build up a comfort-
able level of foreign reserves, close to $400 million. It is clear, however,
that debt service, even if manageable, remains a heavy burden for the country
and that more than medium-term bank loans for refinancing is required to
fundamentally alter the situation, especially in view of the present uncertainty
concerning the future of fishmeal exports due to the virtual disappearance of
the anchovy since rLid-1972. The Government is aware of this and is seeking
to obtain long-term project loans in support of its investment program.
12.       External capital requirements for the 1973-76 period will be sub-
stantial.  In addition to the current account deficit foreseen - some $l,15C
-mllion over the period, based on an average rate of growth of exports of about
9 percent and of imports of about 12 percent per ann-un - amortizattorn of thL&
external debt will require $855 million.  The gross capital requirements wi- 
thus amount to about $2,000 million fcr the period, rising from $450 mrlLiGr.
in 1973 to $550 million in 1976.  On the basis of a plausible financing
pattern of capital inflow, draw down of reserves, and disbursements a.i
commitments of new loans, annual requirements for new project loan corm-i--
mnents would increase from $295 million in 1973 to $470 million by 1976.
Dxuressed in tenms of export earnings, the debt service would remain at about
IS percent over the. period. Lookiiig beyond 1976, this situation will ease
significantly due to the increased export earnings from the new copper mining
developments.
13.       In view of the need to mobilize development capital abroad. the
ConSultative Group for Pern, which had been dormant since 1966, was reconi-
n ned in February 1972. at the initiative of the Government, to discuss Per-;'s
public investment program and external capital requirements.  The members oi
tne Group recognized the serious development effort of the Government and
agreed that external financing commitments at a level of about $260 million
per year would be iiGquired o-.er the period 1972-74. The response in 1972 of



ANNEX I
Page 8 of 9
the multilateral and bilateral lending agencies has been mixed.  Cverall,
Peru has been able to obtain a record $464 million in overall commitments
of external loans during 1972, but only a minor part of it has come from
official sources, at long-term (for details, see page 3 of Annex I). The
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) granmed one loan of $12 million,
while the US Agency for International Development (ALD) made available
$27.6 million for disaster relief in areas affected by the earthquake or
floods. It should be noted that agreement in principle has been reached
with the Federal Republic of Germany and France for substantial amounts of
concessional financing, (i.e., loans exceeding 15 years at interest rates
lower than 5 percert), although in these two cases the projects to be
financed have not yet been fully prepared. As a result of the better
terms now offered, Peru has also begun a process of replacing some earlier
loans with new ones which have better conditions. During the first half
of 1973, Peru contracted $200 rmillion, mostly for non-project purposes,
including debt refinancing, and obtained recently fron IDB a $6 million
loan for a mining credit project. On June 19-20, 1973, another meeting of
the Consultative Group was held. The Group commended Peru's achievements,
in particular the Government's efforts to combine economic growth with
social justice and its policy of stimulating exports through mining and
petroleum expansion. The Group urged the Government to create and maintain
a climate of confidence necessary to encourage private investment, and a
reassuring statement on the subject was made by the Minister of Economy and
Finance, head of the Peruvian delegation. Several participants indicated
that they would consider exterxling part of their assistance on concessionary
terms.
14.      As documented in the economic report, the Peruvian Government is
showing great pragmatism in its economic management and has shown genuine
concern for a more equitable distribution of the fruits of development.
The project preparation and execution capacity of the various public sector
agencies is improving and, while debt service is going to be a burden for
the country for several years to come, Peru is clearly creditworthy for
substantial amounts of additional borrowing.  There is, however, a case for
substantial grace and repayment, periods, so as not to increase the debt
service problems of the next few years, before additional export earnings
from the new mining projects begin to accrue. There is also need for some
local currency financing, as the resource transfer required to support the
development program is not likely to be fully achieved if all lending is
restricted to the foreign exchange comoonent of projects suitable for
external financirng.
PART II - BANK G.ROUP OPERATIONS IN PERU
15.       Since 1957, the Bank has made 24 loans to Peru for a total net ol
cancellation of about $2b3 million. Of this amount, about 48 percent has
been -for transportation (eleven loans, mainly for highways and ports), 27
percent for electric power, 24 percent for agriculture and the remainder f or
irdustry.  IFC conmmit-ments to 6date have been about $9 million - all in

Page 9 of 9
industry - of which $0.4 million is held by the Corporation. A statement
on Bank loans and IFC investments as at May 31, 1973,and notes on ongoing
projects are attached as Annex II. Bank loans to Peru constitute about
11 percent of total outstanding debt, including undisbursed, and absorb
about 7 percent of the country's debt service obligations.
16.       As indicated to you in August 1970, when a loan was approved to
assist Peru in the aftermath of the earthquake, the Bank became concerned
in 1967 about the raDidly deteriorating fiscal situation Mnd a balance of
payments crisis that ultimately led to the devaluation af the sol in Sept Imb-'r
1967. Also, after the new Government came into power in 1968, it took over
the International Petroleum Co. (IPC) properties in Peru, in connectLon w>!.
a dispute that had existed for many years, and agreemren  on compensva frs
was not reached.  In 1969, we informed the Governument of Peru of our concer-i.
for the fiscal position, the resulting lack of local currency resourcc. fIc
ongoing Bank projects in Peru, and possible adverse conseq;.ences on Per-Is
balance of payments and capacity to service external debt of the disputes
with the US Government regarding compensation claims.  I therefore made
clear in 1970 that the road reconstruction loan was proposed without pre ic.
to the question of when and how the Bank might resuine normal lending to Per..
Since then, however, the general economic management has improved conside-c-.`
the budgetary and balance of payments outlook has also improved, anid tne
international financial community, both governmental and private,    sho   .
increasing interest in Peru, as evidenced by the recent external borrowing-
record and the arrangements made with private investors for mining and petro-
leum expansion.  Settlements with foreign investors have been reached in the
cases of Banco Continental, formerly 60 percent owned by Chase Manhattan
Bank of New York, and of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation.
Other investment disputes continue to shroud the horizon, but recent develop-
ments have given some groulnds for hope that these problems will also find a
solution.
'7.       Taking all things into account, I have reached the conclusion that
the Bank might DroDerly respond to the present situation by resuming lending
to Peru on a moderate scale.  Besides the proposed agricultural credit project,
the Bank has under consideration loans for three other projects, in secondary
and vocational education, roads and Power. Presentation of these Drojects
to the Board will, however, await a further review of the status of outstand-
ing investment disputes.

C. PROJECTS TIN EXECJTION g
Loan No. 418-PE - San Lorenzo Irrigation Project;   US$11 million Loan of June 18,
1965. Closing Date: December 31 , 1973
Due to inadequacy of water supply, the Bank agreed to reduce the project
area; consequently, the project was redefined and the original loan amount of
U $11.0 million was reduced to US$6.5 million. (See Mlemorandum to the Executive
Directors "Peru; Proposed Change in Loan 418-PE", February 28, 1968 R68-33). The
closing date, originally June 30, 1967, was twice postponed, first to June 30,
1969, and then to December 31, 1973. The project has encountered a number of
difficulties, both administrative and technical but, these problems are

that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and

being overcome. Project management has recently been strengthened and the
last part of the project related to the drainage scheme is now in process of
implementation. While studies necessary for that scheme were underway, dis-
bursements were slow. With their completion and the start of work on the
drainage scheme disbursements have picked up. Undisbursed funds amount to
US$1.1 of which us$o.5 have been committed for the procurement of equipment
for the drainage scheme and US$0.3 are to be committed shortly for additional
hydraulic equipment. The Bank proposed to the Government to finance a study
to improve agricultural development and marketing aspects of the project, a
matter which, if acceptable to the Government, may justify a one year post-
ponement of the closing date.
Loan No. 425-PE - La Oroya-Aguaytia Highway Project; US$33 million Loan
of September 17, 1965;  Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The extraordinary difficult geological, climatic, and soil conditions
of the region were underestimated in the design and cost estimates on which
the project appraisal was based, as well as in the bid prices of the contrac-
tors. This together with heavy inflation during 1966-68 and the Government's
delay in paying contractors for extended periods led to large time and cost
overruns.  In November 1969, the scope of the project was reduced by deferring
to a second phase paving and a portion of the necessary drainage and
protective works of the road (see Memorandum to the Executive Directors "Peru -
Proposed Revision of the Central Highway Project", November 14, 1969 (R69-219)).
The first phase works for the construction of the La Oroya-Aguaytia Road has
been completed.      The second phase project has been recently appraised for
possible Bank financing. The closing date of this loan, originally June 30,
1971, has been twice postponed, first to December 31, 1972 and then to
December 31, 1973 to permit completion of the project.
Loan No. 511-PE - NMatucana Power Project;  US$1765 million Loan of September 11,
1967;  Closing Date: November 1, 1973.
The project is practically completed. The 120 MW plant, as major item,
went into service in October 1971 for a cos-t of about US$35 million, or about
8 percent less than originally estimated (after adjustment for currency varia-
tions). The closing date was postponed one year to allow for changes in the
transmission and distribution portion of the loan due to revised Government
plans on the Lima airport and housing developments. Completion of the remainder
of the project is expected late in 1973 or early 1974.
Loan 706-PE - Road Reconstruction Project;   US$30 million
Loan of September 14, 1970; Closing Date: September 30, 1975
The loan was signed only three and a half months after the earthquake
in the Callejon de Huaylas. However, the identification, feasibility study
and designs of the roads to be improved, have taken a longer period than



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 4
expected at the time of appraisal, because of delays in contracting consultants
and in the execution of their studies, and also because the time required to
carry out all the abovementioried studies was underestimated in the appraisal.
Construction of a short section of road is well advanced. Bidding and award
of construction contracts for the remainder of the project are expected to be
completed before the end of 1973. Construction works are now projected to be
finished by the end of 1976, about one year after the original Closing Date.
Loan No. 933-PE - Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.o million Loan of September
12, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The Loan was signed in September 1973 and is expected to become effective
in November 1973. Banco de Fomento Agropecuario de Peru (BFA) has several
candidates under consideration for the position of a credit specialist whose
appointment is a condition of effectiveness. The Government is also preparing
to transfer S/.100 million to BFA in fulfillment of another condition of
effectiveness. BFA has commenced field work, such as sub-loan appraisal, and
progress is satisfactory.
D.   EXECUTED PROJECTS (OUTSTANDING TSSUES)
Loan No. 271-PE - Aguaytia-Pucallpa Highway Project; UJS$5.5 million Loan of
December 19, 1960; Closed on July 31, 1967.
Due to cost increases, loan funds have been exhausted in 1967 before
the works were finished. Extensive failures have since occurred in completed
sections, due to insufficient allowance for the combination of poor local soils
for construction purposes, the instability of the region, and extremely heavy
rainfall. Legal proceedings initiated by the Government are taking place
against the consultant and the contractors. One of the contractors in turn has
filed a claim for compensation.
