MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE rNTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO TBE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO NIGER
FOR A PILOT PRIVATE IRRIGATION PROMOTION PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
propose.d development credit to Niger for SDR 4.6 million, the equivalent of US$6.8 million, on
standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40 years to help finance the first phase of a longer-tenn
program aimed at promoting small-scale private irrigation development and, in general, at
enhancing rural incomes as well as alleviating food insecurity among the rural population, through
sustainable growth in food production. The country assn-tance strategy (see para. 14) was
reviewed by the Board on May 31, 1994.
2.          Country and Economic Background. Niger is a country of about 8 million
inhabitants with a per capita GDP estimated at US$300 in 1993. Per capita income today is about
3.4 percent lower than it was in 1980, and Niger's fast growing population (3.3 percent) is one of
the poorest of the world. Social indicators paint a grim picture of the country's poverty profile.
At present, 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas where food security and nutritional
status are linked to rainfall patterns. Also in the countryside, there is a mounting environmental
threat because of deforestation and pressure on land. The social effects of Niger's economic
problems are also visible in the urban areas, where population growth and a shrinking modem
sector have caused rising unemployment and social instability. The formal sector, in 1994
accounted for 22.7 percent of GDP, and comprises a relatively inefficient public sector and a small
modem private sector in rapid decline owing to a lack of competitiveness of the Nigerien
economy, and often "fraudulent" imports. The informal sector accounted for 77.3 percent of
GDP, of which half is rural, and is fast growing. Uranium exports amounted to 80 percent of
merchandise exports until the end of the 1980s, and 71.5 percent during 1990-93, and 64.8
percent in 1994. In 1994, about 40 percent of GDP came from agriculture; industry and
construction contributed 9 percent and the share of services stood at 42 percent, of which 10
percent for Govenmment.
3.          Niger has just emerged from a protracted period of political turbulence due to the
breakdown of the political coalition governing the country. Since January 12, 1995, the country
has a new National Assembly, with a majority from the opposition, which foreshadows a
"cohabitation" government with the President. The stance taken by the opposition parties for
prioritizing economic reforms and pacifying the tense social atmosphere augurs well with the
urgent need for a revival of the reform program. Past adjustment efforts by the government have
been uneven, and implementation of the post-devaluation program agreed upon with the Bank and
the IMF has faced problems. The country scored some good progress in trade liberalization, in
reforms of agricultural and education policies, which contrast notably with a worrisome
stabilization program (poor revenue mobilization, ballooning wage bill) and an equally troubling
public enterprise and labor market reforms.
4.          Sector Background.  Agriculture value added came mainly from the crop
subsector, 54.4 percent, livestock, 35 percart, fisheries and forestry, 10 percent. Throughout the
1970s and 1980s, the vagaries of the weather imparted some randomness to agricultural



- 2-
performance, and the available evidence suggests that the prospects for further production
increases from the present low-input-low-output type of rainfed agriculture are very limited.
Farmers reacted to the cyclical droughts by shifting increasingly out of rainfed farming and into
high-value off-season crops via a crop diversification strategy and a gradual adjustment to small-
scale irrigation farming. This shift has been reinforced by changes in the Government's
macroeconomic policies affecting the agricultural sector. As a result of the adjustment program
(notably SAL I and USAID's Agricuiltural Sector Development Grant (ASDG)) agricultural
markets have been liberalized. The cereals marketing parastatal, OPVN, is no longer involved in
commodity stabilization operations, and was restructured into an emergency food security stock
management agency.  Similarly, subsidies on fertilizers and other agricultural inputs were
substantially curtailed; prices were liberalized and quantitative and administrative restrictions on
trade were removed. More recently, with the January 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc, the
Government has been striving to further improve agriculture's incentive environment by adopting
measures designed to: (a) pass-through the benefits of the devaluation to farmers and (b)
accelerate the structural reforms necessary to support supply response.
5.          Long-term Sectoral Development Goals: Priority objectives in the agricultural
sector are to slow down or reverse present environmental trends, raise existing levels of lier capita
production to help achieve food security, and provide a dependable source of economic growthL
Like most countries in Africa, the key development objectives of Niger are: (i) better
environmental management; (ii) food security, (iii) an appropriate incentive structure for fanners;
and fiv) broadening supply response capacity, inter alia, improving the delivery of agricultural
services (research and extension), access to credit, improved small-scale irrigation schemes and
infastructural support.
6.          The objective uf sustainable management of natural resources underpins the
strategy for removing the agroecological constraints on agricultural growth. Improving land and
soil productivity would be the guiding principles for sustainable growth in productivity. Village-
based land, water and soil management would be the targets of this program. This strategy would
seek to expand irrigated agriculture through small-scale irrigation from Miger's untapped
groundwater resources potential and by integrating rehabilitation and conservation practices in
catchment areas. The implementation of this strategy should involve wide use of labor-intensive
work programs, in collaboration with the private sector and the donor community, in order to
generate income for the food insecure and create crop and forage produ,tion, conservation and
infiastructure works. Regarding the incentive framework, despite the market liberalization
reforms already achieved, there is still scope to inprove the operations of the remaining
parastatals (RINI OPVN, ONAHA), to provide better market and price information to farmers,
to curb political interference in local cooperatives and to foster the emergence of mrual
associations that would provide credit, production and marketing services to their members.
7.          Irrigation Development. The Government's irrgation strategy, which for more
than three decades focused on publicly-funded and operated large-scale irrigation schemes, has
now been abandoned because it was costly and unsustainable. The new strategy, which is
supported by IDA and an increasing number of donors, is based on sustained development of
small-scale, privately-owned and operated irrigation systems as a more secure and dependable
approach to greater intensification of agricultural production, employment generation and
reduction of poverty.  It would focus on simple, low-cost and low-risk techniques of
intensification of production in order to ensure efficient and sustainable use of the water and land



3-
resources. Sustainability has some important implications for resource management, in particular,
water conservation, the maintenance of soil fertility and soil physical characteristics.
8.          Prgject Objectves. The proposed project is designed as a pilot to test and
evaluate adoption of improved low-cost technologies for small-scale private irrigation and to test
procedures that will enable the public sector to commission the private sector to deliver a package
of services to small scale irrigation farmers on a contractual basis. By promoting technologies
which meet small-farmer requirements and capabilities, the Project will contribute to enhancing
local capacity for achieving increased small-farmer productivity and incomes and improved rural
well-being. To accomplish these objectives, the project would focus primarily on the poorest
small irrigation farmers and selected private commercial irrigators.
9.          Project Description. The Project would finance (a) the package of services to be
provided directly by the private irrigation association (ANPIP), which has already been
established, including: (i) carrying out promotional campaigns in support of the Government's
private irrigation development strategy, (ii) ficilitating small farmers' access to the legal and
administrative procedures for obtaining tenurial security, (iii) providing assistance, upon demand,
in preparation of bankable irrigation projects and in establishing economic interest groups, and
(iv) overall project implementation, including procurement and contract management,
coordination of project activities and monitoring and evaluation; and (b) the package of traiuing
and technical assistance services which ANPIP will contract out to consulting firms, including:
(i) testing and evaluating small-scale mechanized and manual irrigation technologies;
(ii) promoting grassroots savings and credit schemes; and (iii) project-related evaluation studies
and the periodic audits. In addition, the project would finance the goods and part of the operating
costs for the monitoring of the replenishable shallow aquifers and erosion control works, which
would be conducted by the Ministry of Hydraulics and the Environment. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$7.5 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$4.3 million, or
58 percent of total project cost. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  The amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Niger are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map is attached.
10.         International Water Rights. The riparian states of the Niger River have signed the
1980 Faranah Convention creating the Niger Basin Authority (ABN). Under this Convention, the
member states are obliged to inform the Executive Secretariat of ABN of all projects and works
they might intend to carry out in the Basin. As condition for Board presentation, the Government
has provided evidence of the formal notification of the Basin Authority. Since the activities to be
financed under this Project would be limited to training, technical assistance and on-station
demonstration of tested improved technologies, the project would not have any adverse effect on
water quality and consumption capacity or the biological characteristics of the fauna and flora.
11.         Project Implementation. The project will be implemented under the responsibility
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The Ministry's prnmary function will be to ensure
enforcement of the Framework Agreement (Convention) which defines the terms and conditions
under which the Association Ni-grienne pour la Promotion de l'Irgation Privi (ANPIP) will
implement the Project. ANPIP has already been created. It is an independent institution, with the
legal status of a non-governmental organization. Its Board is drawn from the private sector,



consisting of individual farmers and representatives of irrigation cooperatives in both the rural and
urban areas. ANPIP will follow its own Manual of Procedures and will not be encumbered by
complex, bureaucratic procedures, and will strive to ensure transparency and efficiency in the
implementation of the project without any political interference. The Agency wil be responsible
for the day-to-day execution of the project, except the Envirownental Protection component,
which would be implemented by the Ministry of Hydraulics and the Environment (MOM). As a
condition of Board presentation, the director of ANPIP, with qualifications and terms of reference
acceptable to IDA, has been recruited. In order to ensure expeditious implementation of the
Project, ANPIP would have full authority, without being submitted to any ex ante clearance, for
carrying out the whole process of project execution. ANPIP would, however, be submitted to
close ex post supervision by the Government and will be required to furnish detailed activity
reports.
12.         Proiect Sustainability.  The Project is a pilot operation designed to promote
improved irrigation technologies for small farmers and to test strategies based on better use of
private sector initiatives in the irrigation subsector. Implementation of this strategy will depend
increasingly on private management structures, voluntary farmer groups, NGOs and other private
economic agents, and decreasingly on formal structures. Given the pilot nature of this operation,
sustainability could not be determined a priori. This issue will be carefully examined during the
mid-term review and in the final evaluation of the project. Cost-recovery concerns will receive
attention in the technology and operational aspects of the pilot phase, so that these could be fully
applied in a possible follow-up operation.
13.         Lessons Learned.  A major lesson learned from the Irigation Rehabilitation
Project (OED Report No.12980) is that state intervention in cooperative affairs often leads to
vague group objectives, uncertainty of members' obligations, poorly defined responsibilities, and
absence of sanctions and accountability. A more appropriate strategy is to empower farmers and
other economic agents to form independent economic interest groups or associations in order to
ensure their viability and sustainability. This approach has been incorporated in the design of this
operation. The experience from the above project also illustrates how political interference and
cumbersome administrative procedures hamper the effectiveness of public irrigation agencies in
project implementation. The proposed project will instead be managed by a private irrigation
management agency that will be insulated from government interference. Project design also
benefited from the lessons learned from the AGETIP project in Senegal, with special reference to
the role of a private agency. The Senegal AGETIP demonstrates that such agencies can deliver a
package of services to clients following procedures that ensure transparency, efficiency and
accountability.
14.         Rationale for IDA Involvement. An important component of the Govemnment's
post-devaluation strategy to stimulate supply response is to provide infrastructual support and
adequate delivery of public services to agriculture. This strategy, which recognizes the central
role of agriculture ;n supply response, was reflected in the last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
discussion on May 31, 1994. The adopted CAS underlined the pivotal role of agriculture and
natural resources management in fostering a decentlized and self-sustaining process of
technological development; the CAS also calls for a greater role for the privete sector in the
development of agricultural enterprises, given past unsatisfictory public sector management
Similarly, agriculture is the centerpiece of the country's poverty alleviation progrm, as it
accounts for the lion's share of the private sector. This program places special emphasis on



-5-
employment creation, improvements in rural incomes and enhanced food security. Accordingly,
the lending program supported by the CAS reflects the stated priority for agriculture by
undertaking the proposed project in FY95 followed by a sector-wide adjustment operation in
FY99. With the proposed irrigation project, MDA will contribute to the countly assistance by
building capacity for sustainable private sector investments in small-scale irrigation production
and complementary conunercial activities, as well as encourage the development of grassroots-
level initiatives in rural finance, by promoting savings and credit schemes, and through a package
of training and managerial services for farmers. Also through the project, voluntary groupings
(Groupements d'Interet Economique) would be established to serve as the front line of contact for
extension, as active members of the grassroots savings and loan associations to be created under
this project, and, ultimately, to provide collective guarantees for credit to its members. Suc, ssful
implementation of the project will depend on parallel actions to improve support for research and
extension. It would also depend on mutually reinforcing actions to improve input supplies, credit,
marketing arrangements and farmers' and non-governmental organzations - all of which would
be supported through the project.
15.         Agreed Actions. The success of the project depends on the willingness of the
Government to entrust to the Association of Private irigators (ANPIP) the full responsibility for
executing the project without political or bureaucratic interference, and to provide promptly as
needed, the funds, facilities, services and other resources required for this purpose. It also
depends on the enforcement of the Framework Agreement (the Convention) which outlines the
terms and conditions of the contractual relationship between the Govenunent and the private
association as well as the operational guidelines to ensure transparency, accountability and
efficiency in project implementation. ANPIP has been created as a non-pTofit association, with a
private legal statute, prior to negotiations; and agreements on the basic principles of executing the
project under delegated contract management were reached during negotiations.  The
Government has agreed to provide in its budget amounts sufficient to cover its counterpart
contributions to the costs of the project, and to open and maintain until the completion of the
project an account (the Project Account) in a commercial bank into which it will deposit its annual
counterpart contributions. The IDA Credit would only become effective once the following
actions have been completed: (a) the Borrower shall have enacted and promulgated legislation
establishing a legal regime for Groupements dTintirf Economique. enabling the organization of
farners into economic itrest groups; (b) the Convention in form and substance acceptable to the
Association shall have been signed by the Borrower and ANPIP;  (c) the Borrower and ANPIP
shall each have established a financial management and accounting system for the Project,
acceptable to the Association; (d) the Borrower and ANPIP shall each have subnitted to the
Association their annual work program and budget for the first twelve months after the
Effectiveness Date and acceptable to the Association; (e) the Borrower and ANPIP shall have
signed a multi-year contract with an auditor for the auditing of the Project and ANPIP's accounts,
acceptable to the Association; (f) the Borrower shall have opened the Project Account and
deposited the Initial Deposit therein; and (g) the Borrower and ANPIP shall have submitted to the
Association a procurement plan, acceptable to the Association, covering the procurement required
for the implementation of the Project.
16.         Poverty Category. The great majority of Niger's poor and, hence potentially food
inseuare, are concentrated in the mrual areas. The actions financed under this project would
strgthen the capacity of smallholder farmers to expand irrigated production of food crops. This
will enhance the food security of the rural poor through increases in their food supply. The



- 6-
support to rural microenterprises and the actions designed to facilitate small-farmer access to
financial services and to obtain tenurial security would also improve the distribution of income
and aHleviate rural poverty.
17.         Envirorunental Impact. The environmental category "B" has been assigned to the
project. The environmental assessrmer+ has been undertaken by FAO/CP as part of the normal
work of project preparation. Its major finding is that the project will not have any serious
negative effect on the environment. As a capacity-building operation, it is designed to create the
necessary capacity that will make future on-farm investments ir. the irrigation subsector profitable,
sustainable and enviroiimentally sound. The project will finance activities which will contribute to
better management of environmental resources, including: (a) monitoring shallow aquifer levels
and soil and water quality in the project area to determine ways of safeguarding against
overexploitation of these aquifers in future investment operations, and (b) soil and water erosion
control works in the river valley zone of the project area. By introducing modern techniques for
proper husbandry of the soil and water rrjources, the project would ensure sustainability of the
irrigated hirntg ay-stems in the smalUholder sector.
18.         Progm   Obiective Categories. Overall, the innovations introdu,-ed under this
project would provide private economic agents in Niger's smallholder sector with the technical
and management know-how that is now critically lacking to significantly increase the productivity
of their resources and independent capabilities. A majority of the bereficiaries of this project are
among the rural poor and food insecure. By strengthening their capacity to increase production
of food crops, the Project will help enhance food security. The strategy focus on smallholder
intensification of production, using low-cost low-risk techniques, will permit efficient and
sustainable use of the water and land resources. This would have a positive impact on conserving
the environment.
19.         Participatory Approach. This project is anchored in the principles of stockholder-
participation, especially with respect to its implementation. Project preparation was undertaken
by a local multidisciplinary working group, which prepared comprehensive technical working
papers for the design of project components. A group of Nigeriens, consisting mainly of small-
scale irrigation farmers, a few local government notables and central goverunent representatives
visited the Fadama irrigation operations in Northern Nigeria in order to draw lessons tha. could be
used in designing this new operation. The project will be implemented by an association of
private irrigators (ANPIP), which has already been created as a non-profit association, with a
private legal statute. The Association consists of representatives of smallholder irrigation
cooperatives, individual private commercial farmers (mainly traders, retired civil servants and
village notables) as well as NGOs. This innovative implementation arrangement, whereby the
state agrees to entrust management of public resources to a private association of beneficiaries,
without any limitation on the latter's autonomy and independence, is a veritable example of
fbnners-empowerment and stakeholders-participation. The stakeholders are inspired by the
successes of the AGETIP in Senegal and similar urban-oriented and infriastructure based project
execution agencies, and are determined to replicate these results in the mral setting.
20.          Benefits. The project is an investment in creating capacity for a self-sustaining
process of technological development, with a pay-off spreading over many years. The technology
promotion program would benefit at least 4,000 smallholder firnilies through incresed
productivity and income. This direct benefit would result from their adoption of motorized and/or



-7-
non-motorized pumps which have been designed to meet small fanners' requirements and
capabilities, by making tubewells less expensive, more versatile and easier to install. The project
would also have an added benefit of training artisans to manufacture and repair adapted small-
scale irrigation equipment. Another major direct benefit of the project would be its contributions
to the development of rural financial intermediation. Over the four-year implementation period,
the project would establish about 60 savings and credit associations at the grassroots level which
would provide improved access to financial services to their membership of some 2,500 family
units, or 15,000 persons. The indirect benefits from the cultivation of a savings culture along
mutualist lines, would contribute to significantly improved smallholder-access to financial
services, as the supported actions would ease the risk and high transaction cost that have, until
now, prevented commercial banks from lending to potential rural clients. Other intangible social
benefits include the establishment of a service-oriented private sector agency for irrigation
development, improvement in the social status of women and development of associations/groups
of producer enterprises oriented tcwards solving conmmon problems faced in their income-
generating activities.
21.         Risks. A major risk is that, over time, the Government may subject ANPIP to
bureaucratic controls and pressures of political patronage which could undermine the agency's
autonomy and effectiveness. The Govemment's willingness to use a non-governmental agency to
deliver publicly-funded services for promoting its private-led irrigation development strategy can
be expected to ensure the independence and professionalism of this agency. Regular joint
Goverunent-IDA review of the performance of the agency will also serve to minimize the risk of
undue Government interference. The risk of political patronage will be alleviated by other
safeguards built into the project, including: (a) clearly spelled o-ut and enforceable performance
criteria for ANPIP; and (b) IDA's prior review and approval of ANPIP's annual work program;
and (c) the organization of beneficiaries into solidarity groups which can deny entry to those
outside the target group who may attempt to improperly access project resources. As is true for
most new and inexperienced institutions, a managerial risk may exist with respect to ANPIP,
including the potential for misuse of public fimds. This risk will be minized through personnel
training, adequate internal regulation and monitoring systems, and strict enforcement of the
Agency's operational guidelines (ANPIP's Manual of Procedures). Another risk is the possibility
of the Government being unable to provide counterpart contributions for financing of incremental
operating expenditures, especially in light of past underfunding of operations and maintenance in
the sector. This risk will be minimized by reliance on private sector institutions for project
implementation, and by requiring the Government to make up-front and, subsequently, annual
deposits into an account for payment of its counterpart contributions. Finally, Government
interference through restrictive legislation or unnecessary controls is likely to stifle grassroots
initiatives in financial intermediation. Such a risk would be minimized by requiring the
Government to provide an appropriate legal framework for grassroots savings and loan
associations, as well as a clear regulatory framework for the GIEs, which would ensure
accountability and transparency.
