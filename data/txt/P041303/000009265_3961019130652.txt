MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR AN EMERGENCY DROUGHT RECOVERY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum  and recommendation on a proposed
Emergency Drought Recovery Loan to the Kingdom of Morocco in an amount equivalent to US$100 million
in support of the Government's drought recovery and relief program. The fixed rate single currency loan
package will comprise two tranches: a US$50 million US dollar tranche and a FRF 240 million French franc
tranche, for up to 15 years. For each loan currency tranche, each semester's aggregate disbursements
(disbursed amount) will have a grace period of 3 years and a final maturity of 12 years, both beginning from
the rate fixing date for such disbursed amount.
Background on the Drought Situation
2.    Morocco is currently suffering from a severe drought which is considered to be one of the worst
droughts of this century. The total rainfall of the 1994-1995 agricultural year was exceptionally low
throughout the country, averaging only about 47 percent of normal levels. Except for the Oriental Region
(Map), the entire country has been severely affected. Rainfall was fairly normal until the end of October
1994, but during the critical agricultural month of November 1994 the average rainfall was one third of
normal levels, and this was followed by zero rainfall in December 1994 and January 1995. By the end of
May 1995, the total water inflow into the 20 main reservoirs reached only 28 percent of the average annual
inflow. The major cities of Tanger, Oujda, Marrakech and Agadir are located in the worst affected regions.
Ground water levels are also well below normal. For example, the aquifer supplying Tanger has fallen
11 meters below normal.
3.    Impact on Agriculture. Agricultural GDP is estimated to have fallen by 45 percent over 1994.
Cereals and pulses normally contribute 36 percent of agricultural GDP and livestock 30 percent and these
have been especially hard hit. Only 60% of the five M ha of cereal areas were cultivated. The available
harvest is primarily from irrigated areas (total 800,000 ha). The total cereal harvest is estimated at
1.6 million tons (MT) compared to last year's 9.4 MT. This is 81 percent below the 1994 level and
71 percent below the last five years' annual average of 5.5 MT. Harvests from the main spring crops, maize
and sunflower were also mediocre. Maize harvest fell by 30 percent and sunflower, by 40 percent. With
respect to livestock, it is estimated that the loss of sheep will be 25 percent, and of cattle 20 percent, unless
urgent action is taken to assure feed and water supplies.
4.    Impact on the Overall Economy. The dramatic fall in agricultural output necessarily entails a
direct loss of employment and incomes, especially by landless wage earners, and small and medium
farmers. Agriculture provides employment to at least 40 percent of Morocco's population and within
rural areas, agriculture provides 81 percent of total employment. Small and medium farmers constitute
the majority (80 percent) of rural workforce. A rough estimate of agricultural jobs lost is 100 million
work days, equivalent to an income loss of about 5 billion Dh (about US$600 million). At the sectoral
level, given that agriculture (including agro-industries, forestry and fisheries) constitutes about 23 percent
of GDP, the estimated 45 percent fall in agricultural output has caused a 5% reduction in GDP. The
current account deficit is projected to deteriorate to about 3.5 percent in 1995 due to increased import
demand for foodstuffs and investment goods. The budget deficit (before privatization receipts) is
projected to deteriorate to about 4.7% in 1995 compared with 3.8% in 1994. While the Government of
Morocco (GOM) is taking steps to control expenditures and raise revenues, the current severe drought
makes the task difficult.

5.    The Government's Response. GOM's response to the crisis, though initially slow, has now
gathered momentum. It has formulated an Emergency Drought Relief and Recovery Program (EDRRP)
and put into place institutional mechanisms to handle the crisis. The Program consists of the following
main activities:
(a)    Transport of potable water in tanker vessels and tanker trucks to urban centers, including
Taza, and Azilah;
(b)    Debt relief and rescheduling by the Agriculture Credit Bank (CNCA) in rural areas;
(c)    Stabilizing the livestock herd through the provision of water, imported feed, and
vaccination;
(d)    Provision of seeds;
(e)    Provision of rural public works to build up capacity to mitigate current and future
droughts while providing current income to the most affected rural populations; and
(f)    Formulation of a longer-term drought preparedness strategy.
6.    In addition, GOM intends to import about 2.8 million tons of soft wheat. For the most part,
GOM intends to finance the program with local resources and bilateral credits, and through accelerated
disbursement of about US$ 100 million from existing World Bank agricultural and rural sector loans. In
addition, it has requested a loan of about US$100 million targeted at some key components of the
Program to ensure a successful recovery of agricultural production while building up the capacity to
mitigate the impact of future droughts. These key components, which constitute the proposed project,
are described below.
The Proposed Project
7.     Project Objectives and Strategy. The proposed project will fund specific components of GOM's
EDRRP, which has been prepared with assistance from the FAO Cooperative Program. The main
objectives are to: (a) alleviate the impact of current drought through measures to regenerate productive
capacity in crop and livestock production, improve rural roads and potable water supply, which while
generating current income for the affected populations, will also strengthen the capacity of GOM to
mitigate the impact of future droughts; and (b) assist in enhancing institutional capacity for drought
management. The long-term strategy will be to begin the process of reducing the vulnerability of rural
populations to severe drought. This will be achieved through improved preparedness, better rural
infrastructure to allow Government to reach affected populations quicker with food, water, and
agricultural inputs, more reliable drinking water supplies, and better management of natural resources.
The drought preparedness and rural roads components will make a small but important contribution to
this long term strategy.
8.    Project Description. The main criteria used to determine the components for financing are:
(a) ability to target a package of investments to benefit victims of the drought; (b) execution of key
actions within a project period of about two years (28 months), and disbursement within a three year time
period; (c) responsiveness to Government's EDRRP; and (d) incrementality to the ongoing and planned
Government and donor assistance. The project will be targeted to rural areas, particularly in the north
and west, where the drought is most severe. Similarly the water supply component was reduced in size
as bilateral French assistance is available and other donor assistance is planned. Consequently, the
project will have the following components, which are described in greater detail in the Technical Annex



-3-
and working papers:
(i)    Agricultural Inputs. The drought has drastically reduced supplies of certified seeds for
cereal cultivation during the next agricultural campaign. The project will provide for
acquisition of about 70,000 tons of barley and wheat seeds. Local distribution will also
be facilitated through 350 National Seeds Marketing Company (SONACOS) selling
points. (Details in the Technical Annex and Working Paper II - A).
(ii)    Livestock Production.  To maintain productivity of the important livestock sector,
Morocco normally imports only about 264,000 tons of feed, since it has ample local
production of barley and also availability of rangeland forage. Because of drought
however, local production of feed has fallen by 70 to 80%. There is a serious danger that
the national livestock inventory will be severely depleted and rebuilding of household
flocks will take several years. Therefore, Morocco intends to increase feed imports to
limit destocking to a maximum of 10 percent. The project will provide for about
500,000 tons of incremental feed, of which about 350,000 tons will be Bank-financed.
GOM and beneficiaries will finance the balance. Provision of water and vaccination for
the livestock will also be intensified. (Details in the Technical Annex and Working Paper
Il-B).
(iii)   Water. To alleviate the impact of the current as well as future droughts, the project will
include construction of about 1,850 wells in rural areas, 650 boreholes, 170 rain
harvesting points, and rehabilitation of 500 springs. Supply of potable water will also
be improved to 56 rural centers and 250 villages hardest hit by the drought, especially
in the North-west and North-central regions. This component will be limited to those
centers that are most seriously affected and where sufficient investigations have already
been carried out to verify ground water availability. Labor-intensive, traditional
techniques for well digging will be used whenever possible to increase income. (Details
in the Technical Annex and Working Paper III).
(iv)   Rural Roads. To alleviate the drought impact, the rural roads component will improve
the access of rural populations to social services and will ensure speedy and economical
food and feed transport. The rural roads network comprises about 38,000 kms. It is
proposed under the project to rehabilitate 600 kms of these and to upgrade about 900 kms
of existing tracks. Drought-prone areas with limited access will be targeted. (Details in
the Technical Annex and Working Paper IV).
(v)    Improving Future Drought Preparedness. Some of the components mentioned above,
such as the digging of wells, will improve overall capacity of the country to meet future
droughts. In addition, an early warning system will be developed to provide farmers
with advice regarding alternative cropping strategies in the event drought appears
imminent.  The project will strengthen GOM's agricultural monitoring system, in
particular to monitor the agricultural and environmental impacts of drought, and based
on this, to develop strategies and actions to mitigate the impact of future droughts. It will
focus particularly on the development of a better livestock management strategy. To
reduce the risk of disruptions in seed supply, the program of seed production in irrigated
areas will be strengthened. (Details in the Technical Annex and Working Paper V).
9.     Project Financing. The project cost of about US$334 million will be financed by the proposed
fixed rate single currency loan (FRSCL) package of US$100 million equivalent comprising two equal
tranches in US dollars and French francs (para. 1). GOM is eligible for single currency loan terms, since



- 4 -
it has authorized conversion of all its VLR82 loans. Including the proposed loan, single currency loans
to Morocco will aggregate to US$350 million equivalent, about 47% percent of Bank's planned FY96
lending to Morocco of about US$750 million. GOM has considered the Bank's alternative loan terms--
Currency Pool Loan, LIBOR-Based Single Currency Loan, and FRSCL - and has selected FRSCL in US$
and FRF in order to improve the management of its external liabilities. The choice of the two currencies
reflects the weight of the currencies (about 35% each) in Morocco's foreign exchange receipts. The
choice of fixed rate reflects GOM's desire to limit exposure to interest rate volatility in view of its current
exposure in floating rate loans, which account for 45% of its external debt. GOM and beneficiaries will
finance US$234 million. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement are shown in Schedule B, and the procedures
are discussed in the Technical Annex. A timetable of key processing events and the status of Bank Group
Operations in Morocco are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Procurement actions have already
been started and some contracts for livestock feed, wells, and boreholes awarded. Retroactive financing
of up to 20% of the loan amount for eligible payments made within four months of the date of loan
signing would be permitted. The proposed procurement arrangements for the project are described in
Schedule B to the MOP.
10.   Project Implementation. The proposed project will be implemented under the supervision of
a high level Inter-ministerial Commission chaired by the Prime Minister with key ministers as its
members, including those for Finance, Agriculture, Public works, Public Health and Interior. The
Commission has already been constituted and has met several times. The Ministry of Agriculture
(MAMVA) will provide the secretariat for the Commission, and the secretariat has already been
constituted with adequate staff. A special supervision and monitoring unit has been set up directly under
the MAMVA's Secretary General to follow the progress of the EDRRP. It will be responsible for
implementing all components of the project except rural water supply and rural roads components, which
will be managed by the Ministry of Public Works (MTP) and the National Water Supply Authority
(ONEP). Under the supervision of MAMVA, SONACOS will be responsible for seeds procurement and
the National Cereals Marketing Agency (ONICL) is responsible for coordination and overall monitoring
of livestock feed imports. They have long experience with such activities and sufficient capacity to
implement the program. The detailed project implementation plan is included in the Technical Annex.
11.   Lossons Learned.  The project has drawn on the experience of other recent emergency
operations. The main lessons, which have been incorporated into the project design are: (a) emergency
operations should be a part of a comprehensive Government recovery program being assisted by donors;
(b) investments should be targeted to the most affected regions; (c) Government organizational structure
should be adapted and a high level co-ordination commission should be set up; and (d) early procurement
actions should be initiated. The high level commission under the Prime Minister for coordination of
EDRRP has already been set up and more than 50% of tenders have been launched. This should ensure
timely implementation.
12.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. Morocco is facing its worst drought of the century, which
has resulted in a 5% decline in GDP. A disproportionate burden of the drought has fallen on the
agriculture-based rural areas, where most of the country's poor reside. GOM's ability to cope with the
drought is constrained by deteriorating current account and budget deficits. Bank support for the proposed
project is justified for the following reasons. First, it will allow GOM to protect and restore the
productive capacity of the rural population. Second, by improving potable water supply and rural roads,
the project would strengthen GOM's capacity to supply water and food to rural communities during future
droughts. And, third, the project would enable the Bank to assist the GOM to strengthen the institutional
framework for improving drought preparedness. This is important, because droughts in Morocco are
occurring with increasing frequency.



- 5 -
13.   Agreed Actions. During appraisal, agreement was reached that livestock feed will be imported
by the private sector under ONICL coordination, and seeds procured by SONACOS, both of which have
requisite capacity. Feed and seeds will be targeted to the most drought affected rural areas, where most
of Morocco's poor live. Agreement was reached that only those rural works components that have been
identified previously under feasibility studies and where procurement actions can be completed quickly
will be included in the project so that the project can be completed quickly.
14.   Environmental Aspects. The drought is having a negative impact on the fragile natural resource
base in the affected areas. Reduced soil cover accelerates soil erosion and reduced water flow in the
rivers concentrates pollution. These problems require longer-term actions, which will be included in
regular investment projects now under preparation. A proposed Watershed Management Project will
include measures to protect soil from erosion, and the proposed Environmental Management II and Water
Sector Investment Loans will include measures to reduce water pollution. Potable water wells will be
designed with adequate covers to avoid pollution. Exploratory drilling will be made to assure that
adequate water resources of potable quality exist before digging begins. Proper drainage facilities will
be provided to the new rural roads so as to avoid soil erosion.
15.   Benefits. The project will protect and restore the productive capacity of the rural population by
ensuring that sufficient, quality seed be available before the next rains, which are expected between
October and December 1995. Furthermore, improved livestock feed supplies will limit the reduction in
flock/herd to less than 10% of current levels. A cost-benefit analysis of this component shows a net
present value of about US$ 340 million (at 10% OCC). The rural potable water supply will ensure that
the population does not depend on poor quality surface drinking water, which has further deteriorated
because of the concentration of pollution resulting from the drought. Better health of the rural population
will have the additional benefit of maintaining their productivity. It has important social benefits also.
A recently completed study of the role and status of women in rural Morocco has shown that women,
especially young girls, spend a major part of their time collecting water and this prevents them from
attending schools. More secure supplies of water nearer their homes will allow more young girls to
attend school. For the rural roads component, cost/benefit analysis done prior to the emergency, and
excluding drought related benefits show economic rates of return of above 30%, and highly positive net
present values. Drought related benefits have not been included in the analysis because they are difficult
to quantify.
16.   Risks. The main project risk will be the continuation of the drought for another year. In that
case the project will need to give more emphasis to the rural potable water component. Another risk will
be delay in project implementation. This risk has been mitigated by identifying project components, that
can be implemented quickly and by taking early actions on procurement for works. More than half of
the program has already been tendered.
17.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed Loan complies with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the Loan.
