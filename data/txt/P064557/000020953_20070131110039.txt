Project development objective Ref: PAD B.2, TechnicalAnnex 3
The project development objectives are to improve the capacity o f schools to educate a rapidly
increasing number o fprimary-level students; andthat o fthe Government o f Burundito carry out
policy analysis, strategic planning andprogram implementation. The first objective responds to
the widely-accepted andurgentpriority that the Government givesto providing immediate and
direct support to schools inorder to cope with the rapidexpansion o f participation inprimary
school. This rapid expansion has been caused by the pent-up demand inthe immediate post-
conflict period and the abolition o f school fees. Failure to provide timely assistance to schools as
the system expands could result inthe slowing or eventhe reversal o fthis trendtowards full
primary enrollment. Inthis context, the overwhelming majority o f project fundingis focused on
these urgent goals, which are normal ina post-conflict reconstructionenvironment. The second
objective responds to the equally well-justified priority that the Government gives to rapidly
buildingits capacity to plan andmanage the education sector, which will assist inthe completion
o f an in-depthaction planthat will, inturn, increase the likelihood o f attracting more external
funding for its programs, including possible fundingfrom EducationFor All-Fast Track
Initiative membership.
Project description[one-sentence summary of each component] Ref: PAD B.3.a, Technical
Annex 4
Component 1. Expansion of School Facilities (US$ 8.15 million). The objective o f this
component i s to contribute to the expansion o f primary enrollment on an equitable basis inorder
to reach universal completion by 2015. It will respond to the significant increase inthe rate of
enrollment by expanding school infrastructure through supporting the MINEDUC's school
infrastructure triennial plan (2007-2009).       This component will focus on the nine most
disadvantaged provinces interms o f enrollment rates and facilities, providingthe construction of
about 220 new classrooms, the rehabilitation o f around 200 classrooms, the construction o f 60
lodges for teachers, the construction o f 40 wells and the provision o f school furniture and
relevant instructional equipment to all schools involved inthe Project.
Component 2. Support for Teaching and Learning (US$6.6 million). The objective o f this
component i s to contribute to maintain or improve student acquisitions through supporting: (i)
the introduction of new in-service programs and devices to train teachers, schools directors and
inspectors; (ii) provision o f textbooks and pedagogic materials for all students at the primary
                the
level and three subject textbooks for lower secondary students, and setting up a textbooks
management mechanism; and (iii)       the measurement o f learning outcomes undertaking a rapid
assessment o f reading competency in a sample o f primary schools throughout Burundi for each
year o fthe Project.

Component3. Building capacity inMINEDUC (US$4.25 million).The objective ofthis
component is to improve the capacity ofthe Government of Burundito carry out policy analysis,
strategic planning andprogram implementation. Building Government's capacity to planand
manage the education sector will, inturn, increasethe likelihood of attracting more external
funding for its programs, includingmembershipinthe Education For All -Fast Track Initiative.

I. STRATEGICCONTEXTANDRATIONALE


   A. Country and sector issues


1.      Since 2000, Burundi has made considerable progress towards peace and political
reconciliation and taking the first steps towards economic and social recovery. It i s gradually
emerging from more than 10 years o f instability and civil conflict that took a heavy toll on
humanlives and the country's economic and social structures. Peace and cease fire agreements
have been signed with the last armed movement, and a post-conflict constitution was adopted by
referendum in February 2005 followed by voting o f local councils and legislative bodies that
culminated withthe election o f a new government inAugust 2005. As a result, security has been
restored throughout most o f the country. However, the social crisis remains severe, social
services delivery i s weak and social capital has been eroded. On the economic front, economic
growth resumed in 2001 and 2002 and accelerated since 2004 through the implementation of a
solid economic program supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World
Bank.InAugust 2005, Burundireached a HIPC decisionpoint.

2.      Under such circumstances, education is a key factor for sustainable peace. If access to
education can be scaled up at all levels, it will reduce the social exclusion that has marked
Burundi since independence. Today's reality is that education reaches only a limitedportion of
the population: only 43% of adults are literate (53% males versus 32% o ffemales). The current
primary school enrollment rate (GER) has significantly surpassedthe pre-crisis, long-term level',
with a GER of 80% in2003/04 and close to 100% in2005/06 (increase due to the elimination of
school fees that started inthat school year). However, completion rate i sjust 37% and only 47%
o f those children that start first grade finish the primary cycle in 2005. At the secondary level,
the GER o f 13% is below the average for Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (25%). Disparities in
education outcomes among gender and regions are huge: a) females comprise 45% o f the
students at the primarylevel, 41% at the secondary level, and 25% at the university level and; b)
GER goes from 130% inthe city o f Bujumbura to 50% inthe provinces o fNgozi and Muyinga.
The quality o f education has also deteriorated severely due to the conflict and insecurity. To
bring in more pupils, a double-shift system was put in place (60% o f children participate in
double-shift), but that cut teaching time per pupil by 20%. Repetition rates are more alarming:
28% for grades 1st to 4th o f primary, 37% for gth grade and 44% for gfhgrade. Teacher
allocation i s extremely inefficient and there are serious shortages o f trained teachers in some
regions.

3.      Public spending on education has significantly increased from an average o f 3.3% o f the
GDP inrecent years to 4.6 % in2005 to more than 6% o f GDP in2006 due to the availability o f

'Bythe early 1980suniversal primaryeducation was the priority aim: interms of school attendance, enrollment
increasedfrom 29% in 1981to 73% in 1991. Protracted conflict inthe last decade sharpened disparities and
devastatedthe education sector. During the civil unrest (1994-1997) enrollment rates decreasedto lessthan 50%.


                                                         6

additional resources, importantly Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) funds (the SSA
average i s 3.9 % o f GDP). In this context, the distribution among educational levels has also
improved with regards to primary, which has achieved approximately 50% o f total education
sector budget, in line with the Education for All - Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) minimum
level and the regional average. However, 22% o ftotal education sector budget i s still allocated to
higher education, a level with lessthan 1% ofall studentsenrolled inthe system.

4.      Burundi eliminated school fees in September 2005, a decision that has resulted in a
significant increase in first grade enrollment. The latest government data (November 2006)
indicate an increase infirst grade enrollment from 261,000 inschool year 2004/05 to 459,457 in
2005/06 (about 75%). The total primary level enrollment has reached 1,309,369 students (an
increase o f around 27% withrespect to 2004/2005). However, many o fthese new studentsare in
precarious circumstances or still without a place in school. The "free school" policy, therefore,
impacted the education budget in three ways: a) the replacement o f the expenditures financed
with the former school fees revenues (formerly not included in the budget) went primarily to
finance Ministryo fNational Education and Culture (MinistBre de 1'Education et de la Culture -
MINEDUC) administration; b) leading to the recruitment o f 6,500 additional teachers during
2005 and 2006 (an increased o f about 37% o f teachers) and; c) other expenditures (transfers to
schools, university, etc). These recurrent costs were already absorbed in the 2006 budget: the
recurrent annual fiscal impact has represented an increase o f more than 65% with respect to the
2004 budget. In terms o f capital expenditures the enrollment increase led to a need for the
construction and equipment o f about 3,400 new classrooms over the next four years. Even
though capital expenditures have also increased due to availability o f HIPC and external funds,
the absorption capacity remains very weak.

Government Strategy

5.      Improvement inaccess to and quality o f education i s the priority inthe new government
strategy as part o f the nation's recovery strategy. In line with objectives for EFA (Burundi has
had endorsed the Dakar 2000) the new government created a team at MINEDUC to produce a
comprehensive Strategy Note. A draft o fthe Strategy Note has already beenproduced, validated
and formally presented to all financial and technical partners in October 2006. The recently
completed Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) is inline with education Strategy Note. The
Bank and the donors have significantly helpedthe Government in this process. The Country
Status Report (CSR) on Education and its long-term simulation model exercise were key
instruments in setting priorities and in framing the strategy in a fiscally sustainable way in the
medium-and long-term. The main principles o f the Strategy Note are to: a) expand access and
retention at the primary level to reach universal completion by 2015 (in accordance with this
EFA strategy, the first andmost importantpolicy measure takenby the new government was the
elimination o f school fees); b) improve quality and pertinence at all levels; c) improve equity and
efficiency in the allocation o f education resources; d) improve human resources, administrative
and information management; and to e) manage the transition between education cycles to
ensure a sustainable path to 2015.


                                                 7

6.      Efforts in the short term will be focused on expanding and rehabilitating facilities
ensuring the availability of minimum supplies, deploying teachers where there are shortages and
organizing teacher training. Inaddition, the following key actions need to be undertakeninorder
to reach the objective of universal quality primary education as well as improving access and
quality in secondary and higher education levels: i)improve the quality of teacher training; (ii)
provide guides, textbooks and learning materials to teachers and students; (iii)
                                                                               reinforce planning
capacities and develop an information system (including a School Map); (iv) reduce repetition
rates; (v) introduce a post-primary policy on vocational training; and (vi) improve the relevance
of post-primary education inline with labor marketneeds.

   B. Rationalefor Bank involvement

7.      The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) set out a road map for Bank support to Burundi for
FY06-FY07. The ISN reflects the outcome o f the consultations with stakeholders and is fully
aligned with priorities set forth in Burundi's PRSP. The formulation of a full PRSP was
launched inMay 2004 by the Government with the support o f the Bank and other donors and it
was completed, through an intensive consultation process, in August 2006. In particular, the
education chapter ofthe PRSP is fully inline with the education StrategyNote.

8.      All development partners have reconfirmed their engagement to coordinate areas of
intervention (Belgian Cooperation (Cooperation Technique Belge - CTB), Department for
International Development (DffD), French Development Agency (Agence Francaise de
Developpement - AFD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and United Nations
Education, Scientific & Cultural Organization (UNESCO)). To date, this coordination has been
successful having already held four multi-donors missions, including policy discussions carried
out in the framework o f the Project's preparation, the presentation of the CSR, long term
financing debates, discussion of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and
development of the Strategy Note and a preliminary action plan. Coordination will continue
throughout project implementation and during the preparation of other donors' contributions,
addressing the entire government strategy'for the sector which means supporting multiple needs
and policy issues at primary education level and the development of the other sub-sectors
(secondary, technical-vocational, and higher education). Inthis framework, donors have agreed
to support Burundito seek EFA - FTI endorsement inwhich framework harmonized assistance
will beput inplace.

   C. Higher levelobjectives to which the project contributes

9.      The Education Sector Reconstruction Project (Projet d'Appui a la Reconstruction du
SystBme EducatifBurundais -PARSEB) contributes to the higher level objectives of the I S Nand
the PRSP. A key element in the consolidation of the country's economic growth, poverty
reduction and mitigation of existing high social risk is to build human capital. The provision of
better quality education i s a strategic approach to generate a skilled labor force, a necessary


                                                 8

conditionfor economic growth. The Project will assist Burundiinmitigating the current post-
conflict context and facilitating the "free school" policy in the education sector to reach the
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) by 2015 and, at the same time, it will provide the
building blocks for the solid development of a medium- and long-term sector program the
framework inwhichBurundiwill seek EFA-FTImembership.



11.     PROJECT DESCRIPTION

   A. Lendinginstrument

 10.    The lendinginstrumentfor the Project is an IDA grant for the amount of aroundUS$20
million. The Project is a Sector InvestmentLoan(SIL), which is justified by the weak fiduciary
 systems and managementcapacity inMINEDUC. Inthis context, the Project seeks to help the
 Governmentinaddressingemergency needs, buildingthe foundationfor developingmainsector
policies and programs, building capacity and introducingadequate procedures to execute sector
actions.

   B. Projectdevelopment objectiveand key indicators

 11.    The project development objectives (PDO) are to improve the capacity of schools to
educate a rapidly increasingnumber of primary-levelstudents; and that of the Government of
Burundito carryout policy analysis, strategicplanningandprogramimplementation.

 12.    The first objective responds to the widely-accepted and urgent priority that the
Governmentgivesto providingimmediateanddirect support to schools inorder to cope with the
rapidexpansionof participationinprimaryschool. This rapidexpansionhas beencausedby the
pent-updemandinthe immediatepost-conflictperiodandthe abolitionof schoolfees. Failureto
provide timely assistance to schools as the system expands could result in the slowing or even
the reversal of this trend towards full primary enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming
majority of project funding is focused on these urgent goals, which are normalina post-conflict
reconstructionenvironment. The secondobjective respondsto the equally well-justifiedpriority
that the Government gives to rapidly building its capacity to plan and manage the education
sector, which will assist in the completion of an in-depthaction plan that will, in turn, increase
the likelihood of attracting more external funding for its programs, including possible funding
from EFA-FTI membership. Project specific indicators and benchmarks for monitoring the
achievement of these objectives are discussed in the section in the context of the results
framework (Annex 3).

  C. Projectcomponents

Component1.Expansionof SchoolFacilities(US$8.15 million)

13.     The objective o f this component is to contribute to the expansion o f primary enrollment
on an equitable basis in order to reach universal completion by 2015. It will respond to the
significant increase in the rate o f enrollment by expanding school infrastructure through
supporting the MINEDUC's school infrastructure triennial plan (2007-2009). This component
will focus on the nine most disadvantaged provinces interms o f enrollment rates and facilities,
providing the construction o f about 220 new classrooms, the rehabilitation o f around 200
classrooms, the construction o f 60 lodges for teachers, the construction o f 40 wells and the
provision o f school furniture and relevant instructional equipment to all schools involved inthe
Project.

Component2. Supportfor TeachingandLearning(US$6.6 million)

14.     The objective o f this component is to contribute to maintain or improve student
acquisitions through supporting: (i) introduction o f new in-service programs and devices to
                                       the
train teachers, schools directors and inspectors; (ii) the provision of textbooks and pedagogic
materials for all students at the primary level and three subject textbooks for lower secondary
students, and setting up a textbooks management mechanism; and (iii) measurement of
                                                                              the
learning outcomes undertaking a rapid assessment o f reading competency ina sample o fprimary
schools throughout Burundifor each year o fthe Project.

(i)    Sub-component 2.1. Training of teachers, schools directors and inspectors (U$S 2.44
       million). This sub-component aims to increase teaching quality through introducing new
       in-service programs and modules to train teachers, schools directors and inspectors. The
       sub-component will support four activities: (i)the training o f about 2,950 unqualified
       primary teachers; (ii) in-service training o f all teachers; (iii) training o f 2,200
                               the                                          the
       school directors and 149 inspectors; and (iv) the technical assistance (TA) to develop new
       programs and the acquisition o f necessary equipment to carry out the proposed training
       activities.

(ii)   Sub-component 2.2. Provision and management of textbooks and learning materials
       (USS4.0 million). This sub-component aims to contribute to improve learning outcomes
       through: (i)  providing one textbook o f reading inFrench and Kirundi for each student at
       3rd, 4`h, 5*, and 6`h grades in primary level; (ii)
                                                         one textbook for three students at lower
       secondary level ("colleges ") in Mathematics, Biology, Kirundi, French and English; (iii)
       one textbook and one guide for all primary and lower secondary teachers; and (iv) the
       development and capacity building related to the procurement and management o f
       textbooks and learning materials.




                                                 10

(iii)  Sub-component 2.3. Measurement of learning outcomes (US$ 0.16 million). This sub-
       component aims to introduce an instrument to measure learning outcomes by introducing
       rapid assessment techniques to determine reading competency, which will allow for
       evaluating the impact o f measures undertaken to improve or maintain quality. The rapid
       reading assessment will be carried out each year o f the Project. The results from the first
       year o f the Project will allow for the establishment o f a baseline (year one) and to begin
       and to evaluate corrective measures throughout the Project life.


Component3. BuildingcapacityinMINEDUC (US$4.25 million).

15.     The objective ofthis component is to improve the capacity ofthe Government o fBurundi
to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation. Building
Government's capacity to plan and manage the education sector will, in turn, increase the
likelihood o f attracting more external fwnding for its programs, including membership in the
EFA -FTI.

(i)    Sub-component 3.1 Institution building and strategy development (US$ 2.95 million).
       This component aims to improve the capacity o f the Government o f Burundito carry out
       policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation. Building MINEDUC's
       capacity to plan and manage the education sector will, in turn, increase the efficiency o f
       the public sector expenditure and facilitate Burundi to access to EFA-FTI's
       membership. In order to achieve this objective the sub-component will support three
       activities: (i)TA to assist MINEDUC indeveloping policies and reforms to improve the
       quality o f education, build institutional capacity in management and planning and
       elaborate policy notes and action plans for health and nutrition and for each sub-sector in
       particular in secondary, technical-vocational and higher education; (ii) acquisition o f
                                                                                  the
       most urgent equipment for the Provincial Education Department (De'partementProvincial
       de I'Education - DPE), the General Directorate o f Pedagogical Offices (Direction
       General de Bureaux Pe'dagogique - DGBP) and the Office o f Education Planning
       (Bureaux de la Planijkation de Z'Education - BPE) and motorcycles for all regional
       inspectors; and (iii)training, workshops and study tours to complement activities
       described in(i).

(ii)   Sub-component 3.2. Project Management (US$1.3 million). This sub-component aims
       to create capacity at the Executive Operational Secretariat (Secretariat Exe'cutif
       Ope'rationnel - SEO) to effectively:      (i)coordinate the work ofthose incharge of
       component implementation; (ii)manage IDA financing; (iii)          handle procurement and
       financial management; (iv) monitor project implementation and results framework; and
       (v) buildcapacity infiduciary management at MINEDUC.

  D. Lessons learnedand reflected inthe project design

16.    The recommendations o f Bank's specialists were sought during a Quality Enhancement
Review (QER) in order to gather lessons relevant to project design. In particular, the team
requested advice on the best way to move from a Bank's SIL to joint multi-donor support
(Sector-wide Approach - SWAP) intwo/three years and ina FTIframework, the convenience to
include upfiont a sub-component on supporting the creation and enhancement o f School
Management Committees (SMC), and which would be an outcome indicator to measure quality
improvementsAearning achievements. In addition to the issues raised by the Team, the QER
meetingprovided some suggestions which were taken into account inthe Project's final design.
A summary o f main conclusion were: (i) Bank should promote the objectives o f donor
                                             the
coordination and harmonization and Burundi EFA-FTI's           endorsement which would help in
reaching a formal agreement on a common set o f objectives and measurable indicators for the
sector, and harmonizing funding and implementation procedures; (ii)       the Project's structure
needs to be simplified in the context o f the limited implementation capacity by grouping and
reducing the number o f sub-components; (iii)in order to simplify contracting and to ensure
consistent technical advice, the TA for sub-component 3.1 will be provided under a "Partnership
Agreement" with one TA provided by an international institution; (iv) the creation o f SMCs
should be discussed inthe framework o f FTI's program; (v) to measure learning outcomes, the
Project must include financing to undertake a rapid assessment o f reading competency in a
sample o f primary schools throughout Burundiduring each o f the four years. This proposal was
based on the Bank's policy o f ensuring that all projects that aim to improve or maintain quality
include at least some means to measure the impact o f project support on learning outcomes; (vi)
concerning the results framework, the PDO on "improving the capacity o f the Government o f
Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation", the
outcome will be the acceptance o f Burundiinto the EFA-FTI, which requires the development o f
an EFA-FTI-endorsed education strategy.



  E. Alternatives considered andreasons for rejection

17.    The proposed lending instrumentis a SIL. A SIL was considered the only possibility in
the short run since the intention to prepare a SWAP combined with pooled resources from
different donors was not possible for the following reasons:        (i)SWAPs require efficient
coordination and harmonization among donors, it was not possible to achieve this due to the
different timing infinancial assistance and difficulties inharmonizing fiduciary arrangements in
the short term; (ii)SWAPs tend to require complex implementation arrangements while
MINEDUC has almost no experience inproject management; (iii)        SWAPs require a sector plan
and mainpolicies/programs inplace, which is not the case for Burundi so far. Eventhough this
context made it difficult to proceed with a SWAP, donors' financial assistance has been
coordinated in terms o f areas o f intervention.    The medium-term objective for all financial
partners i s to advance towards a harmonization o f funding, implementation arrangements and
procedures inthe framework o fBurundiEFA-FTImembership.

111.    IMPLEMENTATION

    A. Partnershiparrangements

 18.    All development partners in Burundi (UNICEF, UNESCO, BTC, DFID, AFD, French
 Cooperation, FlemishCooperation, and other main sector stakeholders such as the World Food
 Program (ProgrammeAlimentaire Mondiale -PAM) and NGOs coordination) are fully engaged
 incoordinating areas ofintervention. This coordination has beencarried out through four multi-
 donors missions, including policy discussions carried out in the framework of the Project's
 preparation, CSR's presentation, and long-term financing debates.            The coordination of
 assistance aims to address the government strategy for the sector which means supporting
 multiple needs and policy issues at primary education level and the development of the other
 sub-sectors (secondary, technical-vocational, and higher education). UNICEF has been chosen
 by all donors as the local coordinator, a function that has beencarried out inahighly satisfactory
 manner. UNICEF (supported by DFID and Japanese grants) and the BTC have already started
 supporting the primary-level inthe framework ofthe 2006 emergency program, mainly financing
 school furniture, classrooms andtextbooks. AFD and DFID are planning their operations for the
 second part of 2007. Inthis framework, donors have agreedto support Burundito seek EFA-FTI
 endorsement in which the framework for a SWAP would be put in place in order to ensure
 harmonization o f funding, implementation arrangements and eventually also fiduciary
 procedures. A PartnershipAgreement has beenagreed among all financial andtechnical partners
 providingthe foundation for this process.

 19.    All development partners agreed on the process of preparation of the sector plan, its
 action plan and related documents to be presented for EFA-FTI membership. The main
 orientations of the plan are already set, but detailed policy actions and more detailed long-term
 indicators still need to be defined. MINEDUC has confirmed the long-term scenario until 2015
 (shown in Annex 9), which donors find sustainable. Development partners also agreed that
 because the country is coming out of an emergency situation, it is important that support is
 provided on emergency basis. However, donors still needto agree on what type o f support the
 EFA-FTIcan provide for the medium- and long-term, based on an assessment of key activities
 andtheir financing to ensure coherenceinthe system.

 20.    Inthis context, important agreementsand decisions have already beenjointly taken: (i)
 four key activities for sector plan development have been agreed on, to be executed with the
 support of the Education Program Development Fund (EPDF) and managed in a coordinated
 manner (institutional assessment, school infrastructure triennial plan, support for development o f
 an action planandMETF and communication and dissemination activities); (ii) will provide
                                                                                   IDA
 training for MINEDUC's officials in the use of the simulation model; (iii)         to appraise the
 educationplanfor EFA-FTI's endorsmentby development partners. Some sections ofthe action
 plan still need to be refined, mainly in post-primary levels, confirming the importance of the


                                                  13

long-term view of the whole sector in the scenario chosen by MINEDUC. The next steps in
program preparation consist of holding a fifth multi-donor mission by February 2007 before the
Donors Round Table that will take place inMarch2007. During this mission, MINEDUC will
present an updatedversion of the Strategy Note, an advancedversion of the action plan for next
three years and the final version of the MTEF. In addition, a final appraisal o f the EFA-FTI
program, action plan and long-term financing framework would be provided by the end of 2007
inorder to achievefinal endorsement.

21.      Interms of institutional implementation arrangements, an important agreementhas been
reachedbetween MINEDUC and donors setting a common institutional structure that will be in
charge of managing funds/projects from all donor sources. The institutional and implementation
arrangements involve the Committee for Coordination and Monitoring of the Implementation of
the Education and Training Sector Policy (Comite de Coordination et de Suivi de la Mise en
Euvre de la Politique Sectorielle de I'Education et la Formation - CCSPS), responsible for
overall policy direction and project execution oversight with its SEO, as a specific structure to
coordinate the implementation of all external resources/projects including its fiduciary
management as needed. A detailed explanation of these arrangements i s shown inthe following
section.

   B. Institutionaland implementationarrangements

22.      MINEDUC will assume overall responsibility for coordination andimplementation of the
Project, including procurement, disbursement and financial management in a framework of a
common institutional structure incharge o fmanaging funds/projects from all donor sources. The
institutional and implementation arrangementsinvolve four organizational levels: (i) CCSPS
                                                                                       the
will be responsible for overall policy direction and project/donor activities oversight; (ii)   the
SEO of the CCSPS will be responsible for the Projects general coordination, fiduciary
management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the Project; (iii) Technical Execution
                                                                         the
Committee (Comite Technique d'Execution - CTE) of the CCSPS will be responsible for
providing technical policy orientation and oversight of the implementation o f each specific part
of the sector planand projects/donors support; (iv) the MINEDUC's Technical Directorates will
be responsible of the execution of components 2 and 3 whereas the implementation of
component 1will be delegatedto the Burundian Agency for Implementation o f Works of Public
Interest (Agence Burundais pour la Rialisation des Travaux d'Intir&t Public - ABUTIP) under
the general supervision o fMINEDUC through the SEO.

23.     During project preparation, the Bank has carried out an in-depth evaluation of the
fiduciary capacity of MINEDUC, having concluded that minimal conditions have not yet been
satisfied in order to delegate these functions to MINEDUC. Consequently, the SEO has been
created within the CCSPS as a specific structure to coordinate the implementation of external
resources including its fiduciary management when applicable. MINEDUC and donors have
agreedthat this will be a transitional arrangement while setting the basis for establishing a long-
term common institutional management arrangement to manage donors' funds. To achieve this


                                                14

objective an assessment followed by an action plan that will be carried out during the first year
o fthe Project (financed by DFID andAFD and supported by the Bank) to identify common long-
term arrangementswith the aim o f harmonizing fiduciary mechanisms inthe context o fresources
canalized in the framework o f SWAP supporting the EFA - FTI program. This will decrease
transaction costs and increase the efficiency inthe execution from all donors' sources.

24.     Committee for Coordination and Monitoring o f the Implementation o f the Education and
Training Sector Policv (CCSPS). The CCSPS will be responsible for the strategic orientation o f
the sector policy and the coherence o f programming o f all projectshnding activities and the
monitoring and oversight o f sector policy and projects/funding implementation. The CCSPS is
chaired by the MINEDUC and composed by the executive secretary o f SEO, the director o f the
BPE, and representatives from the Vice Presidency, the Ministry o f Finance, Ministryo f Interior
and Public Security andthe Ministryo f Planning, Development andNational Reconstruction.

25.     More precisely, the CCSPS will have the following responsibilities, to: (i) the    define

30.     Technical Directorates (DT). The execution o f components 2 and 3 will be carried out by
the DT o f MINEDUC responsible for the respective areas o f intervention under the general
coordination o f SEO. The DT responsible for each component will be in charge o f operational
and technical execution (except inthe case o f Component 1 which has a special arrangement).
Therefore, each responsible Technical Director will be the respective Component's coordinator
inthe case of components 2 and 3. The Technical Directors will manage the component under
the general oversight o f the respective responsible Technical Units o f the CTE in charge o f
sector policy development and oversight:     (i) Component 1 under the general supervision o f
Technical Unit 1 "Access and Equity"; (ii)Component 2 under the general supervision o f
Technical Unit 2. "Quality";      and (iii)Component 3 under the general supervision o f the
Technical Unit 3 "Institutional Capacity Building and Planning" and Technical Unit 4 "Post-
Primary".    The CTE's Technical Units will periodically meet each respective responsible
Technical Director to coordinate and harmonize the execution following approved annual plans
and specific policy in each area. The specific mission o f each Technical Directorkomponent
coordinator (withthe exception o f Component l), prepare
                                                   is to: (i) annual actions plan and their
budget; (ii) quarterly progress reports to submit to the CCSPS and the CTE, including
             prepare
follow up o f component-specific indicators; (iii) execute and supervise all component

activities including terms o f reference (TOR), technical specifications, revision and approval o f
consultant's reports, participation in procurement evaluation missions, and data collection for
sector reports; (iv) coordinate with ES all component activities, submitting to them all required
information, including that for fiduciary and auditing purposes.           Specific and technical
responsibilities and procedures for each component are described in Annex 4 (In the Detailed
Project Description) and inthe PIM.

Specific responsible for each component:

31.     Component 1. "Expansion of school facilities". The management o f this Component
will be carried out by the ABUTIP, following the mechanism o f "Maitrise d'Ouvrage Dble`gub"
(MOD) under the general supervision o f SEO and the Technical Unit 1"Access and Equity" o f
the CTE. Inthis framework, the MINEDUC and the Communes will delegate to the ABUTIP
the authority to manage the contracts for civil works, school furniture and consultant services.
Moreover, the ABUTIP will put in place separate financial management and procurement
arrangements for this component, and will accordingly manage its own Designated Account.,
based on specific operational manuals. The ABUTIP will be also responsible for carrying out
and overseeing the implementation o f the ESMF and RPF. To establish this mechanism three
different contracts will be agreed upon and signed: (i)a "Subsidiary Agreement" between the
MINEDUC and the ABUTIP which establishes all conditions to manage the component; (ii)          an
Annual Agreement between MINEDUC and the ABUTIP specifying the detailed annual work
program (AWP); and (iii)    an agreement between each participant Commune and the ABUTIP
establishing the specific civil work and equipment program and the activities related to
community participation, including the "Commune Development Committee" (Cumite` de
Dbveluppement Communal - CDCs) and the school community. The general supervision o f the
"Subsidiary Agreement" between MINEDUC and the ABUTIP will be carried out by SEO and


                                                17

the Technical Unit 1 "Access and Equity", technically assisted by the Office of Education
Projects (Bureaux du Projects de Z'Education)            and the BPE. The technical, financial
management Ad procurement arrangements will be specified inthe "Subsidiary Agreement" and
inthePIM.

32.    Component 2. "Support to teaching and learning". The DGBP will be in charge o f
the overall implementation o f this component inclose collaboration with structures responsible
for each sub-component execution and under the general oversight o f Unit 2 "Quality" o f the
CTE. In particular: (i) sub-component 2.1 "Training o f teachers, schools directors and
                           for
inspectors", the DGBP will work in close coordination with the Office o f National Evaluations
(Bureau des Evaluations Nationales, BEN) and School Radio Team in selection and supervising
the technical assistance, the purchase of the equipment and the execution o f training activities;
(ii) sub-component2.2."Provisionandmanagementoftextbooksandlearningmaterials", the
    for
DGBP will be the main actor responsible for managing international textbooks bidding in strong
collaboration with the DT o f each education level (DGEB and the General Directorate o f
Secondary Education (Direction General d'Education Secondaire - DGES); and (iii)for sub-
component 2.3. "Measurement o f learningoutcomes" the DGBP will work jointly with the BEN
incarrying out the rapid reading assessmenttests and incoordinatingtechnical aspects with the
consultancy  .

33.     Component 3 "Buildingcapacity at MINEDUC". The BPE will be in charge o f the
overall implementation o f sub-component 3.1. "Institution building and strategy development".
However, since this sub-component reaches most aspects of the sector policy and institutional
building, all MINEDUC's structures will be involved. Therefore, the BPE will be focus in
leading the coordination o f the activities o f the "Partnership Agreement" in close collaboration
with Units 3 and 4 o f the CTE and their respective DT. The sub-component 3.2 "Project
management" will be incharge o fthe SEO, since it i s responsible for project management.



   C. Monitoringandevaluationof outcomes/results


34.    A simplifiedlogical framework and a detailed M&E system were agreed upon. InAnnex
3, there are clearly defined and quantified indicators, with baseline values, yearly progress plans
and final targets consistent with specific goals o f each component. There will be two levels o f
M&E: (i) general sector policy and project general oversight will be a b c t i o n o f the
             the
Coordination Committee with the assistance o f the BPE. The BPE will elaborate and furnish
quarterly and annual progress report for the CCSPS; (ii) Project's M&E will be a primary
                                                             the
task o f the SEO, which will include a M&E specialist.          The SEO will be responsible for
preparingproject progress reports and follow-up o f project indicators in collaboration with the
component's coordinators.

   D. Sustainability

35.        The Government o fBurundiis highly committedto education as it is shown by decisions
made to reach MDGs such the free school policy and the increase in public funding to the
education sector. The commitment to the activities and reform policies proposed inthis project
to reach the MDGs i s indicated in the Sector Policy Letter o f November 2006. Further, the
MINEDUC has demonstrated strong support to this Project with its enthusiastic participation
shown duringproject preparation. As a crucial next step, the EFA-FTI's endorsement process i s
firmly rooted in the country and fully supported by all donors. In this context, a long-term
financing scenario has been developed showing that additional resources from HIPC and donors
would cover the financial gap. However, in order to complete Burundi's application to join the
EFA-FTI, more refined strategic planning is needed to reach a formal agreement based on a
common set of objectives and measurable indicators for the sector, and with the purpose o f
harmonizing funding, implementation arrangements and implementation procedures.                                                                                   All o f
these objectives are promoted by the Project.

  E. Critical risks and possiblecontroversial aspects

36.      Engagement ina post conflict context i s a high-riskbut highreward endeavor. Although
considerable progress has been made in the consolidation of the peace process, political
institutionalization and economic recovery, the post-conflict environment still implies risk. On
the other hand, although the Bank has supported Burundi's education sector in the past, little
management, strategic planning and implementation capacity currently exists in the education
sector due to the post-conflict environment in Burundi. In this sense, the Project can be
considered as one being prepared by a new borrower with very low capacity. The table below
identifies the key risks that project management may face and provides a basis for determining
how MINEDUC and project management should address these risks. The fiduciary risks and
their mitigationmeasures are described inthe corresponding sections.

IV.      APPRAISAL SUMMARY

    A. Economicandfinancialanalyses

 38.     The economic and financial analyses o f the Project (Annex 9) shows that the project
 design is fully consistent with the analysis and conclusion o f the recently completed CSR, the
 long-term financing scenario chosen by the Government and the recently completed MTEF
 (2007-2009). The Project i s also expected to yield significant positive economic returns through
 supporting the actions (school facilities, teachers training, textbooks, capacity building) and the
 process o f introducing reforms that will augment coverage and completion, increase internal
 efficiency (reducing repetition and dropouts), improve resources allocation, and raise relevance
 inpost-primary levels.

    B. Technical

 39.     The Project design follows key CSR conclusions, policy debate and government strategy,
 draws on experience from SSA and post-conflict countries, and i s consistent with internationally
 known best practices. The abolition o f school fees that led to a massive increase in enrollments
 in a context of immediate post-conflict period created a situation that failed to provide timely
 assistance to schools as an expanding of the system could result inthe slowing or even reversal
 o f this trend towards full primary enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming majority of
 project funding i s focused on this emergency situation (Component 1and 2), which is normal in
 a post-conflict reconstruction environment. The second objective responds to the view that the
 government give priority to rapidly building its capacity to plan and manage the education
 sector, which will assist in the completion o f an in-depthaction plan that will, inturn, increase
 the likelihoodo faccessing EFA-FTImembership (Component 3).

    C. Fiduciary

 40.     Financial and procurement assessments have been conducted. All issues and risk related
 to procurement and financial management have been identified. The overall fiduciary risk i s
 considered high. A series o f corrective measures have been agreed upon and include the
 recruitment o f some fiduciary specialist to assist in project management in the context o f the
 SEO.

 41.     Financial Management. The financial management (FM) risks are related to: (i)           the
 weak capacity for implementing adequate FM arrangements, (ii) weak implication o f the
                                                                       the
 technical staff on the internal control issue who are particularly involved in core activities; (iii)
 availability o f timely regular budget for the operations o f the Project; (iv) the country security
 situation which may also leadto delay inimplementingthe Project effectively.

 42.     To mitigate these risks, the following must occur: (a) regular Bank supervision missions
 including SOE reviews and timely follow-up of management issues, will be essential; (b) the


                                                 22

planning and budgeting activity should be properly organized; (c) timely information on M&E
must be provided; and (d) timely submission o f external audit reports and follow up o f
implementation o f auditor's recommendations.

43.     The overall conclusion o f the assessment is that the current FM arrangements are not
satisfactory to meet IDA'S FM requirements.        Therefore, all recommendations need to be
implementedby project effectiveness (Action Plan is shown inAnnex 7). By effectiveness, the
Project will not be ready for report-based disbursements. Thus, at the initial stage, transaction-
based disbursement procedures, as described in the World Bank Disbursement Handbook, will
be followed Le. direct payment, reimbursement, and special commitments. However, when
project implementation begins and the Borrower requests conversion to report-based
disbursements,a reviewwill be undertaken by IDA to determine ifthe project is eligible.

44.     Procurement. The overall project risk for procurement is high, though the procurement
riskfor the component to be executed bythe ABUTIP canbe considered as medium.

45.     Assessment of the implementing agencies.            The overall responsibility for the
management o f the procurement aspects will be handledby MINEDUC through the SEO, except
for component 1. "Expansion o f schools facilities", which will be carried out by the ABUTIP
through a contracting arrangement withMINEDUC. MINEDUC's experience with procurement
i s very limited. Since Burundi was embarked in October 1993 in the last and most important
conflict that country has been subject since its independence, the resources allocated to
investmentineducation sector through the nationalbudgetwere very limited.

46.     It was agreed not to use a typical project implementation unit though the implementing
experience o f recipient o f the grant i s very limited.     Consequently, it was decided that
procurement activities would be carried out by the SEO o f the CCSPS with includes a small
fiduciary team.   It is evident that the procurement risk is high for the components to be
implementedunder the responsibility o fthe SEO. Consequently, an actionplanto strengthenthe
procurement capacity o f the implementing agency and mitigate the procurement risks i s
recommended (Annex 8).


    D. Social

47.     In recognition of the potential social impacts that are likely to result from planned
construction and rehabilitation o f educational facilities, the Borrower has prepared an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF). Potential negative impacts on public health due to the planned construction
and rehabilitation works might result from dust, noise, traffic congestion, and an increase in
water-related diseases due to stagnant water in the temporary quarries, etc. Ifnot rehabilitated,
the quarries serving as sources o f construction materials could contribute to vector proliferation
(malaria).   They can also result in drowning, particularly of children, and become sources o f


                                               23

bilharzias. The lack o f use o f local manpower during construction could cause frustration at the
local level, given that job opportunities are very scarce, particularly in the dry season. On the
other hand, the construction o f new facilities or the extension o fthe existing infrastructures could
involve landacquisition, usingland that may already be usedfor other purposes (i.e. occupation
by the populations, agricultural production, pasture, etc.), which may lead to the displacement o f
populations or loss o f access to economic activities and assets. On the whole, any negative
impact during the construction phase may be due to: poor choice of the sites; potential conflicts
related to land acquisition and occupation; pollution and harmful effects on the surrounding
populations and the workmen due to works; the disturbance o f free movement and socio-
economic activities; the limited use o f local workmen and the occupation o f land. During the
operational phase, the expected negative effects may involve: the degradation o f the educational
environment; the precariousness o f school hygiene; the poor quality o f the works carried out, and
especially the lack o fmotivation of teachers.

48.     The RPF gives the main principles governing the resettlement operations in the
framework o f the Component 1 o f the Project. Inclose collaboration with SEO, the Communes
will develop a Resettlement Action Plan (Plan d'Action de Re`installation - PAR), if a sub-
project for the construction o f classrooms, houses, latrines and water points requires some
resettlement operations.     The Project will ensure that there is implementation o f the
dissemination function of information and knowledge transfer towards the communes. The PAR
will be implementedat the same time as the other studies (civil engineering, socio-economic and
environmental studies, etc.) inorder to mainstream social aspects. Ifthe PARconducts technical
studies, the commune should present a social road map with a series o f proposals. Once the
proposed sub-project by the commune i s approved in the portfolio o f funding programmes, the
authorities will go to the contracting stage o f the technical studies (through the ABUTIP). In
order to address these eventual population displacements, component 1 o f the Project includes
financial support as a provision (2% o f the component amount, US$0.15 million) to compensate
the groups o f people affected, studies, training in safeguards, M&E, and supervision (a detailed
description i s shown inAnnex 4. Detailedproject description).

   E. Environment

49.     Inrecognition o fthe potential environmental impacts that are likely result from planned
construction and rehabilitation o f educational facilities, the Borrower has prepared an
Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). An ESMF has been prepared
because the precise educational facilities to be built or rehabilitated have not been identified at
this time, thus making impossible to identify the specific impact and to recommend mitigation
measures. Therefore, the objective o f ESMF i s to provide an environmental and social screening
process to enable the implementation agencies to identify, assess and mitigate the potential
negative environmental and social impacts related to the Project's activities at the planning
phase. The procedure o f environmental and social review o f the ESMF will be integrated into
the general procedure o f approval and financing o f the project activities.         The ESMF also
outlines the institutional arrangements for environmental and social management during the


                                                  24

implementation of the program, including capacity building measures. It should be noted that a
large part of the Project's investmentsfocus on equipment andinfrastructure.

50.     The Project's potential negative environmental and social impacts will mostly result from
the construction and rehabilitation of infrastructures (schools; water points, sanitation facilities)
that might lead to disruptions of the environment, increased solid and liquid wastes generation.
Inaddition, thepotentialuse ofquarriesfor buildingmaterials may causenegative environmental
impacts which will require restoration after use. Environmental impacts such as: soil erosion,
soil degradation, increase in solid and liquid wastes, loss of vegetation are expected to occur
mainly during the settling of these infrastructures and establishment of building sites as well as
during the exploitation of quarries for building materials. In order to address these negative
impacts, the process of selection proposed in the ESMF will be carried out so that the
biophysical and socio-economic aspects of the project areas are taken into account, and
consequently, that mitigation measures will be implemented.Inthis context, an ESMP has been
developed intending to ensure efficient environmental management of the Project. The ESMP
will be includedinPIM.

51.     To ensure that environmental and social aspects in Project's activities are effectively
taken into account, it was proposedto identify and train Environment Focal Points (Point Focal
d'Environnement - PFE) within DPE, BPE, the ABUTIP, in ESMF. In the framework of
Component 1, the main institutions with key roles and responsibilities for environmental and
social management are:         (i)for the implementation of environmental measures:               the
implementation of project environmental management measures will be carried out by
engineering and design departments of the ABUTIP that will work jointly with private
contractors and Government's technical services.        Under the general responsibility of the
ABUTIP, consultants in charge of sub-project design will be responsible for carrying out the
Environment Impact Study (Etude d'lmpact Environnemental - EIE) and drafting the
infrastructures maintenance handbooks. In this context, the ABUTIP will ensure that all sub-
projects will include the planting of threes around the schools and teachers houses and that the
architectural planwill include environmental mitigationmeasures based on recommendations o f
the ESMP ;(ii) civil work's control and monitoring: under the general supervision of the
                  for
ABUTIP, the control and monitoring of project activities during execution will be carried out by
the private contractors (Maitres de oeuvre) who will beresponsiblefor the implementation ofthe
mitigation measures as indicated in the Environmental Guidelines for Contractors (EGC),
includingthe rehabilitation of quarries usedas sources of building materials, the maintenance of
the building sites, tree planting inside schools, etc.    At the local level, the PFE/CDC, the
PFE/DPE, but also the schools community (including Parents' Associations), will also take part
inmonitoring. The school community, the PFE/CDC andthe DPE(Planning andInfrastructures
Services) will be responsible for data-gathering inthe field; (iii) supervision and monitoring:
                                                                  for
to ensure the efficiency o fthe recommendedmeasures, it is important to carry out environmental
monitoring of works. The coordination and the supervision of the implementation of the ESMF
measures will be ensured by the PFE/ABUTIP, in connection with the PFEBPE of the
MINEDUC, the DGEB and the Direction of Environment and Tourism of the Ministry of


                                                25

Territorial Arrangements, the Environment, and Tourism.                              The mid-term environmental
assessment aims to establisha complete overview of the real impacts o fthe sub-projects, but also
to assess the effectiveness of the mitigation measures realized during works. At the end of the
program, a final assessment will be carried out, to learn the principal lessons on environmental
managementrelatedto the implementation ofProject activities.


   F. Safeguard policies

52.      The Project's environmental category is B due to construction and rehabilitation activities
(Component 1). As a result, safeguards OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12
Involuntary Resettlement have been triggered. Since the precise location of the educational
facilities to be build or rehabilitated are not known at this time, an ESMF and a RPF have been
prepared by the Borrower. These documents include the institutional arrangements, planning
framework and capacity building measures to implement these frameworks effectively.                                       The
ESMF was disclosed in Burundi on November 24, 2006 and at the Bank's InfoShop on
November 27, 2006. The draft RPF has been disclosed in Burundi November 24, 2006 and at
the Bank's InfoShopNovember 27,2006. The safeguardsscreeningcategory is S2.

I.SectorBackground

1.      Access and Coverage: even though enrollment has significantly increased in recent
years, many children remainout of school and most o fthem do not complete primarylevel. As a
result of the civil conflict, primary enrollment significantly dropped from 650,000 in 1991/92 (a
GER of 71%) to only about 440,000 in 1993-1996, (a GER of 50%). However, once the political
situation improved, the education sector made a rapid recovery. By 2000, primary enrollment
had recovered to the level recorded before the 1993 civil conflict, and enrollment has since
grown muchfaster than inthe pre-crisis years. With the recent elimination ofthe primary school
fee, preliminary statistics indicate that primary enrollment exceeded 1,350,000 pupils in the
2005/06 school year (a GER of around 100%). Figure 1 shows the dramatic drop and then
recovery ofprimary enrollment since 1989.

2.      However, many Burundianchildrennever go to school or drop out before completing the
primary cycle. The primary education system in Burundi i s characterized by a high repetition
rates, leading to an inflated GER and thereby giving the impression that access to primary
education is better than it actually is. The intake rate2was 91% in 2003/04, but the completion
rate3was only 33%. There is, thus, a very long way to go before reaching universal primary

completion in Burundi. The retention rate inprimary4is around 37%, thus currently more than
60% ofthose that start primary school will not complete it.

3.      Insecondary education, the situation is not much better. The retention rate inthe four-
year lower secondary cycle, i.e. the proportion of studentsthat enroll in lower secondary school
who are still inschool by the last year, i s only 48%.

4.      Equity. There are large disparities in the access to education based on urbadrural
residence, income quintile, and gender. While the national average GER i s SO%, the GER for
boys (87%) is significantly higher than that for girls (73%).                     There are also large regional
disparities. The GER appears to decline as one moves from Western to Eastern Burundi. Inthe
Eastern region, the GER was only 66%, or about half the level reported for Bujumbura Mairie
(131%). It should be noted that the gender disparity i s largest in the regions where access to
primary ingeneral is low. The disparity inthe GER is, for the most part, due to a much lower
retention rate in the Eastern (25%), Southern (33%) and Northwestern regions (43%) than in
Bujumbura Mairie (68%).

5.      The few students who reach the highest level of education consume a disproportionately
large share of public education resources. The CSR found that the distribution o f education
expenditures among the members of a cohort of children i s highly inequitable with a significant
portion of children not deriving any benefit whatsoever as they will never access education. On
the other hand, the few students in a cohort (1.9 out of 100) that make it to higher education
absorb as much as 40% of the total amount of resourcesavailable to the entire cohort. The Gini
coefficient for the distribution of public education expenditures inBurundi was found to be 0.7.

This was compared to the average Ginicoefficient inFrancophone African countries of 0.56, and
in Anglophone African countries of 0.36. Thus, the distribution o f government educational
spendingis muchmore inequitable inBurundithan the average for Afiica.

6.      School Health: the health and nutrition o f school children and teachers i s not well-
monitored and dispersed efforts inthis area are not consolidated into a comprehensive strategy.
Baseline data on the health o f school age children are incomplete or non-existent.                    The
HIV/AIDS epidemic is negatively affecting the education system and the consequences o f
HIV/AIDS are only expected to become more severe as the epidemic unfolds in Burundi. In
2001, the HIV infection rate o f the adult population was estimated at 9%, but it i s probable that it
will reach as much as 12-15% of adults (between 15 and 49 years) by 2015. The HIV/AIDS
epidemic will make the goal o f universal primary education much harder to achieve because
more teachers will have to be recruited and trained (replacing those that are sick or die) and more
children will dropout due to sickness themselves, the need to care for sick family members, or
the needto become breadwinners. Ifit is assumedthat primaryteachers are infected at the same
rate as other adults, an estimated 1,500 primary teachers are now HIV positive and about 180
primary teachers die from AIDS-related causes every year.                        The HIV/AIDS pandemic also
affects school children, as they become orphaned, and therefore, are at significantly high risk o f
dropping out o f school before completing primary education.

7.       Ouality: even though Burundi performs above the average o f African countries interms
o f learning achievement5, the conflict and insecurity and the recent increases in enrollment have
been maior reasons for a deteriorating quality. In the 2005/06 school year, more than 2,000
unqualified teachers were recruited (around 8% o f total primary teachers). To bring in more
pupils, a double-shift system started many years ago, cutting teaching time per pupil by 20%.
Repetition rates are more alarming: 28% for years 1-4 o f primary, 37% for year 5, and 44% for
year 6. Inaddition, teachers are not where they are needed: while inBujumburaMarie there are
an average o f one teacher by 46 studentsthis ratio is 72 for Karuzi.

Sector financing, costs and resources allocation

8.        Inreal terms, the recurrent education budget dropped dramatically from 1994 to 1997,
and has remained at this depressed level for several years until it began recovering as o f 2001.
The expenditure in 2004 was, however, still lower than the level in 1994 in real terms (due
mainly to decrease inreal wages). In2005, as part o f its priority policy, the new government has
eliminated schools fees, which resulted in a significant increase in first grade enrollment and,
therefore, in additional financing to address the recruitment o f new teachers, the replacement o f
the revenues from schools fees revenues and new infrastructure. In2006, the education budget
has significantly increased - financed either with own revenues (recurrent expenditures) or HIPC
(investment expenditures).             However, the absorption capacity o f investment expenditures
remains weak which leads to low levels o f execution..

9.        Quantitative efficiency o f the education expenditure i s weak by international standards.
Figure 3 shows the position o f different African countries relative to the efficiency curve:
Burundi is one o f the countries furthest away from the efficiency curve, as it has a relatively
large spending on education coupled with a very low school life expectancy. There is, thus,
ample room for increasing the efficiency o fthe use o f existing resources available for the sector.




 According to the international survey on learning achievement, the standardized MLA test given to a sample of students in
grade 5, Burundiperformswell above averageo f26 African countries interms of learningachievement,andis, infact, one ofthe
countries with the highest learningachievement(average score is 69 in Burundi comparedto an average score of 50 (where?)).
In Burundi, as many as 89% of adults that report having received 6 years of schoolingwere able to read without difficulty,
comparedto 72% on average for 12 SSA countries.

 10.        Repetition contributes to the wastage o f resources and increases the chance o f premature
dropout. As a result, more than 50% of resources investedinprimary education are "wasted" on
students who do not complete primarya6 Burundi spends more than other countries on higher
education and less than recommended on primary education. The share o f the budget allocated
to higher education has increased from 22% in 1990 to 27.5% in 2004. The share allocated to
primary has declined from 47.5% to 44.4%.                            Spending on general secondary has remained
unchanged at around 24%, while spending on technical secondary has declined from 5.9% to
3.7%. Thus, spendingon primary education i s further from the recommended minimum level of
50% than it was in 1990. Inan international context, Burundispends a relatively highamount on
higher education (average in other countries is around 20% only) and a relatively small amount
onprimary and secondary education.

11.         As o f the 2005/06 school year, primary school fees were eliminated and secondary

                                                                  31

recurrent budget. Yet, the school fees were used to finance certain non-salary expenditures not
fundedby Government, suchas textbooks.

12.     The revenue from secondary school fees corresponds to approximately 11%o f recurrent
expenditure in this sub-sector.     Secondary students in government boarding schools pay the
highest school fees, but the fees do not cover the actual costs o f operating the boarding and
hostels, which therefore remain supported by Government. Paying school fees i s not the only
way parents contribute to schools.        The large majority o f parents report providing other
contributions to schools, to finance school supplies, or inthe case o f secondary education, to pay
for security guards or maintenance staff or to finance small school repairs, etc. Both inprimary
and secondary education, these contributions may well be higher thanthe school fees and may be
a considerable burdenon poor families, and families withmultiple school-age children.

13.     The per student cost o f primary education was US$ 13.7 in 2004, or about 15% o f
Burundi's GDP per capita. Many other comparable countries have a primary unit cost around
10%o f their GDP/capita, but giventhe very low GDP per capita inBurundi, this slightly higher
unit cost may bejustified (see Figure 4). In secondary and technical secondary education, the
per-studentcost was, respectively, 4 and 12.5 times higher than inprimary education. The unit
cost at the University o f Burundiwas as much as 47 times higher than the unit cost in primary.
In an international context, the unit costs in both secondary and higher education are much
higher than in comparable countries, inrelation to the countries' GDP per capita. Insecondary
education, there i s significant difference in the unit cost between the different types o f schools.
Due to a better endowment o f teaching and non-teaching staff, the unit cost at the conventional
public schools i s about double the unit cost inthe community secondary schools.

14.    A large portionofthe differential inunit costs between the different levels o feducationis
due to a combination o f a better pupil/teacher ratio the higher the level o f education (it is 52 in
primary, 41 in community secondary, 26 inpublic secondary, 17 intechnical secondary, and 22
at the University o f Burundi) and a higher level o f teacher remuneration the higher the level o f
education.    Differences in the ratios o f pupils to non-teaching staff and in the non-salary
expendituresexplain the remainder o f the difference. Public secondary, technical secondary and
higher education all employ more non-teaching staff than teaching staff. At the University o f
Burundi, there is as muchas one non-teaching staffper 8.9 students.

15.    Burundihas relatively highteacher wages compared to the country's GDP per capita. An
analysis o f teacher remuneration found that both civil servant (sous statut) and non-civil servant
(sous contrut) teachers in Burundi are paid more on average than similar categories o f staff in
comparable countries, relative to the countries' GDP per capita. Also, Burundi has one o f the
highest shares o f teachers who are civil servants (93% o f primary teachers compared to 48% on
average for 11 francophone African countries). O n average, primary teachers in Burundi are
paid 6.8 times GDP per capita, while the average for African countries is 4.6 times GDP per
capita.

16.     Management o f the System. Management of human resources i s highly inefficient and
the planning capacity i s weak. In 2000, MINEDUC started a process o f decentralization to
provinces and school's districts. However, the roles of central and decentralized levels remains
unclear, the duplication of roles and overlapping information leads to a huge inefficiency inthe
allocation of resources. This inefficient allocation o f teachers i s clear evidence of poor teacher
management practices. The randomness inthe distribution o f staff to secondary schools is even
higher than for primary schools (68% for all staff, and 59% if only considering teaching staff).
Thus, poor teacher management is pervasive inbothprimaryand secondary education.

17.     The planning system is characterized by several weaknesses: (i) central planning
                                                                                the
structure lacks enough qualified personnel and logistical capacity; (ii) and provincial
                                                                              district
branches o f BP lack capacity for data collection and processing; (iii)  overlaps inresponsibilities
among central and provincial levels exists incritical areas o f planning such as teacher allocation
and infrastructure; (iv) the existing sort o f School Map's tool is poorly developed and the
information i s gathered with delays; and (v) the annual education statistical report i s published
with delays and critical sector indicators are neither presentednor monitored.

18.     Moreover, the system lacks several key facilities to ensure service delivery:             (i)
classrooms are uneven distributed among provinces; (ii)textbooks are scarce and not well
distributed(on average, primary schools have only 0.3 textbooks per students andthere are large
disparities inthe distribution o f textbooks among schools); (iii) schools lack basic infrastructure:
only 40% o f schools are built from permanent materials, three quarters o f schools have latrines,
31% a borehole and only 5% have electricity; (iv) primary schools are larger and secondary
schools smaller than their theoretical optimal size; (v) double-shifting has allowed for an
unprecedented expansion o f primary education, but has resulted in less class contact than the
internationally recommended benchmark: 83% o f primary schools have some sort o f double
shift, affecting at least 60% of primary school students.

Monitoring and Evaluation arrangement for project result framework

1.      The M&E system will be a crucial device to measure the project achievement o f PDO
and intermediate outcomes. The M& E framework has the objective to inform the Coordination
Committee, donors and sector stakeholders on the progress in achieving sector and projects
goals. Inaddition, these M&E arrangements will set the institutional basis for the follow -up of
the EFA FTI program. The information that the M&E system will produce on a periodic basis
will include: (i) quarterly and annual progress report for the CCSPS, donors and stakeholders;
and (ii)bi-annual progress reports to specifically inform and evaluate the project implementation
development andthe progress inachieving agreed indicators.

2.      In this context, there will be two complementary levels of responsibilities concerning
M&E: (i) general sector policy and project general oversight will be a fhction o f the
            the
CCSPS with the specific assistance o f the BPE. The BPE will be responsible for general sector
data collection and making quarterly and annual progress reports for CCSPS and donors,
following up and monitoring sector indicators and evaluating policy implementation; (ii)      the
project's M&E will be a primary task o f the SEO. The SEO will be responsible for preparing
project bi-annual progress' reports and follow up project's indicators in collaboration with the
component's coordinators and Technical Committees. The specialist in M&E o f the SEO will
work inclose collaboration withBP as mainsource ofinformation and evaluation.

3.      Project outcomes and intermediate outcomes indicators have been agreed following an
extensive discussion with MINEDUC's teams and donors. The determination o f baseline values
and the trajectory until the end o f project (2011) has been done on the foundation o f extensive
analytical work included in the CSR and the long-term financing exercise (from year 2006 to
2015). Therefore, all project outcome and intermediate outcomes indicators will be consistent
with EFA-FTI outcome indicators since project preparation and sector program development
were part o f the same process, though the sector plan and its action planwill be finalized during
2007, the reason for which most sector intermediate indicators were left to be includedin EFA-
FTI's program as stated in the results framework for Component 3.             However, outcome
indicators as a primary level completion rate, enrollment rates and studentkeacher ratios are
already definedand agreed upon objectives.

                             BURUNDI: EducationSupportProject

PROJECTDEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE

1.      The project development objectives (PDO) are to improve the capacity o f schools to
educate a rapidly increasing number o f primary-level students; and that o f the Government o f
Burundito carry out policy analysis, strategic planning andprogram implementation.

2.      The first objective responds to the widely-accepted and urgent priority that the
Government gives to providing immediate and direct support to schools inorder to cope with the
rapid expansion of participation inprimary school. This rapid expansion has been caused by the
pent-updemand inthe immediatepost-conflict periodandthe abolition o f school fees. Failure to
provide timely assistance to schools as the system expands could result in the slowing or even
the reversal o f this trend towards full primary enrollment. In this context, the overwhelming
majority o f project funding i s focused on these urgent goals, which are normal ina post-conflict
reconstruction environment. The second objective responds to the equally well-justified priority
that the Government gives to rapidly building its capacity to plan and manage the education
sector, which will assist inthe completion o f an in-depthaction plan that will, in turn, increase
the likelihood o f attracting more external funding for its programs, including possible funding
from EFA-FTI membership.          Project specific indicators and benchmarks for monitoring the
achievement of these objectives are discussed in this section in the context o f the results
framework (Annex 3)


COMPONENT 1.EXPANSIONOF SCHOOL FACILITIES (U$S8.15 million)

3.      Diagnosis: Inorder to reachthe MDGo funiversalprimary completion (completion rates
would need to be close to 100% by 2015) Burundi must significantly expand school facilities.
This fact is exacerbated since the 2005-06 school year was when the free school policy led to a
huge increase in enrollments in first grade.         Consequently, at least 3,000 equipped new
classrooms must be built from 2007 to 2011 based on 54 students per class and maintaining
double shifts (83% o f schools and 60% of students are ina double shift system).

4.      Objective: The objective o f this component is to contribute to the continued expansion
o f primary participation on an equitable basis in order to reach universal completion by 2015. It
will respond to the huge increase in the rate o f enrollment by expanding school infrastructure
through supporting the MlNEDUC's school infrastructure triennial plan (2007-2009).             The
contribution o f this component will be focused on the nine most disadvantaged provinces in
terms o f enrollment rates and facilities, providing the construction o f about 220 new classrooms,
the rehabilitation o f around 200 classrooms, the construction o f 60 lodges for teachers, the
construction of 40 wells, and the provision o f school furniture and relevant instructional
equipmentto all schools receivingproject support.

Activities and procedures

5.      Eligible activities. The component will finance a three year program to construct and/or
rehabilitateprimary schools including the following eligible interventions: (i)             the construction of
new schools (including six or nine classrooms, a school director's office, an administrative and
library room, bathrooms for girls and boys, and wells); (ii)         the improvement o f existing schools,
including rehabilitation and extensions (modules o f three, six or nine classrooms, bathrooms for
girls andboys, andwells); (iii) construction o f lodges for teachers when it isjustified; (iv) the
                                   the
provision o f school furniture for the new or rehabilitated classrooms/schools (desks for students,
teachers and directors; blackboards; library furniture; administrative furniture; maps); (iv)
awareness and training o f CDCs and school community (parents' associations, etc.) involved in
the component's programs. The activities supported by the sub-component will contribute to
support MINEDUC's school infrastructure triennial plan, which also receives financing from
Government's own revenues (HIPC), other projects o f the Bank (importantly "Community and
Social Development Project") UNICEF, CTB, AFD, and other donors (in Table 4 below details
by donor is shown).

6.      Selection of schools. The schedule o f prioritization and selection o f number o f schools
by province has been done based on objective criteria in line with the school infrastructure
triennial plan 2007-2009, which will comprise all interventions from all sources of financing,
including this Project. Inorder to take advantage o f economies o f scale the Project will focus its
interventions in the nine most disadvantage provinces: Bururi, Cankuzo, Cibitoke, Karusi,
Kirundo, Muyinga, Ngozi, Rural Bujumbura and Rutana. These provinces have been selected by
the BPE on the basis o f having: (i) lowest enrollment rates; (ii) highest number o f
                                             the                                       the
students per classroom; and (iii) inexistence o f a current constructionprogram. An indicative
                                     the
distribution o f the component resources allocation i s presented inthe Table 1'. The final list o f
schools for project intervention has been selected during project preparation based on in-depth
analysis o f the state o f school infrastructure in the nine provinces o f project intervention (the
detailed description by type o f intervention - new construction and rehabilitation - is in the
PIM).

7.      Mechanism. The activity will be carried out by the private sector under the management
o f the ABUTIP, following the mechanism o f "Maitrise d'Ouvrage De`le`gue`"(MOD). In this
framework, the MINEDUC and the communes will delegate to the ABUTIP the authority to
manage the contracts for civil works and school furniture. To establish this mechanism three
different contracts will be agreed upon and signed: (i)               a Subsidiary Agreement between the
MINEDUC and the ABUTIP which establishes all conditions to manage the sub-component; (ii)
an Annual Agreement betweenMINEDUC and the ABUTIP specifying the detailed AWP; and
(iii) agreementbetweeneachparticipantcommuneandtheABUTIPestablishingthespecific
     an
civil works and equipment programs and the activities related to community participation,
including CDCs andthe school community.

8.      Identification. The annual list o f schools will be furnished by the MINEDUC and it will
include all the necessary elements to prepare each sub- project: architectural program; detailed
state o f schools to rehabilitate; preliminary estimations o f costs; site information and; description
o f eligibility criteria. The annual program will be based on the following procedure: (i)          the
MINEDUC selects the list of schools based on the selection criteria set intriennial infrastructure
plan 2007-2009; (ii) MINEDUC agrees with the communes on the final list of selected
                         the
schools; the types o f intervention; community participation including its modalities (2% o f total
cost inkindor cash); environment impact and population resettlement when this i s relevant; (iii)
the MINEDUC, after verification o f criteria and technical proposals with the communes, will
conform final annual list and selection based on the annual work budgetandphysical constraints;
(iv) the MINEDUC includes a final list as part o f the Annual Agreement and sends it to the
ABUTIP; and (v) the ABUTIP works withthe communes indefiningtheir agreement.

9.      Projects ' execution procedures. The ABUTIP's responsibilities include the following:
(i)the recruitment of consultants to preparethe Projects' final technical and architectural

document (including site adaptation, plan masse, furniture inventory and work program) and the
bidding documents; (ii)the revision and/or modification o f sub-projects' final detailed
document; (iii)   the recruitment o f the NGO in charge of community participation (CDCs and
school community awareness, mobilization and training activities); (iv) the supervision o f the
activities o f community participation; (v) recruitment o f the enterprises to execute civil works;
(vi) supervision of the execution o f civil works; (vii) preparation o f bidding documents for the
acquisition o f school furniture; (viii) procurement o f school furniture and follow-up o f its
storage, transport and delivery to schools; and (ix) final acceptance o f civil works and furniture.
The procedures for the component's execution are established in the PIM, which will include
two specific manuals o f procedures for the component: (i)    the manual of technical procedures;
(ii) manualofadministrative, accountingandfinancialmanagement'sprocedures;and(iii)
    the                                                                                           all
standards documents, annexes to bothmanuals.

10.     Safeguards. In recognition o f the potential environmental and social impacts that are
likely to result from planned construction and rehabilitation o f educational facilities, the
Government has preparedan Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). In this context, the component includes provisions to
monitor and address eventual negative impacts as a consequence o f construction and
rehabilitation activities: (i) population resettlement: in order to address eventual population
displacements, the component includes financial support as a prevision to compensate the groups
o f people affected. Since the probability o f these events was evaluated as very low, an about 1.2
% o f component amount is planned for this purpose. This fund would be dedicated to support
compensations, studies, training in safeguards M&E and supervision as i s shown inTable 2; (ii)
Environment:      The coordination and the supervision of the implementation o f the ESMF
measures will be ensured by the PFE/ABUTIP, in connection with the PFE/BPE o f the
MINEDUC, the DGEB and the Directorade o f Environment and Tourism. Under the general
responsibility o f the ABUTIP, individual consultants or consultancy will be responsible for
carrying out the EIE (the firms in charge o f sub projects technical design), and drafting the
infrastructures maintenance handbooks. Duringimplementation, private contractors (Maitres de
oeuvre) will be responsible for the implementationo fthe mitigation measures as indicated inthe
Environmental Guidelines for Contractors, including the rehabilitation o f quarries used as
sources o f buildingmaterials, the maintenance of the building sites, tree planting inside schools,
etc. At the local level, the PFE/CDC, the PFEDPE, but also the schools' community, including
parents;' associations, will also take part in the monitoring.      The schools community, the
PFE/CDC and the DPE will be responsible for data-gathering in the field.            The mid-term
environmental assessment will be done aiming to establish a complete overview o f the real
impacts o f the sub-projects, but also to assess the effectiveness o f the mitigation measures
realized during works. At the end o f the program, a final assessment will be carried out, to learn
the principal lessons on environmental management related to the implementation o f the
Project's activities.

COMPONENT2. SUPPORT FORTEACHING AND LEARNING (US$6.6 million)

13.     The objective o f this component is to contribute maintaining or improving student
acquisitions by supporting:     (i)introducing newin-service programs and modules to train
teachers, school directors and inspectors; (ii)
                                             providing textbooks and pedagogic materials for all
students at primary level andthree subject textbooks for lower secondary students, settingup its
management mechanisms; and (iii)    measuring learning outcomes undertakinga rapid assessment
of reading competency in a sample o f primary schools throughout Burundi each year o f the
Project.

Sub-component 2.1. Training of teachers, schools directors and inspectors (US$ 2.44
million)

14.     Diagnosis: The quality and efficiency o f the education service delivery is poor and
limited by insufficiently trained teachers, school directors and inspectors, deficient school
performance monitoring and supervision and weak local capacity. Inthis context, the increase in
enrollment due to the free school policy i s leading to a massive need for the recruitment o f
teachers in coming years, a portion o f whom will not have a basic pedagogical background.
School directors and inspectors have a heterogeneous educational level and have not been
received professional training for many years. Moreover, there also i s a need to train school
directors and inspectors to revitalize the system managing the emergency and enforcing
proximity to schools inthe fiamework ofthe decentralization process.

15.    Objective: This sub-component aims to increase teaching quality through introducing
newin-service programs andmodulesto train teachers, school directors and inspectors. The sub-
component will support four activities: (i)   the training o f up to 2,950 unqualified primary
teachers: untrained teachers recruited during the period 2002/2005 (950), untrained teachers to
be recruited in 2006/2007 school year (estimated to be about 1,700), untrained teachers to be



                                               52

recruited in 2007/2009 school years (estimated to be around 300); (ii) in-service training of
                                                                                  the
all teachers; (iii) training of 2,200 school directors and 149 inspectors; (iv) the TA to develop
                   the
newprograms andto assist andtrainthe School Radio managementteam; and (v) the acquisition
of necessaryequipmentto carry out the School Radio's activities

Activities and procedures

16.      Training of "unqualifzed" teachers. The proposed activity aims to provide basic
pedagogical qualifications and inteaching assignmentsto the unqualified teachers to be recruited
incoming years8. The recruitment strategy will consist of recruiting most of the graduates from
teacher training schools (D6 and D7 levels) and cover the gap with graduates fkom secondary
level ("lycee" or upper secondary school). The most probable scenario indicates that up to 2,000
unqualified teachers will be recruited in the next four years', in addition to 950 untrained
teachers recruited during the period 2002/2005. Approximately 1,500 unqualified teachers
recruited in 2005706 were already trained during 2006 (financed by UNICEF).                      The MTEF
(2007-2009) will provide detailed and more realistic projections on the needs related to teacher
recruitment (meaning?) and its composition between qualified and qualified.                     Taking into
account the quantitative needs and a cost-effectiveness approach, the operativ strategy will
consist inproviding a combination of inclass and distance training through the School Radio. In
this context, atraining of 40 days will be provided using two modalities: (i) training ofin-class
24 days during school holidays; plus (ii)       a distance training of 120 hours, 12 hours a month for
10 months. The training will follow a cascade approach in which trainers will be selected and
trained inall provinces.

17.      In-service training. All primary teachers (around 26,000) will receive this training
through a distance modality (School Radio). Inprinciple, it estimatedthat emissions o f 8 hours
per month will be provided during 10 months a year. The training curricula will have five
modules: (i)     pedagogical methodology; (ii) nutrition, hygiene and HIVIAIDS; (iii)
                                                       health,
human rights and education for peace; (iv) life competencies; and (v) gender issues.                      The
regional inspectorsjointly with pedagogical counselors will have the mainrole inorganizing and
supervising in-service training. On this basis, all aspects of training will be developed in detail
by the TA.

18.      School directors ' and inspectors' training. The school directors (2,200) and district
inspectors (149) have never been trained to reinforce their respective functions since there is no
structure to ensure this activity. Moreover, their initial background i s quite heterogeneous since
their nominations have not been based on objective criteria. The training will, therefore, be

centered on: (i)   reinforcing critical aspects of their functions; and (ii)     follow-up and evaluation
o f distance training. For the first year all school directors and inspectors will be trained by 12
days plus 80 hours of distance training (8 hours by months during 10 months). For the next
severalyears: (i) directors training will be carried out through distance training (80 hours
                     school
of distance training, 8 hours a monthfor 10months) supervisedby inspectors; and (ii)               inspectors
will beregroupedto received 18days oftraining.

19.     Distance trainingAearning. Since 2000, MINEDUC has had a school radio and its own
production and diffusion teams (created in the framework of the Norwegian cooperation).
Currently, the school radio plays four hours a day covering the entire Burundian territory.
However, the current school radio activities are not focused on training but on general
information programs. Therefore, the sub-component will support the creation and training of a
specializedteam indistance training at the Office ofRuralEducation (Bureau d'Education Rural
-BER-) and School Radio inthe areas of writing, production, operation and evaluation of
distance training programs. The team members will be selected among training schools'
teachers, inspectors and pedagogic counselors. At the same time, the sub-component will
support additional necessary equipment, a generator (to avoid electricity breakdowns) and some
operation costs.

20.     Teacher training will be conducted by pedagogic counselors and training schools'
teachers whereas the training of school directors and inspectors will be carried out primarily by
pedagogic counselors at the BER. There are two types o f pedagogic counselors, those who
graduate from specialized institutions inforeign countries and the rest who have been appointed
without having been properly trained. Given that context, trainers for teacher training will be
mainly composed of teachers at the Lyce`es Pe`dagogiques, who have been trained and are
presently implementing the UNICEF-funded teacher training program.                            A specialized
international institution will be recruited by the sub-component to perform the training of
trainers.

21.     Training programs.       In order to develop and implement training programs, the sub-
component will support the capacity building at MINEDUC (focusing on BER and School
Radio) in the following areas: (i)       the elaboration of training programs for teachers, school

directorsand inspectors; (ii) the development ofpedagogicaland administrativetools for school
directorsand inspectors; (iii) conception,writing andproductionof distance interactiveradio
                              the
training programs; and (iv) the training of trainers. The TORSfor the TA were agreed during
Appraisal.

22.     Cost and Financing:       The sub-component will finance all teacher training costs,
including: (i) qualifying and in-service training: costs of travel and per diem for teachers,
trainers andinspectors(US$0.7 million); (ii)  training of school directors andinspectors: costs of
travel and per diem for schools directors, inspectors and trainers (US$ 1.2 million); (iii)
pedagogicaltraining materials and office supplies (US$ 0.1 million); (v) TA to developthe in-
servicetrainingprogram(US$0.3 million); and; (vi) Radio equipment (US$ 0.11million). Other
donors su~port: UNICEF has already financed the training of 1,500 unqualified teachers
recruitedin2005/06.

Sub-component 2.2. Provision and management of textbooks and learning materials (US$
4.0 million).

23.    Diagnosis:     The significant increase in enrollment jointly with the current low
availability of textbooks implies an enormous and urgent need of textbooks and learning
materials. The current availabilityoftextbooks at the primary levelvaries around25% inFrench
and 30% in Kirundi. Lower rates are observed in mathematics, teachers' guides and for most
subjects at the lower secondarylevel("Colleges ").

24.    Objective: This sub-componentaims to contributeto improve learningoutcomesby: (i)
providing one textbook of readinginFrenchand Kirundifor each student inthe 3rd,4th, 5*, and
6thgrades inthe primary level; (ii) one textbook for three students at the lower secondary level
("Colleges ") inMathematics, Biology, Kirundi, Frenchand English; (iii) one textbook and one
guide for all primary and lower secondary teachers; and (iv) the development and capacity
buildinginprocurementandmanagementoftextbooks andlearningmaterials.

Activities and procedures

25.    Procedures. The reprint of the primary level textbooks and the purchase of the off-the-
shelf secondary level textbooks will be carried out through international competitive bidding
(ICB). A margin of preference may be given for books printed in Burundi. Primary and
secondary teachers' guides will be reprinted by national competitive bidding (NCB). The
reference books for the "Bureaux Pidagogiques (DGBP) will be purchased through limited
                                                   "
ICB. All textbooks and learning materials will be delivered to MINEDUC's warehouse in
Bujumburaand the distributionto schools will be carriedout by privatedistributors/transporters
selectedthroughNCB. Textbooks andteachers' guides will be loanedfree of charge to students
andteachersfor the school year.

26.     Cost and Financing: The support o f the sub-component will complement the financing
from UNICEF and Belgian Cooperation ina coordinated manner in order to reach the targets of
one textbook per child at the primary level and one textbook for three students at the lower
secondary level.     In the framework of this sub-component, the IDA Grant will finance the
following list o f titles to be delivered to the schools during school year 2007/08: (a) Primary
level: (i)
         textbooks inFrench and Kirundi for 3rd, qth,5th, and 6* grades (estimated cost: US$2.5
million); (ii)teachers' guides (estimated cost:        US$ 0.4 million); (b) Lower secondary:
textbooks in the following subjects and grades: English Sth, English gth, English IOth; Biology
7th(L1); Biology 7th(L2); Biology Sth (Ll); Biology Sth (L2); Biology gth, Biology loth, History
gth, History lofh, Kirundi 7*, Kirundi Sth, Kirundi gth, Kirundi lo*, French 7* (Ll), French 7th

Mathematics gth (L2), Mathematics gth (L3), Mathematics 1Oth (Ll), Mathematics loth (L2),
Mathematics 1Ofh (L3) (estimated cost: US$0.9 million); (iv) technical assistance, workshops
and study tours to develop capacity building in textbooks and learning materials' procurement
and management (US$0.2 million).

27.     Other donors support. For the 2006-07 school year, the CTB plans to finance:               (i)
primary level textbooks: French 2"d and Mathematics 2"d; (ii)      primary level teachers' guides:
Mathematics 2nd, Local Studies 2nd, Music and Artistic Expression 2"d. UNICEF plans to
finance: (i) primary level textbooks: Kirundi lSt, lSt,
                                                      French     and Mathematics 1"; (ii)    primary
level teachers' guides: Kirundi2nd,Kirundi 3rd, and Kirundi 5'h.

Sub-component2.3. Measurementof learningoutcomes(US$0.16 million).

28.     Diagnosis: Burundi does not have any kind o f standardized test to measure quality
performance. Exams in6'h Grade inprimary level and the national end o f cycle's exams do not
provide standardized results.      Participation in international assessments (like PARSEC and
MLA) does not occur on a regular basis and it does not provide country specific aspects to
evaluate and introduce improving measures.

29.     Objective: this sub-component aims to introduce an instrument to measure learning
outcomes by introducing rapid assessment o f reading competency, which will allow for
evaluating o f the impact o f measures that aim to improve or maintain quality. The rapid reading
assessment will be carried out eachyear o f the Project. The results o f the first year o fthe Project
will allow for the establishment o fabaseline inyear one.

30.     Activities and procedures. The Project will support TA to designand help MINEDUC
in executing the rapid reading competency tests each year of the Project. The assistance will
importantly include to assist the DGED and BEA in: (i) design and identification o f the
                                                              the
sample to be tested, (ii)  the management inthe execution o f the tests; and (iii) elaboration o f
                                                                                   the

COMPONENT 3. BUILDINGCAPACITY INMINEDUC (US$4.25million).

32.      The objective o fthis component is to improve the capacity o fthe Government o fBurundi
to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation.               Building
Government capacity to planand manage the education sector will inturn increase the likelihood
o f attracting more external fundingfor its programs, including membershipinthe EFA - FTI.

Sub-Component3.1 Institutionbuildingandstrategydevelopment(US$2.95million)

33.      Diagnosis: In2000, MINEDUC beganthe process o f decentralizationto provinces and
school districts. However, the roles o f central and decentralized levels remains unclear, with
duplication o f roles and overlapping information leading to a huge inefficiencies inthe allocation
o f resources. In particular, the random allocation of teachers i s evidence o f poor teacher
management practices. Burundi has an extraordinarily poor distribution of teachers among
primary schools. The planning system i s characterized by several weaknesses: (i)        the central
planning structure lacks enough qualified personnel and logistical capacity; (ii)district and
provincial branches o f BP lack capacity for data collection and processing; (iii)overlap in
responsibilities among central and provincial levels exists in critical areas o f planning such as
teacher allocation and infrastructure; (iv) the existing School Map's tool i s poorly developed and
the information is gathered with delays; (v) the annual education statistical report is published
with delays and critical sector indicators are neither presented nor monitored.         In terms of
pedagogic and quality aspects, a main cause o f concern i s the extremely high repetition rate
(30% on average at primary level) causing a strong negative impact on keeping children at
schools and entailing an enormous waste o f resources. Inaddition, its positive impact on quality
i s not proven. With respect to the assessment o f student's achievements, Burundi does not have
any kind o f standardized test to measure quality performance. In terms of pre-service teacher
training and primary level curricula the Government aims to adapt them to the new curricula
developments.     Concerning, in particular the curricula, Burundi has already considered the
possibility to adopt the approaches by competences, though needs to evaluate its long-terms costs
and implementation arrangements. Inthis context and inorder to address strategy development,
the Government has created a CCSPS, committed itself to monitoring and training related to
sector strategy implementationreinforcing the analytical processes for sector policy and decision
making.

34.      Objective. This component aims to improve the capacity o f the government o f Burundi
to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation. Building
Government capacity to plan andmanage the education sector will inturn increase the likelihood

36.     The TA to support MINEDUC indeveloping policies and reforms includesthe following
specific objectives, to:  (i)supportthe developmentofmediumandlong-term strategiesto
improve pedagogic management in order to make learning and teaching and learning process
more efficient and increase education quality. The support will be focused on four key fields:
teacher training, curricula development, student assessment system and reduction of repetition
rates; (ii)
          design andpiloting of a managementinformationsystem (including a school map), (iii)
develop an organizational plan for the sector that promotes decentralization, development of a
teacher employment and training policy, (v) develop a policy note on health, hygiene and
nutrition, (vi) develop a separate sub-sector strategy for secondary, technical and vocational
education, and (vii) prepare a diagnosis and initial strategy document for higher education
reform. The Project will support the TA to assist MINEDUC in developing the policies and
reforms to improve the quality of education, build institutional capacity in management and
planning and elaborate policy notes and action plan for health and nutrition and for each sub-
sector in particular secondary, technical-vocational and higher education. In order to simplify
contracting and ensure consistent technical advice; the activity will be carried out through a
"Partnership Agreement" with a single TA provider in the framework of a two year contract.
The TORSfor the TA were agreedduring Appraisal.

37.     Cost and Financing: The sub-component will specifically finance: (i) TA to assist
                                                                               The

Sub-component3.2. ProjectManagement(U$S1.3 million).

38.     Diagnostic: Existingcapacities at MINEDUC to undertake FMandprocurement are not
adequate. Therefore, some TA will be necessary to support the CCSPS, the technical structures
of MINEDUC, at least for the two first year of project implementation, while capacity can be
transferred to the ministry structures. This TA will be composed of a team of 6 persons in the
context of SEO.

39.     Objective: this sub-component aims to create capacity at the SEO, which will be
strengthened thereby enabling it to effectively: (i) coordinate the work of those in charge o f
component implementation; (ii)   effectively manage IDA financing; (iii) procurement and
                                                                        handle
FM; (iv) monitor project implementation and the results framework; andto (v) transfer fiduciary
capacity to the MINEDUC's future structure that will be in charge o f the management donors

the general supervisiono fMINEDUCthroughthe SEO.

2.      During project preparation, the Bank has carried out an in-depth evaluation o f the
fiduciary capacity o f MINEDUC,having concluded that minimal conditions have not yet been
satisfied in order to delegate these functions to MINEDUC. Consequently, the SEO has been
created within the CCSPS as a specific structure to coordinate the implementation o f external
resources including its fiduciary management when applicable. MINEDUC and donors have
agreed that this will be a transitional arrangement while settingthe basis for establishing a long-
term common institutional management arrangement to manage donors' funds. To achieve this
objective an assessment followed by an action plan that will be carried out during the first year
o fthe Project (financed by DFID and AFD and supported by the Bank)to identify common long-
term arrangements with the aim o f harmonizing fiduciary mechanisms inthe context o fresources
canalized in the framework o f SWAP supporting the EFA - FTI program. This will decrease
transaction costs and increase the efficiency inthe execution from all donors' sources.

9.     Technical Directorates (DT). The execution of components 2 and 3 will be carried out by
the DT o f MINEDUC responsible for the respective areas of intervention under the general
coordination o f SEO. The DT responsible for each component will be in charge o f operational
and technical execution (except in the case o f Component 1 which has a special arrangement).
Therefore, each responsible Technical Director will be the respective Component's coordinator
inthe case of components 2 and 3. The Technical Directors will manage the component under
the general oversight o f the respective responsible Technical Units o f the CTE in charge o f
sector policy development and oversight: (i)     Component 1 under the general supervision o f
Technical Unit 1 "Access and Equity"; (ii)Component 2 under the general supervision o f
Technical Unit 2. "Quality";     and (iii)Component 3 under the general supervision o f the
Technical Unit 3 "Institutional Capacity Building and Planning" and Technical Unit 4 "Post-
Primary".    The CTE's Technical Units will periodically meet each respective responsible
Technical Director to coordinate and harmonize the execution following approved annual plans
and specific policy in each area. The specific mission o f each Technical Director/component
coordinator (with the exception o f Component l), prepare
                                                   i s to: (i) annual actions plan and their

consultant's reports, participation in procurement evaluation missions, and data collection for
sector reports; (iv) coordinate with ES all component activities, submitting to them all required
information, including that for fiduciary and auditing purposes.           Specific and technical
responsibilities and procedures for each component are described in Annex 4 (In the Detailed
Project Description) and inthe PIM.

Specificresponsiblefor eachcomponent:

10.     Component 1. "Expansion of school facilities". The management o f this Component
will be carried out by the ABUTIP, following the mechanism o f "Maitrise d'Ouvrage De`le`gue`"
(MOD) under the general supervision o f SEO and the Technical Unit 1 "Access and Equity" o f
the CTE. Inthis framework, the MINEDUC and the Communes will delegate to the ABUTIP
the authority to manage the contracts for civil works, school furniture and consultant services.
Moreover, the ABUTIP will put in place separate financial management and procurement
arrangements for this component, and will accordingly manage its own Designated Account.,
based on specific operational manuals. The ABUTIP will be also responsible for carrying out
and overseeing the implementation of the ESMF and RPF. To establish this mechanism three
different contracts will be agreed upon and signed: (i) "Subsidiary Agreement" between the
                                                          a
MINEDUC and the ABUTIP which establishes all conditions to manage the component; (ii)            an
Annual Agreement between MINEDUC and the ABUTIP specifying the detailed annual work
program (AWP); and (iii)    an agreement between each participant Commune and the ABUTIP
establishing the specific civil work and equipment program and the activities related to
community participation, including the "Commune Development Committee" (Comite` de
De`veloppementCommunal- CDCs) and the school community. The general supervision o f the
"Subsidiary Agreement" betweenMINEDUC and the ABUTIP will be carried out by SEO and
the Technical Unit 1 "Access and Equity", technically assisted by the Office o f Education
Projects (Bureaux du Projects de Z'Education)         and the BPE.       The technical, financial
management and procurement arrangementswill be specified inthe "Subsidiary Agreement" and
inthe PIM.

11.     Component 2. "Support to teaching and learning". The DGBP will be in charge o f
the overall implementation of this component in close collaboration with structures responsible
for each sub-component execution and under the general oversight o f Unit 2 "Quality" o f the
CTE. In particular: (i) sub-component 2.1 "Training o f teachers, schools directors and
                           for
inspectors", the DGBP will work in close coordination with the Office o f National Evaluations
(Bureau des Evaluations Nationales, BEN) and School Radio Team in selection and supervising
the technical assistance, the purchase o f the equipment and the execution o f training activities;
(ii) sub-component2.2."Provisionandmanagementoftextbooksandlearningmaterials", the
    for
DGBPwill be the main actor responsible for managing international textbooks bidding instrong
collaboration with the DT o f each education level (DGEB and the General Directorate o f
Secondary Education (Direction General d'Education Secondaire - DGES); and (iii)         for sub-

component 2.3. "Measurement o f learning outcomes" the DGBP will work jointly with the BEN
incarrying out the rapid reading assessment tests and incoordinating technical aspects withthe
consultancy.

12.    Component 3 "Buildingcapacity at MINEDUC". The BPE will be in charge o f the
overall implementation of sub-component 3.1. "Institution building and strategy development".
However, since this sub-component reaches most aspects o f the sector policy and institutional
building, all MINEDUC's structures will be involved. Therefore, the BPE will be focus in
leading the coordination o f the activities of the "Partnership Agreement" in close collaboration
with Units 3 and 4 of the CTE and their respective DT. The sub-component 3.2 "Project
management" will be incharge o fthe SEO, since it i s responsible for project management.

13.    A simplified logical framework anda detailed M&Esystemwere agreed upon. InAnnex
3, there are clearly defined and quantified indicators, with baseline values, yearly progress plans
and final targets consistent with specific goals o f each component. There will be two levels o f
M&E: (i) general sector policy and project general oversight will be a function o f the
             the
Coordination Committee with the assistance o f the BPE. The BPE will elaborate and furnish
quarterly and annual progress report for the CCSPS; (ii) Project's M&E will be a primary

Introduction

1.      An assessment o f the FM arrangements for the Project was carried out with the aim o f
determining whether they are suitable for the Project and to determine whether the implementing
agencies have acceptable FM arrangements. This annex contains the results o f this assessment,
and will be completed after project appraisal.

CountryIssues

2.      The 2004 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) revealedthat the public
FM system in Burundi was weak, particularly relating to the following aspects:           budget
formulation and execution, financial reporting, and oversight systems, linkages between agreed
policies, budget planning and execution. The CFAA further outlined the lack of an adequate
tracking and reporting system and a formal accounting system within ministries. These
weaknesses in the financial accounting and auditing systems pose some fiduciary risk. The
biggest challenge facing Government is the severe human resource capacity constraints. Since
then, the Government, with the support of international donors, has shown its commitment to
implementingFM's reforms. Key actions already taken or underway include: (i) adoption of
                                                                                 the
a unified functional and economic classification o f public expenditure and a double-entry
accounting system (2004); (ii)   the implementation of a system for monitoring the flows o f
external assistance and government expenditures; and (iii)   the computerization o f expenditure
management. The audit Court (Cow des Comptes) was established in 2004 and now regularly
preparesaudit reports on the government accounts. These reforms are supported mainly through
a recently agreed Development Policy Lending grant with the World Bank and through the
Economic Management Support Project.

Institutionaland implementationarrangements

3.      The Project will be implementedby MINEDUC through the SEO o f the CCSPS. The
SEO will comprise o f a Financial Management Specialist (FMS) who will be responsible for
implementing the FM arrangements for the Project. The FMS will report to the Executive
Secretary and will manage a team comprising one accountant. These members o f staff will be
recruited through competitive procedure and will have commenced their duties by project
effectiveness. A suitable training program will be designed to ensure their knowledge o f World
Bank financial, disbursement andprocurement procedures.




                                               67

4.      Component 1 o f the Project (Expanding School Facilities) will be implementedby the
ABUTIP. An FMassessmento fthis Agency indicates that its FMarrangements are satisfactory,
particularly with respect to staffing, documentation o f procedures and monitoring their
compliance.    Staffing at the ABUTIP already includes a core management team (National
Director, a Finance Director, a Senior andtwo Juniors accountants).

RiskAssessment andmitipation

5.      The objectives o f the Project's FM system are to: (i) that funds are usedonly for
                                                               ensure
their intendedpurposes inan efficient andeconomical way while implementing agreed activities;
(ii) thepreparationofaccurateandtimelyfinancialreports; (iii) thatfundsare
    enable                                                                 ensure
properly managed and flow rapidly, adequately, regularly and predictably to implementing
agencies; (iv) enable project management to monitor the efficient implementation o f the Project;
and to (v) safeguard the Project's assets and resources. Furthermore, inorder to ensure a strong
FM system, the implementingagencies should have an adequate number and mix o f skilled and
experienced staff, the internal control system should ensure the conduct o f an orderly and
efficient payment and procurement process and the proper recording and safeguarding o f assets
and resources. The accounting system should support the Project's requests for funding and
meet its reporting obligations to funders including the Government, IDA and other donors. The
system should also be capable o f providing financial data to measure performance when linked
to the outputs o f the Project. Lastly, an independent, qualified auditor should be appointed to
reviewthe Project's financial statements and internal controls.

6.      The table below shows the results o f the risk assessment from the Risk Rating Summary.
This identifies the key risks that project management may face in achieving project objectives,
together with the appropriate ratings. It outlines the risk mitigating measures that should be
incorporated into the project design and indicates whether particular actions form the basis for
the conditions o fNegotiations, presentation to the Boardor Effectiveness.

Country Level           S       The Government of Burundi is highly committed to a reform
                                program that includes the strengthening of the budget
                                classifications, implementation of an interim IFMIS. A new
                                legal framework is being prepared. However, there are still
                                weaknesses in capacity and in audit, preparationof first set of
                                consolidated accounts. Efforts are continuing to strengthen
                                accountingand audit capacity.
Entity Level            H       Legal and institutional framework supports project oversight
                                and implementation by the MINEDUC.            The use of a
                                computerized information system should enable the timely
                                preparation and submission of accounts to the MINEDUC.
                                An Executive Operational Secretariat (SEO) with specific
                                responsibilities related to project management has been
                                created.

Planninpand Budpeting

8.      Both implementingunits will use their planning and budgeting system to ensure proper
planningfor the implementationof its activities. A project budget and a disbursement schedule
havebeendrawnupandare includedinthe ProjectAppraisalDocument(PAD). Annual budgets
will reflect the regular updatingof this disbursement schedule and financial requirements of the
project. The annual budgetwill be preparedbasedonthe policy guidelines issuedby Ministry of
Finance. The budgetwill serve as a planning, managementand controltool. It will be regularly
monitored, and material variances between budgeted and actual amounts will be investigated.
The results of the monitoring process will be fed back into the budgeting process to ensure
properfollow up ofkeyissues identified.

9.      As part ofthe preparationof its AWP andbudget, each agency or component involvedin
project implementationwill commit itself to specific performance indicators specifying clear
targets to be achieved inthe course of the year regardingimprovedaccess and quality of service
delivery. These targets reflect the goals implementingagencies want to achieve during project
implementation. The goals are specifiedin strategy documentsthat have already beenprepared
for the Project. Work programs will be presentedto IDA and their approval i s a condition of
annual disbursements.

10.    No later than November 30 o f each year, the SEO will submit to IDA, the aggregated
proposed AWPs and Financial Report for the Project as a whole and broken down by
implementingpartner. The report format will detail activities, associated unit costs and an
implementation timetable. It will also include monitorable progress indicators for each activity
proposed inthe work program. The work program and budgetswill be reviewed by the CCSPS
prior to submission to IDA for no-objection.

11.     Inaddition, the SEO will submitquarterly progress reports to CCSPS and IDA showing
budgetedand actual expenditures, source o f funds used, statements o fprogress achieved on the
basis o f the agreed upon indicators and the (revised) objectives and financial reports for the
forthcoming six months.

Internalcontrols

12.     The Project's internal controls will include all the means by which the implementing
units will ensure that its operations are carried out efficiently and effectively. In addition, this
system will be usedto ensure that project transactions are correctly made, recorded and reported
upon. The accounting systems will be used to track, record, analyze and summarize financial
transactions relating to the components for which they are responsible.

13.     Each o f the implementing agencies' accounting systems will be used to track, record,
analyze and summarize financial transactions relating to the components for which they are
responsible.   The Project's accounts will be prepared on a cash basis in accordance with
International Accounting Standards.

Books of accounts

14.     The implementing agencies will ensure that proper books o f accounts are properly set up
and regularly maintained to record project transactions. These will include at a minimum, a
general ledger, cashbook and subsidiary ledgers. A proper filing system that allows authorized
users easy access will be set up to ensure that all accounting and supporting documents are
retainedon a permanentbasis and properly maintained. The implementing agencies will have an
accounting system that allows for the proper recording o f project financial transactions,
including the allocation o f expenditures in accordance with the respective components,
disbursement categories, and sources o f funds. Appropriate controls over the preparation and
approval o f transactions should be put inplace to ensure that all transactions are correctly made,
recorded and reportedupon.

ChartofAccounts

15.      The Project will prepare a Chart o f Accounts that reflects the transactions that will be
undertakenby the project. The list o f codes in the Chart o f Accounts will be a useful tool in
ensuring that individual transactions relating to the Project can be identified separately and that
project costs canbe directly relatedto specific activities and outputs o fthe Project.

Computerizationof accounts

16.      The computerized accounting systems for both units will be used to maintain the
project's budgets and books o f accounts and to automatically generate its interim and annual
financial reports. The computerization o f the accounting system will help to reduce the risk o f
human errors in record keeping, and would help enhance the efficiency o f the process o f
preparing reports. The ABUTIP already has a well functioning computerized system. The ES
will acquire a suitable software package which will be used to runthe accounting system. The
system will be acquired through procurement procedures acceptable to IDA and installed by
experienced consultants. The Project's staff will receive appropriate training in its usage, and
management will ensure that there are proper controls to safeguard confidentiality, integrity and
availability o fthe data.

ManualofAccountingProcedures

17.      The accounting systems, policies and procedures employed by the project in accounting
for and managing project funds will be documented in the project's PIM. The accounting
policies will specify the accounting treatment for the project's financial transactions and will
constitute basic principles designed to ensure that the accounting records are complete, relevant
and reliable and that accounting practices are followed consistently. The P I M will be used by:
(i)IDAtoassesstheacceptabilityoftheprojectaccounting, reportingandcontrolsystems;(ii)
staff as a reference manual; and (iii) the auditors to assess project accounting systems and
                                        by
controls andindesigning specific project audit procedures.

18.      Specific procedures will be documented for each significant accounting function,
depicting document and transaction flows, the appropriate filing o f project documents,
management approvals and organizational duties and responsibilities. The accounting system
will consist o fthe methods andrecords established to identify, assemble analyze, classify, record
and report the transactions o fthe Project, and to maintain accountability for the related assets and
liabilities. The aspects to be covered inthe PIMwill include: (i) o f funds; (ii)
                                                                   flow                 financial and

                                                 72

19.     Inaddition, the PIM will document the arrangements that have beenmade for recording
project outputs and outcomes which are required to evaluate progress toward the achievement o f
project objectives.

FinancialReportingandMonitoring

20.     The format, content, reporting periodicity anddeadlines for submission o f reports will be
prepared before and agreed at negotiations. The financial reports will be designed to provide
quality and timely information to project management, implementing agencies, and various
stakeholders on project performance.

21.     The Interim Financial Reports will be produced on a quarterly basis and will provide
information on the sources and uses o f funds by loan category and by project activity, forecasts
o f expenditure, amount o f disbursement requested and a reconciliation o f the Designated
Account (DA). This information, in addition to that contained in physical progress and
procurement reports, will help management to closely monitor the implementation o f project
activities.

22.     Annual Financial Statements andAnnexes for the project will include:
    A Statement of Sources and Uses of Funds showing the sources o f funds, a summary o f
    expenditures analyzed under the main headings and by main category o f expenditures
    (consistent with the Chart o f Accounts), and any additional information necessary to indicate
    the activities financed bythe different donors.
    Notes in respect o f significant accounting policies and accounting standards adopted by
    management when preparing the accounts and any supplementary information or
    explanations that may be deemed appropriate by management in order to enhance the
    presentation o f a "true andfair view ".
    Special Account Statement showing deposits and replenishments received, payments
    substantiated by withdrawal applications, interest that may be earned on the account and the
    balance at the end o fthe fiscal year;
    A Reconciliationbetween the amounts shown as "Received by the Project from IDA and
    that shown as having been"Disbursed" by them.
    Implementation Report, which would be a narrative summary o f the implementation
    progress for the Project.

Indicative formats o f these statements should be developed in accordance with IDA
requirements.

Auditing

Internal Audit

23.     MINEDUC i s required to appoint an internal auditor. However, this function i s largely
compliance- and transaction-oriented and adds little value to the control framework. However, it
appears that such a function will be adequate given the context o f the project and the number o f
transactions. The internal audit function will thus be fulfilled within the Ministry's framework.
The frequency and extent o f internal audit review and testing o f the internal controls will be
consistent with the nature, complexity, and risk associated with the Project's activities. Internal
audit exercises will thus be plannedto reflect prevailing circumstances. Internal audit reports
will address internal control deficiencies, or ineffective policies or procedures.          Project
management will put inplace measures to address any deficiencies ina timely manner.

ExternalAudit                                                                                      ,

24.     The external audit o fthe Project's annual financial statements will be contracted to a firm
o f private auditors. The auditors will be selected on criteria that are acceptable to the World
Bank with regard to their independence, qualifications and experience.          The audit will be
conducted inaccordance with TORSagreed with IDA. The scope o f the audit will include all the
project's sources o f income and expenditure. The date o f the first audit will be determined in
consultation with IDA.       A single audit opinion will be issued on project income and
expenditures, designated accounts and InterimUnaudited Financial Reports (IFR). Inaddition to
the external audit report, the auditors will be required to preparea Management Letter which will
document internal control weaknesses identified during the audit, with recommendations for
improvements. Copies o f the audit reports together with Management Letters will be sent to
IDA and all other financingpartners no later than six months after year end.

Disbursementsarrangements

25.     The amounts and percentages to be financed through the Project are detailed inthe Table
below. The grant will be disbursed over a period o f four years. The grant closing date has been
set at six months after the expected date for completion o f project activities June 30, 2011, to
allow for the orderly processing o f final disbursement requests and the production of the
Project's final audit and annual progress reports.

Methodof Disbursement

26.     The Project will not be ready for report-baseddisbursementsby effectiveness. Thus, at
the initial stage, the transaction-baseddisbursementprocedures(as describedinthe World Bank
Disbursement Handbook) will be followed, i.e. direct payment, reimbursements, special
commitmentsandreplenishmentsofthe DesignatedAccount.

27.     Where the reports are adequate and produced on a timely basis, and the Borrower
requests conversionto report-baseddisbursements, a review will be undertakenby the IDA to
determineifthe project is eligible for this method. The adoptionof report-baseddisbursements
by the project will enable it to move away from transaction-baseddisbursementmethodto IFR-
baseddisbursementsto the Project's DesignatedAccounts, basedonIFRs.




                                               75

Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs)

28.     Disbursements for all expenditures will be made against full documentation, except for
items claimed under the SOE procedure.         SOEs will be used for payments claimed under
contracts for: (a) works inan amount inferior to US$200,000, (b) goods inan amount inferior to
US$ 150.000; (c) consulting firms in an amount inferior to US$lOO,OOO (d) individual
consultants inan amount inferior to US$50,000 as well as small equipment, office supplies and
training. Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs will be retained by
the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) and made available for review when requested by IDA
periodic supervision missions and project external auditors. All disbursements are subject to the
conditions o fthe FinancingAgreement and the procedures defined inthe DisbursementLetter.

DesignatedAccount

29.      The Project will maintain two designated accounts: (a) Designated Account A: to
facilitate and accelerate the disbursement process the ABUTIP will maintain one Designated
Account inUS Dollars with a respective current account inFBUto manage Components 1o f the
project. The detailed modalities for the utilization o f the Designated Account B are established
in the Manual of Administrative, Financial, Budgetary and Accounting Procedures of the
ABUTIP. In particular the chapter 111.5 o f the Manual describes the procedures concerning
treasury, replenishment/disbursementand account reconciliation; (ii)  Designated Account B: the
SEO will maintain one Designated Account in US Dollars with a respective current account in
FBU to manage Components 2 and 3 o f the Project. Funds will be used to make payments to
suppliers inthe respective contract currencies. Interest income received on these accounts will
be deposited into the respective accounts.

30.     The Designated Account A in US Dollars with a respective current account in local
currency would be opened by the ABUTIP in a reliable commercial bank on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocations for the Designated Account A will be
US$ 1,000,000. The Designated Account A in U S Dollars with a respective current account in
local currency would be opened by the SEO in a reliable commercial bank on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation for the Designated Account A will be
US$ 700,000.       The respective allocations will cover about six (6) months o f eligible
expenditures.

31.     The Designated Accounts will be replenished through the submission o f Withdrawal
Applications on a monthly basis and will include reconciled bank statements and other
documents as required until such time as the borrower may choose to convert to report-based
disbursement.    The Recipient may also choose to pre-finance project expenditure and seek
reimbursement from the Bank as needed. Upon credit effectiveness, the Bank will deposit the
amount o f US $ 1,000.000 into Designated Account A and US$ 700,000 in the Designated
Account B. The Designated Accounts will be used for all payments inferior to twenty percent o f
the authorized allocation and replenishment applications will be submitted monthly. Further


                                               76

depositsby the Bank into the DesignatedAccount will be made against withdrawal applications
supportedby appropriatedocuments.

FinancialCovenants

32.    An FMsystem, includingrecords andaccounts will bemaintainedby the SEO. Financial
Statements will be prepared in a format acceptable to IDA, and will be adequate to reflect
agreementwith soundaccountingpracticesthe operations,resourcesandexpenditures.

SupervisionPlan

33.     Supervision activities will include: review of quarterly IFRs; review of annual audited
financial statements and management letter as well as timely follow up of issues arising; review
of SOE in a sample basis and participation inproject supervisionmissions as appropriate. The
Bank's FMS in charge will play a key role in monitoring the timely implementation of the
financial managementarrangements.

Conclusions

34.     The overall conclusion of the assessment is that the current FM arrangements are not
satisfactory to meet IDA FM requirements. Therefore, all recommendations need to be
implementedby effectiveness.

35.    By effectiveness, the Project will not be ready for report-baseddisbursements. Thus, at
the initial stage, transaction-baseddisbursement procedures, as described in the World Bank
Disbursement Handbook, will be followed i.e. direct payment, reimbursement, and special
commitments. However, when project implementation begins and the Borrower requests
conversion to report-baseddisbursements, a review will be undertakenby IDA to determine if
the Projectis eligible.

B -Assessment of the country procurementpracticesand assessment of the implementing
agenciesto manageprocurement

14.     Country issues. The country procurement system is a matter o f concern for the
Government and all stakeholders.         In June 2003, the Government established a Steering
Committee (SC) including representatives from the public and private sectors and the civil
society. The SC was aimed at carrying out an assessment o f the national procurement system in
order to propose a procurement reform action plan. In 2004 the Bank conducted a Country
Procurement Issue Paper (CPIP) which was issued in June 2004. The Government and Bank
assessments concluded that Burundi procurement system shows a significant number o f
deficiencies: (i) The legal and institutional framework is outdated; (ii) environment is not
                                                                            the
conducive to effective procurement, as it plagued by political interference; and (iii)     there i s a
lack o f accountability, as well as non-compliance with the existing procedures either because o f
rules and regulations not widely known and/or due to the absence o f capacity to handle
procurement inan efficient manner

15.     InJune 2005, the SC reviewedandupdatedthe government actionandmergeditwiththe
CPIP action plan. The integratedprocurement reform action plan i s built on five components
namely: (i)   the revision of the institutional and legal framework with a view to separating the
execution function from the regulatory function; (ii)the modernization o f procurement
procedures; (iii) the strengthening o f procurement capacity; (iv) the setting up o f an independent
ex-post control system; and (v) the enforcing o f adequate measures against corruption.

16.     This action plan is being executed, while its implementation is behind the schedule,
progress can be noticed. Thus, the draft o f a revised procurement code and institutional
framework consistent with the recommendations o f the procurement reform action plan was
discussed by stakeholder during a four days workshop held in August 2006.              Most o f the
comments and recommendations made by the participants to the workshop and IDA were
incorporated in the final version o f the procurement code. This document was reviewed and
adopted by the cabinet meeting at its meeting o f November, 22, 2006. The new procurement
code should be transmitted to the parliament by mid-December 2006.




                                                  80

17.      In addition, the Government defined and adopted in March 2006 an emergency action
planthat included a set o f measures to be implemented within six months aimed at reinforcing
the competition and the transparency of the procurement process. Under the emergency action
plan, all the procuring entities will sign a transparency pact committing themselves to: (i) make
publicly available their annual procurement plans; (ii)    post on the procurement website to be
created the bidding documents and all the information the bidders are entitled to know ; (iii)
disclose all information on awarding of contracts; and (iv) make publicly available the amount,
the name of the parties to the contract, the scope o f the contract for all the contract awarded
through direct contracting andthe reason o fthe direct contracting as well. Progress to date inthe
implementation is negligiblesince only a couple o f measures aimed at disseminatingthe contents
o fthis action planhave beenundertaken.

18.      Assessment of the implementingagencies. During the appraisal mission it was agreed
that overall responsibility for the management o f the procurement aspects will be handled by
MINEDUC except for the sub component 1. - Expanding o f schools facilities infrastructure -
that would be carried out by the ABUTIP through a contracting arrangement withMINEDUC.

19.      MINEDUC's experience in procurement i s o f concern as it i s very limited. Since the
Republic o f Burundi in October 1993 was embarked inthe last and most important conflict that
country has been subject since its independence, the resources allocated to investment in
education sector through the national budget were very limited. When the Government was in a
position to carry out rehabilitation o f some schools or supply textbooks or provide school
furniture, these activities were procured by the Government using its own units, the Directorate
o f Education Projects ("Bureau du Projet Education") for school construction or the "Regie de
Production Pedagogique" for the supply o ftextbooks. The use o f force account is permittedina
very few circumstances and the using o f government-owned units or enterprises that are not
legally and financially autonomous i s prohibited.

20.      Since the implementing experience of recipient o f the grant i s very limited, it was
decided that procurement activities would be carried out by the SEO of the CCSPS. The CCSPS
i s chaired by the the Minister o f MINEDUC and composed o f the executive secretary o f SEO,
the director o f the BPE, and representatives from the Vice- Presidency, the Ministryo f Finance,
MinistryofInterior andPublic Security andthe MinistryofPlanning,Development andNational
Reconstruction. The SEO will be headed by an Executive Secretary who will be the project

experience in procurement, it was not possible to conduct an assessment o f this entity nor to
conduct an assessment o f the capacity o f the procurement specialist since he or she i s not
recruited yet. It i s evident that the procurement risk i s high for the components to be
implementedunder the responsibility ofthe SEO. Consequently, an actionplan to strengthenthe

                               BURUNDI: EducationSupportProject


1.     An in-depthcomprehensive Country Status Report (Rapport d'Etat du Systbme Educatif
National Burundais, RESEN) on the state of the education system in Burundi was finalized in
April 2006. It provides a solid basis for sector information, statistics, indicators and economic
analysis. In addition, as a follow-up of the CSR, a wide and comprehensive exercise of the
education sector long-term financing (until 2015) was discussed among a joint team comprised
of individuals from MINEDUC, the Bank and the financial and technical development partners
(UNESCOBREDAPole de Dakar, UNICEF, CTB, DFID, AFD, P A M and local NGO's
coordination). Nine different scenarios were formulated and discussed varying assumptions for
all main variables. This economic and financial analysis summarizes the findings of the CSR
and the long- term sustainability of the scenario chosen by the Government and agreed with
among donors, making itthe framework that this Project is aligned to support. Inaddition, it will
bethe basis for amore detailed action planto complete the EFA-FTIprogram.

Access, coverage andcompletion:

2.     As aresult ofthe civil conflict, primaryenrollment significantly dropped from 650,000 in
1991/92(a GER of 71%) to only about 440,000 in 1993-1996, (a GER of 50%). However, once
the political situation improved, the education sector made a rapid recovery. By 2000, primary
enrollment hadrecoveredto the level recordedbefore the 1993 civil conflict, and enrollment has
since grown much faster than inthe pre-crisis years. With the recent elimination of the primary
school fee, preliminary statistics indicate that primary enrollment exceeded 1,350,000 pupils in
the 2005/06 schoolyear (a GERofaround 100%). The intake rate" was 91% in2003/04, butthe
completion rate" was only 33%. There is, thus, a very long way to go before reaching universal
primary completion in Burundi. The retention rate in primary'* is around 37%, thus currently
more than 60% o fthose that start primary school will not complete it.

3.     However, many Burundianchildrennever go to school or drop out before completing the
primary cycle. The primary education systeminBurundiis characterizedby avery large number
of repeaters, leading to an inflated GER andthereby giving the impressionthat access to primary
education is better than it actually is. But, the completion ratel3i s only 37%. There is, thus, a
very longway to go before reaching universal primarycompletion inBurundi. The retentionrate
in prirnaryl4 is around 40%, thus currently 60% of those that start primary school will not

who are still inschool by the last year, i s only 48%.

4.       There are large disparities in the access to education based on urbdrural residence,
income quintile, and gender. Disparities in education outcomes among gender and regions are
significant: females comprise 45% o f the students at the primary level, 41% at the secondary
level, and 25% at the university level and GER goes from 130% inthe city o f Bujumbura to 50%
in the provinces of Ngozi and Muyinga.          The few students who reach the highest level o f
education consume a disproportionately large share o f public education resources. The CSR
found that the distribution of education expenditures among the members o f a cohort o f children
i s highly inequitable with a significant portion o f children not derivingany benefit whatsoever as
they will never access education. Onthe other hand, the few students ina cohort (1.9 out o f 100)
that make it to higher education absorb as much as 40% o f the total amount o f resources
available to the cohort. The Gini coefficient for the distribution o fpublic education expenditures
in Burundi was found to be 0.7.          This was compared to the average Gini coefficient in
Francophone African countries o f 0.56, and inAnglophone African countries of 0.36. Thus, the
distribution o f government educational spending is much more inequitable in Burundi than the
average for Afiica.

Sector financing, costs and efficiency in resources allocation

5.          Inreal terms, the recurrent education budget dropped dramatically from 1994 to 1997,
and remained at this depressed level for several years until it began recovering as o f 2001. The
expenditure in2004 was, however, still lower than the level o f 1994 inreal terms (due mainly to
a decrease in real wages).                  In 2005, as part of its priority policy, the new government has
eliminated schools fees, which resulted in a huge increase in first grade enrollment and,
therefore, also in additional financing to address the recruitment o f new teachers, the
replacement o f the revenues from schools fees revenues and new infrastructure. In 2006 the
education budgethas significantly increased (from 4,2 o f GDP in2005 to more than 6% in2006)
financed either with government revenues (recurrent expenditures) or HIPC (investment
expenditures).          However, the absorption capacity o f investment expenditures remains weak
which has leadto low levels o f execution.

6.          Repetition contributes to the waste o f resources and increases inthe chance o f premature
dropout. As a result, more than 50% o f resources investedinprimary education are "wasted" on
students who do not complete primary." Burundi spends more than other countries on higher
education, even in 2006 reached indicative levels for primary education (50%).                                               Spending on
general secondary has remained unchanged at around 24%, while spending on technical
secondary has declined from 5.9% to 3.7%.                                In an international context, Burundi spends a
relatively high amount on higher education (23% against and average for the region o f around
20% only) and relatively less on secondary education. The unit costs per pupil or student
expressed in GDP percentage/per capita are slightly higher in Burundi than in a dozen o f SSA
countries.

Factors that influence the unit costs

7.          A large portion ofthe differential inunit costs between the different levels o f education is
due to a combination of a better pupil/teacher ratio the higher the level o f education (it is 52 in
primary, 41 in community secondary, 26 inpublic secondary, 17 intechnical secondary, and 22

                                                                       88

at the University o f Burundi) and a higher level o f teacher remuneration the higher the level o f
education.   Differences in the ratios o f pupils to non-teaching staff and in the non-salary
expenditures explain the remainder o f the difference. Public secondary, technical secondary and
higher education all employ more non-teaching staff than teaching staff. At the University o f
Burundi, if the staff o f ROU is included, there is as much as one non-teaching staff per 8.9
students.

External Efficiency

8.      Education has individual and collective effects socially and economically.          Socially,
Burundi's economy i s dominated by agriculture activities (94% o f active population) with a
weak share of activities in the modern sector - government, para-public and private (6% o f
active population). The majority o f people working in the agricultural sector are illiterate and
those working in the modern sector went through a great number o f years o f training. The
difference in unemployment rates o f those who have graduated from secondary and higher
education institutions i s significant and is a signal o f imbalance between the production o f the
education system and the employments inthe economy.

Management of the System

9.      In 2000, MINEDUC started a process of decentralization to provinces and school's
districts. However, the roles o f central and decentralized levels remains unclear, duplication o f
roles and overlapping information leads to a huge inefficiency in the allocation o f resources.
This inefficient allocation o f teachers is clear evidence o f poor teacher management practices.
The randomness inthe distribution o f staff to secondary schools is even higher than for primary
schools (68% for all staff, and 59% if only considering teaching staff).        Thus, poor teacher
management i s pervasive inbothprimary and secondary education.

10.     The planning system i s characterized by several weaknesses: (i) central planning
                                                                              the
structure lacks enough qualified personnel and logistical capacity; (ii)district and provincial
branches o f BP lack capacity for data collection and processing; (iii) overlaps inresponsibilities
among central and provincial levels exists incritical areas o f planningsuch as teacher allocation
and infrastructure; (iv) the existing sort o f School Map's tool is poorly developed and the
information i s gathered with delays; and (v) the annual education statistical report i s published
with delays and critical sector indicators are neitherpresented nor monitored.

11.     Moreover, the system shows lacks several key facilities to ensure service delivery: (i)
classrooms are uneven distributed among provinces; (ii)         textbooks are scarce and not well
distributed(on average, primary schools have only 0.3 textbooks per students andthere are large
disparities inthe distribution o f textbooks among schools); (iii) schools lack basic infrastructure:
only 40% o f schools are built from permanent materials, three quarters o f schools have latrines,
31% a borehole and only 5% have electricity; (iv) primary schools are larger and secondary
schools smaller than their theoretical optimal size; and (v) double shifting has allowed for an


                                                  89

unprecedented expansion o f primary education, but has resulted in less class contact than the
internationally recommended benchmark: 83% o f primary schools have some sort o f double
shift, affecting at least 60% o fprimary school students.

11. Governmentobjectives

12.     Improvement inaccess to and quality o f education i s the priority inthe new Government
strategy as part o f the nation's recovery strategy. In line with objectives for EFA (Burundi has
had endorsed the Dakar 2000) the new government created a team at MINEDUC to produce a
comprehensive Strategy Note. A draft o f the Strategy Note has already been produced and the
final and validated version has beenformally presented to all financial and technical partners in
October 2006. The recently completed PRSP is inline with education Strategy Note. The Bank
and the donors have significantly helped the Government inthis process. The CSR on Education
and its simulation model exercise were key instruments in setting the priorities and in framing
the strategy in a fiscally sustainable way for the medium- and long-term. The main objectives
set forth in the Strategy Note are to: a) expand access and retention at primary level to reach
universal completion by 2015 (in accordance to this EFA strategy, the first and most important
policy measure taken by the new government was the elimination o f school fees); b) improve
quality and pertinence at all levels; c) improve equity and efficiency in the allocation o f
education resources; d) improve human resources, administrative and information management;
and e) manage the transition between educationcycles to ensure a sustainable pathto 2015.

13.     The efforts in the short term will be focused on expanding and rehabilitating facilities
ensuringthe availability o f minimumsupplies, deploying teachers where there are shortages and
organizing teacher training. Inaddition, the following key actions need to be launched to reach
the objective of universal quality primary education as well as improving access and quality at
secondary and higher education:       a) improve teacher training quality; (ii)provide guides,
textbooks and learning materials to teachers and students; (iii) reinforce planning capacities and
develop a information system (including School Map); (iv) reduce repetition rates; (v) introduce
a post-primary policy on vocational training; (vi) promote private education; and (vii) improve
the relevance o fpost-primary education inline with labor market needs.

111.Long-term financial sustainabilityanalysis.Progressiontowards the proposed
scenarios

14.     The actions needed to reach the objectives described above have been grouped in a
synthetic and coherent way ina simulation model. This tool describes the physical evolution o f
the education system between 2005 and 2015 in response to the implementation of education
policy measures. The financial consequences have been determined for each o f the 9 scenarios
tested in order to reach a credible scenario in term o f quality, equity, efficiency - internal and
external - and o f the efficiency also achievable at the physical level (teachers'
traininghecruitment, for example) and the financial sustainability.

15.     Table 4 summarizes in figures form the progression followed to attain the final scenario.
Incomparison to the scenario 0 established without financial constraints, in comparison to the
scenario 1, 4 parameters o f primary education were modified. Inscenario 2, four parameters in
1'` secondary cycle in comparison to scenario 1 and so on. The financial consequences o f the
changes brought to the parameters are shown at the bottom o f each scenario (see annexed
document in files Annex 12 for further details). The main macro indicators deemed the most
relevant to qualify the scenarios are also shown below (and in more detail in the annex). The
simulations have been done from information available for the 2005-06 school year and the 2006
budgetary exercise in the context o f METF (2007-2009) which describes the mid-termtracking
to ensure moving towards the set objectives for 2015.

16.     While these scenarios are only indicative at this stage, they have the merit o f having
helpedto choose the scenario to buildthe basis o fmost sensitive policies and show the financing
gap through 2015. Main macroeconomic assumptions have been: (i)           a GDP growth o f 6%; (ii) a
20% o f fiscal pressure; (iii)15% o f domestic resources dedicated to recurrent expenditures in
education, where domestic resources includes just own fiscal revenues, excluding budget support
from donors and HIPC, both very important in Burundi. As Table 4 shows the financial gap is
considerable, ranging from 4.2% in Scenario 9 to almost 20% o f GDP in Scenario 0. However,
domestic resources do not include aid inthe way o f general budget support and HIPC resources.
Budget support represents around 30% o f total resources in the last year and HIPC has an
increasing importance since 2006, though the latter mostly for capital expenditures. Therefore,
this preliminary exercise needto be completed with a estimated projectiono fbudgetsupport and
HIPC for the coming years in order to figure out the residual gap to be financed with specific
donors support to education sector. This exercise will be done in 2007 in the context o f EFA-
FTI long-term financing framework to cover the "residual" financial aid gap. Other approaches
to estimate the recurrent financial gap i s to take into account that the education resources already
reached 6.4% o f GDP. Therefore, the additional or residual financial needs would be around
1.5% o f GDP.

17.       The scenario chosen is the results o f significant efforts under the following strong
assumptions: (i)     reaching universal primary completion rate by 2015 (MDG) i s a fixed objective;
(ii)EFA-FTI          indicative framework for sub-sector allocation (50% resources for primary
education) i s an internally efficient distribution to sustain long-term balanced growth in all sub-
sectors. Underthis basis, some key variables were adjusted to tackle the challenge associated: (i)
the level o f teachers salaries will decrease overtime interms o f the GDP per capita from 7.8 in
2006 to 7.1 in2015 in primary and from 10.1 to 7.3 in secondary (even though will increase in
real terms since the GDP growth assumption is 6% over the period). It has been assumed that
there will not be changes in the status o f teachers as civil servants; (ii)   the transition rate from
primary to lower secondary will decrease from 55% to 22% and from lower secondary
("college") to upper secondary ("lycee") from 41% to 30%. This leads to the important policy
conclusion that regulation o f student flows should be introduced; (iii)    to cope with regulating the
flow o f students to lower and upper secondary general education a sub-system o f vocational
training needs to be developed to reach around 20% o f those studentsthat will not reach general
lower and upper secondary education. However, this new expanded system will have to be
financed at low unit cost (estimated at US$1GDP per capita for primary graduates and US$ 1.5
for lower secondary graduates); (iv) repetition rates will decrease from 29% to 10% in primary
level producing a significant increase in internal efficiency and therefore a reduction in units
costs; and (v) community and private financing incentives and new mechanism will need to be
develop inspecific sub-sector such as pre-school, vocational and literacy programs.

18.      Capital Expenditures. The overwhelming bulk o f capital expenditures needs in coming
years will be on school facilities in order to reach the MDG o f universal primary completion.
This fact i s exacerbated since the school year 2005-2006 when the free school policy led to a
huge increase in enrollments in first grade. Consequently, at least 3,000 equipped new
classrooms need to be built from 2007 to 2011 based on 54 students per class and maintaining
double shift (83% o f schools and 60% o f students are in double shift system). A comparison of
unit construction costs in different donor-financed projects indicates that there is a very large
variation, as the highest unit construction cost (US $19,828/classroom unit) is 250% higher than
the lowest unit constructioncost (US$5,672/classroom unit) for classroom construction (most o f
the difference is due to the materials used or the fact that some classroom are "evolving",
therefore not complete). This large difference indicates that there i s a need for developing a set
o f common construction standards, and a ceiling for the unit construction cost, in order to
balance the conflicting objectives o f a high rate of expansion o f the number o f classrooms and
the quality o f new construction, and inorder to make school construction more cost-effective. A1
these issues are objectives of the project in the framework o f the development o f the school
construction triennial plan 2007-2009. Taking an average of US$ 16,000 the cost o f 3,000
additional classrooms (including respectively bathrooms, school director office and a small
library) will be around $48 millionor US$16millionby year, which is a reachable amount taken
into account the donors support and HIPC resources.


Economic Rationale for Project interventions


19.      Insummary, the analysis shows that the Project has a designthat is accordance with the
diagnostic o f the education system done by the CSR. On the one hand, most o f the project
funding will support basic needs to improve the capacity o f schools to educate a rapidly
increasing number o f primary-level students: school facilities, textbooks and teacher training.
These three interventions will contribute to cover part o f the financial gap in next four years


                                                 96

while contributingto increasing equity and efficiency inthe allocation of physical (classrooms,
textbooks) or humanresources (teachers). Failureto provide timely assistance to schools as the
system expands could result in the slowing or even reversal of this trend toward full primary
enrollment. On the other hand, the PDO of improving the capacity of the Government of
Burundito carry out policyanalysis, strategicplanningandprogramimplementationwill provide
crucial support to develop policies to address main policies conclusion derived from the long-
term expected scenario such as the equally well-justifiedpriority that the Government gives to
rapidly building its capacity to plan and manage the education sector, which will help the
completionof an in-depthactionplanthat will increase the likelihoodof attractingmore external
fundingfor itsprograms, includingEFA-FTI's membership.

1.       The Project's environmental screening category i s B in recognizing potential
environmental and social impacts that are likely result from planned construction and
rehabilitation o f educational facilities (Component          1 "Expanding      school facilities").
Environmental impacts such as soil erosion, soil degradation, increases in solid and liquid
wastes, and losses o f vegetation are expected to occur mainly during the settling o f these
infrastructures and establishment o f building sites as well as during the exploitation o f quarries
for building materials. As a result, safeguards OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12
Involuntary Resettlement have been triggered. The Borrower has prepared and Environmental
and Social Management Framework (ESMF) and a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF).
These frameworks have been prepared because the precise educational facilities to be build or
rehabilitated have not been identified at this time, thus making impossible to identify specific
impacts and to recommendmitigation measures.


OP 4.01 EnvironmentalAssessment

2.       Inrecognition of the potential environmental and social impacts that are likely to result
from planned construction and rehabilitation o f educational facilities, the Borrower has prepared
an ESMF and an RPF. These frameworks have been prepared because the precise educational
facilities to be build or rehabilitated have not beenidentifiedat this time, thus making impossible
to identify specific impacts and to recommend mitigation measures. Therefore, the objective o f
the ESMF is to provide an environmental and social screening process to enable the
implementation agencies, to identify, assess and mitigate the potential negative environmental
and social impacts related to Project's activities at the planning step.          The procedure o f
environmental and social review o f the ESMF will be integrated into the general procedure o f
approval and financing o f project activities.        The ESMF also outlines the institutional
arrangements for environmental and social management during the implementation o f the
program, including capacity building measures. It should be noted that a large part of the
Project's investmentsfocus on equipment andinfrastructures.

3.       The Project's potentialnegative environmental and social impacts will mostly result from
the construction and rehabilitation o f infrastructures (schools; water points, sanitation facilities)
that might lead to disruptions o f the environment, increased solid and liquid wastes generation.
Inaddition, the potentialuseofquarries for buildingmaterialsmaycausenegative environmental
impacts which will require restoration after use. Environmental impacts such as: soil erosion,
soil degradation, increase in solid and liquid wastes, loss o f vegetation are expected to occur
mainly during the settling o f these infrastructures and establishment o f building sites as well as
duringthe exploitation of quarries for buildingmaterials. To address these negative impacts, the
process o f selection proposed inthe ESMF will be carried out so that the biophysical and socio-



                                                  98

economic aspects o f the project areas are taken into account, and consequently, that mitigation
measures will be implemented. Inthis context, an Environmental and Social Management Plan
(ESMP) has been developed intending to ensure efficient environmental management o f the
Project. The ESMP will be included inthe PIM.

4.       To ensure that environmental and social aspects in Project's activities are effectively
taken into account, it was proposed to identify and train Environment Focal Points (PFE) within
DPE, BPE, ABUTIP, in environmental assessment. The main institutions with key roles and
responsibilities for environmental and social management are: (i)        for the implementation o f
environmental measures:        the implementation o f the project environmental management
measures will be carried out by engineering and design departments o f ABUTIP that will work
jointly with private contractors and Government's technical services. Under the general
responsibility o f the ABUTIP, consultants incharge o f sub-project design will be responsible for
carrying out the EIA studies and drafting the infrastructures maintenance handbooks. In this
context, the ABUTIP will ensure that all sub-projects will include the planting o f trees around
the schools and teachers' houses and that the architectural plan will include the environmental
mitigation measures based on recommendations o f the ESMF; (ii)         for civil work's control and
monitoring:     under the general supervision of the ABUTIP, the control supervision and
monitoring o f Component 1 activities during execution will be carried out by the private
contractors (Muitres de oeuvre) who will be responsible for the implementation o f the mitigation
measures as indicated in the Environmental Guidelines for Contractors, including the
rehabilitation o f quarries used as sources o f building materials, the maintenance o f the building
sites, tree planting inside schools, etc. At the local level, the PFE/CDC, the PFE/DPE, but also
the schools community (including Parents' Associations), will also take part inthe monitoring.
The school community, the PFE/CDC and the DPE (Planning and Infrastructures Services) will
be responsible for data-gathering inthe field; and (iii) supervision and monitoring: to ensure
                                                           for
the efficiency o f the recommended measures, it is important to carry out environmental
monitoring o f works. The coordination and the supervision o f the implementation o f the ESMF
measures will be ensured by the PFE/ABUTIP, in connection with the PFEBPE o f the
MINEDUC, the DGEB and the Direction o f Environment and Tourism.                     The mid-tern
environmental assessment aims to establish a complete overview o f the real impacts o f the sub-
projects, but also to assess the effectiveness o f the mitigation measures realized duringworks. At
the end o f the program, a final assessment will be carried out, to learn the principal lessons on
environmental management related to the implementationo f Project's activities.

OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement

5.       To enable project implementers to mitigate social impacts due to potential population
displacements, an RPF has been prepared by the Borrower, which outlines the principles and
procedures to be followed in such events. The construction o f new facilities or the extension o f
the existing infrastructures could involve land acquisition, using land that may already be used
for other purposes (i.e. occupation by the populations, agricultural production, pasture, etc.),
which may lead to the displacement o f populations or loss o f access to economic activities and


                                                   99

assets. On the whole, possible negative impacts during the construction phase may be due to:
poor choice o f the sites, potential conflicts on land acquisition and occupation, pollution and
harmfuleffects due to works on the surroundingpopulations and the workmen; the disturbance
o f free movement and socio-economic activities; the lack o f use o f local workmen and the
occupation o f land. During the operational phase, the expected negative effects may involve:
the degradation o f the educational environment; the precariousness o f school hygiene; poor
quality o f works carried out, and especially a lack o fmotivation among teachers.

6.      The RPF provides the main principles governing the resettlement operations in the
framework o f the PARSEB. In close collaboration with project management, communes' CDCs
will develop a PAR, if a project for the construction o f classrooms, houses, latrines and water
points requires some resettlement operations. The Project will ensure that dissemination o f
information and knowledge transfer towards the communes is undertaken.               The PAR is
implemented at the same time as the other studies (civil engineering, socio-economic and
environmental studies, etc.) inorder to mainstream social aspects. Ifthe PAR conducts technical
studies, the commune should present a social road map with a series o f proposals. Once the
proposed sub-project by the commune i s approved in the portfolio o f funding programmes, the
authorities will go to the contracting stage o f the technical studies (through ABUTIP). Inorder to
address these eventual population displacements, component 1 o f the Project includes financial
support as a prevision (1.5 % o f the component amount, US$0.15 million) to compensate the
