I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.    Country context. At the time of project appraisal, Burundi was emerging from a
decade-long civil conflict that had exacted a heavy toll in terms of human lives and socio-
economic structures. Nevertheless, in a short period of time the country had made
significant progress toward social and political reconciliation. A series of peace and
cease-fire agreements had led to the adoption of a post-conflict constitution, culminating
in the election of a new government in August 2005, and security was gradually restored
throughout most of the country. Yet despite such progress the social situation remained
dire: social services delivery was weak, and social capital had been severely degraded. In
terms of national economy, growth had resumed in 2001, and accelerated from 2004
onward following the implementation of a solid economic program supported by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.

2.    Sector context. Given Burundi’s tenuous security situation, the new government
deemed education as essential to fostering sustainable peace. By scaling up education at
all levels, it was reasoned the social exclusion that had beset the country since
independence could be mitigated. By 2003/2004 the primary school gross enrollment rate
(GER) had significantly surpassed the pre-crisis level of 80 percent, and in 2005/2006
increased to nearly 100 percent (due in large measure to the abolition of school fees in
September 2005). However, the completion rate was alarmingly low: only 34 percent of
children that started first grade finished the primary cycle in 2005. At the secondary level,
the GER of 13 percent was below the Sub-Saharan African average (25 percent). In
addition, the disparity in education outcomes in terms of gender and region was
enormous: a) females comprised 45 percent of students at the primary level, 41 percent at
the secondary level, and 25 percent at the university level; and b) GER varied from 130
percent in metropolitan Bujumbura to 50 percent in the provinces of Ngozi and Muyinga.
Likewise the quality of education had deteriorated severely as a result of the civil conflict
and episodes of insecurity. To accommodate more students, a double-shift system was
instituted (60 percent of children participated), but that reduced teaching time per pupil
by 20 percent. Repetition rates were even more alarming: 28 percent for primary grades
1-4, 37 percent grade 5, and 44 percent for grade 6. Furthermore, teacher allocation was
extremely inefficient and in some regions there was a severe shortage of trained teachers.

3.    Public spending on education increased from an average of 3.3 percent of GDP in
the immediate post-crisis period to more than 6 percent in 2006. This is compared to an
SSA average of 3.9 percent. This was due to the availability of additional resources, most
importantly Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative funds. Within this context
the distribution among levels also improved, with primary education receiving
approximately 50 percent of the total education sector budget: in line with the Education
for All - Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) minimum level and the regional average.

4.     Burundi abolished primary school fees in September 2005, resulting in a significant
increase in first year enrollment. Government data in November 2006 indicated growth of
first grade enrollment from 261,000 pupils in school year 2004/05 to 459,457 in 2005/06:
an increase of 76 percent. Similarly, total primary enrollment in the same period rose to
1,309,369 pupils (an increase of 27 percent over 2004/2005). Thus, although this was a
positive first step towards universal access, it threatened to overwhelm the country’s
limited school infrastructure with overcrowded classrooms, double-shift sessions, poorly
trained teachers, and inferior quantities and quality of learning materials.

5.    The “free school? policy impacted the education sector budget in three ways: a)
expenditures previously financed by the school fee revenues (formerly not included in the
budget) went primarily to finance administration of the Ministry of Basic and Secondary
Education, Technical Education, Vocational Training and Literacy (MINEDUC); b)
6,500 additional teachers were recruited in 2005/2006 (an increase of 37 percent); and c)
other expenditures (transfers to schools, university, etc). These recurrent costs were
absorbed into the 2006 budget, and represented an increase of more than 65 percent with
respect to the 2004 budget. In terms of capital expenditures, the increase in primary
school enrollments necessitated the construction and outfitting of approximately 3,400
new classrooms over the following four years. While capital expenditures did increase,
due to the availability of HIPC and other external funds, the country’s absorptive capacity
remained weak.

6.    Project Context. Burundi’s 2005 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) set out a road map
for Bank support to the country for the period FY06-FY07. It was prepared through an
extensive consultation process with a broad array of stakeholders (i.e., government,
private sector, civil society members, and donors), and was fully aligned with the
priorities set forth in Burundi’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). For its part the
PRSP was launched by the government in May 2004, with support from the Bank and
other donors, and was completed in August 2006. In particular, the education chapter of
the PRSP was fully in line with the Interim Strategy Note.

7.    During project preparation Burundi’s development partners affirmed their
commitment to a coordinated intervention in the education sector (Coopération
Technique Belge [CTB]), Department for International Development [DfID], Agence
Française de Développement [AFD], United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF], and
United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization [UNESCO]). This
resulted in a significant number of joint missions, which included policy discussions
carried out in the framework of project preparation, presentation of the CSR, long-term
financing debates, discussion of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF),
development of the Strategy Note, and a preliminary action plan. Such coordination was
planned to continue throughout the project implementation period, and include the
preparation of other donors’ contributions, thus addressing the government’s strategy for
the education sector as a whole, including primary education and other education sub-
sectors (secondary, technical-vocational, and higher education). Within this framework
donors also agreed to support Burundi’s efforts to seek EFA-FTI endorsement, under
which harmonized assistance was to be put in place.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.    The development objectives of the Burundi Education Sector Reconstruction
Project (PARSEB), as stated in the Grant Financing Agreement, were: to improve the
capacity of schools to educate a rapidly increasing number of primary-level students, and
of the government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program
implementation.

9.   Evidence of progress towards achieving the project development objectives was to
be measured as follows:

Table 1: Original Project Development Indicators
Project Indicators                                             Baseline              Target
                                                                (2007)               (2011)
1.   Primary education completion rate has increased          38 percent           65 percent
2.   Baseline figures established for sample-based rapid     Not applicable   Baseline results in
     reading competency tests (SBRCT) by end of first year                    Year 4 equal or
     of project implementation, with results maintained or                    exceed those of
     improved in each subsequent year                                         Year 3
3.   Acceptance of Burundi into EFA-FTI, including           Not applicable   Burundi FTI
     endorsed education sector plan                                           program is in place

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10. The PDO was not revised during the life of the project. However, in June 2011,
select PDO level indicators were realigned to better capture the project’s development
objectives as a part of the level two restructuring.

11. At the time of project preparation, the primary education GER was determined to be
an intermediate outcome indicator. However, during restructuring it was deemed to be a
key measure of the capacity of the system to improve access to education, and therefore
was elevated to a PDO level indicator. Conversely, rapid reading competency, which
originally had been a PDO level indicator, was reassigned as an intermediate outcome
level indicator. This was the result of delays experienced in establishing the baseline
assessment figures. In addition, due to the introduction of the Bank’s direct project
beneficiaries requirement in July 2009, the indicator was added to the results framework.
The revised indicators are reflected in Table 2.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12. The main beneficiaries as identified at project appraisal included: a) primary
school-aged children, particularly females and those in disadvantaged regions, who
otherwise would not have access to education 1 ; b) secondary school-aged children
without sufficient quantities and quality of learning materials; c) unqualified teachers; d)
school directors; e) school inspectors; f) staff of the Executive Operational Secretariat
(SEO); and g) functionaries of MINEDUC.

1.5 Original Components

13. The project as approved consisted of three principal components: 1) Expansion of
School Facilities; 2) Support for Teaching and Learning; and 3) Building
Capacity in MINEDUC. Of these, Components 2 and 3 were further divided into three
and two sub-components, respectively.

14. Component 1 Expansion of School Facilities (US$8.15 million). This component
aimed to contribute to the expansion of primary enrollment on an equitable basis, in order
to reach universal completion by 2015. It sought to respond to the significant increase in
the enrollment rate by supporting MINEDUC’s 2007-2009 school infrastructure triennial
plan. The component focused on the nine most disadvantaged provinces 2 in terms of
enrollment rates and facilities, seeking to construct 220 new classrooms, rehabilitate 200
classrooms, build 60 teacher housing units, construct 40 wells and 280 latrines, and
supply school furniture and relevant instructional equipment.


11
   Though some 300,000 primary school-aged children were anticipated to benefit directly from the project
(i.e., due to increased access to school facilities), it is reasonable to conclude that all 1,900,000 children in
this age group benefited from rehabilitated or newly constructed classrooms, decreased class size, expanded
access to textbooks, and better qualified instructors.

                                                       4
15. Component 2 Support for Teaching and Learning (US$6.6 million). This
component sought to contribute to maintaining or improving student learning through
supporting: i) the introduction of new in-service programs and devices to train teachers,
schools directors and inspectors; ii) the provision of textbooks and learning materials for
all students at the primary level, three subject textbooks for lower secondary students,
and the introduction of a textbook management system; and iii) the measurement of
learning outcomes by undertaking a rapid assessment of reading competency in a sample
of primary schools throughout Burundi for each year of the project.

16. Component 3 Building Capacity in MINEDUC (US$4.25 million). This
component aimed to improve the capacity of the Government of Burundi to carry out
policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation. Building the Ministry’s
capacity to plan and manage the education sector, was to have increased the likelihood of
attracting more external funding for its programs, including membership in the Education
for All - Fast Track Initiative.

1.6 Revised Components

17.   The components were not revised during the life of the project.

1.7 Other significant changes

18. The grant Financing Agreement was amended three times over the life of the
project.

19. The first amendment of November 2, 2009 reallocated SDR 478,731 of the grant’s
proceeds. An assessment of the planned activities and their corresponding allocations
indicated that the project would exceed the amounts budgeted for goods and consultant
services under Part 1 (Expansion of School Infrastructure). Accordingly, SDR 250,776
was reallocated for goods, and SDR 227,995 was reallocated for consultant services by
drawing these sums from the “unallocated?, “works?, and “Population Resettlement Fund?
categories.

20. The second amendment of June 30, 2011 extended the project closing date by one
year to June 30, 2012, and realigned the project indicators to better measure achievement
of the PDO. The closing date extension was necessary to conclude on-going procurement
actions and key activities under Components 2 and 3 of the project. Specifically, these
included the sample-based rapid reading competency tests, re-printing of third year
primary French textbooks, and securing EFA-FTI endorsement of the Education Sector
Plan. The realignment of the results framework reflected the need to swap two indicators
between the PDO and intermediate levels, and recalibrate select targets to adjust to the
extended time period and more accurately track project progress. In addition, it permitted
the introduction of Direct Project Beneficiaries as a core PDO level indicator, in
accordance with OPCS policy introduced in July 2009.




                                            5
21. The third and final amendment of September 29, 2011 served to reallocate a total of
SDR 314,808 of the grant’s proceeds. This realignment reflected both historic
disbursements vis-à-vis the expenditure categories, as previously amended and
anticipated expenditures for the remainder of the project’s implementation.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

22. Project Preparation. Burundi’s education sector needs in the post-conflict
environment were urgent and growing. In response, several donors mobilized to address a
variety of demands, though often in an uncoordinated manner. It was in this setting that
the Bank became formally engaged in the PARSEB program, conducting a joint
identification mission with key donor partners in October 2005 (i.e., DFID, CTB, AFD,
UNESCO, UNICEF, HCR, WFP, and EU). This effort was followed by three further joint
missions during project preparation and a series of joint missions thereafter. The
overarching goal of the missions was to identify the objectives and potential components
of a program of support to Burundi, based upon the principles outlined in the
government’s strategic policy plan, Options et Priorités en Matière d’Éducation et
Formation, and ultimately to apportion the program’s constituent elements among the
development partners.

23. In tandem with the joint missions, the Bank was directly engaged with the
government in project preparation activities financed under the Norwegian Education
Trust Fund 3 and Education Program Development Fund 4 . This support included
providing assistance for the preparation of Burundi’s Country Status Report, fostering
coordination between the government and key stakeholders, providing training to
MINEDUC’s management staff, and developing a Triennial Plan for school construction
and allocation (2007-2009). These preparatory activities informed the design of the
project, and laid the groundwork for a targeted, coordinated, situation-appropriate
operation.

24. Project Design. A sector-wide approach (SWAP) originally was proposed for the
operation, though it was rejected in favor of a standard Specific Investment Loan (SIL)
due to: (i) poor donor harmonization; (ii) lack of project management experience within
MINEDUC; and (iii) the absence of an education sector plan. The project itself was
designed in conformity with key conclusions of the recently completed CSR (2006),
policy debates and government strategy, the experience of other Sub-Saharan African and
post-conflict countries, and lessons drawn from internationally known best practice. In



3
  Norwegian Education Trust Fund (NETF): Its primary objective was to support countries preparing
education sector plans for Education for All Fast Track Initiative financing. Specifically, the NETF sought
to address capacity and analytical gaps in the beneficiary countries.
4
  Education Program Development Fund (EPDF): The fund sought to enable low-income countries to
access Catalytic Fund resources, and accelerate progress towards universal primary education. It provided
technical support and built capacity to prepare sound education plans in countries with weak capacity.


                                                    6
substance PARSEB was designed specifically to address the government’s education
sector priorities, namely: i) expand access and equity; ii) improve the quality of teaching
and learning; and iii) support institutional capacity for planning, management, and
evaluation.

25. The project PDO was applicable, well defined, and was supported by appropriate
development indicators; the grant amount was sufficient; and the timeframe as planned
was realistic (though ultimately subject to unanticipated delays). The majority of project
funding was directed to the emergency situation which were reflected in Components 1
and 2, which was appropriate given Burundi’s post-conflict environment. The secondary
objective addressed the government’s priority of rapidly building its capacity to plan and
manage the education sector, and ultimately increasing its likelihood of securing EFA-
FTI financing, as reflected in Component 3. While the overall project design was
appropriate, in retrospect there were some design weaknesses. These were: (i) a complex
institutional management structure (see Graphic 1) that created some implementation
bottlenecks; (ii) two intermediate level indicators that did not define baseline values or
fixed targets; and (iii) a front-loaded procurement schedule with limited capacity for
implementation.

Graphic 1: Institutional and Organizational Chart




26. Quality at Entry. A Quality Enhancement Review (QER) of PARSEB was
conducted in September 2006. Overall the panel members responded favorably to the
project’s concept and objectives. However, they were unanimous in their view that it was
too ambitious in scope—in particular given that key policy decisions had yet to be taken
in critical areas of intervention—and strongly recommended that the breadth of the


                                            7
objectives and number of activities be reduced. To this end the panel made specific
recommendations as to which activities should be scaled back or dropped from the
project entirely (i.e., improving school health, supporting the creation of School
Management Committees, developing post-primary formal and non-formal education). In
addition, the QER panel offered the team detailed proposals on how to strengthen the
project’s activities, focus the indicators, and organize the procurement. With minor
exceptions, these recommendations were incorporated into the final design of the project.

2.2 Implementation

27. Implementation progress was not uniform in execution. This was mainly due to factors
that were exogenous to the project. During the project implementation period there were
three Bank task team leaders and the education ministries underwent a series of structural
changes. These ministerial changes had a direct impact on the project’s institutional and
organizational structure, which slowed project procurement and disbursements. Although
there were three Bank task team leaders and structural changes within the ministries, the
unit responsible for daily implementation, the Executive Operations Secretariat (SEO),
experienced only minor staff changes over the five-years, which provided a level of
continuity for project implementation.

28. Project implementation began with the: (i) conditions of effectiveness being fully
met (i.e., adoption of the Project Implementation Manual, and staffing of the Executive
Operations Secretariat (SEO)), (ii) planning, execution and M&E instruments in place,
and (iii) MINEDUC exhibiting strong leadership and ownership. A project launch
mission was held in July 2007 that included a three-day workshop attended by all of the
key stakeholders: i.e., MINEDUC officials, governors, communal authorities,
stakeholders and donors. After the launch workshop, the project began to make notable
progress with respect to the procurement of primary level textbooks (4th, 5th, 6th grade
French and 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th grade Kirundi) and the pre-investment feasibility studies and
construction contracts for Phase I of the school infrastructure component. Although
progress was being made, MINEDUC began to exhibit weaker than expected capacity to
coordinate activities, develop training programs and identify the final sites for school
construction. Moreover, implementation of the twinning arrangement, which was to
provide needed capacity building TA for MINEDUC was delayed, as well as the rapid
reading assessment that was to establish a baseline for early grade reading. Both were
important activities imbedded in Components 2 and 3 that did not meet the agreed targets
in the 2007 action plan. This led to a downgrade in the IP rating from S to MS. A further
hindrance was the lengthy gap between project launch and the first supervision mission
(February 2008), which eased the drive to advance. Despite these early implementation
challenges, the DO rating throughout this period remained Satisfactory. This was due to
the fact that MINEDUC was making progress toward achievement of the development
objectives and disbursements were on schedule.

29. In 2009, there was a political restructuring of the Ministry of Education, as well as a
change in Bank task team leadership. These two changes contributed to a loss of
momentum in project implementation. On the government side they split ministerial



                                            8
oversight of the project into three (i.e., Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific
Research, Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, and Ministry of Trade
Education, Vocational Training and Literacy). This complicated the organizational
structure and function of the project 5, as the role intended to be played by one ministry
was now carried out by three. Confusion over roles and responsibilities resulted, and
delays in procurement ensued. The SEO implementation responsibilities remained the
same thereby providing some continuity for project implementation. However, the SEO
had to replace the financial management (FM) specialist during this period because the
FM specialist left the project for another assignment. The replacement took time which
led to some delay in disbursements.

30. The Bank conducted supervision missions in February and June 2009. The February
and June aides-mémoire noted that three key elements had to be realized by year’s end to
ensure project success: (i) administration of the rapid reading assessment; (ii) launch of
the twinning arrangement; and (iii) endorsement of the Education Sector Plan. None of
these was accomplished in the set timeframe. In addition, the mid-term review that had
been planned for June 2009 was postponed to October, and ultimately not completed until
spring 2010. In October 2009, the Bank team’s architect also carried out a review of the
new classrooms construction under Phases I and II of the project. The review found that
construction was well advanced, with 74 percent of new schools completed and occupied.
The review further noted that the reconstruction of classrooms initially planned under
Phase III was more extensive than anticipated, and therefore was cost-prohibitive. Thus
the decision was taken to reduce the scope of work to “light? reconstruction, and leave
the heavier work to be financed under the Common Fund for Education (FCE) 6. This
change necessitated a recalibration of the planned works, including revised specifications
and some new site selections, which further delayed progress. Finally, the review noted
MINEDUC’s disappointment in the quality of school furniture initially procured: a
deficiency that was addressed by an upgrade in technical specifications and tightening of
production oversight.

31. Although the Bank conducted two supervision missions, the SEO and government
viewed the 2009 changes in leadership as a period of disengagement by the Bank. This
had an adverse effect on advancement toward EFA-FTI endorsement—a key PDO level
indicator—as the leadership vacuum coincided with deliberations over Burundi’s
Education Sector Plan. The perception arose as well among the donor partners that the
Bank’s absence indicated a loss of interest in the greater PARSEB program.

 The Common Fund for Education (FCE) was established in 2008 by AFD, DFID, Belgian Technical
Cooperation, and Luxembourg. Its objective was to provide financial support for the implementation of
Burundi’s Education Sector Plan.



                                                    9
32. Throughout this period the DO rating remained S and the IP rating MS, despite
setbacks in procurement and loss of traction in attaining development objectives.
Subsequent status reports reflect a more accurate state of the project’s progress.

33. The last two years of implementation marked: (i) a return to Bank engagement; (ii)
a restructuring; (iii) increased disbursements; and (iv) progress towards fulfillment of the
PDO. At the beginning of 2010, the third Bank task team leader assumed management of
the project, and the government underwent another restructuring of ministries, which
reduced the three education ministries to two ministries. The ministerial changes
necessitated another reordering of the project’s organizational structure, which led to an
associated period of adjustments in the project implementation structure. When the new
task team leader took over responsibility for the project, a full supervision mission had
not been conducted since June 2009 and the mid-term review was overdue. Thus a period
of reengagement with the government, SEO and donor partners began that featured an
accelerated frequency of supervision missions and renewed focus on results, which would
remain until the project’s completion.

34. The first task was to take stock of the project’s state of development, and prepare
for the mid-term review. The assessment revealed that Phase III classroom rehabilitation
still had not begun (the new list of sites remained pending), the launch of the distance
learning program (Radio Scolaire) was overdue, and a copyright issue with a publisher
was holding up delivery of the 3rd year primary school textbooks. Furthermore, three of
the elements key to achieving the PDO remained outstanding: (i) administration of the
rapid reading assessment; (ii) launch of the twinning arrangement; and (iii) endorsement
of the Education Sector Plan. Weaknesses in procurement and M&E also were identified,
resulting in their rating being reduced from S to MS. Thus the Bank team set about
working with the government and SEO to address these issues with specific proposals for
remedial action.

35. The mid-term review conducted in April 2010 found that progress had been made in
several areas such as access and equity (school construction/rehabilitation), education
quality (teacher training, textbook provision), gross enrollment and primary completion.
However, the government needed more time to complete the education sector strategy
and have it endorsed by the donors for submission to the GPE. Therefore, the government
requested a six-month extension of the project closing date which was subsequently
increased to 12 months based on the Bank’s recommendation. Along with the one-year
extension, the level two restructuring of June 2011 realigned the grant proceeds to reflect
actual needs, reduced the primary completion rate target from 65 percent to 55 percent,
and swapped the rapid reading assessment and GER indicators between the PDO and
intermediate outcome levels.

36. The final 18 months of implementation witnessed the removal of bottlenecks that
had delayed procurement and hampered disbursements from the project’s inception. The
result was progress on a variety of fronts, namely:




                                            10
   a) school construction/rehabilitation was completed, exceeding the numerical targets,
      thereby increasing access to education for boys and girls;
   b) face-to-face training of teachers, school directors and inspectors concluded and
      distance learning (via Radio Scolaire) commenced;
   c) textbooks for 3rd year primary French and several disciplines in lower secondary
      education were purchased and distributed via a Rapid Response Initiative;
   d) the twinning arrangement was signed, management training was provided to
      MINEDUC, education sector studies were conducted, and an information
      management system was put in place; and
   e) an agreement was reached between the government and donor partners on the
      Education Sector Plan, and the application for endorsement was submitted to the
      GPE .

37. It should be noted that during this period the DO rating was downgraded to MU in
February 2012, because PDO level data was not available to measure the number of
project beneficiaries, improved institutional capacity within MINEDUC, and increases in
the primary completion rate. However, at the time of the final supervision mission the
data was provided and it was apparent that the majority of the PDO level indicators were
going to be achieved. Thus the DO rating was revised to moderately satisfactory. In total
US$19.83 million was disbursed or 98 percent of the total grant.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

38. Design. The project’s PDO and intermediate outcome level indicators were agreed
upon following extensive discussion between the Bank, MINEDUC and donor partners.
The baseline and target values were the product of extensive analytical work conducted
under the CSR and long-term financing plan (2006-2015), and were designed to be
consistent with the follow-on GPE operation. There were two intermediate indicators
where baselines were not established during project appraisal nor during the
implementation. These were: (i) ratio of teaching to non-teaching staff and (ii) the
equitable distribution of teachers among schools. These indicators were intended to
provide evidence of MINEDUC’s improved capacity to undertake policy analysis and
strategic planning, and monitor the achievement of objectives. Although the baselines
were not established the ICR team’s analysis showed substantial progress in achieving
these goals over the life of the project. Overall, the ICR team judges the original M&E
design to have been largely appropriate to measure progress toward achievement of the
PDO indicators. Moreover, the team judges that the adjustments made during the final
restructuring to have been appropriate for measuring the final project impact and
achievement of the PDO.

39. Implementation and Utilization. The SEO was responsible for monitoring and
evaluation of the project, under the overall direction of the Coordinating Committee
(CCSPS). The M&E specialist within the SEO collaborated closely with the BPE
(principal data source and evaluation body), as well as other technical departments of
MINEDUC and ABUTIP. During implementation the Bank team registered a good
degree of satisfaction with respect to the SEO’s performance. Quarterly and biannual



                                           11
reports were delivered on time, and when difficulties were encountered, the SEO took
action independently to resolve them. Nevertheless, the Bank team expressed concern
over the quality and reliability of the data used to support activity planning and to track
project performance (e.g., education sector statistics), in particular as this had an adverse
effect on progress of PDO level activities. As mentioned previously, there was also the
issue of deficiencies in M&E within the SEO, which resulted in its downgrade to MS
status at the time of the mid-term review. This was not the result of one particular set of
circumstances, but rather was a reflection of repeated delays in procurement and uneven
data supporting M&E, and was intended to spur the SEO to step up its efforts.

40. One of the principal sources of project data was MINEDUC’s education
management information system (EMIS). Each November the Ministry sends
questionnaires to schools, once the relevant data has stabilized (i.e., number of students
enrolled, number of teachers, etc). Thus in principal at the beginning of the fiscal year the
system has useful and reliable data for the current school year. However, as the project
aides-mémoire attest, this data was not made available in a timely manner, and its
reliability often was uneven.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

41. Safeguards. The project was classified Category B due to the construction and
rehabilitation activities planned under Component 1. As such, safeguards policies OP
4.01 Environmental Assessment and OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement were triggered.
Given that the precise locations of the schools to be built and rehabilitated were not
known at the time of project appraisal, an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) and Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) were prepared by the
Borrower. Both the ESMF and RPF were disclosed in Burundi and the Bank’s InfoShop
in November 2006. Provisions also were made for the development of a Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP)—to be coordinated with affected communities—in the event project
activities required resettlement of populations. In fact the Population Resettlement Fund
was not employed, nor were there any safeguards issues reported during the life of the
project.

42. Fiduciary Compliance. At the time of appraisal the overall fiduciary risk was
deemed to be high, due to weaknesses in procurement and financial management. To
mitigate these risks, corrective actions were agreed upon and taken, including the hiring
of a fiduciary specialist within the SEO. Throughout the period of implementation the
Bank team expressed satisfaction with the financial management system in place within
the SEO, and as early as 2009 the fiduciary risk was being referred to as modest. Where
deficiencies in fiduciary compliance were found they were communicated to the SEO and
revisited during the following supervision mission. The aides-mémoire consistently
report on-time delivery of the quarterly interim unaudited financial reports (IFR), all of
which are available in the Bank’s document records system. A 15-day extension was
granted for the final IFR (April 1-June 30, 2012), which was received on schedule on
August 31, 2012. Copies of annual audits for each of the years of project implementation
are on file. Only in one instance did the Bank team express dissatisfaction with the



                                             12
quality of the annual audit produced (fiscal year 2009), and the auditor was not retained
for the following year. Over the course of the project Financial Management was rated
Satisfactory. With respect to procurement, the delays in carrying out key actions already
have been documented, and are presented in further detail in Annex 2. Nevertheless, the
aides-mémoire record the Bank team’s satisfaction with the SEO’s handling of
procurement throughout the project. In fact, only four minor instances of ineligible
expenditures were recorded, which represented a statistically insignificant amount of
overall disbursements (0.4 percent). The rating was downgraded from S to MS as part of
the mid-term review (due to repeated slippages of select procurement actions), but
remedies were put into place and the rating was reinstated by the next supervision
mission. Thus overall Procurement was judged to be Satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

43. The Bank and Government of Burundi recently concluded a new Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was approved by the Board on October 23, 2012. Any
new Bank-supported operations therefore will be based on the new CAS. Furthermore,
Burundi’s Education Sector Plan was endorsed by the Board of Directors of the Global
Partnership for Education (GPE) in August 2012. This was a considerable project
achievement as well as an achievement for the government. The endorsement of the
Education Sector Plan led the November 20, 2012 announcement of a GPE-supported
investment program in the amount of US$52.9 million. This GPE activity is expected to
support: (i) classroom construction, (ii) policies to reduce grade repetition, and (iii) a
program both to reduce double-shift schooling and improve its management. The Belgian
Technical Cooperation (CTB) will be the supervising entity of the GPE grant.

44. It is expected that the new GPE operation will sustain the gains of the project and
the PARSEB related to access and equity. Since the new GPE has not been fully
developed it is difficult to know if the project achievements within Component 2 and 3
will be sustained. However, the Bank and other donors will be involved in the
development of the new GPE project, and will work with the CTB to promote quality
activities within that operation.

3.0 Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45. Objectives. The project’s development objectives, which were drawn from
Burundi’s 2005 ISN and 2006 PRSP, continue to be relevant to the country’s needs as
evidenced by the current Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper II (2012-2015), the FY13-
FY16 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and the newly endorsed Education Sector Plan
(PSDEF). Burundi’s PRSP II seeks to build on the progress achieved under the first
PRSP with respect to macroeconomic stability and access to basic social services, by
placing emphasis on growth and job creation. Accordingly, one of the four pillars of the
strategy is to improve access and quality in basic social services. Specifically, the PRSP
II aims to: a) reduce grade repetition; b) increase effective hours of instruction; c) revise



                                             13
school programs and curricula; and d) improve the monitoring and management of basic
education. Thus each of these objectives correlates well to the project. A new FY13-
FY16 CAS for Burundi was approved by the Board on October 23, 2012. It is closely
aligned with the PRSP II and the government’s stated development priorities (Burundi
Vision 2025), in particular with respect to inclusive growth, poverty reduction and social
stability. To that end it too reflects the objectives of the current project. Finally, the
newly-endorsed Education Sector Plan will build and expand on the achievements of
PARSEB, most notably under the GPE-financed grant approved on November 20, 2012
(US$52.9 million).

46. Relevance of Design. The relevance of the original project design is judged to be
substantial. This is primarily due to the fact that the project was directly linked to the
goals articulated in the PARSEB and majority of the project funds were directed to the
emergency situation caused by a decade of civil war. As indicated earlier, the government
organizational/implementation structure was complex and the initial procurement plan
was ambitious for a low-capacity environment, but these issues ultimately were overcome
during project implementation. These achievements are particularly impressive when
viewed in light of Burundi’s post-conflict environment. The relevance of the design after
project restructuring is also judged to be substantial. This is due to the fact that the
original PDO, project indicators and project activities remained relevant throughout
implementation. The restructuring only sought to ensure project success by extending the
implementation period and making minor adjustments to the results framework.

47. Implementation. The relevance of the project’s implementation prior to
restructuring is judged to be substantial. Within this phase progress towards achievement
of the PDO was uneven, with the initial period of activity movement followed by a
slowdown, and ultimately renewed traction. The final 18 months of project
implementation witnessed a continued drive toward attainment of the PDO, which
ultimately was successful. Thus the post-restructuring period of implementation is
deemed as well to be substantial. In sum the project was able to achieve a considerable
portion of the expected outputs by: a) constructing 231 new classrooms and
rehabilitating 200 existing classrooms (including latrines, wells, and teacher housing
units); b) providing face-to-face training to over 4,600 school directors, inspectors and
unqualified teachers; c) purchasing and distributing over 2,180,000 primary textbooks
and 718,000 lower-secondary textbooks; d) procuring and distributing 3,300 radio units
and establishing distance learning programs broadcast via Radio Scolaire; e) conducting
rapid reading assessment tests of 2nd grade students; f) establishing a twinning
arrangement to strengthen MINEDUC’s ability to monitor and manage the education
sector; and g) securing GPE endorsement of the country’s Education Sector Plan. (See
Annex 2 for more details.)

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

48. The project PDO was to improve the capacity of schools to educate a rapidly
increasing number of primary-level students, and of the government of Burundi to carry
out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation. The project was



                                           14
designed with three PDO level indicators. Data for these three indicators was being
collected and reported on and was judged to be making moderately satisfactory progress
toward achievement of the PDO. At the time of the 2011 restructuring, the PDO and
intermediate level indicators were adjusted as stated above. This section evaluates the
outcomes against the results framework that was adjusted during the 2011 restructuring.

49. Improved capacity of schools to educate a rapidly increasing number of primary-
level students, prior to restructuring, was to be measured through improved completion
rates. During the 2011 project restructuring the intermediate indicator of gross enrollment
rates (GER) was elevated to the PDO level and the target for completion rate was
adjusted from 65 percent to 55 percent, which was more realistic given the post-conflict
challenges faced by the local education administrators to deliver education services, and
the various ministry reorganizations. Based on these adjustments, the targets for the two
PDO indicators: completion rates and GER were met or exceeded. The completion rate
increased from 38 percent in 2007 to 56 percent in 2012 (47 percent improvement)
thereby exceeding the revised target of 55 percent. Graphic 2 shows the steady increase
in completion rates over the life of the project. Gross enrollments rates also have shown
considerable improvement during the project period indicating that children and young
people are entering or re-entering the system, which would be expected in a post-conflict
environment. At the time the project closed, the GER was 137.7 percent in the nine
disadvantaged regions and 138 percent nationally thereby surpassing the project target of
100 percent. Graphic 3 shows the positive trends in GER over the last 12 years in
Burundi.

50. The intermediate indicators that were used to measure the capacity of schools to
educate a rapidly increasing number of students were:

     (i)     improved ratio of primary school age population per class between the
             province with the highest and the lowest population from an average of 127
             to 40. By the end of the project the ministry had been able to reduce the
             number to 43, just missing the target of 40. Although the target was missed,
             the reduction in students per classroom was substantial during the life of the
             project;
     (ii)    improved ratio of girls to boys from a baseline of 91 percent to 95 percent at
             project completion. The ratio of girls to boys by project closing was 100
             percent, thereby exceeding the target;
     (iii)   lower student-teacher ratios in the nine disadvantaged provinces targeted by
             the project from 57:1 in 2007 to 50:1 by project closing. By the end of the
             project the student-teacher ratio in the nine provinces was 52:1, just missing
             the target. As previously noted the government hired 6,500 new teachers to
             address the rapid expansion of primary enrollments, but had not expanded
             school facilities. To this end, the project was instrumental in providing 231
             newly constructed classrooms, which surpassed the target of 220, and 200
             rehabilitated classrooms, which met the target, thereby fostering the
             reassignment of students from overcrowded schools to newly constructed
             and rehabilitated classrooms. This process remains ongoing.



                                            15
        (iv)   distribution of 1.6 million French and Kirundi textbooks to primary school
               students. The project exceeded the target by distributing 2,182,410 million.
               The distribution of these textbooks was to increase the number of textbooks
               per primary school student from 0.3 in 2007 to 1 in 2012. The project
               surpassed the target for French to 1.04 and Kirundi to 1.05 in 2012. In
               addition, the project was to distribute 940,000 biology, mathematics, French,
               Kirundi and history books to lower secondary school, but was only able to
               distribute 717,900; and
        (v)    provision of in-service training for a target of 2,950 teachers. The project
               trained 2,343 unqualified teachers in the system, which missed the target.
               However, in 2008 the government banned the recruitment of unqualified
               teachers so there were fewer overall unqualified teachers for the project to
               train.

51. Improved capacity of the government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis,
strategic planning and program implementation was to be measured at the PDO level by
the acceptance of Burundi into the EFA-FTI, which required the development of an FTI
endorsement strategy. To achieve this PDO the government of Burundi needed to
develop an Education Sector Plan (PSDEF) that was approved by both the government
and development partners, and endorsed by the GPE Board. As soon as the GPE
endorsement was secured, the government could apply for a program development grant
to finance elements of the PSDEF. Therefore, GPE Board endorsement of Burundi’s
Education Sector Plan was considered to be key evidence of enhanced capacity within
MINEDUC. This indicator was achieved. The government and development partners
approved the PSDEF on July 31, 2012, and it was endorsed by the GPE Board on August
7, 2012. Subsequently, on November 20, 2012 the GPE Board approved a development
grant to Burundi in the amount of US$52.9 million.

52. The intermediate indicators used to measure the capacity of the government of
Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation
were:

      (i)      reduction of the ratio of non-teaching to teaching staff. The base ratio was
               4:1 in 2007 (26.5 percent), and although a target was not set during the
               project, this ratio improved to 10:1 by 2012 due to increased teacher hires
               and a halt to the hires of new administrative staff; and
      (ii)     improvement in the equitable distribution of the teaching force between
               schools. Though a target was not set for this indicator, the government
               launched a policy in 2010 to equitably distribute teachers throughout the
               country. As of July 2012 3,024 of the 4,240 teachers identified had been
               redeployed (71 percent).

53. Direct Project Beneficiaries. Though it was not a factor at the time of appraisal,
the introduction of Direct Project Beneficiaries in July 2009 required that it be
incorporated as a core indicator during restructuring. Given the project’s focus on
expanding access, equity and quality of primary education, it was reasoned that all
students at this level benefited from increased numbers of classrooms, greater access to
textbooks, better trained teachers, and reduced teacher-pupil ratios. The same held true
for lower-secondary students with respect to greater access to textbooks. Thus baseline
values were established using historical enrollment rates for primary and lower-secondary
students, and targets set based upon projected growth. The respective figures are shown
below.

Table 3: Direct Project Beneficiaries - Indicators
 Project Indicators                       Baseline                Target
                                          (2007)                  (2012)

                                                 17
54. As Graphics 4 (a) and (b) illustrate, the targets for both total numbers of students at
the primary and lower-secondary level, and the proportion of these who are female were
met or exceeded: i.e., total primary enrollment 2,000,000 of which 1,000,000 female (50
percent); and total secondary (cycle 1) enrollment 370,000 of which female 160,000 (43
percent). Thus the project achieved its development objectives with respect to direct

3.3 Efficiency

55. A specific financial analysis of the project was not included in the PAD, but rather
an extract from the more comprehensive financial analysis of the 2006 CSR. Thus a
comparison of those results with those post-completion could not be made. In addition,


                                                                                             18
although the project consists of three components, the economic analysis focuses on the
Components 1 and 2 (classroom construction, textbook purchase), due to the absence of
solid data linking project activities with quantifiable outcomes for Component 3. The
economic analysis provides an NPV, an ERR, and an efficiency analysis of the expansion
of school facilities and textbooks purchases. Complete details are presented in Annex 3.

56. NPV/ERR. The NPV and ERR analyses focus on the construction of new
classrooms, as these investments clearly link to the benefit of allowing more children to
access and complete primary education. Due to lack of data on the prior conditions of the
rehabilitated schools, these investments are not part of these analyses. With respect to
new construction, 231 classrooms were built in two phases: 141 classrooms (24 schools)
in phase I and 90 classrooms (15 schools) in phase II. The total cost of the 231
classrooms including feasibility studies, construction, supervision, and furniture is
US$6.13 million (2007 prices). Thus the NPV and ERR were calculated using the
following assumptions:

   •   Average expected “ useful life? of a school 23 years
   •   Full replacement of classroom furniture every 10 years
   •   Yearly unit cost of a primary school student US$26 (2007 prices)
   •   Each classroom accommodates 84 students; 54 students per class maintaining 60
       percent double-shift
   •   Total student capacity in 231 classrooms equals 19,958 per year (total annual
       variable cost US$510,496)
   •   Benefits: yearly wage gain of primary school graduates US$505
   •   30-year work life after primary school completion
   •   Primary completion rate in nine target provinces (46.6 percent - 2010/2011)

57. Based on the above and assuming a real discount rate of 4 percent, the NPV of the
expansion of school facilities is US$132.2 million (2007 prices), and the ERR is 18
percent. Sensitivity analysis also was performed, with the assumptions changed one at a
time. All scenarios resulted in positive NPVs, and the ERR ranged from 16 percent to 21
percent.

58. Cost Efficiency. In order to analyze the cost efficiency of the expansion of school
facilities, the project’s unit price of a new classroom was compared to similar projects.
The unit cost of a new classroom is US$26,540 (2007 prices) including feasibility studies,
supervision, and furniture. If these costs are excluded the unit price is US$22,088. In both
cases the unit cost is above the average of US$16,000 referenced in the PAD.

59. The 2006 Education Country Status Report lists unit prices for the construction of
primary school classrooms between US$5,672 and US$19,828. The large discrepancy
may be explained by variations in standards, life-expectancy of the schools, materials
used, etc. In addition, the CSR does not state whether unit costs include feasibility studies,
supervision or furniture. Nevertheless, using 2006 prices the unit cost of construction for
a new classroom built under the project is US$20,303, which remains at the high end of
the spectrum.


                                             19
60. If the project is compared with classroom construction financed by other sources,
the unit cost is high, but on par with those of a similar standard (Table 5). It should be
noted as well that the schools have been built in rural areas, including a number in spaces
difficult to access, which may have increased the cost. Studies of the soil, materials, and
catchment area also were carried out in order to improve the quality and utility of the
schools, which the others may not have included. Finally, the project’s unit cost includes
housing units for teachers, wells, and latrines. It is unclear whether similar factors were
taken into consideration for the others. Thus on balance the cost efficiency of the project
may be judged to be on par with that of other high-quality construction.

61. The second component of the project financed the purchase and distribution of
textbooks and learning materials throughout the country. In total the project provided
2,900,310 textbooks and teachers’ guides, which was 4 percent higher than the target.
The overall cost of these materials was US$3.3 million for a unit price of US$1.15 per
book. This value is in line with the unit cost recorded under a similar basic education
support project in Niger, which indicated a unit cost between US$1.10-1.40 for
elementary school textbooks.

62. The project also contributed to the improved efficiency of the education sector itself.
As previously mentioned, targets were not set for the reduction of the ratio of non-
teaching to teaching staff, nor for the redistribution of teaching staff nationwide.
Nevertheless, the ratio of the former indicator improved from 4:1 to 10:1 during the life
of the project, while over 3,000 teachers had been redeployed by July 2012. The latter
process remains ongoing.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

63. The overall outcome rating for the project is Moderately Satisfactory. This is
based on the fact that the project design was relevant to the needs of the post-conflict
environment especially with most of the project funds being allocated for the emergency

areas. Project implementation, albeit periodically delayed, was strong enough to deliver
the majority of the project outputs and reach the project objectives. This can been seen
with the improved completion rates, gross enrollment rates, improved physical capacity
of the system to handled increased enrollments, increased numbers of qualified teachers
and finally, the development of an overall education sector development that was
endorsed by the development partners and approved by the GPE board. . The project
restructuring provided the needed additional time to achieve the project goals and to meet
the project development objectives. This is a considerable achievement considering the
post-conflict environment within which the project was being implemented. The ICR
team finds the final rating to be reflective of the overall project achievements.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

64. The abolition of school fees in 2005 had led to a rapid expansion of primary school
enrollments, which threatened to overwhelm the system and reverse Burundi’s trend
towards universal primary completion. This issue was particularly acute in the country’s
most disadvantaged regions, which were not included in the government’s infrastructure
development plans. Thus Component 1 of the project specifically targeted these regions,
with the objective of increasing access and equity through expanded physical structures.
This in turn would lead to an increase in GER and, as a result, higher primary education
completion rates. Further, as the economic analysis indicates, primary school graduates
enjoy an annual wage gain of US$505 over their less educated counterparts. Therefore by
expanding primary enrollments and completion rates in the most disadvantaged regions,
the project should improve those populations’ economic prospects and reduce poverty.

65. One intermediate outcome indicator set a target girl-boy ratio in primary school
enrollment of 95 percent. In fact, by the time of restructuring in 2011 the project already
had achieved full parity. And though the project did not seek to draw a definitive causal
link, evidence indicates providing gender-separate restroom facilities—such as was done
under Component 1—fosters a “girl-friendly? school environment that encourages
greater female enrollment and retention. Therefore, although beneficiary data is not



                                                        21
available to prove such an assertion, it is not unreasonable to infer that this element of the
project helped to promote gender parity in the classroom.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

66. At the local level the project sought to improve the quality of student learning
through training programs for teachers and administrators, and increased access to
textbooks for pupils (Component 2). In both instances the elements were completed as
planned. However, in the absence of robust student learning assessments, it isn’t possible
to quantify the project’s effect on the quality of instruction. In addition, the fact the
distance learning program (Radio Scolaire) does not have an identified budget decreases
the probability of continued teacher and administrator training. Nonetheless, the fact all
teachers in service are now certified, and the ratio of students to textbooks has been
reduced, should improve the quality of primary education in Burundi going forward.

67. At the national level the project aimed to improve the capacity of the Ministry of
Education to conduct policy analysis, strategic planning and program implementation.
The twinning arrangement established for this purpose produced a variety of positive
results despite its short duration, which are detailed more fully in Annex 2. Among the
most notable institutional changes accredited to the project—and more specifically to the
twinning arrangement—are the creation within MINEDUC of the General Directorate for
Human Resources (DGRH), the General Directorate of Finance (DGF), the General
Directorate of Supplies Allocation (DGAS), and the General Directorate for the
Development of School Infrastructure ( DDIS). Given the high degree of external funding
of Burundi’s education sector from a variety of sources, these structures will be critical
for proper management of those resources in both the near and long-term.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Not applicable.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

68. A formal beneficiary survey was not carried out, nor was a stakeholder workshop
held. However, a member of the ICR team traveled to Burundi to conduct interviews and
focus groups with various project beneficiaries, to gather their views. The findings of that
mission are reflected throughout this report.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

69. In general the risks identified during project preparation were appropriate, as they
reflected the post-conflict environment of Burundi, and the government’s own limited
capacity at that time. Five of the risks were rated High, two were rated Significant, and
one was rated Moderate. The overall risk rating was High. These assessments bore out
during the implementation period, where weaknesses in MINEDUC’s ability to



                                             22
coordinate and manage both the project’s activities, as well as that of a host of other
donors, adversely affected progress and advancement toward the development objectives.
And though in principal the project was cordoned off from these activities, the fact it was
de facto part of the larger donor-funded initiative meant that donor harmonization was
very important. Nevertheless, this was not identified as a risk until the third year of
project implementation. Where the project particularly identified and mitigated risk was
in the decision to delegate responsibility for Component 1 to ABUTIP, which had
satisfactory prior experience executing Bank-funded works. Thus the Moderate rating
was appropriate as evidenced during implementation. The consistent High ratings
accorded MINEDUC also were correct, and were properly mitigated by establishing a
separate project implementation unit (SEO) to handle day-to-day management of the
project activities, including procurement, financial management and M&E.

70. As noted, the principal project development objectives were achieved, indicating a
degree of success. However, some risks to the durability of these results remain. Burundi
continues to be regarded as a fragile state; the government remains dependent upon
foreign aid to finance operations; issues affecting the primary completion rate remain to
be addressed (i.e., insufficient instruction time, high retention rates, unequal distribution
of teaching staff, limited secondary education slots); and there is a lack of identified
budget to sustain select elements of the project. Nonetheless, the newly endorsed ESP
seeks to address many of these issues, the government remains committed to the sector,
and donors continue to be engaged. Therefore, the risk to the project’s development
outcomes is Moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71. The Bank team was composed of persons with the appropriate background and
technical expertise to prepare and appraise the project. The preparation phase was
sufficient in length, and included numerous joint missions with fellow development
partners beginning in 2005. The necessary studies and analyses were conducted to
develop a solid framework for the operation; the development objective and indicators
were properly identified; and the appropriate components were devised to achieve the
project’s goals. Moreover, trust funds resources were mobilized to finance preparatory
work on the Education Sector Plan and provide technical assistance to the Borrower. The
operation was properly aligned with the country’s ISN and PRSP, and responded to the
government’s expressed development goals. Furthermore, a QER was convened and its
recommendations broadly incorporated into the project’s design. To be certain difficulties
arose during implementation that slowed progress and threatened to impede achievement
of the PDO, but the Bank team largely had taken the proper steps up front to mitigate this
eventuality (i.e., identification of risks, establishment of SEO, focused M&E scheme,
appropriate procurement and FM hires, advance training, kick-off workshop with



                                             23
Borrower, stakeholders, and development partners). As previously noted, primary gross
enrollment rate was elevated from an intermediate to a PDO level indicator during
restructuring, though in the ICR team’s assessment this should have been done at the time
of preparation. Similarly, the original target set for primary completion rate (65 percent)
was unrealistic given Burundi’s post-conflict status. Thus, the Bank’s performance in
ensuring quality at entry is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

72. Overall the Bank carried out 12 full supervisions missions, and one partial mission in
preparation for the mid-term review (team architect’s review of Component 1). In each
case the missions were comprised of a team of specialists in education, architecture,
procurement, financial management, and M&E, as appropriate. There were three TTLs
during the life of the project, which led to inevitable lag times in bringing the new staff
up to speed. The lack of a permanent TTL presence in Burundi—as opposed to other
development partners—also was remarked upon by the SEO.

73. The Bank was actively engaged in supervision from the start. Early aides-mémoire
were detailed in their analysis of project progress, including their identification of
problems and suggestions for resolution. These issues were addressed with the Borrower
and SEO and followed up in subsequent missions. However, the frequency of missions
slowed in 2009, in parallel to changes at the ministerial level. Project progress slowed
during 2009, yet picked up again for the final 2½ years of implementation with increased
frequency of supervision, and improved quality of reporting. The mid-term review was
conducted 10 months after it was originally scheduled, and the restructuring it
necessitated was finalized just one year before the project closing date (after extension).

74. In general the Bank team’s reporting (aides-mémoire, ISRs) did a satisfactory job of
documenting project implementation. That said, a clearer, more concise format for the
results framework would have been helpful. In the latter stage of the project a more
consistent model was introduced, which made tracking progress on individual elements
simpler. The ICR team further noted the consistent issuance of satisfactory ratings for
procurement, despite slippages in select project elements. This was addressed with the
downgrade of procurement and M&E to moderately satisfactory in the mid-term review,
and introduction of positive remedial steps that ultimately led to procurement being
reinstated to satisfactory. Finally, the Bank team was able to visit four of the nine regions
targeted by the project (supervision of classroom construction/ rehabilitation –
Component 1), and survey a good portion of the works, although mobility was limited
due to security concerns.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75. On the basis of the Bank’s performance in ensuring quality at entry and quality of
supervision, the overall rating for Bank performance is Moderately Satisfactory.



                                             24
5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

76. The government was actively involved in the preparation of the project, dating back
to the time of the initial joint donor missions. Further, it exhibited a strong degree of
ownership and leadership, with the Minister of Education and other high-level
MINEDUC authorities assuming overall responsibility for project management. However,
capacity weaknesses in the Ministry slowed progress, in particular with respect to
activities management and procurement. The quantity of technical assistance on offer
from a broad array of development partners, each with its own priorities and objectives,
led to inaction and delays. These issues were further exacerbated by the structural
changes at the ministerial level (split of project responsibility from one to three ministers
from three different political parties, and then back to two). Over time these protracted
delays threatened to derail achievement of the PDO, as critical activities slipped further
behind. Nevertheless, the government maintained a good relationship with the SEO
throughout implementation, and remained engaged in the project. Therefore its
performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

77. Two agencies were responsible for project implementation: ABUTIP (Component
1), and the SEO (Components 2 and 3). As noted, ABUTIP was delegated responsibility
for the school infrastructure activities. It maintained a separate special account, and
possessed its own procurement and financial management staff, who effectively managed
the tendering, contracting and payment of firms. In addition ABUTIP was responsible for
maintaining records and providing data to the SEO, which fed into the larger M&E
framework. Though such issues as site selection delays, cost adjustments and stalled
procurement are well documented, there are fewer details about ABUTIP’s performance
in the Bank team’s records. Nevertheless, the Agency exceeded the targets established by
the project and, after initial delays, did so in a timely manner. Further, the SEO asserts
ABUTIP maintained a constructive relationship throughout the implementation period,
which was critical to achieving the project’s objectives.

78. Components 2 and 3 of the project were implemented by the SEO, under the overall
direction of the Committee for Coordination of Implementation of Education and
Training Sector Policy (CCSPS) of the Ministry of Education. The requisite staff for
proper project management was in place prior to effectiveness, and the unit maintained a
professional, motivated workforce throughout the life of the project with little turnover.
As the aides-mémoire attest, the SEO was a solid partner in implementation, and where
issues arose with respect to changes to the organizational structure, the SEO stepped in to
fill the gap and keep the project moving forward. Furthermore, despite instances of issues
with the quality and consistency of data, the SEO maintained a solid M&E regime, and



                                            25
was able to produce requested documentation on demand. On the FM side IFRs and
audits were produced within the specified timeframe and remedial action was taken
where required. Procurement posed a greater challenge for the SEO, but not due to its
own capacity or will to achieve, but rather to external factors within the project’s
management structure. And finally, despite setbacks and delays, the SEO was able to
keep the project on track to achieve its key development objectives. Thus the rating for
both ABUTIP and the SEO is Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

79. On the basis of the performance ratings of both the government and the two
implementing agencies, and the development objectives achieved under the project, the
overall rating for borrower performance is Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

80. Lesson 1. Complex organizational structures should be avoided, particularly in
low-capacity environments. Multiple levels of organizational management with vertical
and horizontal lines of authority can become unwieldy when even a single element
undergoes modification. Fundamental changes at the ministerial level (twice) led to
confusion in the lines of authority and ultimately led to delays in implementation.
Simpler structures can mitigate such issues, even if they can’t prevent them entirely.

81. Lesson 2. Properly targeted indicators are key to measuring a project’s impact.
Indicators that measure outcomes at a level different than that of an intervention can
mask shortcomings or miss the opportunity to highlight progress. By setting the primary
completion rate indicator at the national level, rather than at the level of the nine targeted
regions, the project missed an opportunity to record the more impressive rate of
achievement in these areas. Data from the nine regions indicate the primary completion
rate more than doubled from 23 percent to 46.6 percent, compared to the country as a
whole where the rate increased from 38 percent to 51.4 percent. This is particularly
impressive given the fact these were disadvantaged regions in a post-conflict
environment. Thus, linking indicators directly with activities produces a better measure
of impact.

82. Lesson 3. Delegate responsibility to an entity with a proven track record, in
particular in cases where the implementing agency has weak capacity. Due to
capacity constraints within MINEDUC, the project delegated responsibility for
Component 1 (school infrastructure) to ABUTIP, an entity with a proven track record of
achievement constructing public works under a prior Bank project 8 . This freed
MINEDUC and the SEO to focus on building their capacity under the other project
components, while simultaneously buttressing ABUTIP’s expertise and experience

working with a key development partner. This arrangement served as an advantage to
these parties, as well as to the project as a whole.

83. Lesson 4. Continuity of TTL management is important, in particular in a post-
conflict environment. Both government officials and SEO staff remarked on the
multiple changes in TTL, and the lack of a more permanent presence in the field by the
Bank. Particularly in the middle period of project implementation there was a perception
of disengagement, which weakened the Bank’s position with the government and other
development partners. Staff movement in the Bank is unavoidable, but changes in TTL
should be kept to a minimum, and joint handover missions (including the sector manager,
if possible) should be the norm.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Expansion of School Facilities (US$8.15 million)

1.    Rating: Satisfactory. The objective of Component 1 was to contribute to the
expansion of primary enrollment on an equitable basis, in order to achieve universal
primary completion by 2015. Most notably it aimed to address the dramatic increase in
primary enrollment by supporting MINEDUC’s 2007-2009 triennial school infrastructure
plan. Accordingly, the component focused on Burundi’s nine most disadvantaged
provinces 9 in terms of enrollment rates and facilities, seeking to construct 220 new
classrooms, rehabilitate 200 existing classrooms, build 60 teacher housing units,
construct 40 wells and 280 latrines, and provide school furniture for all schools involved
in the project.

2.    Education Infrastructure. At the time of closing the project had constructed 231
new classrooms (including school furniture), rehabilitated 200 existing classrooms, built
37 teacher housing units, dug 42 wells, and constructed 525 latrines. Thus in large
measure the component achieved or exceeded its numerical targets. More importantly,
the expansion of educational infrastructure facilitated achievement of the development
objectives related to gross enrollment rate and student gender parity, and partial
achievement of the objectives related to teacher-student ratio, and equity of student
distribution among provinces. Furthermore, there is anecdotal evidence that the
construction of teacher housing units is fostering the redistribution of the teaching force
among schools.

3.   Responsibility for the implementation of Component 1 was delegated by
MINEDUC to the Agency for the Execution of Public Works (ABUTIP) under a project
management contract (Maîtrise d’Ouvrage Deleguée). The infrastructure program itself
was divided into three phases or “portfolios?, to be carried out over the first three years of
the project. Phases I and II involved the construction of 24 and 15 new schools,
respectively, while Phase III was dedicated to the rehabilitation of 29 existing schools 10.
The selection of sites was made by MINEDUC in accordance with the 2007-2009
Triennial Plan—in cooperation with the Bank team and development partners—and
focused on provinces with the poorest student access rates and teacher-pupil ratios.

4.   Under Phases I and II, 231 new classrooms were constructed, thereby exceeding the
project target of 220 classrooms. There were delays in the early period of implementation
of Phase I. MINEDUC was late in providing the final list of schools to be constructed.
Further delays were experienced in the procurement process, as the construction of each
school was awarded under a separate contract, some of the firms selected were less

    Bururi, Cankuzo, Cibitoke, Karusi, Kirundo, Muyinga, Ngozi, Rural Bujumbura, and Rutana.

10
  Schools were to consist of a structure with 6-9 classrooms, an administration office, latrines, a well, and a
teacher housing unit.



                                                     29
experienced in such work, and the SEO was on the early side of the learning curve with
respect to the Bank’s procurement processes. In addition, the original estimates for the
cost of consultant services for pre-construction feasibility studies and the supervision of
works were lower than the actual costs, which required a reallocation of grant proceeds to
top up the sum for consultant services. Nevertheless these shortcomings were overcome
and execution of Phases I and II construction advanced apace thereafter.

5.    A related issue involved the school furniture purchased under the project. The
pupils’ desks originally procured contained inferior quality wood, wore out quickly, and
didn’t conform to the agreed technical specifications. ABUTIP thus increased its
oversight of the production process to ensure quality before delivery, and upgraded the
technical specifications to address the degradation issue (switch to wood-and-metal
construction). As a result unit and total costs rose, thereby necessitating a
reapportionment of the grant expenditure categories. In total new school furniture was
purchased for each of the 231 classrooms constructed under the project.

6.    Under Phase III of the construction cycle some 200 school classrooms were
rehabilitated, thus meeting the project target. Initially this element encountered delays
due to an underestimation of the cost of rehabilitating school structures (i.e., cost of
reconstruction exceeded that of total replacement), which required that the list of sites be
revised and the scope of work limited to “light rehabilitation? of classrooms. This had the
effect of lowering the unit cost and conforming the total amount to the allocated budget
and numerical target.

Component 2: Support for Teaching and Learning (US$6.6 million)

7.    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. The objective of Component 2 was to contribute
to maintaining or improving student learning through the: i) introduction of new in-
service programs and devices to train teachers, school directors and inspectors; ii)
provision of textbooks and learning materials for all students at the primary level, three
subject textbooks for lower secondary students, and the introduction of a textbook


                                            30
management system; and iii) measurement of learning outcomes by undertaking a rapid
assessment of reading competency in a sample of primary schools throughout Burundi for
each year of the project.

8.     In-Service Training. Under this sub-component the project provided face-to-face
in-service training to 2,343 previously uncertified teachers, 2,170 school directors, and
139 school inspectors. In addition, a distance learning program via Burundi’s Radio
Scolaire was piloted and made fully operational in 2011. This program aimed to bolster
the advances achieved under the interpersonal training as a continuing education
initiative. The target audience for the distance learning includes all teachers and school
directors in Burundi. Accordingly, 3,300 radio units were purchased and distributed to
schools throughout the country, and training programs developed for broadcast.These
initiatives were a response to the massive increase in primary enrollments and the
subsequent hiring of thousands of new teachers and school directors.

9.     The face-to-face course work for teachers was carried out from 2007-2009 in a
series of weeks-long sessions conducted at select learning centers. Early feedback
indicated that the length of training was too long and the hours per week too few. As well,
it was determined the program focused too heavily on program content, rather than
teaching methodology. Thus the 2008 and 2009 sessions featured a revised and
strengthened training methodology, increased hours on task per week, and a condensed
time period. At the program’s inception there was a lack of data on precisely which
teachers were unqualified. In addition, participation records were not maintained in the
first round of training, thus leading to repetitions. Nevertheless, both these issues were
resolved prior to the 2009 session, and robust data maintained thereafter. In all 2,343
previously unqualified teachers received training. While this number was short of the
2,950 planned, it should be noted the government abolished the practice of hiring
unqualified teachers in 2008, thereby reducing their projected numbers. Thus,
MINEDUC asserts all uncertified teachers have been trained.

10. School inspectors and school directors also received face-to-face training in
October 2008. This program focused on strengthening the theoretical and practical
competencies of their professional functions (e.g., supporting teaching and learning,
ensuring proper school management, fostering techniques and knowledge for quality
learning and administrative oversight, etc), and was conducted in two parallel sessions
covering participants from all 17 provinces. In total 139 school inspectors and 2,170
school directors received face-to-face training, which was 93 percent and 99 percent of
the planned totals, respectively.

11. Distance learning for teachers, school inspectors and school directors was
conducted by Radio Scolaire, a government-operated radio broadcaster. The objective
was to distribute radios (3,300) to schools throughout the country, and broadcast lessons
that would reinforce and expand upon the in-person training already provided at low cost.
Initial delays in the preparation of learning materials and procurement of technical
assistance slowed progress on this component. However, in 2011 the distance learning
programs were developed and piloted (initially in municipal Bujumbura), which



                                           31
subsequently were revised and improved, and ultimately rolled out nationwide. The
training is broadcast in the afternoon, and then again at night and on Saturdays. It should
be noted the government has not identified resources to continue the program as of this
writing.

12. Textbook Publishing and Distribution. Under this sub-component the project
purchased and distributed 2,182,410 primary level textbooks and teachers’ guides, as well
as 717,900 lower-secondary level textbooks and teachers’ guides. In addition, 3,262
primary school directors and inspectors received training in the proper use, maintenance
and storage of textbooks.

13. The project sought to provide one French and one Kirundi textbook per pupil in
primary grades 3-4-5-6. The calculations of how many units to purchase assumed a 70
percent retention rate of the existing stock of textbooks in 2007, factored against the
estimated number of students enrolled in 2010/2011 11. The objective was to top up this
amount with textbooks in numbers sufficient to cover 100 percent of the student
population. However, despite clear instructions on the treatment of the existing stock,
some directors opted to dispose of the older books or placed the new books in storage as
a reserve against loss or degradation. Another issue was the rapid expansion of the
primary school population (11 percent per annum), which was not anticipated at appraisal
either with respect to children’s textbooks or teachers’ manuals. A lengthy procurement
process for the 3rd year French textbook owing to a copyright dispute with the publisher
also delayed the books’ dissemination, though ultimately this issue was overcome. In
total the project purchased 2,182,410 textbooks and teachers’ manuals in French and
Kirundi. Despite this progress, evidence suggests the ratio in Burundi remains close to
one book for every two children.

14. In addition to the primary level, the project sought to procure textbooks in sufficient
numbers to offer one book for every three students at the lower-secondary level in
English, Kirundi, French, history, mathematics, and biology. This element of the project
experienced issues on several fronts. While the PAD envisioned the purchase of
textbooks only, many of the texts had to undergo editing and revision before they were
print-worthy, and when difficulties arose, the government was slow to react or provide
solutions. In the case of a purchase of 8th grade French the SEO had to contend with the
demands of the Bank’s procurement policies, and the specifications of the borrower,
which required that a specific textbook be procured. Nevertheless, by the project’s close
some 717,900 lower-secondary level textbooks and teachers’ guides had been purchased
and were on course to being fully disseminated.

15. Training in the proper storage, preservation and use of books was held in February-
March 2011 for primary school directors. The objective was to strengthen the capacity of
schools to manage and utilize the textbooks in their possession, to maximize their benefit.
The training was facilitated by municipal school inspectors, who themselves had been
trained in textbook management in December 2010. A total of 3,262 education staff had
received textbook management training by the project’s end.

16. Sample-Based Rapid Reading Competency Tests. During the project two rapid
reading competency tests were conducted. The first test was carried out in 2011, and
established a baseline figure for reading competency among second grade students
nationwide. The second test was conducted for the same cohort in 2012 to serve as a
basis for comparison. Though four tests were envisioned to be performed under the
project, the two tests completed were instructive in indicating progress in students’
reading comprehension, and highlighting areas in need of focus. Furthermore, the firm
contracted to perform the assessment trained local education staff in methodology and
execution, which can be used to Burundi’s benefit for future testing.

17. A series of delays in the initial years of project implementation prevented a baseline
of early grade reading assessment from being established. This was due largely to issues
associated with procurement and, ultimately, timing of the assignment as the original
project closing date drew near. In addition there was a limited pool of firms interested in
or able to bid on the work, which led to several unsuccessful procurement actions.
However, in April 2011 a firm was contracted to conduct the baseline assessment, which
included training local teaching staff (l’équipe nationale) to administer the test and
compile the data. The first assessment of second grade students’ reading proficiency in
Kirundi was conducted from April-September 2011 in 120 primary schools across
Burundi. In all 1,746 students participated in the study, the results of which indicated that
20.4 percent of test subjects could not read a single word, while a further 4.9 percent
could read fewer than five words per minute.

18. The same firm was contracted to conduct a second assessment from April-June
2012, focused on the same cohort in 90 of the original 120 schools. However, in the
follow-up assessment the examiners included both 2nd grade students, and the students
from the past year (now in 3rd grade), for a total of 1,793 participants. The results for 2nd
grade students indicated that 11.9 percent of subjects could not read a single word, while
11.8 percent could read fewer than five words per minute. Taken together, the tests
indicated a slight reduction in the rate of illiteracy or limited reading ability from 25.3
percent in 2011 to 23.7 percent in 2012. At the other extreme, those students reading 20
or more words per minute decreased slightly from 39.7 percent in 2011 to 32.8 percent
2012.

19. Given two assessments were conducted during the life of the project—as opposed
to the four planned—it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions from the results.
Nevertheless, the test administrators remarked on the visible increase in the availability
of textbooks in Kirundi between the two tests, which has the potential to enhance literacy
and learning in the future. In addition, the consulting firm’s results reports provided
MINEDUC critical analysis of its language learning programs and offered proposals for
improvement, while the training provided to the teachers who administered the test
enhanced their capacity to perform other such learning assessments (e.g., PASEC,
national evaluations).

Component 3: Building Capacity in MINEDUC (US$4.25 million)

20. Rating: Moderately Successful. The objective of Component 3 was to improve the
capacity of the Government of Burundi to carry out policy analysis, strategic planning
and program implementation. By building the Ministry’s capacity to plan and manage the
education sector more efficiently and effectively, it was believed additional external
funding could be attracted, including that of the Education for All - Fast Track Initiative.

21. Twinning Arrangement. A twinning arrangement (accord de jumelage) was
signed with a consulting firm in June 2011 with the aim of strengthening MINEDUC in
such key areas as: human resources management, programming and budget execution,
development of an education management information system (EMIS), curriculum
development (primary level), teaching oversight and evaluation, assessment of student
learning, education and training of teachers, and policies to reduce repetition. Separately,
but in support of the capacity building initiative, ICT and logistics equipment were
purchased to facilitate data collection and analysis, better manage human resources, and
foster planning, budgeting, forecasting and scenario modeling. With an eye to simplifying


                                                 34
the organization and management of the numerous TA activities, these tasks were
consolidated and procured as a single assignment.

22. The recruitment process for the twinning arrangement took longer than anticipated,
as the terms of reference needed to be revisited over a period of supervision missions.
This was due in large measure to the complexity of the assignment, but also to structural
changes at the Ministry. Finding a suitable consulting firm, too, presented its challenges
as the subject matter covered a broad array of areas that required specific proficiencies.
Nevertheless, a firm was selected and a memorandum of agreement signed in June 2011.
Thus an assignment that was planned for the early phase of the project began activities
only one year prior to the closing date. Accordingly, the scope of work was reduced by
half.

23. Despite the initial delays, the twinning arrangement scored a series of important
achievements, including:

     (i)     Installation of an EMIS system that will enhance MINEDUC’s ability to
             plan, budget and manage both personnel and resources;
     (ii)    Completion of a series of studies on such issues as human resources
             management, programming and budget execution, school mapping, teacher
             training and evaluation, and student learning assessment;
     (iii)   Development and dissemination of a primary education curriculum,
             including educational materials for students and teachers;
     (iv)    Focus on the critical issue of grade repeaters and drop-outs, which led to a
             national debate on policy prescriptions; and
     (v)     Significant contributions to the development of the Education Sector Plan.

24. The choice of topics addressed by the twinning arrangement was deemed to be
highly responsive to the country’s needs. However, the manner in which the subjects
were addressed and the methodology used by the firm encountered some criticism.
Among some beneficiaries there was the impression the twinning arrangement had only
produced a series of reports, while others questioned the technical qualifications of the
consulting firm’s experts. In other areas a lack of follow-up on policy prescriptions,
uncertainty over future resource allocations, and limited political will could lessen its
impact. These facts notwithstanding, the systems put in place, the training provided, and
the studies developed have laid the groundwork for a more effective management of
MINEDUC, which should be capitalized upon in the upcoming GPE operation.

25. GPE Endorsement. Burundi’s Education Sector Plan (PSDEF) was formally
approved by the government and donor partners, and submitted to the Global Partnership
for Education (formerly EFA-FTI) for consideration on July 31, 2012. On August 7, 2012
the PSDEF was officially endorsed by the GPE Board, making Burundi the 50th member
of the Partnership. This achievement initially was anticipated within the first years of
project implementation. However, there were delays in the elaboration of the PSDEF,
which held up endorsement. Aides-mémoire from the project’s inception to its closing
cited the PSDEF’s imminent approval, without resolution. Indeed, a version of the



                                           35
PSDEF was approved by the government in October 2009, but the Technical and
Financial Partners deemed it to be too complex, in addition to needing to incorporate the
government’s new 9-year basic education policy. On a more positive note, the delays
permitted additional time for the technical assistance under the aforementioned twinning
arrangement to be completed, which provided information critical to the preparation of
the Education Sector Plan. By 2011 the issues between development partners and the
government had been worked out, and endorsement was on track to realization. On
November 20, 2012 the GPE Board approved a development grant to Burundi in the
amount of US$52.9 million

1.    The economic and financial analysis of the project in the PAD summarizes the
findings of the Education Country Status Report (Rapport d’Etat du Système Educatif
National Burundais, RESEN) from 2006, as well as the results from a long-term financial
sustainability analysis for the education system, which was discussed among the
Government, the Bank and financial and technical development partners. These findings
form a framework for justification of the project development objectives namely, to
improve the capacity of the education system to educate a rapidly increasing number of
primary-level students; and to assist the Government of Burundi to carry out policy
analysis, strategic planning and program implementation. The PAD does not contain a
Net Present Value (NPV), an Economic Rate of Return (ERR), or efficiency
considerations of the project.

2.    The project consists of three components: 1) expansion of school facilities, 2)
support for teaching and learning, and 3) building capacity in MINEDUC. This economic
analysis focuses on the first and second components, due to the absence of good data
linking project activities with quantifiable outcomes for the third component. The
economic analysis provides an NPV, an ERR, and an efficiency analysis of the expansion
of school facilities. Subsequently, an assessment of efficiency for the provision of
textbooks and a short financial analysis are presented.

Expansion of primary school facilities

3.    The expansion of school facilities was successful in exceeding the initial target of
number of classrooms to be constructed: 231 classrooms were built compared to the
target of 220 new classrooms set out in the PAD. Further, the project completed
rehabilitation of 200 new classrooms corresponding to the target set out in the PAD, and
42 wells were built compared to a target of 40. The PAD sets a target of 60 lodges for
teachers, but the project only completed 37 homes for teachers (each of four bedrooms,
one living room, kitchen, and bathroom facilities). The housing program was abandoned
after construction of the 37 homes due to teachers’ preference to live in town, rather than
near the rural schools.

NPV and ERR of the construction of new classrooms

4.    The NPV and ERR analyses focus on the construction of new classrooms, as these
investments clearly link to the benefit of allowing more children to access and complete
primary education. Due to lack of data on the prior conditions of the rehabilitated schools,
these investments will not be a part of the NPV and ERR analyses.

5.    The 231 new classrooms were built in two phases: 141 classrooms (24 schools) in
phase I and 90 classrooms (15 schools) in phase II. Due to high inflation rates in Burundi
(especially in some years), timing of payments as well as the exact time of completion of
the schools can play a significant role for the size of NPV and ERR. However, only the



                                            41
approximate time of completion of the schools is known, thus Table 1 lists the
assumptions of timing of events necessary in order to calculate the NPV and ERR.

                                                               100% of furniture costs paid

6.   On basis of the above, the total costs of the 231 classrooms including cost studies,
construction, supervision, and furniture is US$6.13 million (2007 prices), cf. Table 2. 12

Total                                6,130,672             26,540

7.    The average expected time of school use is assumed to be 23 years on basis of an
architect assessment of 20-25 years of “life-expectancy? for the schools. Full functioning
of the schools is expected for all 23 years, as the estimate is well below the international
accepted standard of 40 years of life-expectancy for classrooms built from permanent
materials. 13 A full replacement of all furniture is expected on average every 10 years.




12
   Total costs in current prices is 8,585 million FBU. Costs in 2007 prices are calculated on bais of inflation
data for Burundi from the World Economic Outlook (IMF) and according to the time of payments
illustrated in Table 1. Finally, costs are converted to US$ (2007 exchange rate, World Bank).

Communities Be Empowered to Build Their Schools?, The World Bank, 2009.

8.    The yearly unit cost of a student in primary school is US$26 (2007 prices). 14 Each
classroom accommodates 84 students, which corresponds to 54 students per class and
maintaining 60 percent double shifts. 15 The student capacity for the 231 classrooms is
thus 19,958 students per year, which results in variable costs of US$510,496 (2007
prices) per year, when all classrooms are in use.

9.    Benefits are measured by the average wage-gain of those who complete primary
school compared to the average wage for people without education. The yearly increase
in average income for people with primary education is US$505 16 , and people are
assumed to work for 30 years on average after finishing primary education. The real
wage-benefit of education is assumed to stay constant over the period of time considered.
No wage-gain is assumed for those who do not complete all six years of primary
education. This is a conservative assumption as some benefit is expected in reality for
those leaving primary school: e.g., after four or five years of schooling.

10. The primary education system in Burundi is characterized by high repetition rates
and low completion rates. The retention rate is very low, and thus out of 100 children
newly entering primary education, only 44 percent finish 6th grade. 17 The high repetition
rates leads to an inflated gross enrollment rate exceeding 100 percent for primary
education. The resulting completion rate for primary education was 51.3 percent for
Burundi in 2010/11 18, and the CSR 2012 estimates maximum overall completion rate of
primary education in Burundi will be 58 percent in 2015.

11. Although the project’s outcome indicators evaluate on basis of the national
completion rate, the relevant completion rates for the NPV analysis are the province-
specific completion rates, as the NPV solely focuses on the value of the expansion of
school facilities in the nine provinces and does not take into account results of other
project components such as training of teachers etc. In general the completion rates are
lower for the provinces, where the 39 schools have been built. The average completion
rate for the nine provinces was 46.6 percent in 2010/11 19. Completion rates have been
rising faster for the nine provinces, where the new schools have been built, than for the
country overall. However, although completion rates have been going up during the
period of time studied, the NPV is calculated based on a constant completion rate of 46.6
percent for all future years. This may be too conservative an assumption, and the
sensitivity analysis considers scenarios with higher completion rates.

12.   Due to high repetition rates especially at the higher classes 20, classroom seats are
assumed to be divided equally between students at all levels in primary school.

13.    On the basis of the above and assuming a real discount rate of 4 percent 21, the
NPV of the expansion of school facilities is US$132.2 million (2007 prices). The ERR of
the expansion of school facilities is 18 percent.

14.     As already mentioned, the calculations of NPV and ERR are subject to a number
of assumptions, which influence the calculated value of the investment. Table 3 lists the
results of the sensitivity analyses, where assumptions have been changed one at a time.
All scenarios result in positive NPVs, and the ERR ranges from 16 percent to 21 percent
depending on the assumptions made.

Cost efficiency

15. In order to analyze the cost efficiency of the expansion of school facilities, the
project’s unit price of a new classroom is compared to similar projects. The unit cost of a
new classroom is US$26,540 (2007 prices) including cost studies, supervision, as well as
furniture, and assuming that costs are paid according to the timeline in Table 1. 22
Excluding cost studies, supervision and furniture, the unit price of construction of
classrooms is US$22,088 (2007 prices). Both of these calculated unit costs are above the
average cost of US$16,000 mentioned by the PAD (p. 96).

16. The Education Country Status Report (Rapport d’Etat du Système Educatif
National Burundais, RESEN) from 2006 compares unit costs for new classrooms built for
primary education. The highest unit cost is US$19,828 and the lowest unit cost is


20
   PAD p. 6
21
   Corresponds to the average annual growth rate of GDP in Burundi 2007-2010.
22
   Unit costs are calculated as follows: 1) the total costs of 8,586,317,585 FBU are taken back to 2007
prices according to the timing outlined in Table 1 and using average yearly inflation rates from World
Economic Outlook (IMF). This results in total costs of 6,632,588,109 FBU (2007 prices). 2) using the
World Bank’s 2007 exchange rate the corresponding total costs are US$6,130,672 (2007 prices). 3) divided
by the number of classrooms (231) yields a unit price of US$ 26,540 (2007 prices).


                                                  44
US$5,672 for construction of a permanent classroom. The large difference in costs may
be explained by variation in standards, different “life-expectancy? of the schools,
variation in common premises included etc. Furthermore, the 2006 CSR does not state
whether unit costs include cost studies, supervision and furniture. Finally, some schools
are constructed by entrepreneurs where others incorporate community contributions.
Taking this project’s costs back to 2006 prices, the unit price of construction for the new
classrooms is US$20,303, which is in the high end compared to the unit prices listed in
the 2006 CSR.

17. The final evaluation of the project, undertaken by the Bank, also compares the unit
cost of classrooms across different projects and shows high unit costs for the classrooms
in this project as well. Although, the costs are difficult to compare as there does not exist
a common standard of design, the following issues may explain some of the higher costs
of the project. First, all of the schools have been built in rural areas with a number of
them in spaces difficult to access, which may have increased the cost. Second, studies of
the soil, materials, catchment area, etc. have been carried out in order to improve the
quality and utility of buildings. Third, unit costs include lodges for teachers, wells, and
latrines.

18. Component 2 of the project supported the provision of textbooks and learning
materials. The project provided 2,900,310 textbooks and teachers’ guides in total, which
is 4% higher than the target. The overall costs of learning materials amounted to US$3.3
million, which corresponds to a unit price of US$1.15 per book. This unit cost is in line
with those obtained in a similar basic education support project in Niger, in which unit
costs amounted to US$1.10 for grade 1-5 textbooks and US$1.40 for grade 6 textbooks. 23

Financial Analysis

19. The government spending on education has increased from 6.55 percent of GDP in
2007 to 9.75 percent of GDP in 2010, cf. Table 4.

Table 4 Government Expenditure on Education (source: CSR 2012)

Billions FBU (2010 prices)                     106.82    126.37    121.12    165.83
percent of GDP                                   6.55      8.12      7.55      9.75

20. Out of the budget for 2010, 46.4 percent 24 goes to primary education, which is a
small increase in the relative spending on primary education by 2 percentage points
compared to 2003/04 25.

21. The fiscal impact of this project primarily stems from the higher cost of the
expanded school system: i.e., the recurrent costs associated with the additional number of
students accommodated in the new classrooms. This fiscal impact can now be calculated,
as Burundi has an education financial simulation model describing the aspect of increased
capacity of the education system. The recurrent cost of the expanded school system
amounts to US$510,496 (2007 prices), cf. the economic analysis. Furthermore,
replacement of furniture for the new classrooms is expected every ten years
corresponding to an average yearly cost of US$46,558 (2007 prices). Finally, a fiscal
impact is expected from maintenance costs for the new classrooms, as well as
replacement of textbooks. For the rehabilitated classrooms, the recurrent costs are not
expected to be higher than costs were prior to rehabilitation, and it is possible that the
rehabilitation results in a fiscal saving due to lower maintenance costs.

22. Although there is not a direct fiscal impact from the project with respect to ongoing
training of teachers, school directors, and inspectors, prolonging this work will help
sustain the quality of education in the future. To the ICR team’s knowledge funding has
not at this point been granted for this purpose.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

[A copy of the Borrower’s complete ICR report is available on file in French.]

I.          Assessment of project development objective indicators as of June 30, 2012

Primary completion rate

1.     The primary completion rate indicator, which was set at 65 percent at the project’s
start and then lowered to 55% after the mid-term review, rose from 38% to 51% by 2010-
2011.

The results of the rapid reading assessment improved during project implementation

2.    For the first two years of implementation progress could not be measured. The first
rapid reading assessment held in May 2011 revealed that 20.4 percent of students could
not read. At the end of the project, the portion of non-reading students was 11.9 percent.

Admission of Burundi to EFA FTI/GPE

3.   Burundi was admitted to the FTI just after the end of project implementation. The
project supported the development of the education sector plan (PSDEF), which was
endorsed by the Government in 2009, but not by the PTFs at that time. However, by
project closing the revised PSDEF was endorsed by the PTFs and submitted to the GPE.

II.         Status of achievement of operational components of the project

Status of activities under Component 1 "Expansion of school infrastructure"

4.    The activities under this component were all executed and the planned objectives
achieved. The project built 231 classrooms (against 220 planned), 37 teacher housing
units, and 39 water points for 39 new schools, and rehabilitated 200 existing classrooms.
All new schools have been equipped with benches desks and other furniture. Actions
undertaken by NGOs recruited permitted communities to be sensitized to the issues of
environmental protection and maintenance of schools constructed and/or rehabilitated.

Status of activities under Component 2 "Support teaching and learning?

      (i)      Status of implementation of training activities for teachers, principals and
               school inspectors

5.    Training for unqualified teachers (2,343) was held in 2007, 2008 and 2009. All
unqualified teachers in Burundi received training. Note the number of these teachers did
not increase, because the Government halted the recruitment of unqualified teachers in
2008. School inspectors (139) and primary school principals (2,170) also were trained
during project implementation. Distance training conducted by Radio Scolaire consisted



                                                51
of the following: i) training of a team of 29 counselors from BEPEB in the development
of distance learning programs; ii) training of journalists; iii) provision of transmitters to
Radio Scolaire to strengthen its coverage area; iv) provision of radios; and v) training of
inspectors to conduct monitoring and support training activities.

       (ii)      Status of achievement of the provision of textbooks

6.    In order to increase the ratio of textbooks per pupil in Kirundi and French, the
project funded the reprinting of textbooks. The process of procurement of 3rd year
French textbooks was delayed until the end of the project due to a copyright issue. At the
lower secondary level, the project financed the acquisition of textbooks in French,
Kirundi, Biology, Mathematics, English and History in three different manners: reprint
edition, printing and textbooks. In order to enable better management and maintenance
manuals in schools, training courses were organized for primary school principals,
directors of community colleges municipal and provincial inspectors. In total 3,038
participants were trained in textbook management.

       (iii)     Status of achievement in learning assessment

7.    A rapid reading assessment was administered to second grade students in May 2011,
and a follow-up assessment was administered to second and third grade students in April
2012. Technical assistance was provided to MINEDUC staff, who may then organize
such tests in the future to develop a national assessment system.

Status of activities under Component 3 "Development of institutional capacity"

8.    The objective of the component was to develop capacity in the following areas: i)
curriculum elaboration; ii) student learning assessment; iii) education inspection; iv)
teacher training; and v) repetition reduction. These activities were all completed and
validated by reports. Activities were then organized in order to reinvest deliverables and
thus change the educational system.

III.          Issues related to the implementation of PARSEB

Implementation of activities under Component 1

9.    The principal issues faced with school construction related to the length of time
needed to finalize the list of schools to be built, which at times required changes and
identification of new sites. Another issue was the higher than anticipated cost of
construction in remote areas. In the case of rehabilitation, initial costs estimates proved to
be too low, requiring a change in strategy to achieve the target.

Implementation of activities under Component 2

       (i)       Training teachers, school directors and inspectors




                                                 52
10. Initial plans for training of teachers had too few hours of instruction per week,
unequal distribution of teachers among centers, and repetition of modules. In the case of
school directors, new hires required a second round of training to replace those already
trained.

      (ii)      Procurement of textbooks

11. In general there were delays with respect to the procurement of textbooks. In some
instances this was due to matters with publishers, and in others to the information on
hand at the time of project preparation.

      (iii)     Learning assessment

12. The principal issue affecting the learning assessment was the search for an
appropriate firm to conduct the testing. This led to delays.

Implementation of activities under Component 3

13. Recruitment of the firm for the twinning arrangement took longer than anticipated,
in particular due to the process of preparing TORs. With respect to training in human
resources management, the use of the tools developed is hampered by MINEDUC’s
nascent familiarity with the EMIS system.

IV.          Project Management Performance

Committee for Coordination and Monitoring of the Implementation of the Education and
Training Sector Policy (CCSPS)

14. The CCSPS played a significant role in the implementation of the project. However,
there were changes at the institutional level, such as the addition of the Education Sector
Group and various thematic working groups, which affected the institutional structure.

Executive Operational Secretariat (SEO)

15. The Executive Operational Secretariat performed its tasks well. All procurement
actions ultimately were carried out, despite initial delays, issues with copyrights, and the
introduction of the Bank’s Procsys system. With respect to monitoring and evaluation,
the SEO actively tracked data and stayed up to date with financial and narrative reporting
requirements.

Technical Execution Committee (CTE) and ABUTIP

16. The CET and ABUTIP performed well, yet were subject to the same restructuring
issues as the CCSPS.

World Bank



                                            53
17. The project benefited from the advice and technical support provided during
supervision missions. In addition, the training sessions organized by the World Bank
country office contributed greatly to the SEO’s technical capacity. Nevertheless, the lack
of a TTL in country was a handicap. On procurement, most requests for non-objection
were responded to rapidly and without reminder.

V.        Lessons learned

18.    The main lesssons learned from the project are the following:
      • Ensure reliable baseline data for project components
      • Establish standards for building construction and factor in maintenance costs
      • Strengthen education offices in areas of development and evaluation of textbooks
      • Multiple changes in the institutional structure of a project should be avoided
      • Produce accurate price estimates for project components
      • Multiple actors overseeing project components leads to overlap and competition;
        streamline

19.    Concerning the sustainability impacts, the following should be noted:
      • PARSEB fostered sustainable institutional changes: e.g., creation of Directorate
        General in Charge of Finance (DGF), Directorate General of Human Resources
        (HRD) with relevant departments such as the Office of School Facilities and
        Maintenance (BISEM), and the Directorate of School Supplies (DAS).
      • There was a good deal of sustainable impact from the training activities, including
        the development of curricula, the assessment of learning outcomes, and the
        acquisition of skills in Radio Scolaire to conduct quality distance learning
        programs. In addition, the skills training of teachers coupled with the availability
        of the textbooks will change teaching practices for the better.
      • The built and rehabilitated classrooms will provide years of value to the
        underserved regions covered by the project.
      • Full funding of these activities requires sustained follow up and good governance
        at the educational level. In the monitoring of the implementation of the PSDEF, it
        would be wise for MINEDUC to provide resources to continue the benefits of the
        project acquired.

VI.       Environment in which the project was implemented

20. The project was implemented in a post-conflict environment, with effectiveness
starting just a few years after the cessation of hostilities. However, there were no
disruptions to implementation on account of security issues, and field missions—
including those of the Bank—went smoothly. Following the 2005 elections there were
policy debates on such sensitive issues as governance and citizens' rights. Most of the
institutional changes at the ministerial level that influenced the project were motivated by
these debates.




                                             54
21. During the early years of the project, there were issues with donor coordination.
The SEO was simultaneously managing the Common Fund for Education (FCE), which
led to a degree of competition between the FCE and PARSEB. On January 1, 2011
management of the FCE was moved to the Directorate General of Finance in the Ministry
of Basic Education.

22. The project was implemented by a competent team of professionals at the Executive
Operational Secretariat. That said, the process of closing the project was not easy, as
many staff moved on to other assignments due to a lack of funds for these activities.
Proper funding should be provided for the closing of an operation.

VII. Conclusion

23.   Overall the project was well implemented. The achievement of development
objectives and lessons learned will foster the success of future projects in the education
sector. These achievements were the result of concerted effort and solid cooperation
among technical departments in charge of the implementation of project activities, as
well as the dedication of the staff of the SEO. Their flexibility and diligence helped to
overcome issues that arose during implementation and led to project success.
