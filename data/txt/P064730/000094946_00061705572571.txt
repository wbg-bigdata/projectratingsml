CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Purpose of Present Report
In 1999 the Chinese government and the World Bank prepared reports, including an EIA,
for a proposed "Yangtze Basin Flood Control Project", in which the WB contributed to
the project financing in the amount of US$ 300 million. Since the government and the
Bank have agreed recently to reduce the Bank participation to approximately US$ 235
million, and also to change the name of the project to the "Yangtze Dyke Strengthening
Project" and accordingly, new project reports are needed which describe the revised
project compared to the 1999 version, including a revised EIA if necessary. The modified
project deletes participation of Jiangxi province.
The purpose of the present report is to determine whether the modifications in the project
will result in any significant changes in the project's environmental impacts and if so to
describe these changes in impacts and the corresponding changes which will be needed in
the project's Environmental Management Plan. These revisions in the EIA are described
as a supplement to EIA/1999, called "S/EIA".
1.2 Background on EIA/1999
The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report for the Yangtze Basin Flood Control
Project (YBFCP) was prepared by the Research Institute for Yangtze Water Resources
Protection (RIYWRP) with assistance from corresponding institutes in Hunan, Hubei, and
Jiangxi provinces (the EIA/1999). World Bank staff and consultants also assisted with the
preparation of the EIA.
The EIA is based on the updated provincial EIA reports prepared by the provincial design
institutes mentioned above for the project components in each province. The provincial
ELAs have been approved by the Provincial EPB's and SEPA. The EIA for the project
meets the requirements of both the Government of China and the World Bank.
The EIA takes into account the entire spectrum of environmental effects that could result
from the Project, including effects on: (i) physical natural resources, (ii) natural
ecological resources, (iii) economic development, (iv) quality of life values, and (v)
global environmental issues, as they apply to project components in each of the three
provinces.
The EIA delineates all "Significant Environmental Issues" (SEIs) affected by the Project,
describes the potential for each SEI to cause adverse environmental effects if not
controlled, and describes recommended control measures, called Environmental
Protection Measures (EPMs). The EPMs include (i) Mitigation measures, for lessening



the magnitude of adverse impact, and (ii) Offsetting measures, for offsetting any residual
adverse effects not solved by mitigation, so that there will be no or no significant net
adverse effect for each SEI. In some instances, where feasible, the EIA recommends a
third kind of EMP, namely Enhancement measures, for those situations where a small
additional investment would yield valuable environmental benefits.
The EIA/1999 includes an overall Enviromnental Management Plan (EMP), which is to
be implemented when the project proceeds, including (i) establishment of an
Environmental Management Office (EMO) in each participating province, with
responsibility for achieving implementation of all EMPs specified in the EIA including
environmental monitoring and for carrying out the recommended technology transfer
measures, and (ii) establishment of an International Panel of Environmental Experts.
1.3 Approach to Preparing Supplement to EIA Report
1.3.1 EIA Team
The present report "supplement to EIA for the Yangtze Dyke Strengthening Project"
(S/EIA) has been prepared, like the EIA/1999, by the Research Institute for Yangtze
Water Resources Protection (RIYWRP), with the same staff and assistance, except that,
because Jiangxi Province is not a participant in the modified project, the S/EIA team
does not include participation by the Jiangxi Water Conservancy & Hydropower Survey
& Design Institute and Jiangxi Environment Protection Research Institute.
1.3.2 Procedure for Identifying Needed EIA Adjustments
To identify the needed adjustments for preparing S/EIA, Chapter 2 first clarifies several
project concept related issues. Based on this clarification, Chapter 3 identifies needed
adjustments in the ETA/1999. Chapter 4 then presents the discussion for each of the
identified adjustments. Chapter 5 gives the Summary and Conclusions for the S/EIA.

Chapter 2
Clarification of Project Related Issues
2.1 Definition of Yangtze Project
The Yangtze Project, previously called the "Yangtze Basin Flood Control Project", now
renamed as "Yangtze Dyke Strengthening Project"(YDSP), is defined as comprising
improvements in the dykes and related berms plus the resettlement program, plus other
improvements such as in flood forecasting and preparations for emergency flooding relief
operations, for those provinces in the Yangtze basin where the improvement program is
financed jointly by the Government and the World Bank (WB). This project,
corresponding to such financing as planned as of November 1999, thus comprised the
improvements in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces. This is called the Projectll 999.
Recently the Government and WB have agreed to reduce the scope of Bank financing to
include participation only in Hubei and Hunan provinces, with Jiangxi province no longer
included. Hence Project/2000 is defined as the improvement program for Hubei and
Hunan provinces.
2.2 Changes in Project Scope/Components
Other than for the deletion of the Jiangxi province improvements, the overall
Projectl2000 is essentially the same as for Project/i999. There are no changes in the
overall project investment program, including (i) no changes in the engineering designs
for dyke/berm improvements, and (ii) no changes in the provisions to be made for
resettlement, i.e., the resettlement program is to ensure resettlement of all
families/facilities which need to be resettled because of the project, including provision of
all resettlement community facilities needed for enabling sound environmental protection
and associated environmental monitoring.
2.3 Changes in Bank Financing
2.3.1 Bank Requirements for Describing Project Components Involving Bank
Financing
The EIA for Project/i999, called EIA/1999, covers the entire project program in the
participating provinces, regardless of sources of financing. However, for Bank purposes
the EIA/1999 project description does identify those portions of the overall project which
involve Bank financing, including drawings which identify these components. Table 2-1
has been prepared to compare  Bank's involvement in project dike sections for
Project/2000 with Projectl1999. Correspondingly, Figure 2-1 shows the dike sections of
Projectl1999, and Figure 2-2 shows the dike sections of Project/2000.
3



2.3.2 Changes in Bank Financing
Review of Table 2-1, Figure 2-1, and Figure 2-2 show that the main changes in Bank
financing are as follows:
a. Jiangxi province is no longer included;
b. Project underwater components, such as cut-off wall, bank protection works, are no
longer included because responsibility for these works has been shifted from provincial
governments to the CWRC (Changjiang Water Resources Commission);
c. More dyke sections in Wuhan have been included and some dyke sections in other
areas in Hubei province are no longer included, and
d. As a result of above changes, World Bank financing participation is reduced from
US$300 million to US$ 235 million.
There is no change in the Bank's involvement in the non-physical components of the
overall project except for deletion of Jiangxi province participation.
2.3.3 Detailed Description of Projectl2000
Detailed description of the Projectl2000 is included in a separate project document
"Description of Project/2000" (Ref. 1).

CHAPTER 3
IDENTIFICATION OF NEEDED
ADJUSTMENTS IN PROJECT EIA/1999
3.1 Project Scope and Project Components
Based on the discussion in Chapter 2, the following conclusions can be made:
(i) The overall Yangtze dyke strengthening projects in the three provinces, Hubei, Hunan
and Jiangxi, remain the same. Regardless of World Bank financing involvement, all
the projects will be constructed according to the same basin wide flood control
planning and same project design criteria.
(ii) The physical aspects and the detailed project components of Project/2000 for Hubei
and Hunan provinces are the same as for Project/1999, with no additions to the
project's physical components.
3.2 Role of EIA/1999
3.2.1 Environmental Setting and SEIs
Because of no changes in overall Yangtze Project and because the physical aspects of
Project/2000 fQr Hubei and Hunan provinces are the same as for Project/i999, the
environmental setting for Project/2000 for Hubei and Hunan provinces remains the same
as for Project/1999. Therefore the Significant Environmental Issues (SEIs) for
Project/2000 are the same as for Project/1999, except those specially related to Jiangxi
Province such as Saicheng Lake Migratory Birds.
3.2.2 Scope of EIA/1999
The EIA/1999 covers the entire Yangtze project including the impacts of all project
components including both World Bank financed and non-World Bank financed
components, such as project impacts on downstream hydrology, precious ecology,
Dongting Lake flood release, etc. Hence, the EIA/I1999 is fully applicable to Project/2000.
The above conclusions include the resettlement (RS) component of the project. While the
number of people to be resettled has been reduced from approximately 52,860 to 35,200
due to reduction of WB involvement, the SEIs for the RS component and the EPMs
(Environmental Protection Measures) for environmental management in resettlement
areas remain the same.
3.2.3 Needed Adjustments in EIA/1999
5



Because of the removal of Jiangxi province in the Project/2000, adjustments are needed
in the Project EIA. The following adjustments in EIA/1999 are identified to be necessary
to be applicable to Project/2000:
a. Adjustments in Environmental Management Plan
b. Issues specially related to Jiangxi Province(deleted)
c. Adjustments in Maps and Drawings
d. Adjustments in EIA/l999 Executive Summary
All above adjustments are discussed in detail in Chapter 4 including adjustments in the
numbers/figures included in pertinent tables/figures in EIA/1999.
6



CHAPTER 4
ADJUSTMENTS IN PROJECT EIA/1999
Chapter 4 discusses the needed adjustments in the project ELA/1999 as identified in
Chapter 3 including the revised environmental management plan, deletion of
environmental issues specially related to Jiangxi Province, and adjustments in project
maps and drawings, and adjustments in the EIA/1999 Executive Summary.
4.1 Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
4.1.1 Overall Coordination for Participating Provinces
In EIA/1 999, an overall EMO coordinator (C/EMO) is recommended to be established to
work with the three provincial EMOs to ensure coordination of the environmental
operations of all three provinces (See Section 7.4 of EIA/l 999). Because Jiangxi Province
is no longer included in Project/2000, the C/EMO is no longer considered to be
necessary. Coordination on environmental management issues between the remaining two
project provinces will be done by the project management offices (PMOs) in the two
provinces with assistance from the International Panel of Experts to be established and
the follow-up World Bank missions.
4.1.2 Environmental Monitoring
The environmental monitoring program developed in EIA/l999 is fully applicable to
Project/2000 except those components specially related to Jiangxi Province such as
monitoring on Saicheng Lake migratory birds.
Figure 5.3-2 in EIA/1999 has been updated to exclude these monitoring components. This
is attached here as Figure 4-1.
4.1.3 Environmental Training
The environmental training program was developed for pertinent staff in the three
provinces. With exclusion of Jiangxi Province in the Project/2000, the training program
needs to be correspondingly adjusted. However, the contents of the training program
remain the same and only the number of trainees and the training budget need to be
reduced. Table7.6.1-4 in EIAI1999 has been revised and is attached in the S/EIA as
Figure 4-2.
7



4.1.4 Environmental Management Costs
Because the nature and contents of environmental management in the two provinces
involved in Projectl2000 remain the same, the cost estimates for overall environmental
management for the two provinces remain unchanged. However, environmental
management costs for Jiangxi Province need to be eliminated.
4.2 Environmental Issues Peculiar to Jiangxi Province
Because Jiangxi Province is not included in Project/2000, some environmental issues
specially related to Jiangxi Province, which are discussed in project EIA/1999, are no
longer applicable to Projectl2000. These include environmental assessment on Saicheng
Lake migratory birds, impacts of project construction on Xunyang Tower and Pipa Tower
in Jiujiang City of Jiangxi Province, and other Jiangxi related issues described in
EIA/1999 such as environmental setting, project economic analysis, etc..
4.3 Adjustments in Maps and Drawings
As mentioned in Chapter 2, Figure 2-2 has been prepared to show clearly the World
Bank financing involvement for Project/2000. Similarly, slight adjustments are needed in
pertinent project maps and drawings in EIA/1999, which have been included in the
"Description of Project/2000" (Ref. 1).
4.4 Adjustments in Project EIA/1999 Executive Summary
The changes needed in project E4IA/1999 as mentioned above are also needed in
EIA/1 999 Executive Summary. As explained in above chapters/sections, these
adjustments have not affected the validity of the ELW1 999 as applied to Proj ect/2000.
8



CHAPTER 5
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The evaluation presented above shows, because EIA/1999 covers the entire Yangtze
Project regardless of sources of financing, that the reduction/changes in the Bank's
financing participation does not affect the EIA's evaluation of project effects on
enviromnental resources, hence EIA/i999 remains applicable to Project/2000 as well as
to Project/i999 with respect to these effects. However, deletion of Jiangxi province from
the overall project does reduce the scope of the project Environmental Management Plan
(EMP) required for ensuring that all of the EPMs specified in the EIA will be duly carried
out. Hence S/EIA has been prepared to describe the modified EMP including updating of
the associated figures and tables.
Some other slight corresponding adjustments such as adjustments in maps and drawings
are also identified and discussed in the S/EIA.
