1 Report overview

1.1 Porject background

Consisting of four uncontinuous dikes, Changjiang River Huanggang main dike locates
at left bank of Changjiang in the section from Jinluo Port of Tuanfeng Countz to Makou
Port of Wuxue City, this dike is devided by four first-class tributaries of Changjiang
River, i.e. Jushui, Bahe, Xishui and Qishui rivers. The tributary dike combines with
Changjiang main dike to form a flood barrier to protect Tuanfeng, Huangzhou, Xishui,
Qichun and Wuxue counties (district, city) in Huanggang City and etc.
Dike of estuary of four tributaries influenced by backwater effect of flood of
Changjiang River main stream in flood season is called as "Changjiang River
Huanggang backwater dike", including some branch dikes, i.e. Judong, Changsun,
Laocheng, Beiyong, Yongbao, Yonggu and Chidong. Judong branch dike locates at left
bank of Jushui RiverChangsun branch dike locates at right bank of Ba River,
Laochengdi dike is adjacent to Zhangsun dike and locates at upper stream of Zhangsun
dike, Beiyong branch dike locates at left bank of Ba RiverYongbao branch dike licates
at right bank of Xishui River, Yonggu branch dike locates at left bank of Xishui River
Chidong dike locates at left bank of Qishui River.
Located between Hankou and Hukou, Changjiang River Huanggang main dike connects
to conflow of Chuangshui River, Hanjiang River and Dongting Lake and receives
backwater effect of flood from Poyang Lake. Rapid rising, slow falling and long term
high water level are features of Changjiang River. Under backwater effect of
Changjiang River flood, water level in Jushui, Bahe, Xishui and Qishui Rivers stay in a
high level in a long termAll tributaries often receive intensive and long-duration
rainfalls, therefore, even Changjiang River is at low level, water level in tributaries may
be high still, for this reason, flood danger often occure in flood season.
In 1996, Yonggu branch dike was bursted.
In flood season in 1998, 8 flood peaks in upper stream interacted with flood from
middle and downstream to form a flood which ranked second in historical full basin
type flood since 1954. The flood risk frequently occure in Changjiang River Huanggang
backwater dike and cost much in emergency protection in flood defense.
From 1998 to 2004, Flood prevention and reinforcement work had been developed in
Changjiang River Huanggang main dike, the completion of the work thoroughly
eliminates threat of flood to safety of main dike. However, the flood control project
system in protection area consists of main stream dike and branch dike, therefore, the
hidden danger of flood still exists in branch dike, the protection area is still subject to
flood.
In order to upgrade flood control standard and ensure safety of people and properties in
protection area and facilitate and stabilize development of local economic and perfect
flood control project system, reduce flood threat in this area, it is very necessary to
eliminate risk and reinforce Changjiang River Huanggang backwater dike.
This project involves in full length of 57.392km in scope of flood prevention and
reinforcement project of Changjiang River Huanggang backwater dike, where, Judong
dike, Laocheng dike, Beiyong branch dike, Yongbao branch dike, Yonggu branch dike
and Chidong branch dike is at length of 17.774km, 6.23km, 3.76km, 2.343km,5.286km


                                              3

and 22km respectively. Changjiang River Huanggang backwater dike and main dike
protects 758-thousand Mu cultivatable land and 1.344 million people, after completion
of this project, 37.8 million RMB economic loss due to flood will be reduced, internal
benefit of the project will be 9,90%, main construction includes heightening and
thickening of dike body, slope protection, highway specially constructed for flood
control on top of dike, vertical anti-seepage wall, cone-penetration grouting, immersion
inhibitive platform, clay anti-seepage trench, pond filling and foundation solidation,
riprap revetment, maintenance and reinforcement of one culvert gate, rebuild of five
culvert gates. Since the construction require permanent acquisition of 1622.02 Mu land
and resettle 1622 people, a detailed resettlement action plan is prepared to reduce
influence of the project.


1.2 Consistency with original project

Original project refers to "Reinforcement of Changjiang River main dike financed by
Hubei government utilizing World Bank loan", which include Changjiang River Wuhan
main dike, Changjiang River Hannan main dike, Changjiang River Jingnan main dike,
Changjiang River Huanggang main dike and Bapu major dike.
Targe of the project is as same as the original project, i.e. to upgrade flood control
standard, to protect safety of lives and properties of people living in the protected area,
to facilitate continuous and stable development of local economy, to perfect flood
control project system, to relif threat of flood. This dike connects with original
Changjiang River Huanggang main dike, the protection area is as same as before,
therefore, reinforcement of dike will strengthen safety of protection area in scope of
original Changjiang River Huanggang main dike.At the same time, consisting with
original project, the project works on reinforcement of dike, i.e. heightening and
thickening of dike body, construction of slope protection, special highway for flood
control on top of dike, vertical anti-seepage wall, cone-penetration grouting, immersion
inhibit platform, fond filling and foundation solidationi and etc. In view to operation of
original project, these measures will not cause heavy environmental issues.
Causes of resettlement of this project are as same as that of original project.Although
the alternative project program maximize the use of vertical anti-seepage wall (which
occupies less land than horizontal anti-seepage) to replace horizontal anti-seepage and
the use of flood control wall to replace thickening and heightening of dike to minimize
resettlement, some sections need occupying land and cause resettlement.As same as
original project, belt type, scattered resettlement features this project; the land
expropriation has small affect on the whole project area, resettlers will not loss living
resources.At the same time, this resettlers had been living beside the dike, flood directly
treaten their safety, for safe reason, the project will directly benefit these resettlers, the
investigation for resettler'will indicates that all resettlers support the project. Therefore,
there is no social risk to the project implementation.
The original project was implementd in accordance with Resettlement Action Plan
approved by World Bank, the settlement targets of production and living were realized.
As same as original project, this project will follow resettlement policies specified by
national authority and World Bank to recover or upgrade original living standard of
resettlers, information of project will be disclosed to public, infirm group will be
supported, public will be encourage to participat and negotiate with the project, social


                                               4

adjustment will be strengthened, administration offices will be established during
implementation of the project.
Deriving successful experience of original resettlement project, the programming of
RAP of this project includes a lot of resettlers in; especially, resettlers and local
government are consulted with for resettlement planning.After assessment of World
Bank, RAP will be kept in local library and resettlement office and will be disclosed to
public in local newspaper, TV and broadcasting.

1.3 Project influence

Flood prevention and reinforcement project of Changjiang River Huanggang backwater
dike involves in 4 counties, 1 district, 8 villages and towns, 33 executive villages (farm
lands). The project has small adverse influence on local society and economy. However,
residences of resettler will be removed, therefore, their lives will be affected, at the
same time, local cultivable lands will be reduced; therefore, it has to take measures to
adjust economy.
Expropriation of land-The project will permanently occupies land of 1622.02 Mu, of
which 308.5 Mu are cultivable lands in dike area, or 19% of total, paddy field is about
9.6%, crop productivity suffers loss about 118t/year. Land temporarily occupied is
4396.25 Mu, of which 2487.3 Mu is cultivable land (2288.5 Mu locates in dike, 198.8
Mu landed out), or 56.6% of total, crops productivity will loss 1125t per year in 2-year
occupation period.
Resettler-406 households, 1622 people will be resettled due to occupation of the project.
The investigation for people affected by this project indicates that no minority people
was found, some minorities maybe get married with Han nationalities, and has been
melted in Han culture, they will be treated neither as weak group nor as aborigines,
therefore, OD4.2-Aborigines is not applicable in this case. The investigation also found
66 infirms, or 4% of total resettlers (including orphans and widows, disables and familis
without labor force). Since lands expropriated are linearly distributed, therefore, there is
no need to resettle the whole village, in most condition, the influence is small. In 33
influenced villages, number of resettlers takes only proportion of 4% of total
population.
Resettlement of residences--Houses to be removed occupy lands of 77510 m2, where
private house is 68558m2, or 88.4% of total, houses pertained to enterprises and institutions is
8952.1m2or 11.5 of total. 17 enterprises and institutions are involved, most of them,
only limited portions or appurtenant houses and facilities need to be removed. Four
enterprises or 23.5% will be relocated wholly.
Professional project facilities-following facilities are affected by the project, i.e. 9.6km
mechanical plough, 12.1km 10kv electric line, 25.6km communication line, 21.6km
CATV, 2880kw pump unit and etc. There are no important cultural relics in area of
project.
Influence on ecomony-the land expropriation has small influence on production of
enterprises; production of 85% enterprises will be affected in resettlement period (1--2
monthes). The expropriation of cultivable land reduces productivity of crops, this
consequently reduces revenue about 3.775 million Yuan per year, according to planning,
538 agricultural population need production rearrangement, which maybe reagreement
of agricultural production and improvement of per unit area yield of existing land.
Population in settlement area--since the project is placed in adjacent area of local


                                               5

village, these villages are not only area affected but also settlement area, therefore,
original social relationship is not interrupted, no adverse influences will bring to those
people in settlement area, to the contrary, the compensation for the project will improve
infrastructure construction in settlement area, this will benefit people staied in
settlement area. See table 1-1 for fixed assets and population in covered area, see table
1-2 for influence of land expropriation and resettlement on area covered in the project.


1.4 Laws and policies frame resettlement.
The flood prevention and reinforcement of Changjiang River Huanggang backwater
dike and resettlement plan is established based on current law of the People's Republic
of China, and also meet requirements of constrained resettlement policy and OP-BP4.12
of world bank. Main references are as follows
Involuntary resettlement policy and procedures of world bank, OP/BP4.12
Flood control act of the People's Republic of China (1997);
Water laws of the People's Republic of China (2002);
Land management law of the People's Republic of China (1999);
Code for compensation for land expropriation and resettlement in large-medium scale
water conservancy and hydropower construciton (2006);
Design specification of land expropriation and resettlement in water conservancy and
hydropower construction (SL290-2003);
City planning law of the People's Republic of China (1989);
GB50188-93 Standard of village and town planning (1994);
Implementation regulation for land management law of the People's Republic of China
(1999);
Implementaqtion measures of land management of Hubei Province (1999);
Notice of further reinforce management of land expropriation and practical protection
of legal rights and interests of peasants whose land is to be expropriated, Hubei
government. (EZF [2005] No. 11).
Rules above are main references of compensation to resettlers in the project of flood
prevention and reinforcement of Changjiang River Huanggang backwater dike. The
principle is: recover or upgrade living standard of resettlers, create condition for
development of resettlers after remove.
In view to actual condition of area covered in the project, based on average resettlement
cost of various houses, unit price for house compensation rangesfrom 250 Yuan /m2 to
360Yuan/m2, the interview with resettlers indicates that current standard of
compensation covers resettlement cost of house. Compensation for land is determined
based on annual yield of various types of land and multiplying factor specified in
national policies, unit price of compensation will be2000-30000 Yuan/Mu.
1.5 Implementation plan for resettlement and rebuild
Various measures for house rebulding and recovery of economy are proposed in
implementation plan of resettlement and rebuild in the project of flood prevention and
reinforcement of Changjiang River Huanggang backwater dike, this will (i)be supplied
to resettlers for selection, through providing familiar production and resettlement
measures and assistance in transition period, influence of the project on resettlers will be
reduced; (ii) be accepted by both resettlers and resident in settlement area; (iii) recover
or upgrade revenues and living standard of people under coverage of the project.
      (a)Livelihood of resettlers


                                              6

Ther are 430 households or 1622 persons lived in project area, take annual increasement
of population into account, resettlement scale for resettlers will be 411 households or
1644 persons.
According to the principle that relocate people to original village as close as possible
and wills of resettler, based on resources of arable land, increasable production and
settlement quantity and feasiability industrial development, following resettlement
measures are established
In order to reduce interruption of social and economic systems, 380 households, 1518
people or 92.3% of total resettlers will be resettled backward of the project spot nearby,
the investigation indicates that this resettlement method is applicable to all other
counties and towns, except one county, which shall be wholly removed to an adjacent
county.
The backward resettlement has small influence on social service system, the recovery
cost is within budget scope of resettlement planning. House will be built by villagers
according to relevant standard.
       (b)Production reloction
Principle of production resettlement is as follows: (i) based on land, take various
resettlement measures. (ii) fully use local resources to avoid adverse affect on
environment.
Production resettlement population will be 538 persons, people resettled on the back of
project spot nearby will be 412 persons, 126 persons will be relocated to adjacent
counties, 488 Mu cultivable lands will be removed. The cost will come from land
compensation and resettlement subsidies.
       (c)Temporary land occupation
Land temporarily occupied will be 4396.25. Loss compensation will cover two-year
yield and cost for recover plowing in cultivable land in dike area.
       (d)Recovery of special facilities, enterprises and institutions
The compensation shall be implemented based on the principle of recovering original
production standard, function and scale, compensation for special facilities will be 8,
983.8 thousands Yuan, compensation for working time of enterprises and institutions
will be 3,326.3 thousands Yuan, the speical authorities and enterprises and institutions
affected will rebuild facilities by themselves.


1.6 Budget estimation of compensation

According to feasibility research of this project, total static investment will be 422.36
million Yuan, of which 24 million US$ (approximate 187.20 million Yuan) are loaned
from World Bank, Hubei government supplies 235.16 million Yuan.
The calculation indicated that compensation for resettlers and land expropriation will be
87.997 million Yuan, of which basic compensation will be 66,054.5 thousands Yuan for
land compensation, resettlement subsidies, house move, infrastructure construction,
facility move of enterprises and organizations, infrastructure construction and rebuild of
special projectother costs for surveying and designing (3%), execution and
management(3%)and supervision and assessment (1.5%)will be 4,954.1 thousands
Yuanbasic budgetary reserves (15%)will be 10,651.3 thousands Yuantax and charges
for cultivable land reclamation, recovery of woods vegetation will be 6, 337.1 thousands

  2 Project background

2.1 Introduction of the project area

2.1.1 Natural condition
Jushui River, Bahe River, Xishui River, Qishui River originated from the south foot of
Dabie Mu ntains flow to Changjiang River at Tuanfeng town, Bahe town, Lanxi town
and Qizhou town respectively. The flow direction of each branch is basically from north
to south, the distance between adjacent branches is 20~30km. There are Sanhekou,
Fuqiaohe, Mingshan, Weidoushan and Daohuanhe etc 5 large scale water reservoirs
connected in parallel on the main stream and branch of Jushui River, there are
Zhangjiazui and Bailianhe two large scale water reservoirs connected in series on the
main stream of Xishui River, Datong and Huayuan two large scale water reservoirs are
built on the branch of Qushui River.
The protected area consists of the dike of main stream of Changjiang River and dike
of backwater part; this protected area is divided into 4 pieces: Huangzhou, Beiyong,
Maoshan, Chidong. There are mainly hills in the protected area, the river width of each
branch is generally 200~300m, flood land is developed. The topography is inclination
from northeast to southwest, the ground elevation is generally 13~20m.
The river basin of backwater dike along Changjiang River in Huanggang belongs to
subtropical zone monsoon climate, which features warm weather, abundant precipitation,
sufficient sunlight, rich quantity of heat, clear four seasons, and long frost-free period.
The mean annual air temperature is 16~17 , the extreme lowest air temperature for past
years is -15 , the extreme highest air temperature is 41 , the frost-free period is about
240~270 days, the mean annual sunshine time is about 2000 hours, the mean annual
quantities of rainfall are respectively 1267mm, 1377mm and 1339mm.
Affected by the change of monsoon climate, the rainfalls of each river basin are
unevenly distributed in one year; rainfalls are concentrated between May to July, which
features concentrated quantity of rainfall, extensive rain surface, high rainfall intensity,
long duration of once rainfall. The rain storm weather system is mainly vortex, plum
rains peak and typhoon.
The flood for the main stream and branch of Changjiang River within the boundaries
of Huanggang is formed by rain storm; it features large flow rate, high water level, and
long duration etc.

2.1.2 Population and economic position
According to the statistics by the year book of year 2006 of Huanggang City, the total
population of Tuanfeng, Huangzhou, Xishui 4 county districts is 2.7429 million persons,
among which the rural population is 2.1373 million persons that occupy 63% of the
total population; the total household number is 813.7 thousand, among which rural
household number is 515.3 thousand that occupy 63% of the total household number;
there are average 4 persons in a rural family, the annual income per head of rural
population is 2618 Yuan, the annual disposable income per head of town dweller is 6138
Yuan.

Changjiang River protect the 758 thousand mu cultivable lands and 1.344 million
population in Huanggang City; within the protected area, there are Huangzhou that is
the government location of Huanggang City, Tuanfeng, Xishui, Quchun etc county seat,
Nanhu, Lanxi, Sanhua, Qizhou, Bahe etc key business towns. The transportation in the
area is developed; the transportation by land and water forms network, the
Shanghai-Chengdu express highway, 106, 318 etc major national highways, and
Beijing-Kowloon Railway run through the protected area. The land of the protected area
is fertile; it is an important production base of grain and cotton, which occupies extreme
important position at east Hubei province.

2.1.3 Flood disaster
Huanggang stem dikeof Changjiang River is located between Hankou and Hukou;
during flood season, it connects to water catchment of Chuanshui River, Hanjiang River,
and The Dongting Lake at upstream, and bears the uplift of discharge flow of Poyang
Lake at downstream. The water level of Changjiang River features fast rising
amplitude, slow flood discharge, and long duration of high water level. Effected by the
uplift of flood water of Changjiang River , the durations of corresponding high water
level of Jushui River, Bahe River, Xishui River, Qishui River are long; the rainfall of
each branch is concentrated with high intensity, the duration of once rainfall is long,
even when the water level of Changjiang River is lower, the water level of branch may
be still higher, which result in continuous dangerous condition during flood season.
In 1996, the dangerous condition of dike failure occurred at the permanent branch dike.
In 1998, the second major flood of whole Changjiang River Basin in the 20th century
occurred, altogether 200 places of dangerous conditions occurred at Changjiang River
Huanggang backwater dike (not including Zhangsun dike, the same below), among
which there were 92 places of major dangerous conditions, Beiyong branch dike had
dike failure with length near 100m.

2.2 About the project
2.2.1 The necessity for the construction of the project
During the flood season of 1998, there were 8 times of flood peaks successively
appeared at the upstream of Changjiang River, and these flood peaks met with the flood
of middle-lower stream, and formed the second major flood of whole Changjiang River
basin since 1954. There were continuous all classes of dangerous conditions at
Backwater dike along Changjiang River in Huanggang , and we had paid out huge
cost for the flood fighting.
During 1998 to 2004, overall danger eliminating and reinforcement project was finished
for stem dike along Changjiang River in Huanggang; the danger of flood for the safety
of the stem dike was relatively completely solved. But the flood control project system
of the protected area consists of dike of stem dike and branch dike, because the hidden
flood dangers of branch dike are not solved, the protected area still confronts flinty the
danger of flood disaster.
In order to improve the flood control standard of Huanggang district, ensure the safety
of people's life and property in the protected area, facilitate local economy to develop
continuously and stably, perfect the flood control engineering system of this district,
reduce the danger of flood, it is extreme necessary to carry out danger eliminating and
reinforcement to the backwater dike along Changjiang River in Huanggang .

2.2.4 The measures to reduce resettlements
The heightening and thickening of dike body, fill inside and outside platforms, seepage
control treatment of dike foundation are the main reasons of resettlements for the danger
eliminating and reinforcement project of dike. Through technical and economical
rationality research and optimum design, in the case of not affecting the flood control
capability of dike, the following measures are taken to reduce resettlements of this


                                             17

project.
     (a)In population concentrated area, when heightening and thickening of dike
body are carried out, compare between several schemes and choose the optimum
scheme to reduce engineering occupation of land and relocation of resettlements result
from the heightening and thickening of dike body. Such as, at the aspects of selecting
heightening and thickening methods and dike lines, we compare the outside
reinforcement and inside reinforcement, and carry out optimization section by section
for dike line and mainly use the scheme of outside reinforcement;
     (b)The general method of seepage control measure for dike foundation is "Take
suppression as main measure, combine Suppression with Dredge to control flood",
according to the detailed geologic condition of dike section, if the dike foundation has
shallow sand layer, take the measure of controlling the elevation of platform according
to the vertical height of dike body, so as to reduce resettlements result from the
occupation of land by seepage blanket and cover weight of rear dike.

3 Project influence

3.1 Overview
The necessity of project construction and great benefit of flood control and disaster
reduction are indicated above, this chapter mainly discusses the loss result from the
project construction and potential negative effect. This is also one of the key points of
this report.
InAugust 2005, the Construction Management Office for Flood Prevention and
Reinforcement for Changjiang River Huanggang Backwater Dike jointly with
Changjiang River Water resources Commission, Changjiang River Institute of
Survey, Planning, Design and Research, under the cooperation of relative local
departments, carry out overall investigation on the real object index of effected land
expropriation and relocation of residents, the result shows that, the influence of the
project involves 4 counties and districts of Huanggang city, and Xinzhou district at the
juncture between Wuhan city and Tuanfeng county (small amount of land of 1 village),
8 townships, towns (farms), 33 administrative villages, the affected population is 430
households (1622 persons).
The influence of the project is linear and local, the influence on local social economy is
small, but resettlements will be affected by house relocation and life arrangement, the
amount of rural cultivable land will be reduced, corrective measures must be taken at
economy.

3.2 Investigation process
InAugust 2005, the Construction Management Office for Flood Prevention and
Reinforcement for Changjiang River Huanggang Backwater Dike cooperate jointly
with staffs of Changjiang River Water resources Commission, Changjiang River
Institute of Survey, Planning, Design and Research, under the cooperation of
Huangzhou district water conservancy bureau, Huangzhou dike management section,
Tuanfeng county dike management section, Qichun county dike management section,
Xishui county dike management section, according to the engineering design (floor plan
and construction plan) scheme, carry out investigation on the real object index within
the land occupation range of Tuanfeng county, Qichun county, Xishui county and
Huangzhou district involved in the project by using 1:5000 topographic map.

3.3 Investigation content and method
The investigation content for rural district includes population, house and accessory
structure, land. Special items include road, transmission line, communication lines etc.
The real object index is divided into permanent, temporary, inside dike, outside dike
according to the property of land occupation; the detailed investigation method is as
follow:
     (1)Population: take habitation at the land occupation district of the project and
household registration book issued by the public security department as standard, carry
out investigation according to village, citizen, and unit, the registered permanent
residence is classified as peasant population and non agricultural population.
     (2)House: houses are classified as village, citizen, unit, enterprise, measure the
building area on the spot.



                                             23

     (3)Land: the investigator will carry out field investigation by using 1:5000
topographic map, measure and calculate area according to land class and patch, carry
out statistics according to the sorting.
     (4)Special items: road, transmission and substation, communication, water supply
etc, carry out investigation and registration on site.


3.3.1 Population investigation
     The population investigation takes household registration book and the location of
the main house as standard, the population lived in the main house that is required to be
relocated within the range of permanent land occupation is taken as resettlement
population of this project. Population registration is carried out by taking household as
unit according to the sorting of peasant population and non agricultural population, the
household number takes the household registration book issued by local public security
organ as standard. In the investigated population, the children born outside birth-control
plan who are not registered, targeted-area recruited student who return to his ancestral
home after graduate and his registered permanent residence has been temporarily
transferred out, compulsory serviceman, criminals undergoing reform through labor and
persons undergoing rehabilitation through labor, these persons can be registered along
with the householder after the certification issued by countryside town government is
obtained, and make remarks in the remarks column.
Other persons without registered permanent residence other than these are not
accounted as resettlement population all and singular, if his house property is located at
the land occupation area, only the house property is registered.

3.3.2 Investigation on house and accessory structure
The investigation on house includes public housing of the village, house of enterprise or
institution, and private housing of resident. Houses are measured according to usage and
structure one by one, and calculated according to the building area. The accessory
structures are accounted by square meter or places (number).
3.3.2.1 Sorting of houses
     The houses of resident are divided into 3 kinds: main house (including one-story
house and storied house), minor house, and sundries room according to their usage.
     (a)Main house refers to dwelling house and living room etc inside the gable wall;
     (b)Minor house refers to newly built house outside the gable wall or newly built
house by using penthouse.
     (c)Sundries room mainly refers to toilet, tool house, girth rail for pig, cattle, sheep,
chicken, duck etc livestock and poultry, the bottom layer of suspended wooden building
and housing other than above 2 kinds.
According to the material of load bearing element, the building construction is divided
into 3 kinds: frame construction, brick-concrete structure, half timber construction.
     (a)Frame construction: reinforced concrete poured bearing beam and column,
reinforced concrete floor slab or roof covering.
     (b)Brick-concrete structure: brick or stone body of wall, reinforced concrete floor
slab or roof covering.
     (c)Half timber construction: brick or stone body of wall, tiled roof or thatched roof.

3.3.2.2 Accessory structure
It includes brick (stone) enclosing wall, concrete drying yard, water well, water pool,


                                             24

basement, biomass pool, manure pool, bondless stock barn, general kitchen range,
energy saving kitchen range, sepulture and other temporary buildings.Among which,
enclosing walls are calculated by facade area, concrete drying yard is calculated by
plane area of square meter, water pool is calculated by cubic meter, others are calculated
by number of places.

3.3.3 Land survey
The investigator will carry out field survey with topographic map at scale of 1:5000,
measure and calculate area according to land class and patch, carry out statistics
according to the sorting.

3.3.3.1 Sorting of land
Land is classified as state-owned and collective owned according to proprietary rights, it
is classified as 3 major kinds: agricultural land, land used for building, unused land
according to its usage, land investigation takes administrative village as unit, takes
horizontally-projected area as standard all and singular, and calculate by using standard
mu (1 mu = 667m2).
Agricultural land is classified as 5 kinds: cultivable land (including less than 2.0m ditch,
channel, road, border dike ), garden plot, forest land, grassland and other use of land.
Land used for building refers to rural population house sites, traffic use of land, special
use of land etc, unused land refers to land and water area other than agricultural land
and land used for building.
For sporadic fruit trees and forest, carry out field investigation on the physical quantity
within the land occupation of dike by taking village as unit.

3.3.3.2 The calculation for the area of land expropriation
     (a)According to the dike reinforcement measures, calculate the floor area
(including management use of land) of dike after reached the standards, and initially
determine the composition of land kinds according to 1:5000 topographic map.
     (b)According to survey data, calculate the floor area (including management use of
land) of present status dike that the land right has been confirmed.
     (c)Land expropriation area = the floor area of dike after reached the standardsthe
floor area of present status dike
     (d)Use topographic map to verify on site all classes of land kinds, village
borderline, and account all classes of land expropriation by using administrative village
as unit.

3.3.4 Investigation on enterprises or institutions
For enterprise or institution units involved in the land occupation of dike, investigate the
fundamental state of the unit and the occupation condition within the land occupation
range of dike. The investigation of real object index includes the occupied area of the
unit, the name of workshop or building, building structure and area, location site,
department in charge, economic nature, date of establishing the factory, start up date,
original value of fixed assets, net value of fixed assets, operating status (annual yield of
main products, annual output value, main market of product, sources of raw material
and fuel, dependence relationship with outplant cooperation), resident population in the
plant area.



                                              25

3.3.5 Investigation on special facilities
The investigation on special facilities includes: transmission and substation,
communication, and all classes of pipes etc.

3.3.5.1 Transmission and substation
Investigate and ascertain the membership of transmission line, voltage class, the
specification of electric pole and cable and the length of line within the range of land
occupation. Investigate substation on its transformation grade, capacity and transformer
facilities and equipments.

3.3.5.2 Communication
Investigate and ascertain the name of line, grade, specification, membership, start and
end site and the length of pole road (only investigate the length of trunk line for local
telephone line) within the range of land occupation. Investigate post office on the
capacity of switchboard, the amount of equipments and facilities.

3.3.5.3 Broadcast television
The broadcast television line should be investigated according to 2 levels: from county
to township (town) and from township (town) to village, no investigation will be carried
out for level below village. Investigate and ascertain the name of line, start and end site,
membership, date of built, land occupied site, length of land occupied, and technical
indicators of the line (pole material and length, specification of line).

3.3.5.4 All classes of pipes
These pipes include gas pipes, oil pipes, and water pipes. Investigate and ascertain the
class and name of pipe lines, membership, pipe diameter, material, transmitting capacity,
start and end site, length of pipe line and quantity of facility within the range of land
occupation.

3.4 Affected population
The population that is required to be relocated result from the present status of land
expropriation of the project sum to 430 households, 1622 persons, among which the
peasant population is 430 households, 1619 persons, which takes proportion of 99.8%
(see table 3-1 for detail). The population required to carry out production arrangement
as a result of land expropriation sum to 507 persons.
The reinforcement project of Huanggang dike of backwater involved in this project is
distributed on the dike line of up to 57.392km, the effect of land expropriation and
relocation is scattered, which appears linear and local, in relation to the whole project
area, the proportion of cultivable land expropriation is small, the influence on the
production of industry and agriculture, people's life and social economic development is
small.
In the 33 effected villages, only 4% peasant population is required to be immigrated,
about 1.3% cultivable land will be occupied. Rural resettlements will be relocated at
current village or adjacent village, most new addresses are within 1km, the influence on
social and production system is reduced to minimum degree.
There is no concentrated place of residence for minority in the land expropriation area,
individual minority person may marry the Han nationality person, and is integrated into
the culture of the Han nationality, they will not be regarded as weak population as a


                                             26

result of ethnic, they are also not local aborigine, so OD4.20--aborigine population
does not apply to this project.
The weak population is mainly elder household, disabled major labor household and no
male labor household, which sum to 66 persons that occupy 4% of the total
resettlements. These families are largely affected by the relocation of the project, their
difficulties at building house after removing are larger, their compensation of house
building should be appropriately increased at arrangement (see table 4-5).

simple buildings, and 2000 scattered fruit trees.
The real object indexes for the removing of rural houses and houses for companies for
land occupation by the project are shown in table 3--4.

3.5.3 Special facilities
As a whole, the influence on special facilities is small. The affected special facilities are
mainly road and all classes of lines.Among which tractor plowing road of 9.6km, 10kv
transmission line of 12.1km, communication line of 25.6km, cable television of 21.6 km,
pumping station installation of 2880kw etc are required to be removed or restored. The
real object index for special facility is shown in table 3--5.

3.5.4 Cultural property
In the investigation of real object index, no important cultural relics or historic site is
found to be removed.

3.6 Effect economy
Through estimation, affected by land expropriation, 308.5 mu cultivable land will be
reduced in the project area, the annual reduction of output of grain 118 tons. It is
planned that the mode of production for altogether 538 peasant populations is required
to be adjusted.As a whole, the loss of cultivable land result from the project is not large.
Through dispensing land, reforming middle-low yielded cultivated land, popularizing
agricultural production technology, supporting village-run enterprise and tertiary
industry etc measures, the added value of farm product can be improved, and their
opportunities to earn a living can be solved, so that the economic loss result from the
reduction of cultivable land can be compensated.
There are 17 enterprises affected by the project, most of them are middle and small
businesses, and most of them are locally affected, the influence on production use of
house and land is not large, they should be relocated backwards nearby and the loss


                                             29

result from stop production should be considered. For few enterprises that are required
to be totally removed, carry out compensation for the rebuilding according to original
function and original scale, the original employment number will not be reduced, but
the loss of stop production result from removing and rebuilding must be compensated.

3.7 Influence on population of settlement area
As the rural settlement area is located at current village, as parts of their cultivable lands
are also occupied, the residential resettlements of the settlement area are also subject to
economic impact; the economy can be recovered through land development, which will
also benefit the whole community.
For resettlements moved to adjacent village, through interview investigation, most (92%)
residents support the construction of this project, and also support relocate resettlements
from other village to their village, they think that the relocation of resettlements can
bring promotion to local economy, and the condition of local infrastructure will also be
improved. Only 8% residents represent certain ideas to the relocation of external
resettlements, their main concern is that: whether external resettlements will have
influence on current benefit of local residents.

3.8 Farmer whose land has been expropriated for the
project and project effect
In the 33 affected villages of this project, less than 2% peasant population is required to
be immigrated, about 1.3% cultivable land will be occupied. Except for individual
villages, the project effect is mainly linear and local, the influence of land expropriation
and relocation is scattered, in relation to the whole project area, the proportion of
cultivable land expropriation is small, the adverse effects to local production of industry
and agriculture, people's life and social economic development are small.
Through questionnaire investigation to the village farmers involved in the project, most
of these potentialfarmer whose land has been expropriated for the projects (90%)
understand and support the construction of this project. 25% farmers think that the land
expropriation for the construction of this project will have influence on their incomes;
75% farmers think that there will not be large influence. Thefarmer whose land has been
expropriated for the projects agree with the proposed production arrangement measures
(adjusting cultivable land, reform middle-low yielded cultivated land, livestock
breeding developing etc), they think that these measures are reasonable and feasible,
85% of farmers think that their incomes can be restored or improved. 60% farmers
express that after the land is reduced, they will take other measures to increase their
incomes, including develop secondary industry and tertiary industry, stay away to do
salary work etc methods. The problem that these farmers (55%) mostly care is that
whether the capital of production arrangement for this project can be fully funded, the
problem in the next place that these farmers (30%) care is the method of production
arrangement is reasonable and reliable.

3.9 Women and project effect
The women status for the location of this project appears typical property of China
village. Women can basically attend social economic activity equally as the same as
men, most women who select to remain inhouseholds to take care of family and manage
farm work are voluntary, they insist the principle of men first at employment


                                              30

opportunities.At political affairs, the political position of women in the project affected
area is gradually improved, the proportion of woman cadre, women's consciousness of
political participation, women's consciousness of entitlement and the consciousness of
participating social activity etc are gradually strengthened.At the position of education,
women can basically obtain equal educational opportunities as the same as men. For
marriage, woman mainly adopts free courtship and introduction, the elder member of
the family no longer carries out arranged marriage.
The influences of project construction on women are mainly materialized at the
following aspects: for economy, the project construction requires occupying land, the
reduction of land will reduce the contribution of woman to the income of domestic
sideline production, and some women (25%) express that project construction will bring
them the opportunities of non-agricultural economic activity. For politics, the woman's
consciousness of entitlement wakes up further, the consciousness of participation is
further strengthened, they pay more attention to social public affairs, the effects of
project construction are mainly positive. There is no negative effect of project
construction to the education position and marriage position of woman.

3.10 Weak population and project effect
There is no concentrated place of residence for minority in the range of the project area,
individual minority person may marry the Han nationality person, and is integrated into
the culture of the Han nationality, they will not be regarded as weak population as a
result of ethnic, and they are also not local aborigine.
The weak population involved in this project is mainly elder household, disabled major
labor household and no male labor household, which sum to 66 persons that occupy 4%
of the total resettlements. During the process of resettlement arrangement, we should
consider the property of social economic living of weak population, try to avoid
decreasing the life level of these weak population result from land expropriation and
relocation, at the same time, give certain supports to them at policy and compensation, it
is proposed to give 5000 Yuan additional allowance to each household of weak
population.

4.1 Policy regulations
4.1.1 Procedures of the World Bank BP4.12
        Preparing a plan for resettlementis an essential part of preparations of assistant
project of the World Bank. During appraisal period of the Project, Project team (TT)
will determine possible involuntary migration arising from the project. In the whole
process, the Project team shall take counsel with Local Social Development Department
and Legal Executive Governor (LEG), and also shall consult with resettlement
committee of theresettler if necessary.
        According to operation policy OP4.12, the Debtorshall deliver
resettlementprogram and reports of resettlementpolicy frame or requiredresettler
procedure frame as one of the conditions for project assessment (see section 17--31 of
Operation Policy OP4.12 for details).
        Once the Debtor officially delivers the resettlement document to the World Bank,
 employees of the World Bank including local experts of resettlement and lawyers will
 conduct examination to determine whether the report provides actual and detail basic
 data for project assessment or not, in addition, related conclusion will be notified to
 local administrative department. Once the director general of the State approves the
 assessment, the Project team shall deliver the resettlement document to public
 information center of the World Bank. The project team shall prepare English
 execution summery report on the basis of the report, and then deliver it to Secretariat
 of the Directorate attached with transferred report statement to determine that the
 report and its summery report may vary during assessment.
        In implementation of the Project, the project manager shall supervise and
examine implementation of resettlement and ensure that necessary participation of
experts in society, finance, law and technology in examination. It shall focus on
supervising whether implementations of examination project and resettlementare carried
out according to legal documents, including project implementation planning and
resettlementdocument. If there is any deviation between the examination and the
original agreement, the Project team shall discuss with the Debtorand report to local
administrative department for correction. The Project team shall regularly review
internal supervision report of the project, and also the external supervision report as
proper to ensure problems and suggestions found out can be absorbed and accepted in
implementation of the project. In order to avoid possible problems during
implementation ofresettler settlement, the Project team shall review the preparation and
implementation of the resettlementplan in the early period of the Project, discuss with
the Debtoron the basis thereof, and modify related resettlementdocument if necessary to
realize the objective of the policy.

Compensation mode, scope, applicable standards and other measures for reducing
influence of the project have been listed in Table 4-5.

4.2.1 Land compensation and relocation subsidy
4.2.1.1 Land compensation
     (a) Main crops and output value per mu
Main crops in expropriation area are rice, wheat, beans and potatoes, main economic
crops are cotton and oil plants (including rape, peanut and sesame) and vegetables.
Because the expropriation land covers a wide area, natural conditions of each places are
different, cultivation system and plant proportion are also different.As for unit price
calculation for permanent land expropriation, land output value shall be calculated by
counties according to the original Rules on Land expropriation, Compensation and
Arrangement ofresettler for Construction of Large and Medium-size Hydraulic and
Water Power Engineering, and it shall respectively calculate average annual output
value of irrigated land and non-irrigated land taking crop, cotton and oil as main outputs
based on local cultivation output and crop rotation system. See Table 4-2-(1-4) for
output value per mu of cultivated land.
According to calculation results, annual output value per mu of irrigated land is shown
as follows: Tuanfeng 1346yuan/mu, Huangzhou 1525yuan/mu, Xishui 1376yuan/mu,
Qichun 1265yuan/mu; annual output value per mu of non-irrigated land is shown as
follows: Tuanfeng 1313yuan/mu, Huangzhou 1297yuan/mu, Xishui 1319yuan/mu,
Qichun 1142yuan/mu.
Vegetable plot shall be calculated 1.5 times of the non-irrigated land.
Output value of fish pound per mu: Tuanfeng 1481yuan/mu, Huangzhou 1678yuan/mu,
Xishui 1514yuan/mu and Qichun1392yuan/mu.
    (b) Compensation standards
Compensation standards of irrigated land, non-irrigated land and fish pound shall be
calculated by the unit prices 16 times annual average output value per mu, i.e.
compensation unit prices of irrigated land are shown as follows: Tuanfeng 21536yuan/m,
Huangzhou 24400yuan/mu, Xishui 22016yuan/mu and Qichun20240yuan/mu;
compensation unit prices of non-irrigated land are shown as follows: Tuanfeng


                                             52

21008yuan/mu, Huangzhou 20752yuan/mu, Xishui 21104yuan/mu, Qichun
18272yuan/mu. Compensation unit prices of fish pound are shown as follows: Tuanfeng
23696yuan/mu, Huangzhou 26848yuan/mu, Xishui 24224yuan/mu,
Qichun22272yuan/mu.
Unit prices of all lands mainly refers to "Initial design report of Flood Prevention and
Reinforcement for Changjiang River Huanggang Backwater Dike " , see Table 4-4 for
details.
Vegetable plot shall be 1.5 times of non-irrigated land, woodland shall be 5000yuan/mu,
grass land 3000yuan/mu and others 2000yuan/mu.
As for cultivated land outside the bank, it shall be compensated as cultivated land inside
the bank if there is summer dike.
Permanent land occupancy: It shall be compensated as unit price of land inside the bank,
green crop fees shall be separately calculated; only green crop fees shall be
compensated outside the bank.
Temporary (Borrow pit, construction camp and road) occupancy of cultivated land: it
shall be compensated based on output value in construction period (two years) inside
the bank (including green crop fee), reclaim fee shall be added separately; green crop
fees shall only be compensated outside the bank.
Reclaim fee: borrow pit shall be calculated based on 2000yuan/mu of cultivated land;
construction camp and road shall be 500yuan/mu.
Green crop fee: 600yuan/mu for irrigated land, 500yuan/mu for non-irrigated land,
545yuan/mu for vegetable plot and fish pound 660yuan/mu.
Pond filling for foundation reinforcement: because water surface is changed into
non-irrigated land, land type is changing, so compensation unit price is the balance of
that of the pond and the non-irrigated land, green crop fee and reclaim fee shall be
added separately.
Reclaim fee of cultivated land: it shall be 13000yuan/mu based on Implementation
Methods of Land Administration of Hubei Province.
Recovery fee of forest vegetation: in accordance with Forestry Law of the Peoples
Republic of China, Regulations for the Implementation of Forestry Law of the Peoples

5.4 Production settlement planning
5.4.1 Scope of production settlement
Permanently-occupied cultivated land in dam is involved to five counties such as
Qichun, Xishui, Huangzhou, Tuanfeng, Xinzhou, eight towns and 25 villages. 2006's
statistical document shows that there are 34008 agricultural population in 25 villages,
total cultivated land area is 28370 mu and permanently-occupied cultivated land area in
dam is 377.4 mu.
For loss of productive materials caused by permanent occupation of the project the
following formula is used to calculate population for production settlement: Population
for production settlement = Permanently-occupied cultivated land in dam/cultivated
land per capita for country (town) related to occupation
Planned population of production settlement = population of production settlement
(1+7)2
Growth rate of population 7, two years'construction period, n=2
507 calculated population of production settlement
538 planned population of production settlement.
See Table 5-3 for details.


5.4.2 Planning principle
Most of villages along the dam are abundant in land resources.Agricultural settlement
is planned according to the actual situation and the local condition. Land resource is
regarded as basis with main dependence on plant production and livestock breeding
(fresh water breeding). The local settlement is planned in the current group, village and
town as much as possible.

5.4.3 Standard of production settlement
2006's statistical document shows cultivated land area per capita (cultivated land and
pound, as the below) is 1mu in Qichun County, 0.7 mu in Xishui County, 1-1.3mu in
Huangzhou District and 0.65 mu in Tuanfeng County.
According to the current situation in settlement area the local and near settlement is
planned within the limit of the original cultivated land area per capita. Resettlement is
performed for the area with favorable condition through different channels and methods.
See Table 5-4 for standard of production settlement

5.4.4 Plan for production settlement
For Permanently-occupied cultivated land there are 538 planned population of
production settlement including 412 population for the near settlement and 126
population moved into the adjacent town, and the cultivated land is 488mu for
adjustment. County and district will make plan as follows:
Movement from Chidong Town of Qichun County to Balihu Farm of the adjacent
country, 126 resettlers in total, 1mu/person, 126mu cultivated land for adjustment;
Scatted settlement in the country and town of Xishui County, 122 resettlers,
0.8mu/person; 94mu cultivated land for adjustment;
Settlement on the back of project site nearby Huangzhou District, 195 resettlers,
1.3mu/persion, 177 mu cultivated land for adjustment;
Settlement on the back of project site nearby Tuanfeng County, 95 resettlers,
0.65mu/person, 62mu cultivated land for adjustment

See Table 5-3 for production settlement plan.

5.4.5 Balance between land compensation fund and production settlement
investment
Article 9 in "Ordinance of Compensation of Land Expropriation and Resettlement
Planning for Middle and Large Water Conservancy and Hydropower Project
Construction" [No. 12 Reference] specifies that "the expropriated unit will use land
compensation and settlement fund to recover and develop production, arrange
employment for surplus labor and subsistence allowance for unemployed persons
caused by land expropriation, and also assign county (city) to use such fund for land
development, resettlement production and living with no peculation and
embezzlement." If land compensation fund and settlement subsidies are insufficient to
production settlement, settlement subsidies will be increased. Therefore the single
capital source for production settlement is land compensation fund and settlement
subsidies.
5.4.6 Temporary occupation
5.4.6.1 Related areas
For the project temporary occupation is 4396.25mu including 2536.20 mu for Chidong
branch dike of Qichun County, 629.30mu for Yonggu branch dike in Xishui County,
14.10mu for Yongbao branch dike, 502.25mu for Beiyong branch dike, 299.70mu for
Laocheng dike in Huangzhou District and 414.70mu for Judong branch dike in
Tuanfeng County. Loss compensation is based on two years'output value and costs are
considered for the second reclamation of cultivated land (see Table 6-1)

5.4.6.2 Capital of temporary occupation
Such capital is used for expropriation compensation. Compensation for temporary
occupation of construction team is listed into construction cost for the project.
Agreement on compensation for temporary occupation will be concluded before
utilization of capital to define his/her responsibilities.




5.4.6.3 Requirement on the second reclamation of land
During the period of project construction soil sampling is based on the design depth,
deep excavation and reconstruction for pound is approved by villagers and protection is
taken for soil course of cultivated land. Construction unit will recover the cultivated
land after service expiration. Resettlement surveillance department will supervise the
second reclamation of land, and land administration and resettlement office in county
will plan inspection and acceptance.

5.5 Relocation planning for enterprise and institution
5.5.1 Principle of planning for recovery, relocation and reconstruction
     (a)According to the principle of feasible technique and reasonable economy
confirm plan for enterprise and institution.Adopt near settlement for land expropriation
for workshop, facility, office and residential buildings except for occupied area of
workshop; if land of residential building is expropriated, use resettlement on the back of
project site nearby; If workshop is expropriated for enterprise adopt reconstruction in
the near area or different region. For enterprise which fails to abide by state industrial


                                             - 74 -

policy and environmental specification carry out shutdown, merging, transfer and
bankruptcy.
     (b) Check and verify the assets of industrial enterprise in occupied area according
to the solution plan of industrial enterprise, investigated physical indicator and theory
and method of state-owned asset assessment. Compensation investment is calculated as

there are 17 units, among which removed house is 8952.1m2, 3438m2 for mixed brick
house and 5514m2 for brick-wood house. The related enterprise and institution includes
school, village department, dike management branch, small processing factory related to
dike. Some influences are produced on land usage for production and living and facility
of enterprise and institution. Except for 4 enterprises and institutions to be completely
moved the majorities are partially influenced with no influence on the main body and
teaching.

5.5.2.2 Planning for relocation of enterprise and institution
As for linear feature of dike enforcement, resettlement on the back of project site nearby
is adopted for rural enterprise and institution to be beneficial for production continuity
of enterprise and institution and production and living of staff in enterprise and
institution. For the unit which can not use resettlement on the back of project site nearby
due to that house (workshop) are mostly removed, consideration will be taken for
compensation on the different regional settlement according to suggestion on
relocation and reconstruction. For the small unit to be completely removed the local
government will propose solution according to the local resource, market condition and
productivity level. The local government will make organization and execution on the
basis of construction procedure.

5.7 The environment protection in the settlement area
5.7.1 Domestic sewage treatment of rural resettlements
The resettlements number involved in this project is large, and they are scattered, carry
out treatment to their domestic sewage by household to reach the standards, the
domestic sewage discharge of residents should be treated by adopting anaerobic pool,
and combine with develop and utilize marsh gas, if it is not convenient to develop
marsh gas, we propose to build grid, water flush or double urn etc type toilet.
Compensate appropriately about 300 Yuan to user adopting sanitary toilet.


5.7.2 The treatment of solid waste
Village generally has no dump area, domestic wastes are piled everywhere, wastes are
easy to be washed out when heavy rain is met, and result in flowing all around and
pollute environment. Therefore, each household should select well the place to pile
waste to avoid running out, at the same time, according to the composition of rural
waste, try to turn waste, waterlogged compost the waste etc as possible.

5.7.3 The environment protection for the public infrastructure of resettlements
     (a)The residential area of resettlements should be far away from industrial and
mining enterprise, select the area at upper drift and upstream of industrial and mining
enterprise to avoid the effect of waste gas, waste water.
     (b) During the resettlement of affected residents, take full advantage of waste mu
ntain, waste hillside, try to reduce the occupation of forest land to build house or
reclaim cultivable land as possible, take the principle of less occupation of cultivable
land, try to distribute at hill and sloping field with good geologic condition, do well the
conservation of soil and water, discharge ditch should be set at the upper part of the cut
surface to lighten washout, and protect the safety of housing; the spoil of excavation
should be back filled as soon as possible to plant trees and grass to avoid soil erosion.
     (c)The matching road and drainage facility etc built for the dwelling of
resettlements should reduce the damage to land form and vegetation as possible.After
the project is completed, the cut surface, exposed cut-over land etc should be restored
by adopting tree planting and grass planting.
     (d)In the residential area, pay special attention to the construction of swinery,
bullpen etc livestock used house, the discharged waste water and domestic sewage


                                              - 77 -

should be concentrated to water pool to be treated, never allow them flow everywhere
and pollute environment.
     (e)The house arrangement residential area should be planned, so as to be
favorable to reduce land use and facilitate lighting. For domestic drinking water, try to
adopt tap water as possible to be convenient for the resettlements to use.
     (f)Some resettlements of the reservoir area are required to be removed externally,
which will effect local residents by these external resettlements. Take cooperation
measures; try to reduce the influence on the natural environment and social environment
of local place by the rebuilding of residential area as possible. During design, consider
to let local residential area obtain advantage from the rebuilding, improve their life
environment, allow the settlement area to develop healthily, and realize long period of
order and stability.
     (g)The residential area should have forestation plan, and gradually allow the forest
and grass cover rate to reach more than 30%, so that green trees are distributed at the
front and rear of house and at both the beginning and the end of the village, actively
popularize ecological courtyard. The selection of tree species should consider the like of
public, which can not only beautify environment, but also increase their incomes.




5.7.4 Health protection measures for public
     (a)During the resettlement of affected residents, strength the supervision for the
fully funding of all items of capital for resettlements, understand the living condition of
resettlements, do well the supervising work for the water quality of domestic water of
resettlements.
     (b)Hygiene and disease control measures
     Strength the propaganda and education of patriotic sanitation, mobilize large
masses of the people to develop large scale of rat destruction and mosquito destruction
activities, fill and level up channeled and depressed waterlogged zone, destroy the
vector of transmission of communicable disease at coming thing.
     Do well the health care work for the settlement area of resettlements. For
resettlements relocated backwards, select well ventilated and good lighting place, and
build matching common facilities, regularly carry out sterilization treatment, and do
well the planning and sterilization work of drinking water resource, stop the drinking of
impure water source. Carry out physical examination to the body of resettlement, and
also carry out corresponding physical examination to people at the settlement area,
strictly prevent the introduction of communicable disease resource or communicate
resettlements.
     (c)The supervision and management of epidemic situation
Complete the supervision organization of hygiene and disease control, environment
supervisor should carry out sample survey to the health of public, closely pay attention
to the health dynamic of public, and cooperate closely with relative professional

8 Public Negotiation and Social Adjustment

8.1 Favorable policies

According to relevant national rules and regulations, in order to advocate and support
resettlement for development, the state will provide compensation and subsidies to
resettler in early stage and will give supports for production in later stage", resettlers
will enjoy the following favorable policies,
(a)According to 11th Five-Year planning of social development of Hubei Province, give
priority in arrangement for those industries pertinent to industrial and agricultural
production and development, at the same time, give priority in employment for
qualified resident in settlement area and dweller;
(b) When the state transfers special funds to agriculgural production and poverty relief,
and such funds to social development in communication, posts and telecommunication,
cultural education and sanitation, resettlement area shall be prorpely appropriated to
improve living standard of resettler and develop production;
(c) In order to release burden on resettler and support resettler and resident in settlement
area, resettlers who rebuild house will enjoy exemption policy in cultivated land tax,
land use tax, real-estate tax and funds of flood control and security;
(d) Resettler who occupies woodland to rebuild house will enjoy exemption from woods
and woodland compensations.
(e) Taxes for industry, agriculture and stock in districts and countries will be adjusted
based on resettlement influence.
(f) Resettler will enjoy exemption from compensation on mineral resources used for
stone and sand quarrying and tile fabrication for building;
(g) Establish poverty relief funds used in the later stage to ensure that resettler's basic
living conditions can be maintained in special condition.
Funds for production and resettlement are used for recovering and developing
production which influences population. In order to ensure effectiveness of
compensation funds, these funds will be transferred to district resettlement office for
control. This will exert professional advantages of local government in knowledge and
will timely plan and establish feasible production system and enterprise to avoid
potential risk (inability in management, improper investment decision) incurred if
compensation funds are directly transferred to resettler. One mission of independent
resettlement supervision unit is to supervise usage of compensation funds of district
resettlement office to ensure that development plan can effectively meet demands of
resettler.

8.2 Special measures to recover living condition of residents
affected

It takes long time to recover living conditions of resident in settlement area, during the
period of which, in addition to arrangement for necessary and reasonable living and
production and training for agricultural technologies and other skills required for
resettler, it is necessary to take the following measures to recover living and production
conditions of residents affected, especially resettler, based on local actual conditions
under the guide of national and local governmental favourable policies and post-phase


                                              101

support.
(a) Each village covered in this project shall give special assistance to disabilities (such
as poverty family, women, orphan, widow and elders ), especially for house building
and purchasing. Some of resettlement funds will be specially transferred to disabilities
as compensation.
(b) In addition to capital assistance, villages will assign labours to rebuild or purchase
houses for disabilities to resettle their residence;
(c) During resettlement, all governments shall establish the complete safety security
measures, provide necessary vehicles, labours and temporary residences, assign special
safety inspector to maintain social security and traffic system, guarantee life safety and
properties of resettler to ensure smooth proceeding of resettlemen.


8.3 Adjustment in transitional period

Resettlement is a complex and long-term task with wide influences on local people.
Effective management in transition period is very important in the whole process of
resettlement. Therefore, government shall fully understand wills of resettler and
organize resettler to participate in negotiation on resettlement in planning stage.
Pertinent government shall do their best to arrange resettler with the same living
background (such as neighbours, relatives and etc) in a same place to relieve their
physiological pressure and worries in transitional period.
Resettlement planning includes subsidies for temporary residence and compensation for
loss of working time in transition period (this fund has been listed in resettlement costs).
Transfer of house compensation and allocation of house site shall be implemented at
least 3 months prior to house removal to provide enough house rebuilding time and
relieve pressure of temporary house.
Besides, in transitional period, a lot of people are unwilling to risk their living condition
on resettlement with conservative attitude toward change of living, therefore, in this
period, officers in resettlement office and village cadres shall provide guarantee for
production and living conditions of resettler in early stage after resettlement. In order to
ensure people affected smoothly get through the transitional period, the following
measures will be taken: provide critical infrastructures (such as water, power and road
and garbage treatment and etc.); provide credit; transfer partial funds from reserves to
subsidies in transitional period, provide technological services for agricultural industry,
secondary and third industries, organize training course for settlerprovide sanitations
design and workers, expand market information serviceestablish organizations joined
by resettler; organize relevant activities to improve aggressiveness and independence of
resettler and reduce difficulties encountered in transitional period.
Experience proves that even after house compensation is granted, a lot of resettlers will
live together with relatives to expect reduction of demands for building, therefore, their
houses are rebuilt gradually. It is true for resettler relocated in the local village, because
relatives or friends in the local village will provide temporary residence for such
resettler.
In transitional period, resettler can live with compensation for crops on land to be
expropriated. Since the land expropriation is often arranged after harvest time, resettler
can receive incomes from both of the compensation of land expropriation and sales
revenue of crops, constituting a part of support funds in transitional period.

8.4 Public participation and negotiation

In the planning for resettlement, villager representatives will be organized to attend the
resettlement meeting and discussion, sign the agreement through negotiation with
governmental authorities, participate in investigation for real object index and sampling
investigation for resettler, release the relevant information and collect information from
resettler and cadres for suggestions. Planning and implementation of resettlement are
described as follows. Table 8-1 lists activities developed in project area.

8.4.1 Participation of people affected and representatives
The first step: Before investigation, establish working guideline and refer to the advices
of local government for details, methods and requirements of investigation.
The second step:In general investigation period, invite leaders and resettler from
countries, village and group to take part in the investigation and explain necessity,
project benefit, influence, compensation principle and resettlement schedule and discuss
possible resettlement location. The investigation group holds village meeting (women
are also invited to attend the meeting) when they pass by each village; although it is
impossible that all villagers attend the meeting, resettlement information is effectively
publicized to all people through oral statement in the meeting.
The third step: In the period of resettlement planning, personnel from design unit will
discuss with leaders from municipal, district or village government to seek for advices,
accept requirements, find out problems and select settlement area. In addition, sampling
investigation is made to obtain detailed information on wills and attitudes of resettler.
As an important link, Handbook of resettler's right are prepared and issued to each
settled household. .
The fourth step: sign agreements with villages affected and settlement villages,
including land and property, compensation standard, location and method,
implementation date and the mutual responsibilities. If the village affected cannot
approve resettlement planning, its requirements will be considered and planning will be
made again.
The fifth step: The items in agreement with villages affected shall be agreed by resettler.
If resettler cannot accept planning, it shall be modified to solve unacceptable problems.
If all planning are approved by the resettler, the modified handbook of resettlers'right
will be issued to all families affected.
Acritical guarantee for successful implementation of resettlement plan is enthusiastic
participation in all activities. In the implementation of resettlement, people affected
shall take part in activities as follows:
House building: resettlers from rural district often build house by themselves or hire
others to build the house. Resettler can reuse materials removed from the original house
to build new house or on other purposes; they will remove the original house before the
specified date, then to deal with documents on land and house transfer.
Training: based on condition of resettlement area and wills of resettler, training courses
are provided to resettler to give support to recover and improve earning of resettler.
Complaint: It is proposed that if resettler and resident in resettlement area have any
complaints, they shall follow procedures of complaint (see section 8.6), in which
mechanism to find out and resolve problems in resettlement implementation is specified



                                              103

(see section 8.6).
The resettlers'right handbook describes the existence and treatment method of
complaints procedure.
Through training and village cadre's explanation, resettler and resident in resettlement
area will understand the importance of establishing interest team and mutual benefit
team in village (or between county and village), which may focus on social life or
production condition of settler. Besides such teams will find out problems effectively
and report them to village cardre and resettler, and participate in visit from village
commission and resettlement monitoring and assessement organ in the name of their
community.
The independent resettlement supervision and assessment unit will collect data on
change of earning and living standard of resettler after resettlement from place affected
through sampling investigation.

8.4.2 Public opinion poll

Number of samples in sampling investigation is 120 households, or 28% of total
relocated households. See report in 2.3.4.5.
8.4.3 Pertinent parties
Opinions of pertinent parties (including resettler, resident in settlement area and other
participants) are included in assessment and study for influence of project through
approval for opinions and attitude of people. Public opinions and issues on
reinforcement of Changjiang River branch dike are understood through questionnaires
and forum.
It shall be noted that most attendees state that the resettlement for resettler are their
concerned issues. Most people expect that resettlement planning and compensation shall
be complete and perfect.
The forum attended by governmental representatives, non-governmental and business
personages also reflects that issues mostly concerned by these people are complete and
perfect relocation planning and compensation. These attendees generally have high
education background, and have been working in education, health care, water
conservancy, environmental protection, business, and forestry industries, specialties
involves in industry and commercial industry, medicine, forestry, water conservancy,
law, literature, economy, news, architecture, environmental science.
These investigations indicate the importance of resettlement management from the
public and necessity fpr participation of people affected and public in resettlement
implementation and rebuilding of community affected.


8.5 Publicity of resettlement information

From commencement of the project to resettlement execution, project information and
relevant resettlement laws and regulations shall be publicized to resettler through public
participated activities (forum, discussion and other form, see table 8-1). Working
personnel of resettlement and local government shall make resettler familiar with
calculation method and compensation method for real object index and compensation
standards, resettlement measures, transfer and usage of resettlement subsidies, rights
and favourable policies granted to resettler.At the same time, local newspaper shall



                                             104

issue bulletin of removal to resettler and resettlement information to residence in
settlement area; resettlement implementation reports shall be archived in the local
library and resettlement offices, including land expropriation, land compensation
standard, fund useage and resettlement conditions. Issuance of resettler's rights
handbook will dramatically strengthen understanding of people affected for resettlement
to increase transparency of resettlement works and improve working efficiency in
resettlement.


8.6 Complaints

8.6.1 Possible complaints and resolutions
As an important national construction project, a life protection project beneficial to
people, Flood Prevention and Reinforcement for Changjiang River Huangang
Backwater Dike will protect life safety and properties of people lived in flood control
and protection area in Huanggang city, resettler are people affected and also
beneficiaries, therefore, they shall obey overall situation and support construction with
actual deeds. However, the resettlement plan is established based on the overall area
affected by the project, which makes the overall planning for settlement.Although a
wide negotiation is made with local government, resettlement control authorities,
resettler and resident in settlement area, in the process of implementation, the change of
actual condition and operation error will incur misunderstanding and complaints from
settler.According to previous resettlement experience and existing issues on water
conservancy, the major complaints of resettler are as follows:
a) Real object index for house removal
Since there are errors in investigation, statistics and calculation, item omission and
errors maybe appear in the real object index, this will damage interests of settler. In case
that this problem appears, person affected and village committee shall notify in oral or
written form this to county resettlement office, which will report this to employers and
supervision units in document. Employer will organize designers and supervisors to
make in-situ check to identify items omitted and errors in real object index,
compensation will be made in accordance with standard.
b) Standard of resettlement compensation
Since a small number of resettlers are not familiar with policies and rules of
resettlement, they complain that compensation standard is low and cannot meet
requirement of house rebuilding and production recovery. In this case, before and after
implementation of resettlement, government of all levels and resettlement offices shall
publicize national resettlement policies and rules and organize designers to make site
design disclosure to resettler to explain principle of compensation standard
establishment, to make resettler understand that compensation standard is established in
accordance with relevant national policies, rules and documents, to eliminate suspicions
of resettler.At the same time, we shall reasonably plan various facilities and associated
buildings in resettlement area to complete production and living settlement.
c) Fulfilment of funds
In the process of resettlement, many causes will result in delay of resettlement funds,
which will affect living and production schedule of resettler. Therefore site supervisors
shall properly control funds, progress and quality to ensure funds of resettlement can be
earmarked for a specific purpose, at the same time, shall coordinate with financial



                                             105

management department to transfer funds based on actual progress to ensure that
resettlement works can be implemented in accordance with schedule.
d)Arrangements of living and production
After completion of reinforcement of Changjiang River backwater dike, the
expropriation will reduce area of cultivated land per capita, which causes complaint
from some of resettlers and residents in settlement area, in this case, governments will
use land compensation and resettlement subsidies, take a series of production and
development measures, such as land reconstruction, science and technology publicity,
agricultural industry adjustment to improve yield of per unit area, to maintain economic
earning and living standard of resettler not lower than level before resettlementas for
non-agricultural resettler and those resettlers engaging in small business, processing
industry, labor service industry, the loss of original operation site may cause complaints
from these people, therefore, local government will provide proper operation and
production places and grant favourable policies in credit and tax exemption to resettler
based on their skills to ensure stabilization and development of resettler.
8.6.2 Complaint channel and procedures
Resettler has rights and obligations granted to citizens by constitutions and laws. The
exsiting law will completely ensure legal rights and interests of resettler if legal rights
and interests of settler are infringed. Resettler aggrieved can appeal to complaint office,
procuratorate, court; there are also some arbitration authorities in charge of civil suit. If
people affected are unsatisfactory with compensation, the following procedures can be
conducted:
a) Complaint channel
Provincial resettlement office has functions to supervise subordinate resettlement and
can accept and hear complaints from resettler; citizen complaint offices are established
in district, municipal and provincial governments to accept and treat complaints from
resettler;
Resettlement Supervision unit will supervise the local government to arrange resettler in
accordance with laws, and will treat complaints of resettler through audition, check and
coordination.
Independent resettlement supervision and assessment authority will implement
supervision for resettlement in accordance with relevant state rules, and maintain legal
rights and interests of resettler, and can reflect infraction of rights and interests of
resettler to the relevant departments; law violation case will be received and treated by
executive supervision, audition, discipline inspection, judicial administration and
procuratorate sectors.
b) Complaint procedures
When resettlers are unsatisfied with resettlement, they can report complaints to village
committee (resident committee), the complainant or village committee (resident
committee) will directly seek assistance from local resettlement office, or report in oral
or written form to the superior resettlement office, and then record the complaint upon
receipt of complaint, and will find out solution within 10 days together with village
committee (resident committee) and local resettlement office. If any disputes cannot be
resolved through negotiation, village committee (resident committee) can appeal to
executive government agencies (such as project office, resettlement management
authority, office accepting complaints of citizens, administrative supervision, discipline
inspection and procuratorate sectors ) level by level in accordance with Administrative
procedure law of the People's Republic of China and complaint procedures, if the



                                              106

adjudication cannot satisfy complainant, who can appeal to people's court; the
complainant can also directly appeal to people's court. The resettlement office will
record issues complained and solution process.
Although all complaints shall be recorded and archived, this issue is often omitted,
especially at village government level; the complaints are treated orally and randomly.
However, whatever types and natures of complaints, it shall be recorded in writing to
identify general trend and reinforce confidence of complainant in treatment of
complaints. This record shall be regularly submitted to district resettlement office (the
office shall also record the complaints). The independent resettlement supervision and
assessment unit will check and make comments to recorded complaints to ensure that
issues will be properly solved according to complaint procedures in time.

8.7 Relationship between resettler and resident in settlement
area

In land expropriation and resettlement of reettler, backward and scattered settlement is
adopted for most of rural resettlers, therefore, resettler will still live in a familiar
environment, the original social relationship and society guarantee system will not
change dramatically due to resettlement. In order to facilitate resettler to communicate
with resident in resettlement area, the following measures shall be taken:
(a) Participation in planning: In order to facilitate cooperation between resettler and
resident in settlement area and encourage resettler to participate in resettlement and
obtain feedbacks. During planning of the resettlement rights, interests and selectable
programs shall be introduced to resettler. The resettler can select one acceptable from
optional programs. Program can be selected through direct negotiation with resettler, or
determined by formal of informal leaders and representatives. In most cases, some
institutional arrangements will be made, such as holding regular meeting attended by
project officers and local organizations to understand opinions of resettler and resident
in the whole period of planning and implementation.
(b) Supply of sufficient resources: after resettlement, demands for land, water resources,
wood land and social service will be increased cause capital competition and hidden
conflicts. In planning of resettlement, quantity of existing resources and services shall
be assessed to check whether these resources can satisfy future demands. If insufficient,
the existing resources shall be upgraded or expanded and relevant budgets shall be
arranged (such as water, power and road supplies). In addition, garbage disposal
measures and new sanitation standard shall be optimized in esettlement area to
dramatically improve existing public health conditions.

features, so expropriation relocation and house rebuilding will be planned in the slack

season to reduce influence on agricultural production.

funds are paid to reduce influences on living environment from construction before

((c) Granting of compensation funds and distribution of homestead will be made ahead

3 months so that resetter has funds and time to complete construction of new building

and relieve influence in transition period.

(d) Infrastructures in settlement area will be planned before resettlement for rebuilding.

(e) For enterprise relocation workship is built and then relocation is made to reduce loss

of shutdown.

(f) Resettlers'production settlement will be made afte compensation for land.

(g) Resettlement progress will be related with construction progress. In order to ensure

 resettlement quality condition will be created for satisfactory commencement and

 completion



11.2 Progrss Plan


The progress plan will be made in advance according to resettlement to confirm the



                                            156

resettlement period is 10 months. Resettlement will be implemented ahead 2 months of

construction commencement, namely from the middle ten days in July of the first year

to that in May of the second year. Three steps will be adopted for the resettlement: I.
