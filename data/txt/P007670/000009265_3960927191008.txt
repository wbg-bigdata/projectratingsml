MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A WATER, WOMEN AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed loan to Banco Nacional de Obrau
y Servicios Publicos, S.N.C. (BANOBRAS) for US$20.0 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan, which would be guaranteed by
the Government of Mexico, would be repayable over 17 years, including 5
years of grace, at the Bank's variable interest rate and charges. BANOBRAS
would be the borrower and coordinating executing agency. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
2.       Background:  During the 1960s and 1970s, Mexico made important
gains in the areas of social sector development and poverty alleviation.
However, the economic crisis that started in 1982 slowed down progress in
the areas of poverty alleviation and social sector development and since
1983, wage-earners, mainly urban poor, have lost about 202 of their share
in GDP. Unskilled workers have suffered a larger drop in employment than
skilled workers. In rural areas, where income levels are the lowest, there
is evidence that substantial deterioration in absolute terms occurred. To
alleviate the rising cost of adjustment and to help eradicate poverty, the
Administration that took office in December 1988 is committed to redesign
and expand ongoing social investments in the public sector. In focussing
its strategy on alleviating conditions of extreme poverty and increasing
the well-being and productivity of the poorest segments of the population,
the Mexican Government is showing a growing awareness of the role of women.
3.       Several reasons exist for this new emphasis on women.  First, the
Government is responding to a greater world awareness of the equity issues
relating to the role of women. Second, there is evidence that women make
up the majority of the Mexico's poor. Also, rapid population growth has
prompted increased interest in the relationship between birth rates and
such inter-related factors as women's education, contribution to family
income and participation in the decision-making process at home. As a
result of male emigration to more attractive employment areas in Mexico
City or the United States, an increasing number of households within the
lowest income groups are headed by women. These women, limited by their
education and their household and maternal responsibilities, often lack
training, mobility and flexibility to compete with men for new jobs. They
tend to be concentrated in low productivity jobs that require relatively
little training. Low skills, low productivity, and low wages reinforce
each other to keep women at the bottom of the economic scale.
4.       Many efforts to improve women's status have been hampered by a
failure to recognize that they place competing demands on women's time and
energy. Such is the case of programs designed to generate female
employment without considering the limited amount of time and energy that
women can devote to the labor market after completing their domestic



chores, which in many areas of rural Mexico include a substantial amount of
time devoted to fetching water. In addition to the health implications of
inadequate water supplies, the depletion of women's energy and time from
carrying out water related household activities reduces their capacity for
other responsibilities. Thus, increased level of water services, for
instance through yard-taps, would not only improve well being but would
also set the stage for improving productivity of women.
5.       Mexico has set ambitious goals for extending the coverage of water
supply and sanitation services to its inhabitants. In 1980, about 70? of
the population had access to a piped system and 491 had access to a
sewerage system. This ranked Mexico's water sector bq the sixth most
developed in Latin America. However, the level of coverage has not
increased since 1980. Because of financial constraints, the need exists to
concentrate on low-cost technologies and staged approaches to the provision
of water and sanitation services. This will facilitate the implementation
of affordable cost-recovery schemes. On the institutional front, the
Government is committed to foster improvements in efficiency, which
requires strengthening State Water Agencies (SWAs) by encouraging small
municipalities to delegate the operation and maintenance of their systems
to the SWAs and developing SWA's capabilities for planning, design and
maintenance.
6.       To address the most pressing issues affecting the well being of
the poorest member of the society, the Government launched the Programa
Nacional de Solidaridad (PRONASOL). PRONASOL, which is under the
responsibility of a Committee headed by the President, has the objective of
ensuring that those projects effectively targeted to the poor will have
first priority in the allocation of budgetary resources. Priority is given
to community participation projects aiming at providing water and
sanitation as well as increasing income and improving health conditions.
In the water sector, more specifically, Government's efforts in expanding
water and sanitation services to the poor will be based on a policy that
would reduce reliance on budgetary appropriations by promoting an increase
in the self-financing of the SWAs. The Government of Mexico and of the
states of Queretaro, Michoacan and Hidalgo have agreed to a project which
would apply this strateg7 in a comprehensive manner, bringing controlled
amounts of water to yard taps, and training women in income-generating
activities as well as providing health education to the communities.
7.       Rationale for Bank Involvement:  The thrust of the Bank's lending
strategy for Mexico is to assist the Government in stabilizing and
restructuring the economy to obtain sustained growth, and to alleviate the
cost posed by the adjustment process on the poorest segments of the
population. To implement this strategy, the Bank would participate in two
new projects in the water sector during the next two yearss (a) the
proposed project, and (b) a water and sanitation sector loan. The proposed
project will allow the Bank to target its benefits to groups that have
hitherto not been directly assisted by Bank lending, but which have high
priority needs. The project also provides an efficient instrument for
strengthening the capabilities of the SWAs involved, to adequately operate
and maintain the systems. As a pilot scheme the project would provide a
model which, if successful, can be replicated in other areas of the country
and make an important contribution towards improving the living conditions
of the low-income population in Mexico. The Bank is the development



-3-
institution best equipped to provide the needed multisectoral approach
essential for this project and it can draw on the experience from working
on four previous water and several rural development loans, as well as
several sector studies since 1974. The main lessons learned from these
projects point to the importance of self-sufficient water agencies.
community support, adequate designs that reflect local needs and
willingness to pay, recognizing the value of infrastructure in relieving
constraints to productive activities and ensuring tha early establishment
of an effective monitoring and evaluation system to focus project
management on project impact. These lessons have been incorporated in the
design of the proposed project.
8.       Proiect Obiectives:  The main objective of this project is to
improve the living standard of low-income population in Mexico by: (a)
providing water, sanitation and health education both to free women's labor
for more productive activities, and to reduce ccmmunity morbidity; (b)
promoting income-generating activities, primarily for women. and providing
them with the necessary training and credit to carry them out; and (c)
assisting the state Governments to strengthen the SWAs ability to design,
build, operate and maintain water and sanitation systems in low-income
areas.
9.       Project Description:  The proposed project was d signed based on
the recognition of the Importance of community participation in defining
and addressing their needs.   It would include three major components.
These are: (a) Water and Sanitation Services (71.8Z of total cost), which
comprises a line of credit for: (i) installation of community water supply
and sanitation systems in about 200 communities in rural and peri-urban
areas in the participating states; (ii) maintenance of water systems,
including procurement of equipment; and (iii) technical assistance and
training to strengthen the SWA8 and to implement a health education
program; (b) Income-Generating Activities (18.9S of total cost), which
includess (i) lines of credit to finance the investment and working capital
needed by low-income beneficiaries to start productive activities; and (ii)
technical assistance and training to the agency in charge of the promotion
of productive activities at the community level; and (c) Proiect
Preparation in other states (9.3S of total cost), which would operate as a
project preparation facility and would finance: (i) identification of
water-cum-productive projects; and (ii) preparation of subprojects in other
states as well as priority works. Technological standards for the water
and sanitation component would be tailored to the population's income. For
example, sanitation services would include construction of latrines for the
poorest segment of the population and low-cost sewerage system for a
population with higher ability to pay.
10.      The total project cost is estimated at US$28.5 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$13.0 million (46Z). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursemint, and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$1.5 million would be granted
for expenditures incurred after January 15, 1989, the date of project
appraisal. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Mexico are given in Schedule C and D respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7726-ME dated May 24, 1989, is also
attached.

ll.      Implementation Arrangements:   The borrower and implementing
agency would be BANOBRAS, which would be responsible for overall project
coordination. BANOBRAS would enter into onlending agreements with the SWAs
and with the financial intermediary (FI) in each state. Both SWAs and FIs
in the participating states have previous experience in implementing Bank
projects. The focal point of project implementation at the state level
would be the State Planning Secretariat, which would coordinate all project
related activities in the state. STWAs would be responsible for the design,
construction, operation and maintenance of the new water supply and
sanitation systems. Financing for the income-generating componerst would be
channelled through parastatal financial intermediaries.  The promotion of
productive activities, which includes provision of training to the
beneficiaries, would be carried out by FIs in Michoacan and Hidalgo and by
a state government agency, IDEAS, in Queretaro. The health education
component of the project would be implemented by state delegations of the
Secretariat of Health.
12.      Actions agreedlto be agreed upon:  During negotiations assurances
were obtained on the following,:  (a) From the Federal Government:  it shall
assign an appropriate budget for CY1990 for the Secretariat of Health to
design the Health Education Program, and shall cause its regional
delegations to implement these programs in a timely manner; (b) From
BANOBRAS to: (i) carry out the monitoring and evaluation program,
including an in-depth mid-term review, maintain a qualified staff, carry
out the selection of the communities to be benefitted following agreed
criteria; and (ii) cause each State Planning Secretariat to: (a)
coordinate project activities at state level; (b) carry out the Annual Uotk
Plan at state level in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and annually
update it and review it with the Bank; and (c) carry out the preparation of
new projects in other states; (iii) cause each SWA to: (a) each year
prepare and submit for approval by the Secretariat of Planning in its state
the annual State Water Plan, which should subsequently be sent to the Bank
for its comm6nts; (b) maintain in the communities benefitted under the
project a tariff level covering at least their operating and maintenance
costs, plus the debt service on the investment loan; (iv) cause each Fl to
approve and supervise productive activity subloans on the basis of the
agreed criteria; and (v) cause each Promotion agency to carry out promotion
at community level with the assistance of consultants and maintain the
necessary level of extension workers. For Effectiveness the following
condition must be met: BANOBRAS finalizes a financial agreement with the
Guarantor and subloan agreements with the SWAs and FIs of at least one of
the three participating states, under terms and conoitions satisfactory to
the Bank. For Disbursement in Each State each promotion agency and each
SWA should furnish to the Bank satisfactory signed contracts for its
technical assistance programs.
13.      Benefits:  The proposed project is just'fied on the basis of the
benefits accruing to low-income sectors of the population in the form of:
(i) improved water and sanitation services for about 200,000 people; and
(ii) the expected increase in income for about 5,000 households from
productive activities. A very high participation of women in these
activities is expected because project promotion and training for
feasibility studies would be initiated through water committees in the
communities, in which women &re heavilg represented. In addition, the



strengthening of SWAs is expected to result in savings to the economy due
to the rationalization of water sector investments, adoption of low-cost
technologies, and improvements in operational efficiency. Indirectly, the
impact of the project will go beyond the quantifiable benefits because ofs
(a) the health effects of improved water and sanitation; and (b) the
experience gairtd during project implementation, which may allow subsequent
replication on a larger scale.
14.      Risks2  The project is not likely to face technical risks.  There
are, however, commercial and credit ris'xs involved with the income-
generating component.  To minimize these !isks, the project includes a
substantial element of technical assistance to develop Fl's project
evaluation capabilities and their ability to mobilize the communities and
ensure their commitment to the successful implementation of the selected
activities. In addition, subloan limits and prior evaluation/approval
processea are designed to reduce these risks. An assessment of these risks
confirms that the project would remain economically viable even in the case
of 50Z of the activities failing after two years of their implementation.
Financial risks, related to the creditworthiness of low-income
beneficiaries and their ability to pay for water services, will be
addressed through high frequency collection schemes. Another risk relates
to the coordination of the implementing agencies. This risk has been
minimized by involving and ensuring strong commitment of the agencies since
the early stage of project preparation.
15.      .ecommendations  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Dir'. 'tors approve the proposed loan.
