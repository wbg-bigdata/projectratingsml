3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the project objective was to assist the Government in
implementing its secondary education reform program, aimed at: (i) achieving improved quality and
efficiency; and ii) improving access to accommodate the projected increase in upper basic and secondary
school enrollments. The initial project objectives were realistic, and fit in well with the Government's
strategy for strengthening the reform of basic and secondary education. Tunisia was the first country, in
1962, to take out a Bank loan for its education sector, and the Government has always placed considerable
emphasis on the improvement of human resources within its development strategy. This project was
therefore in line with Government priorities.
3.2 Revised Objective:
There were no changes made to the objectives during the project life.
3.3 Original Components:
The project had two components:
Component A, designed to Improve Educational Delivery Mechanisms, the total cost of which the SAR
estimated at US$7.3 million, would help MoE to improve system quality through strengthening educational
delivery mechanisms. In particular, the component was to finance the following measures: (i) strengthening
the assessment system at the Ministry of Education (MoE) and at the National Institute for Education
Research (NEER); (ii) training teachers, (iii) strengthening the MoE's administration and planning services
at central and regional levels, and (iv) improving the existing information and feedback mechanisms
between the different decision-making levels.
Component B, which would Improve Access at an originally estimated cost of US$151.9 million, was
aimed at increasing the number of student places through strengthening system efficiency. This would
include the construction of about 30 upper basic schools (colleges) and 44 secondary schools (lycees) in
underserved areas, the rehabilitation of schools in priority areas and the establishment of a system of
preventive maintenance. This component would also include the provision of instructional equipment for
about 380 secondary schools, training and technical assistance to improve the use of the equipment, and
institutional support for the National Maintenance Center.
3.4 Revised Components:
Savings made as a result of the dinar depreciating against the US dollar - the currency in which the loan
was originally held -- allowed MoE to acquire additional equipment, with the Bank's approvaL particularly
for the school inspectorate, as part of Component A. In addition, the project's initial closing date was
extended by eighteen months (from June 30, 2000 to December 31, 2001), to allow for completion of the
civil works planned for the project, as well as the purchase of additional teaching and computer equipment.
The loan agreement was amended in January 1999 to allow the following two changes: (i) to allow MoE to
use loan funds to finance all local and other costs for training activities undertaken abroad that benefited
the NIER; (ii) o combine category 3 (Training) and category 4 (Technical Assistance) in a new category 3
(Training and Technical Assistance).
3.5 Quality at Entry:
The project preparation and design were judged satisfactory, given the overall congruence between project
design features and Government priorities. The satisfactory quality at entry is borne out by the project's
satisfactory results.



4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
At the time of the appraisal-mission on the Secondary Education Support Project (SESP), the Bank and
MoE developed implementation and impact indicators that made it possible to assess the progress of the
project and the achievement of its objectives during the supervision missions. The inpact indicators relate
to academic quality (student/teacher ratio), school access (upper basic education and secondary education
enrollment capacities), and academic performance (achievement rates). From an overall standpoint, the
project met its goals. Nonetheless, achievement in each component was uneven.
Component A - lmprove Education Deliverv Mechanisms
The objectives of the three subcomponents were only partially achieved.
Al. Academic attainment rose substantially when comparing its status at the start of the project with the
status on the closing date. In fact, achievement rates for basic education grades six and nine increased
significantly (from 60.1% to 87.0% for the sixth grade and from 76.6% to 82.0% for the ninth grade). At
the same time, the repeat rates in the first, fourth, sixth, ninth, and eleventh grades declined noticeably (see
Annex 1).
A2. Implementation of the assessment system planned under the project could not be achieved, notably
because of the long delays before calls for bids were anmounced (e.g., for the NIER documentation center,
and for the proficiency training planned for ten technologists and ten academics), and because of the
difficulties the NIER experienced in relation to its legal status. Training activities for research and
evaluation scholars did however take place as planned.
The project moreover made it possible to review and redefine the NIER's legal status. By the end of the
project, the NIER had become the National Center for Educational Research and Innovation (NCERI).
The NCERI is now installed at a new site more suitable for its research activities; this site is near the MoE,
which allows for much closer communication and coordination between the two agencies. With its new
semi-autonomous status, NCERI is able to recruit scholars on a contract basis and manage its activities
independently. The creation of NCERI will foster implementation of the assessment system under the
Education Quality Improvement Project (EQIP), launched in January 2001.
The creation of a master plan for computerizing the management of MoE, the central administration, the
regional divisions and the academic institutions (by using a management information system), including
creation of a database management system, could not be fully achieved.
A3. The various implementation schedules for the training activities were sometimes delayed, and some
programs needed adjustments. Allowing for modifications made it possible to better adapt the training
programs to the needs of MoE.
Component B - Improve Access
The component, concerned with increasing the number of student places particularly through the
construction of upper basic and secondary schools, meets the country's needs in the area of enrollment
capacity. The number of upper basic and secondary schools planned for the project has been almost fully
achieved, with the exception of the secondary school in Kef, where not all work could be finished by
- 3-



December 2001, as planned.
B1. Upper basic education enrollment capacity rose from 364,342 in 1993/94 to 580,974 in 2000/01
(project closing date), increasing by 37%. Secondary education enrollment capacity went from 241,593 in
1993/94 to 382,011 in 2000/01, also increasing by 37%.
B2. The average student/classroom ratio in upper basic education went from 35.4 in 1993/94 to 33.7 in
2000/01. In secondary education, this ratio went from 33.0 in 1993/94 to 32.0 in 2000/01.
4.2 Outputs by components:
The project was made up of two components. Overall, the objectives of both component were met
satisfactorily.
Component A - Improve Education Delivery Mechanisms
Some 1,000 teachers were trained in the CS approach, for a fairly significant program length (about 17.5
hours, on average). This tuining helped to improve the academic quality of teachers during the project life.
In addition, 52 school directors and 96 teaching advisers (conseillers pedagogiques) and inspectors were
trained, so that they could then train teachers in the roll-out phase of the project. An impact assessment
study of the training activities performed under the project has shown that, overall, they have been positive:
i) The number of NIER staff benefiting from trauining (16 weeks of local seminars and ten weeks of
overseas seminars) remained limited due to the high cost of this type of training.
u) The training activities received by officers at the In-Service Training Division, especially for the
implementation of the basic skills approach in upper basic education, were much more effective.
iii) Staff of the the MoE's National Institute for Information Technology in Education, along with a group
of teaching advisers, inspectors and teachers, benefitted positively from training in the use of
communications and information technologies in teaching. This training helped in the creation of the
EduNet network linking the education community together. It also contributed to the establishment of
computer summer schools aimed at educators, that enabled 200 teachers to receive training in computer
technology, software expertise and teaching methods. In addition, 40 staff received training that made
them champions for the development of information technology within the MoE.
Component B - Improve Access
Both the quantitative and qualitative objectives of this component were achieved.
The number of schools to be built under the project was fully achieved: the 30 upper basic schools were
completed in full. The 44 secondary schools planned under the project were also fully completed, with the
exception of the secondary school in Kef, where nonetheless, 80% of the work had been completed by the
project closing date.
All the school rehabilitation activities planned under the project were completed.
The acquisition of equipment (computers, photocopiers, etc.) and teaching materials, as well as the
maintenance of equipment envisaged by the project, was completed.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
No rate of return analysis was undertaken.
-4 -



4.4 Financial rate of return:
No rate of return analysis was undertaken.
4.5 Institutional development impact:
The impact on the NIER (now NCERI) was lesser than expected, given the institutional problems outlined
in section 4.1. Despite this, the contribution made by the project to building institutional capacity was
substantial, both in developing competencies in project implementation and management and, to a lesser
extent, in enhancing policy analysis skills within the MoE. The improved capacity had a positive impact on
the preparation and implementation of the follow-on EQIP project (P050945).
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The unsuccessful bids and problems with the availability of land (Ben Arous, Bizerte and Kef) led to
significant delays in execution at some of the construction sites.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Despite there being three different ministers heading the MoE dunng the life of the project, Govermnent
support for the project objectives remained constant.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Decree No. 98-1779 of September 14, 1998, establishing the new organizational chart for MoE, led to the
reorgnization of various divisions and the appointment of new heads for the project's subcomponents.
Project management suffered as a result, as institutional memory was at times lost with the changes- in
senior personnel.
Construction activities, particularly the construction of preparatory schools in the various regions,
experienced delays and suffered problerns in implementation due to regional councils' lack of experience
and inadequate mastery of procurement procedures. The situation improved toward the end of the project
term, largely due to the institutional support and material means made available to the Buildings and
Equipment Division and the project coordination team, allowing them to improve the performance at the
regional level.
The availability and personal commitment of the staff in charge of tracking the project's various
components also had a positive impact on project implementation. The Buildings and Equipment Division
and the project coordination team were able to benefit from institutional and technical support as well as
obtain material means (computer equipment, etc.), allowing them to improve management and tracking of
project activities, and thereby fully achieve the project goals.
5.4 Costs andfinancing:
At the time of appraisal, the cost of the project was estimated at US$184.3 million, with the IBRD
financing US$98.3 million (53% of the total) and the remaining US$86 million (47%) to be met by the
Government. At the closing date of the loan, the amounts actually spent for the project came to US$87.6
million in IBRD financing and US$54.5 million from the Tunisian counterpart (see Annex 2). Depreciation
of the dinar against the dollar provided extra loan funding to the project in dinar terms (see Section 3.4).
Comparison of the original disbursement curve with the actual disbursement curve shows a lag right from
the beginning of the project. This lag widened at mid-term and then narrowed somewhat by the end of the
project (which was 18 months later than originally planned).

6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The overall sustainability grade of "probable" given the project, as stated in section 2, is justified as
follows:
Component A - Improve Education Delivers Mechanisms
The sustainability of this component has been established. The performance of the educational system and
the promotion of teacher training and practice have definitely improved, thanks to institutional
strengthening and the technical assistance made available to NEER and In-Service Training Division, along
with the training activities provided to the various divisions by the Regional In-Service Teacher Training
Centers: teaching staff, inspectors, pedagogical counselors, etc. The decline in the rate of repeaters,
resulting at least partially from the improvement in the quality of education, adds to the school system's
financial sustainability.
Component B - Improve Access
The sustainability of this component has been established, taking into account the political motivation to
use the classrooms built under the project and to continue building schools in the aim of increasing
enrollment capacity. In some cases, this has meant converting some prinary schools into upper basic
schools. Moreover, construction of almost all the schools was fully completed and rehabilitation of all
existng schools planned under the project was fully achieved. This had a positive impact on enrollment
capacity, the number of students per classroom, etc. Moreover, equipment purchased through the project is
regularly maintained by the National Maintenance Center.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Project activities, such as training and construction, are integrated into the MoE's normal program, so that
no special transition arrangements are required. They will continue on an on-going basis, financed either
out of the State budget or from funds provided by new extemal loans or grants. As for implementation
processes, no particular transition arrangements are required, since project implementation was not
undertaken by a stand-alone project management unit but rather by the MoE's core units under the guidance
of a project coordination team.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
The IBRD's project preparation process was judged highly satisfactory. The project team had a range of
relevant qualifications, with knowledge in the areas of assessment, pedagogy and project management It
took 13 months to prepare the project (from the identification mission in July 1993 to the appraisal mission
in August 1994). This provided enough time for an in-depth study of the sector's main problems, as well
as for multiple dialogues with the main stakeholders. Throughout project preparation, the two
teams-IBRD and MoE-worked in close collaboration, and the project reflected Government priorities.
The World Bank drafted a Staff Appraisal Report clearly describing the activities supported by the project
and providing an itemized schedule of these activities, along with a list of performance indicators. Project
negotiations took place in country (a first for Tunisia), in contrast to the World Bank's usual practice at
that time of holding negotiations at headquarters.
- 6 -



7.2 Supervision:
Bank supervision was satisfactory. There were 15 supervision missions during the project's terr,
including a mid-term review mission, making for an average of two supervision missions per year. The
makeup of the supervision missions at all times included the needed profiles and expertise. Despite the
change in the project head, neither the development nor the continuity of the activities suffered any negative
impact. Despite one year delay in implementation, the team was reasonable in maintaining overall
"satisfactory" ratings throughout.
7.3 Overall Bankperformance:
Given the lending and supervision performance noted above, the overall performance of the World Bank
was satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The borrower played an active role in the various phases of the project (preparation, appraisal,
supervision). A working group of MoE officials worked in close collaboration with the World Bank team
during project preparation and appraisal. Overall Government performance in preparation was
satisfactory.
7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's performance was satisfactory, particularly as it remaiing committed to the project's
overall objectives. The Govemnment maintained strong policies in favor of the development of the education
sector.
7.6 ImplementingAgency:
MoE management of the project was satisfactory overall, with well-qualified staff assigned to the project
Progress reports and audit reports were regularly turned in to the World Bank The performance of the
Buildings and Equipment Division and the Statistics and Planning Office, both of which played a
substantial role in the execution of the project's various components, was excellent. At the regional level
however, a lack of skills in procurement and other administative procedures led to delays in the execution
of the civil works component Organizational and structura changes introduced by MoE led to delays in
execution of some project actions.
7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Overall, the performance of the Borrower was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
Positive Lessons
i) The definition of realistic objectives, closely tied to the Govemment's priorities in relation to education
system reform, was essential for overall success of the project.
ii) The success of the individual components is largely due to the sustained commitment of the officials
entusted with their achievement, particularly the commitment of MoE officials direcdy involved in
project activities.
iii) The seriousness of analytical preparation, along with policy consultations with the main stakeholders,
facilitates project implementation and increases the chances of achieving development objectives.
iv) The flexibility in the approach to traiing enabled training activities to be redefined in response to the
specific needs of the various trainees and thus contributed to the project's success.
-7-



v) In-service training for teachers can have a very positive effect on the quality of education and on
repeaters and drop-outs.
vi) The institutional support provided to MoE made satisfactory implementation of the project possible.
Negative Lessons
i) The institutional weaknesses of the body in charge of drafting the assessment system prevented MoE
from applying this key component for quality improvement (which had to be postponed to the next
project).
ii) The lack of experience with World Bank procurement procedures at the start of the project's term led
to delays in execution of its activities.
iii) The lack of integrated software to facilitate the project's active management made it hard for the people
in charge to manage the project components.
iv) A lack of sufficient expertise in determining needs and technical specifications for teaching materials
had a negative impact on implementation.
v) Project accounting made no provision for quantifying and including in-kind contributions from MoE
under the total expenditures paid by the Government (see Annex 2).
9. Partner Comments
(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
The Bank's assessment of project activities, as set out in the present document, is in our opinion generally
accurate. Successes and failures are outlined in an objective manner. Overall, we agree that the project
outcome is quite positive.
In order to ensure that our assessments converge, we would ask that the final version of the report take into
account the following remarks:
(a) The author correctly pointed out that the restructuring that took place during project implementation,
especially with respect to the training activities, enabled a better targeting of needs and a more effective
response to those needs. This highlights the importance of building flexibility into any project that is to be
implemented over several years, in order to allow for adaptation to changing circumstances without
modifying the fundamental goals of the project
(b) The delays that occurred in implementing some activities are due not only to the lack of experience
amongst the Ministry's project management staff and/or general administative slowness, but also to some
extent to the complexity of the Bank's own approval procedures. Thought should be given to ways in
which processes could be simplified, to avoid delays caused by having to seek the Banles prior approval at
every turn.
(c) Supervision missions are very useful. However, it would be appropriate to reach agreement before each
mission on (i) its specific objectives and program of work, and (ii) its membership, to ensure that it
contains experts whose advice is sought in relation to specific project activities.
