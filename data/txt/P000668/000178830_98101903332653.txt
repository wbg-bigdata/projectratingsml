APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH TELECOMMUNICATTINS PROJEcr
OF THE
IMPERIAL BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA (IBTE)
SUMMARY
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the fourth telecommuni-
cations project of the Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia
(IBTE).
ii.       IBTE has requested the Bank for a loan to cover part of the
foreign exchange needed to carry out the 1968-1973 program of expansion
of telecommunication facilities in Ethiopia. The Swedish Government is
participating in the project and the Swedish International Development
Authority (SIDA) took part in the appraisal.
iii.      The physical progress of the third loan - 441-ET - made in
December 1965 is satisfactory. The schemes in this project have been
largely completed and the remaining ones are expected to be completed
by the end of 1969. The loan amount is also expected to be fully drawn
down by the closing date of June 30, 1969.
iv.       The new expansion program in addition to the continuing schemes
from the project covered by loan 441-ET, envisages essentially (a) an
increase in the capacity of the urban telephone systems by about 29,000
lines, of which about 23,000 lines will be in automatic exchanges, and
(b) the expansion of long-distance communication facilities, including
the installation of microwave and VHF systems, and of automatic trunk
exchanges. Other components of the program include the expansion of tele-
graph and telex facilities and of international communication. Buildings,
vehicles, training and auxiliary equipment needed for the program have
also been included. The program as now proposed is technically sound
and would provide for a balanced growth of telephones and of long-distance
facilities within the resources available.
v.        The number of telephones in Ethiopia has actually increased by
about 17% - a high growth rate - per year during the past six years . In
line with the trends in other countries, IBTE expects that this initial
high growth rate will not be maintained.    The program as now proposed,
which would provide for a growth rate of 12% per year, is conservative
but should enable IBTE to keep pace reasonably with the demands.
vi.       The existing long-distance facilities are inadequate in many
respects. The number of circuits are insufficient to handle the traffic
which is therefore subject to considerable delays. These facilities are
largely provided on open wire routes which are subject to frequent inter-
ruptions and to copper wire thefts. The service is therefore unreliable
and the quality of speech poor. The proposed radio relay systems (micro-
wave and VHF) will provide for a large increase in the number of circuits
- and improvements in quality as well as reliability - to enable IBTE to
l roiride a good service between Addis Ababa and other important DOpDllation
eveIivsr in Ethiopia and to provide interconreutQ.rv ns wi1t. SvClan anc3 ye3ra.



- ii -
vii.       From the economic point of view, the establishment of reliable
and speedy communication will help production, trade, tourism, transporta-
tion and administration over large parts of Ethiopia. The rate of return
to the enterprise on the proposed investment at current rates is about
15%.
viii.      The total cost of the 1968-1973 program, including the con-
tinuing works in progress for the earlier project, is estimated at
Eth$63.5 million (US$25.4 million) including a foreign exchange component
of Eth$40 million (US$16 million).
ix.        The proposed financing plan, which has been agreed with SIDA,
is based on a Bank loan of US$h.5 million and an equal amount from the
Swedish Government.  IBTE has available US$2.8 million from the third
loan in the period from January 1, 1968, to June 30, 1969, and proposes
to utilize US$1.1 million of supplier's credits for purchase of Addis
Ababa exchanges. The balance of foreign currency expenditure of US$3.1
million is unsuitable for Bank financing. This amount as well as the
local currency expenditures will be found by IBTE from internal resources.
x.         The financial rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
is expected to decline from 11.2% in 1968 to about 9.2% in 1973. Debt
service coverage and operating ratio would be satisfactory.
xi.        IBTE intends to employ an expert for carrying out the progran
and consultants for the detailed engineering in respect of the microwave
and VHF schemes. In all other areas, IBTE has the necessary capabilities
and no difficulty is anticipated in the execution of the program.
xii.       IBTE is reasonably well managed and has a good organization.
Some improvement is, however, still necessary in collection, costing,
accounting, auditing and stores (paragraph 7.07). The management is
aware of these problems and there has been some progress recently.
During negotiations IBTE agreed to make the necessary improvements.
xiii.      The proposed program is suitable for a Bank loan of US$h.5 mil-
lion repayable in 20 years including a grace period of four and a half
years. The Swedish Government will provide an additional credit of
US$$4.5 million at an interest rate of 2% repayable in 25 years including
a grace period of 10 years.



ETHIOPIA
APPRAISAL OF THE FOURTH TELECO2MUNICATIONS PROJECT
IMPERIAL BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (IBTE)
has asked the Bank for a loan to cover pcrt of the f,reign
exchange needed to carry out the 1968-73 program for the'expansion of
telecommunication facilities in Ethiopia.
1.02      The Swedish Government showed an interest in participating
in this project.  In view of this, the Swedish International Development
Authority also took part in the appraisal.
1.03      The Bank has made three loans for telecommunications in
Ethiopia. The first loan (US$1.5 million) was made in 1951 to the Empire
of Ethiopia for the rehabilitation and extension of IBTE's telecommunication
facilities. For many reasons, mostly connected with organizational
problems, the loan did not become effective until February 1954. The
project was completed in 1956. The second loan was of US$2.9 million in
1962 directly to IBTE in connection with its 1962-64 program. This
project was virtually complete in 1965. In December 1965 the Bank made
the third loan (US$4.8 million) to the IBTE for its 1965-67 investment
program. This loan (441ET) became effective only in May 1966. Even so,
the physical progress of the project is satisfactory. The schemes in
this project have been largely completed and the remaining ones are
expected to be completed by the end of 1969. The loan amount is also
expected to be fully drawn down by the closing date (June 30, 1969).
1.04      A condition of the first loan agreement was
that the. Government should establish the Imperial Board of Tele-
communications of Ethiopia. This was done in 1952 and the Board was
set up on a sound foundation. Much of Ethiopia's telecommunication
equipment was obsolete and near complete breakdown at that time. IBTE
is now a reasonably efficient commercially run entity and the tele-
communication services have been very much expanded and improved.
1.05      The essence of the 1968-73 program, in addition to the
continuing schemes from the project covered by the third loan, is to
.increase the capacity of local telephone exchange systems and to expand
long-distance communication facilities including the establishment of
backbone interurban microwave and other radio relay routes.
II. TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR
2.01      Ethiopia covers an area of about 1.22 million km2 and has an
estimated population of 22.6 million. It is thus one of the larger
developing countries in Africa.



- 2   -
2.02      The greater part of the country consists of high plateaus and
mountains with the capital, Addis Ababa, at an altitude of 2,h00 m.
Towards Somalia in the east and the Red Sea in the north, the topography
changes into lowlands. Only 1.5 million of the population live in urban
areas.
2.03      Most of the people obtain their livelihood from agriculture.
Grains are the most important crop and coffee is the principal export
commodity. Livestock is a major natural resource and offers a long term
potential for expansion.
2.o4      Manufacturing is at an incipient stage but growing rapidly, the
important sectors now being food processing, textiles and production
of building materials. Handicrafts and small scale industries employ
more people and contribute more to the national product than the manu-
facturing industries. Mining activities have so far played a minor role
in the economy. However, important deposits of potash have been discovered
in northeastern Ethiopia and are expected to become one of the major
sources of export earnings.
2.05      Ethiopia appears to have good potential for development of
tourism because of good climate, scenic beauty, historical relics and
proximity to the East African tourist flow.
2.06      The distribution of population and of economic activities
requiresgood communication facilities - transportation and teleconununication.
A good telecommunication network helps to increase the utilization and
efficiency of transportation as well as to promote directly the develop-
ment and integration of economic activities. It is therefore not surprising
that there has been a strong demand in Ethiopia for telecommunication
facilities not only in the urban but in the rural areas also. The 1968-73
program of expansion has been drawn up to keep reasonably in step with
these requirements. In spite of the rapid growth of telecommunication
facilities in Ethiopia during the last decade, there is still a large gap
in meeting the needs, especially in respect of long-distance communication
facilities.
2.07      All telecommunication services for the public - local and lohg-
distance telephone, telegraph, telex and international communication - are
the responsibility of IBTE. IBTE also maintains the equipment and provides
other technical services to the Broadcasting Authority in Ethiopia on a
cost plus basis.
III. EXISTING FACILITIES
3.01      A brief description of the existing telecommunication facilities
in Ethiopia provided by the IBTE is given below. The present network is
related reasonably to the geographical distribution of economic activities
in the country and provides telecommunication facilities for urban and
rural areas. The Annexes 1 to 4 and maps 1 and 2 give additional infor-
mation on the network, growth, traffic and other aspects.



-3-
Local exchange systems
3.02      Service at the main centers is provided using automatic
exchanges. Manual exchanges are used for smaller towns. IBTE had at
the end of 1967 a total of 195 exchanges which provided 32,355 telephones;
28,290 telephones (87.4% of the total) were connected to 10 automatic
exchanges and 4,066 telephones (12.6% of the total) were connected to
185 manual exchanges. The two largest exchange systems at Addis Ababa
and Asmara had 20,287 telephones and 5,034 telephones respectively,
accounting for a total of about 84% of the telephones working in Ethiopia.
The growth of telephones in Ethiopia and in Addis Ababa is given in Annex
2 and of connected lines in the graph in Annex 3. These indicate the
rapid increase of urban telephone service which, in the last six years,
amounted to a 17% annual growth rate for the number of telephones.
Long-distance telephone network
3.03      The long-distance - or toll -   network in Ethiopia is based
very largely on the use of open wire lines, consisting of 18,000 pair km
erected on 9,000 km of route. The existing open wire routes are shown
in map 1. A number of carrier systems operating on some of these routes
provide the main interurban circuits - in all about 185 in number - between
the important towns and cities - see map 2. The smaller places are served
solely by the physical pairs and in many cases several exchanges share
the use of a single pair. A few circuits have been provided using high
frequency radio systems to some remote places and to important towns as
a standby in case of breakdowns. The only modern routes are two short
distance sections: one between Addis Ababa and Debre Zeit (46 km) consisting
of an underground carrier cable route and the other a microwave radio
link between Asmara and Massawa (87 km).
3.04      The size of the above network is totally inadequate for meeting
the toll traffic needs. Further, the long-distance facilities are almost en-
tirely based on open wire working and therefore subject to frequent interrup--
tions, because of the terrain, the long distances involved in Ethiopia and of
copper wire thefts. The ranid growth in the number of telephones and the aware-
ness of the benefits under Ethiopian conditions of telephone communication
have all contributed to a considerable strain on tne meager and unreliable
toll facilities. As a result, it is not unusual now in Ethiopia to
encounter delays of several hours - in some cases in excess of a day on
account of interruptions - in establishing long distance connections.
The quality of circuits are also in many cases well below the minimum
standards. The service provided is unsatisfactory.
Domestic telegraph and telex services
3.05      Telegraph facilities within Ethiopia are rather limited and are
provided only to a few places, essentially to the important tow'ms and a
few out of the way places. The number of domestic telegrams has decreased
during the last three years. Telex facilities are now available in Addis
Ababa, Asmara and Assab with a total of 113 subscribers connected to manual
exchanges.



- 4 -
3.o6    Most of the telegraph and telex interurban circuits are provided
by use of high frequency wireless links which are equipped with automatic
error correction equipment for the main 0ircuits.
International services
3.07    International telegraph, telephone and telex facilities are
provided through use of high frequency wireless systems. There are direct
connections to a number of cities in Europe, Africa and Asia. Service
to other places is arranged via these cities. The telegraph and telex
services are aatisfactory and the telex usage for international communica-
tion from and to Ethiopia has shown significant increases in each of the
last three years.
3.o8    However, the international telephone service from Ethiopia is
not satisfactory due to the limitations of the high frequency radio systems
for handling telephone calls and to the short schedules of operation. But
there is no short term alternative and the use of satellite communication
may not be financially justified for some years.
IV. PROGRAM
4.01    The revised 1968-73 investment program - evolved after discussions
with the mission - provides for a total expenditure of Eth$63.5 million
(US$25.4 million) during the six year period including the cost of the
continuing works from the earlier project covered by Loan 441-ET. The
details of this program including rhe construction schedule for the prin-
cipal items are given in Annex 5.
4.02    The following are the main items included in the program, the
most significant being the expansion of local telephone exchange systems
and the establishment of reliable long distance arteries interconnecting
the principal cities using microwave and VHF/UHF radio relay systems.
Local exchange systems
4.03    The program envisages an increase of about 31,200 telephones
or an average annual growth of 12%. For this purpose, the installed
capacity of automatic exchanges will be increased by 23,000 lines and of
manual exchanges by about 7,000 lines. Of this, 16,000 lines will be added
to the two Addis Ababa exchanges - Arada and Filwoha - and 4,000 lines to
the Asmara exchange. The planned increases have been based on the anti-
cipated growth in each of the exchange areas. The urban networks in the
exchange areas will also be expanded to keep in line with the increased
capacity of the exchanges.
Long distance facilities
4.04    The program aims at setting up an adequate and reliable long
distance network in order to overcome the existing deficiencies and to
establish a base for further development.   It will also provide for st.brriber



dialed long-distance calls to be set up between the telephone users in
the principal five cities - Addis Ababa, Asmara, Dessie, Nazareth and
Dire Dawa. The main parts of this program are as follows:
(i) Microwave and VHF/UHF radio relay routes between the
principal stations are given below - also see map 3.
These systems together with the associated multiplex
installation will interconnect the main cities.
Microwave systems capable of providing ultimately up to 960
circuits between
Addis Ababa  - Dessie    - Makale     - Asmara
Addis Ababa - Nazareth - Dire Dawa - Harrar
Microwave systems capable of providing ultimately up to 120
circuits between
Addis Ababa - Shashemane
Addis Ababa  - Jimma
Asmara       - Agordat   -   Tessenei and on to link up
with Sudan network
VHF/UHF system capable of providing ultimately up to 24
circuits between
Yirgalem     - Moyale and on to link up with Kenya network
(ii) For communication to smaller places about 2,000 km of existing
open wire lines will be reconstructed; and 3,000 pair km of
open wire lines, or low capacity (one to five circuits) VHF
routes where advantageous, will be added.
(iii) A number of single, three and twelve channel open wire
carrier systems will also be installed on existing and
new lines.
(iv) Automatic four wire exchanges with a capacity to terminate
a total of 684 long distance circuits will be installed at
Addis Ababa, Asmara and Dessie. Additions will also be made
to the exchanges in Nazareth and Dire Dawa to terminate 168
long distance circuits and to provide two wire, automatic
toll working for these places.
Telegraph and telex facilities
4.05      The present telegraph and telex facilities will be extended.
A number of teleprinters will be installed in the principal cities to
improve and expand telegraph working. The Addis Ababa automatic telex
exchange will be expanded by 200 lines and the manual telex exchange
which is now surplus in Addis Ababa will be moved to Asmara.   Small
additions will be made to the high frequency wireless installations in
'ddis Ababa, Asmara and Assab. A number of error correcting muOtiplexing,



units will also be installed to provide telegraph and telex circuits
on HF links.
International communications
4.o6      The existing international transmitter and receiver stations -
Besseka and Sululta in Addis Ababa - will be enlarged slightly by installaticn
of new equipment to provide a small additional capacity in respect of the
existing links and to provide a few new ones. In addition, a small
high frequency monitoring station will be set up in Addis Ababa to
facilitate better operations.

4.o8      The cost estimates are reasonable and adequate.   The costs
of materials and equipment have been based on recent quotations received
by IBTE. The contingencies - at about 8% of the estimated costs --
are to cover variations such as possible changes in copper wire prices.
Execution
4.09      Excepting for the radio relay schemes, the construction and
installation program is of the same order of magnitude as in recent
years.  IBTE has shown an adequate capacity to handle the work satisfac-
torily and no special problems or difficulties are likely in respect of
this program.
4.10      IBTE, however, has no experience of engineering or erecting
microwave and other radio relay systems. The Addis Ababa - Asmara route
has been engineered by a Japanese firm and is based on an actual survey
of the route and of sites for repeater stations. This forms an adequate
and suitable basis for going out to international tender.
4.11      In respect of other microwave and VHF schemes, the detailed
engineering of the systems and the siting of repeater stations is yet
to be done. The proposals have been drawn up on the basis of the
available maps and give a reasonable estimate of the costs.    However,
the detailed engineering of these schemes is necessary before procure-
ment action can be taken.
4.12      IBTE proposes to employ consultants, either an independent
firm of consultants, or experts provided by another administration
under bilateral assistance, to consider alternative routes and systems
and to recommend the least cost solution; further, to do the detailed
survey of the routes and sites, and draw up detailed engineering plans
in respect of routes other than Addis Ababa - Asmara and Yirgalem-Mloyale.
The latter is a small capacity route which can be adequately engineered by
IBTE's staff, with'the assistance of the expert described belo'y.
4.13      In addition, IBTE proposes to employ an expert wrho will assist
I'BTE in certain procurement matters such as the drawing up of specifications
and other bid documents and in the evaluation of the bids. The expert will
also assist in supervising the installations and also the work of consultante.
4.14     TThese arrangements would be adequate, and IBTE gave assurances
during negotiations that the schemes would be handled in this manner.

V. PROJECT FOR BANK FINANCING
The Project
5.01         Part of the foreign costs of the above program is already
financed.  The previous Bank loan (441-ET) will cover US$2.8 million.
IBTE has arranged suppliers' credit through L. M. Ericsson of Sweden
amounting to US$1.1 million and proposes to finance US$3.1 million
itself. This leaves foreign costs of US$9 million to be financed.
The proposed Bank loan would cover Us$4.5 million and the proposed
Swedish Government credit the same amount.
5.o2         The Bank project comprises the 1968-73 program except
those works continuing from Loan 441-ET.

VI. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The 1968-1973 program of expansion has been drawn up by IBTE
after a careful and detailed study of the requirements. The demand for
telephone services is in respect of two principal interrelated items,
connection to local exchange systems and long-distance facilities per-
mitting the speedy setting up of interurban calls of good quality.
6.02      IBTE has up to now been preoccupied with improvement and
modernization of the local exchanges - an essential first step in the
development of a good telephone service. The rapid expansion of ex-
change systems in recent years has enabled IBTE to reduce the serious
gap in meeting the demand for local connections. But the expansion of
the long-distance facilities has been extremely limited and has lagged
well behind the requirements. The current program provides for a rea-
sonable growth of local exchange systems and for a significant expansion
and improvement of interurban facilities, thus making for a well-balanced
plan of expansion.
Local Exchange Program
6.03      The demand for telephones has been very high during the past
six years; and indeed IBTE has been unable to meet all the demands,
especially in Addis Ababa and Asmara. WJhile the rates of growth in
individual exchanges have varied over a wide range, the actual increase
in the number of connected telephones in Ethiopia has averaged 17% per
year. The basis for the 1968-1973 program is dealt with fully in Annex 6
and is given briefly below.
6.04      In the case of the smaller exchanges, the program is based
generally on the growth rates experienced during the previous years.
In the case of Addis Ababa and Asmara, a more flexible approach has
been adopted.
6.o5      The Addis Ababa system has had a rate of growth of 18% per
year over the past six years. The Asmara system growth has been limited
in some years due to lack of capacity; but for this, the rate of growth
would have been similar to the 18% in Addis Ababa.
6.06      The program provides for an average growth rate of about 13%
in these two systems.   At first sight, this is a conservative growth
rate. There is,however, an element of flexibility in that, if it is ex-
ceeded, IBTE will be able to start additional works in the period before
1973. In this way IBTE could accommodate if necessary a growth rate of
up to 18%.



- 10 -
Long-distance Facilities
6.07        The inadequacies of the long-distance facilities were set
out in paragraph 3.04. The system is at present not fulfi±lling its role.
Under these conditions, it is not possible to estimate directly the de-
mand for long-distance facilities.
6.08        Experience in most countries indicates that the annual
growth rate of long distance calls is greater than, often as much as
twice, the growth rate in the number of telephones. In Ethiopia, the
annual growth rate of long-distance calls over the last 12 years has
averaged about 13%, but these increases have varied from '.6% to 31%.
After high growth rates (22% to 31%) following the completion of new
facilities in the 1964-1966 period, the increase fell to 2.8% in 1967
due to the lack of increase in the number of circuits. The long-distancee
expansion program is aimed at meeting the anticipated growth of traffic
which is expected to reach a level of six times the present traffic in
the main interurban routes by 1974 - based on a 15% growth rate per year
until the microwave and VHF routes come into operation followed by an
increase of 60% and 40% in the two subsequent years then by a growth rate
of 25% per year up to the end of 1974.
6.09        The establishment of microwave UHF and VHF radio links and
the installation of automatic trunk exchanges together with associated
facilities when completed in 1973 will generally speed up and improve
the quality of long-distance service throughout Ethiopia and enable sub-
scribers to dial calls between the five principal cities. Further
additions to capacity and extensions of subscriber dialing to other
stations can be achieved without major cost to cope with future require-
ments.  Thus the program as such would provide for the basic establishment
of the long-distance service on a sound basis. It would also then be
possible to handle long-distance telegraph and telex traffic by addition
of necessary telegraph channeling equipment at a small cost and replace
the more expensive and operationally difficult high frequency systems.
6.10        The use of microwave and VHF/UHF radio relay systems as propo-
ed provides for the most economical solution in terms of both capital and



-11-
recurring costs. Due to recent technological advances and to increased
volume of production, the costs of these systems have progressively come
down in recent years in spite of providing extra capacity, improved
performance and reduced maintenance. On the other hand, open wire line
costs have gone up due to increased prices of copper wire. For the num-
ber of circuits now required for meeting the traffic requirements in the
years ahead, the use of open wire lines is more expensive.
6.11      The provision of automatic trunk exchanges to permit subscribers
to dial interurban calls is likewise now economical in terms of capital
and recurring costs. The total capital expenditure is a small part -
about 3% - of the total program. The alternative of providing manual
switching facilities would cost-more in capital for handling a similar
volume of traffic.  In addition, the operating expenses for manual oper-
ations would be considerable.
6.12      The rest of the long-distance program consists of the erection
of open wire routes and the installation of open wire systems, small capac-
ity VHF links and HF systems - more or less as heretofore. This expansion
will provide interim relief to some of the congested routes and open up new
areas. This is largely complementary to the radio relay links which will
provide for the interurban traffic between the main cities. After the main
interurban routes are equipped with radio relay systems, the open wire net--
work will provide circuits on essentially short spur routes feeding into
the main arteries and, for such applications, will be reasonably adequate in
respect of quality and reliability.
Other Schemes
6.13      The other components of the expansion program consist of telegraph
and telex expansion, small additions to provide additional international
circuits, buildings, motor vehicles, training equipment and ancillaries.
6.14      The telegraph and telex expansion is small.   The telegraph expan--
sion is aimed at introducing teleprinters in a few important stations includ.
ing the use of Amharic language teleprinters in the expectation that this
would popularize the telegraph service. The telex expansion provides for an
additional 200 subscribers in Addis Ababa in the six year period. The
program is justified by the anticipated demand-for these facilities which
are extremely useful to the business community, especially for international
communication.
6.15      The building program is, with the exception of the IBTE headquar-
ters in Addis Ababa, largely for accommodating telecommunication equipment
installations. The motor vehicles are needed for the execution of the pro-
gram and for replacement of part of the existing fleet of vehicles. The
small investments for training equipment and for ancillaries are obvious.
Rate of Return
6.16      A cost benefit analysis in the telecommunication sector is diffi-
cult and can be no more than indicative. There is not muich difficulty in



-12-
establishing the costs of communication which broadly fall into three cato-
gories viz using mail, telecommunications, and personal visits.   The difi-'-
culty is to establish data which will help to assign values to benefits
arising from a communication. These benefits vary considerably and depend
on the circumstances, nature of activity and a number of other factors.
6.17     WTithin cities telecommunications provide a cheaper form of com-
munication - and a speedier and easier form - than the other forms of
communication. Elsewhere long-distance telephone calls are cheaper than
personal visits and achieve the desired objective in most cases. More
particularly, telecommunication helps to increase the effeciency and utili-
zation of transportation and reduces the costs thereof, and plays an
important role in promoting and integrating the trade in the country,
especially of bulk commodities like food grains and export commodities
where it is necessary and usual to operate on low margins of profit. The
importance of telecommunication to decentralization of administration and
industry, as well as to the development of suburban communities, is
recognized. Its uses for doctors and other professional people, for
dealing with emergencies, etc. are clear.
6.18      The benefits of good telecommunication become ever greater in the
context of the distribution of population and of production centers over a
large part of Ethiopia (see paragraphs 2.01 to 2.06) and the high costs of
transportation in Ethiopia due to the hilly terrain over a large part of
the country and the fact that fuel has to be transported a long distance
from ports of entry to the place of use. Addis Ababa, which has a large
proportion of the telephones in Ethiopia, is an unusually wide spread city
set among hills, its commercial establishments all scattered over a wide
area, thus again enhancing the value of telecommunication.
6.19      It is difficult to measure benefits such as those listed above;
but it may be argued that the prices which users have to pay give at laast
a minimum indication of their value. The rate of return on the investment
proposed for 1968 to 1973 is estimated to be 15%, valuing services at cur-
rent tariffs.  The details and methods of calculation are shown in Annex 7.
VII. BORROWER
7.01      The Borrower would be the Imperial Board of Telecommunications,
Ethiopia, which is a government owned corporation established in 1952 by
Imperial Proclamation for the purpose of building, operating and maintaining
all public telecommunication services in Ethiopia. The Board has maintained
a good record of progress and achievement since its formation.
7.02      An organization chart is given in Annex 8.   The governing body
of IBTE is a Board of Directors consisting of not less than five and not
more than seven members appointed by the Emperor, with the Minister of
Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones as ex officio chairman.
7.03      Responsibility for the management and operations of IBTE is
entrusted to the General MIanager who has under the charter, fairly broad
powers over such matters as employment and discharge of staff, planning,
puirchasing and financial management.



- 13 -
7.04    The organization is generally satisfactory.   Some readjustments,
desirable to improve the coordination and direction of engineering plan-
ning are dealt with here, and others on financial matters are discussed
in paragraph 7.07. The planning functions are now handled by the three
divisional managers - operations, radio and telephone divisions - under
the manager of the Technical Department. The divisional managers are es-
sentially responsible for maintenance and operations. A planning officer
reporting to the manager of the Technical Department is responsible for
coordinating the planning activities but he has neither the authority nor
the staff to do so. Since planning is an important function and especially
so with the increased expansion activities of IBTE, the organization should
be altered in order to handle this work effectively. During negotiations
IBTE agreed to establish a planning division or a branch responsible for
planning, supervision and execution of expansion programs.
Staff and training
7.05    The Ethiopian staff of IBTE have demonstrated over a number of years
a steadily growing skill and ability, and have been filling adequately the
administrative positions in the various divisions at headquarters and in
the regions. At present there are only two foreigners at the management
level of IBTE, one from the Swedish Telegraph and Telephone Administration
as an engineering adviser and the other, a Greek who is the financial ma-
nager. The IBTE management staff are qualified and competent; many of them
have been trained in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe. IBTE proposes to con-
tinue the practice of sending key personnel abroad fcr training under bila-
teral assistance.
7.06    IBTE has established a training center with residential facilities.
The center provided training to about 640 engineering and operative persons
(100 persons at a time) in the period 1963-67. The center will be expanded
and improved to meet the increased demands for trained personnel and would
be giving training in the 1968-73 period to over 1,000 persons.
Accounting
7.07    IBTE's financial organization has not kept pace with the rapid
development of the undertaking and a number of matters require attention.
These problems are elaborated in Annex 9 and include:
(a) the strengthening of the position of the Finance Manager
within the organization;
(b) the organization of the Collection Department;
(c) supply and its relation to engineering planning;
(d) the provision of a new accounting plan and costing system;
(e) internal audit;
(f) the extension of data processing.
IBTE recognizes these weaknesses and is taking steps to correct them.



- 14 -
IBTE has recruited new senior staff and expects to obtain the services
of a computer specialist to review and advise on data processing. A
number of senior staff will also be sent on specialized training
courses outside Ethiopia. However, the position of the Finance Manager
in IBTE's organization requires review; he should be given full authority
to coordinate and control IBTE's financial activities. During negotiations
IBTE agreed to do this; IBTE also agreed to carry out within a specified
timetable the required improvements in its financial organization.
Audit
7.o8      An annual independent audit of IBTE's accounts is carried out
by a firm of chartered accountants. This arrangement is satisfactory
to the Bank, and assurances have bean obtained that the accounts will
continue to be audited by an independent firm of auditors acceptable to
the Bank.
Tariffs
7.09      IBTE has the right to settle its own tariffs without reference
to the Government. For the time being, they are reasonable and adequate;
no adjustments are proposed. Details of tariffs are given in Annex 10.
7.10      IBTE was required as a condition to the last Loan to maintain
tariffs at a level sufficient to provide a rate of at least 8% per annum
on the net fixed assets in operation; furthermore, it was agreed that IBTE
should be able to provide out of revenue at least 40% of capital expendi-
ture to be incurred during the four years 1965 through 1968. IBTE fully
met these requirements. Taking into account the estimates for 1968, the
rate of return will have remained above 11% throughout the period and cash
generation will have provided 56% of IBTE's capital development. Having
regard to the large program to be undertaken, and the increased cash needs,
IBTE has agreed to maintain tariffs at such a level as to produce a rate
of return of not less than 9% on the average net fixed assets in service
(see paragraph 8.10).
Present financial position
7.11      The estimated capitalization of the IBTE at December 31, 1968
is given below:

Total Capitalization             60.3       24.O      100
7.12   Up to December 31, 1967, IBTE's share capital was Eth$7.7 million.
This had been issued to the Government during IBTE's early years for Eth$4.0
million cash and against the receipt of material for Eth$3.7 million acquired
under the first Bank Loan to the Ethiopian Government. The share capital was
increased as at December 31, 1967, from Eth$7.7 million to Eth$20.0 million
by capitalizing part of its reserves. Before this step was taken the Ministry
of Finance appointed a committee of experts to carry out a current valuation
of assets taken over from the Government by IBTE in 1953. Arising out of the
review, the value of land which had been taken over at a nominal figure was
increased by Eth$2.6 million and the capital reserves increased accordingly.
(See Annex 14,paragraphs 8 and 9) The decision to increase share capital was
taken to enable additional debt to be incurred for the proposed expansion
program since under its charter the amount of indebtedness which IBTE may
have outstanding at any one time may not exceed three times the amount of the
authorized and subscribed capital stock.
7.13   The long-term debt consists of the balance outstanding on two 20-year
IBRD loans, Nos. 314-ET and 441-ET, which were made for the 1962-64 and
1965-67 capital programs, and the balance of a six-year 7% L.M. Ericsson
credit for the supply of the Addis Ababa crossbar exchange.   In addition, a
current liability to the Public Service Pensions Commission in respect of
pension contributions retained within IBTE during past years was converted in
June 1968 into an Eth$2 million loan at 6.5% repayable over five years.
Past earnings
7.14   A statement of income covering the five-year period 1963 through
1967 is given in Annex 12. In 1967 IBTE derived approximately 62% of its
revenues from telephone, 22% from telegraph, 7% from telex, with the
remainder coming from broadcasting and miscellaneous sources. Total revenues
showed an average annual increase of 17.2% between 1962 and 1967. A high rate
of development during that period enabled IBTE's annual net income to exceed
the forecasts resulting,in an average rate of return of 12.7% per armum,



-16-
7.15      During the five years 1963 through 1967, 62% of IBTE1s capital
requirements was provided from internally generated funds, 32% from IBRD
loans and 6% from supplier's credit.
Receivables
7.16      Although considerable improvement was shown in IBTE's outstanding
receivables at March 31, 1968, they still remain too high. The failure of
the Government to settle its bills promptly, a weak collecting organization
and poor billing procedures have all contributed to this position (see
paragraph 7.07 and Annex 9). Total receivables outstanding on March 31, 1968,
were Eth$2.9 million of which 26% were current and 56% had been outstanding
for at least four months.  Of the total outstanding, 30% was due from the
Government. In 1967 part of the dividend payable to the Government was
applied in the settlement of its debts. The Government agreed during negotia-
tions that it will make arrangements with IBTE to settle its arrears and
maintain its bills on a current basis.
VIII. FUTURE FINANCES
8.01      The forecast finances of IBTE for the six years 1968 to 1973 are
presented in Annexes 11 to 13 in the form of forecast Balance Sheets, Income
Statements and Sources of Application of Funds. The assumptions contained
in these accounts are elaborated in Annex 14.
Financing Plan
8.02      The financial requirements for the period of the six-year

It is estimated that 53% of total requirements for the program will be
provided from internally generated funds, 10% from IBRD Loan 44l-ET, 15% froi'
IBRD's new loan, and the remainder from other loans and a supplier's credit.
8.03      During the program period IBTE's network will almost double and
accordingly an increase in working capital is necessary. An amount equiva-
lent to US$3.9 million has been included in the plan for this purpose.
8.oh      The total to be raised by way of loan capital other than supplier's
credit will be equivalent to US$12.6 million. Of this sum, US$2.8 million
will come from the balance of the IgRD loan 441-ET, the equivalent of US$0e8
million from the Pension Fund loan (see paragraph 7.13) and the balance of
US$9.0 million would be provided, 50% by the Bank and 50% by a Swedish
Government credit. The terms of the latter would be 2% for 25 years with
a grace period of 10 years. The Bank loan is assumed to be at 6.5% for 20
years including a grace period of four and a half years.
8.05      IBTE has negotiated an additional supplier's credit with
L.M. Ericsson for the equivalent of US$1.1 million for the supply of
automatic exchange equipment. The terms for the Credit would be 6.5%
for eight years, wfith no grace period.
Future Operating Results
8.06      Telephone revenue has been projected on a network which is expected
to increase from 32,355 telephones at the end of 1967 to 63,400 at the end
of 1973. Additional telephone, telegraph and telex revenue is also expected
to accrue from the expansion and improved quality of long-distance facilities.
Total overall revenue forecast for the six-year period 1968-73 shows an
annual growth of 10%. Telephone revenue is estimated to increase at an
average annual rate of 12%, telegraph revenue by 6% and telex revenue by 15%.
8.07      IBTE will continue to provide for some years to come the technical
services for broadcasting on a cost plus basis (see paragraph 2.07). It
Is foreseen that these services will increase and this has been taken into
account in the projections of both income and expenditure.
8.08      Operating expenses other than depreciation provide for an annual
increase of 12%, this being considered reasonable to cover wage increases
and the cost of additional maintenance staff and other expenses for the
increased network.
8.09      Operating ratios although satisfactory show deterioration in
moving from 70 in 1967 to 75 in 1973. IBTE's management was made aware of the
necessity to maintain a strict control on staff numbers during the forth-
coming period of expansion, since the staff schedules for the proposed pro-
gram were found to be unrealistic.  This view was accepted by the management.
At the end of 1967 IBTE had 87 employees per 1,000 telephones. This figure
is high and IBTE gave an assurance during negotiations that it will restrict
net annual increases of staff to a maximum of 6% during the period of the
construction program, the permitted percentage increase to be reviewed at
the end of 1973.

8.10      The rate of return on average net telecommunication assets in
service which was 13.1% in 1967 is expected to decline to 11.2% in 1968,
10.3% in 1970 and 9.2% in 1973. During negotiations IBTE agreed to
maintain a 9% rate of return (see paragraph 7.10).
8.11      A dividend totalling Eth$300,000 was declared in 1967 on the
operating results of 1966. Of this sum, Eth$200,000 was paid to Govern-
ment, Eth$90,000 was set off against Government overdue accounts, and
the balance remained to be dealt with either as a cash payment to the
Government or offset against arrears. Although IBTE is undertaking a
sizeable expansion program and is expecting to finance about 53% of the
capital costs from its own funds after providing for debt service, the
estimates provide for the payment of dividends totalling Eth$1.6 million
during the years 1970 through 1973. During negotiations the Government
and IBTE agreed that before declaring or paying dividends, IBTE would
insure that there would be sufficient funds available after the payment
of the proposed dividends to assure the prompt carrying out and operation
of the project.
Future Financial Position
8.12      Forecast balance sheets for IBTE as of December 31, 1968,
through 1973 are shown in Annex 11.
8.13      Average net plant in service would increase from Eth$36 million
in January 1968 to Eth$77 million in 1973.
8.14      It is expected that annual internal cash generation will in-
crease from Eth$8 million in 1968 to Eth$12 million in 1973. Total debt
service coverage would be ample, 4.8 times in 1968 falling to 3.0 times
in 1970 and increasing slightly to 3.2 times in 1973.
8.15      Total equity shows an annual growth of about 8.5% over the
period of the program, at the end of which the ratio of long-term debt
to equity would be 36/64.  IBTE is subject to a debt limitation under
its statutes (see paragraph 7.12), whereby its long-term debt may not
exceed three times the issued share capital. However, in view of the
rapid rate of expansion, the heavy capital commitment which it is under-
taking, and the fact that the debt/equity ratio limitation does not con-
trol the terms of lending, IBTE has agreed that its maximum future debt
service will be covered 1.5 times by net revenue (before charging
depreciation) of a 12-month period prior to the incurring of new debt.
IX.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      The 1968-73 program is technically sound and well designed to
meet the essential telecommunication needs of Ethiopia. Estimates of
costs are reasonable, procurement procedures and financial proposals
are satisfactory. IBTE is well organized and its operations are rea-
sonably efficient. In some areas, however, there is room for improvement.
IBTE's financial position is sound and expected to remain so. The ar-
rangements for financing the program are satisfactory and IBTE should be
able to meet an adequate proportion of the costs out of earnings. The pro-
gram is suitable for a Bank loan of US$h.5 million for a term of 20 years
including a grace period of four and a half years.

Outline of Principal Items in IBTE's 1968-1973 Expansion Program
LOCAL TELEPHONE SERVICE
Growth in Number of Telephones
1.       The installed capacity of the local exchanges in Ethiopia at the
end of 1967 was 32,220 lines (Filwoha exchange is taken as 8,500 lines and
not 9,500 lines). The schemes included in project 441-ET and now in pro-
gress would provide an additional 2,800 lines. The current program of ex-
pansion will add a further 29,900 lines. This will bring the installed
capacity to a total of 64,920 by the end of 1973.
2.       The anticipated number of telephones forecast at the end of each
year is given below:

Exchange Facilities
3.       The installation program consists of expanding some of the
existing automatic exchanges; in the case of Addis Ababa the installation
will be new exchange units in the same building as the existing Arada
and Filwoha exchanges. The program also includes the addition of about
7,000 lines of manual exchange capacity. The table below gives the
program in detail:

to be completed in December 1969.
5/ This figure is tentative. The program will follow general require-
ments.
Urban Network
4.        The program in respect of urban network - primary and secondary
cables, terminating boxes, cabinets, etc. - has been drawn up to be in
line with the expansion program and the growth in the number of tele-
phones. An extension of the cable network by approximately 110,000 pair
km has been provided for, based on the trends in recent years. This
includes the additions covered by the continuing works from the project
covered by Loan 441-ET.
Subscriber Plant
5.        This program includes all works from the secondary cable ter-
minal to the subscriber's telephone (inclusive) - small cables, drop
wire, subscriber fittings, PBX's and telephone instruments of various
kinds. The provision is in line with the growth of telephones in the
1968-1973 program.



Page 3 of 6
LONG-DISTANCE FACILITIES
6.        The long-distance program consists of the following:
(a) microwave and VHF/UHF radio relay systems to
interconnect the main urban centers;
(b) erection of open wire lines and associated
open wire carrier telephone equipment, VHF
small capacity systems (one to six channels)
to provide additional capacity on secondary
routes and to extend the network to new areas;
(c) the installation of manual and automatic toll
exchanges to handle the long-distance traffic.
(a)  Microwave and VHF/UHF Radio Relay Systems
7.        Addis Ababa-Asmara will be provided with a microwave system
having a capacity of providing ultimately 960 telephone circuits with
one working and one standby (1 &-l) radio equipment. There will be four
terminal stations at Addis pbaba, Dessie, Makale and Asmara. The as-
sociated multiplex equipment at these stations will provide initially
the following number of circuits:
Addis Ababa-Asmara        168 circuits
Addis -,Ibaba-Dessie       60
Dessie-Asmara              24
I'akale-Asmara            24
The number of circuits between these stations can easily be increased
at a small additional cost by installation of additional multiplex
equipment.
8.        The system will have,in addition to the four terminal stations,
seventeen heterodyne repeaters and four terminal repeaters (a terminal
repeater consists of three transmit-receive microwave equipment arranged
to branch off from the main route).  Provision has been made in the esti-
mate for the infrastructure - buildings, access roads, tower foundations,
power supplies, etc.
This system is expected to be commissioned in 1972.
9.        Addis Ababa-Harrar.  The engineering features of this route
will be similar to the Addis Ababa-Asmara route with microwave equipment
(1 & 1) capable of providing ultimately 960 circuits. There will be
four terminal stations at Addis Ababa, Nazareth, Dire Dawa and Harrar.
The multiplex equipment at these stations will provide the following num-
ber of circuits:



ANTEXX 5
Page 4 of 6
Addis Ababa-Nazareth        48 circuits
Addis Ababa-Dire Dawa      120    "
Dire Dawa-Harrar            36    "
10.       The detailed route and site selections are yet to be taken up
but,Tbased on a study of the maps, it is expected to have, in addition
to the four terminal stations, five heterodyne repeaters and two terminal
repeater stations. The cost estimates include the infrastructure.
This system is expected to be commissioned in 1972.
11.       Addis Ababa-Jimma and Addis Ababa-Shashemane routes are re-
quired to connect Addis Ababa with Jimma (46 circuits) and with Shashamane
(24 circuits). On a preliminary study based on maps, two separate routes
have been proposed using microwave systems (1 & 1) capable of providing
120 circuits on each of the routes.
12.       The Addis Ababa-Jimnmasystem will, in addition to the two ter-
minals at Addis Ababa and Jimma, have five intermediate repeaters and
the Addis Ababa Shashemane system will, in addition to the two terminals,
have three intermediate repeaters.
13.     - The routes will be further studied with a view to providing, if-
possible, a more economical route configuration, and if more advantageous,
to use systems in the UHF range of frequencies.
These systems are expected to be commissioned in 1973,
14.       Asmara-Tessenei.  This system configuration will be similar to
the Addis Ababa-Jimma system.  It will have terminal stations at Asmara
and Tessenei as well as a double terminal at Agordat and will provide
circuits between Asmara, Agordat and Tessenei (a total of 54 circuits).
The system will connect up with the Sudan network when the route from
Sudan is completed to Tessenei.
The system is expected to be completed in 1971.
15.       Yirgalem-Moyale.  This is a small capacity (24 channels ultimate)
system, and will have, in additiontto the two terminal stations, five
intermediate stations with double terminals.   The system will thus not
only provide communication to Moyale and on to the Kenya network but also
to the intermediate stations.
The system is expected to be completed in 1971,
(b) Secondary Network
16.       The program envisages the erection of 3,000 km of new open wire
routes and the reconstruction and extension of 2,000 km of open wire
routes and will be carried out at the rate of about 600 km of new



Page 5 of 6
and 400 km of reconstruction every year.   The program is intended
to open up new areas and provide extra capacity on the secondary routes
and has been drawn up on the basis of using open wire lines. However,
IBTE intend to examine cases where VHF small capacity (one to six cir-
cuits) systems are likely to be advantageous, and will substitute these
systems instead. The open wire lines - new and existing - will be
equipped with carrier systems also to increase the number of circuits
where needed.
(c) Toll Exchanges
17.       Automatic transit exchanges of the four wire type will be
installed in Addis Ababa, Dessie and Asmara.   In addition, ancillary
equipment will be added to the exchanges in Nazareth and Dire Dawa to
provide automatic toll working on a two wire basis in these stations.
The capacity, in terms of long distance lines, in these places is.

The actual capacity of each of these exchanges will be greater by the
number of circuits from the toll exchanges to the local exchanges in
each of these stations - these are expected to be approximately equal to
the number of long-distance circuits.
18.       In addition, a number of manual toll Dositions - about 64 -
will be installed to handle all traffic which is not set up by subscriber
dialing via the toll automatic exchanges.
TELEGRAPH AIND TELEX FACILITIES
19.       The telegraph facilities will be extended by the addition of
50 teleprinters - 30 in Latin and 20 in Amharic script. These will be
installed in the larger stations.
20.       In respect of telex, the newly installed automatic telex ex-
change in Addis Ababa will be extended by 200 lines. The telex manual
exchange,-which has been replaced by automatic equipment recently, in
Addis Ababa will be moved to Asmara to provide additional capacity. An
increase of 200 telex subscribers is envisaged - 180 using Latin and 20
using Amharic teleprinters.
21.       The number of telegraph circuits will be increased essentially
by the installation of error correcting multiplex telegraph terminals
(14UX/ARQ) - six four-channel MUX/ARQ and four single-channel ARQ equip-
ment together with the ancillaries - to work over HF radio equipment.

The facilities in the existing radio stations in Ethiopia will be in- -
creased slightly to cope with the increased requirements for telegraph,
telex and leased circuits.
These will be completed progressively through the program
period.
International Communication
22.       The high frequency radio transmitting and receiving stations
in Addis Ababa will be expanded slightly by the addition of three 10 kw
transmitters, five single side band, five dual diversity and two FSK re-
ceivers, together wlith associated radio telephone terminals, aerials, etc.
An HF monitoring station will also be set up to improve and assist the
operations.
These expansion schemes are expected to be completed in the
first half of 1971.
Buildings
23.       Except for the IBTE headquarters'administrative building in
Addis Ababa, the building program is largely in respect of housing tech-
nical installations. Most of the buildings are small ones to house small
exchanges. Amongst the larger ones will be the extension to the training
center, extension to the Filwoha building, extension of the Asmara car-
rier room, the Assab auto exchange building and a new exchange building
at Bahar Dar. The construction schedule for the buildings will be in
line with the installation schedules of equipment.
Miscellaneous
24.       These comprise largely of motor vehicles required in connection
with the construction activities and replacement of old vehicles, equip-
ment and training aids for the training center, and other auxiliaries
consisting of miscellaneous test equipment, tools, etc.

ETHIOPIA
IMPERIAL BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA
Growth Forecast of the Telephone Network
1.        The two main areas of investment in the 1968-1973 program are
the local exchange systems and the long-distance facilities, especially
of the main interurban microwave and VHF/UHF systems. The expansion
plans are based essentially on the expected growth rate of demand for
telephone facilities and are discussed below.
Local Telephone System
2.        IBTE has compiled data on the increase in the number of tele-
phones in each of the existing exchanges. The overall rate of growth for
the whole of Ethiopia has averaged 17% over the last six years but the
rates of growth of individual exchanges have varied over a wide range.
3.        A major part of the expansion program is in respect of Addis
Ababa and Asmara exchange systems which now account for about 84% of
the telephones in Ethiopia and which have a high growth rate. The fore-
casting and planning of these exchanges require special care.
4.        The planning of the smaller exchanges has been based generally
on the extrapolation of the historic growth trend in each of these ex-
changes. The marginal investments needed for providing extra capacities
are small in respect of such exchanges. The actual expansion program
in respect of these exchanges is drawn up each year and necessary adjust-
ments to the program can easily be accommodated.
Addis Ababa
5.        Addis Ababa now has two exchanges - Arada and Filwoha - with
a total installed capacity of 18,500 lines. At the end of 1967, there
were 13,550 connected lines with a total of 20,890 telephones. The
overall annual rate of growth of connected lines for the whole system
has been about 18.3% in the period 1962-1967, although the rates of
growth in the two exchanges have been different. The average number
of calls per connected line has been about 2,200 per year (1,400 per tele-
phone) - a high usage for a system in which the charges are based on the
number of calls made.
6.        The present expansion plans for Addis Ababa provide for an
addition of 16,000 lines taking the capacity to 34,500 lines at the end
of -1973. The expansion of large telephone exchanges is a continuous
process and additions are made as required, based on actual experience,
by taking up further expansion in time - about two years ahead - for new
capacity to be available before the previous capacity in the exchanges
is used up.



A.NmX 6
Page 2 of h pagep
7.           The increase in capacity of Addis Ababa provides for a
rate of growth of 13% per year up to the end of 1975 - on the assumption
that additional expansion is started only after this period viz, in 1974,
This rate of growth is conservative as compared with the previous average
growth rate of 18.3% per year.
8.           The growth rate in the past few years in Addis Ababa has
been very much higher than in other countries. IBTE does not expect
that this will continue. It is also the experience in other countries
that the growth rate tends to decrease as the density of telephones -
number of telephones per 100 of population - increases. Based on these
considerations the IBTE program might be in line with the future demands.
9.           If however the growth rate is higher than the planned 13%
per year, the capacity now provided in this project will be used up
before 1975. If this happens it will be necessary to take up further
additional expansion in this program period. The experience up to
1970 or 1971 will provide a reliable guide as to the actual requirements.
On the basis of taking up additional expansion in 1971, IBTE can cope with
a rate of growth of up to 181% per year.
Asmara
10.          The approach in deciding on the expansion requirements of
Asmara has been similar to that followed in Addis Ababa. IBTE's task
in forecasting the demand in Asmara is particularly difficult in view
of an acute shortage of capacity of exchange equipment and cables which
has prevailed more or less continuously up to now.
11.          Asmara had about 1,400 connected telephones in 1956, in-
creasing to about only 1,500 in 1964. Lack of capacity up to 1964 was
alone responsible for the negligible growth during this period. Asmara
had, at the end of 1967, an installed capacity of 4,000 lines with 3,860
connected lines and 5,o30 telephones. The rates of growth were 0, 0, 71,
22, 19, and 5% per year respectively in the years 1962 to 1967. The
growth rate has largely depended on the availability of capacity in the
system. The actual experience is therefore of no use in forecasting the
demand in the years ahead. IBTE expects however that there is great
similarity between Asmara and Addis Ababa in respect of the pattern of
growth which may therefore be about 13% per year again on a conservative
basis,
12.          Gn theteeffu4tion that no further additions are started
before the end of 1973 - viz, the present capacity is to serve the needs
up to the end of 1975 until new capacity becomes available - the program
provides for an average growth of 13%a. However, as in the case of Addis
Ababa, it is possible for IBTE to use up the capacity faster than plarned
and be able to accommodate a higher rate of growth of up to 18%; in this
case additional expansion works would have to be started in the period
before 1973 depending on the actual requirements.

Long-distance Netvork
13.      The inadequacies of the long-distance facilities in Ethiopia
have been dealt with in paragraphs 3.03 and 3.04 of the report. Since
the service provided has been subject to long delays and generally un-
reliable, the experience of the previous years is not of much use in
making forecasts for the future.
14.      The experience in other countries is that the rate of growth
of long-distance calls is much higher, as much as twice, than the growth
rate of telephones.  In Ethiopia, the growth rate of telephones has been
very high at about 17% per year. It would therefore be reasonable to
expect long-distance calls to increase at 20% to 30% per year if the
service is reasonably good.
15.      The actual growth of long-distance telephone calls in Ethiopia
is given below:
Year         Growth               Year          Growth
1954           4                  1961           2.7
1955          17.2                1962            3.6
1956          22.5                1963          12.3
1957          12.6                1964           21.6
1958           8.2                1965           31.1
1959          14.5                1966          27.3
1960           1.6                1967           2.8
The high growth rates have been in years when extra facilities were pro-
vided and the low rates when these facilities became inadequate. The
average growth rate has been only about 13% per year.
16.      Taking all the above factors into account, IBTE has forecast
that the traffic will be about five to six times the present traffic in
1974 in the different routes based on an increase of traffic at 15% per
year up to the time when the microwave or VHF/UHF routes come into
operation, thereafter an increase of 60% and 40% in the subsequent two
years and a growth of 25% per year in the years up to 1974. This fore-
cast appears reasonable.
17.      Fortunately, with the availability and use of modern micro-
wave and UHF/VHF and other systems, forecasting of the traffic - and
circuit - requirements does not have to be very accurate. With these
systems, the costs increase only marginally with a large increase in the



AINNEX 6
Page- Tof 4 pages
capacity of the route; hence these are designed to provide ample capacity
as is now proposed in Ethiopia. The terminal multiplexing equipment
is being provided in Ethiopia to fit in with the 1974 forecasts as given
in paragraph 16 above. It is possible to add on equipment to provide
extra circuits easily and quickly at a small cost, based on actual ex-
perience after these routes become operational.

2.        Capital costs of the program are taken from the Sources and
Application of Funds statements where they are shown under the years 1968
through 1973 (see Annex 13).  The benefits are the estimated additional
revenues directly produced from the program less the additional operating
expenses, exclusive of depreciation, and are derived from the income state-
ments (Annex 12).
3.        In calculating the benefits after 1973, the figures do not take
into account part of the net benefits which will accrue from the 1968-1973
program when multiplex equipment will be added to the network. The bene-
fits may therefore be underestimated.
4.        The calculations, based on the figures in the table above, show
that the increased revenue from the new investment would yield a rate of
return of about 15% at current prices.

IMPERIAL BOARD OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA
Financial Organization
The undermentioned resume sets out the main problems which
were found in IBTE's financial organization.
1. Finance Manager
One of IBTE's major problems in recent years and the principal
reason for the deterioration of its financial organization has been the
absence of an experienced financial officer. In 1968, IBTE was able to
recruit such a person and some improvement is now being shown. However,
the financial management of IBTE and especially the position and role of
the Finance Manager calls for review.
The finance division is one of three divisions which form IBTE's
administrative department, the other two being the supply division which
covers purchasing, stores, transport and workshops, and the administration
division which embraces personnel, training, 0 & M, and legal services0
IBTE's organizational chart (See Annex 8) shows the three divisional mana-
gers to be responsible to a departmental manager who in turn is responsible
to the general manager. At the present time the post of the departmental
manager is vacant.
This organization is unsatisfactory since it does not give the
officer responsible for finance adequate authority to formulate, implemont,
and control IBTE's financial policy.  It is therefore necessary for a ncr
post of Finance Manager to be created within the organization. The hold3r
of this office must be made directly responsible to the General Manager
for all financial administration and his duties and responsibilities mll ;
be clearly defined.
2. Collection Department
IBTE's receivables have been high during recent years particu.-
larly in the Addis Ababa region. Notwithstanding an improvement in the
settlement of Government accounts, the introduction of mechanized billing
and outside collectors, much more is still required to be done in this
field.
There is a general' lack of "tknow how"t in collection procedures
and particularly in the organization of a collection department to operate
with mechanized billing. The procedures in the Addis Ababa collection
office require simplifying, and wherever possible greater use should be
made of the computer for producing collection office data.



1,,-r  9
Page 2 of 3
-    As regards the actual collection of subscribers bills in Addis
Ababa, IBTE has never adopted the recognized and successful procedure of
"barring" non-paying subscribers and has permitted excessive subscriber
credit before disconnection. Stricter and more methodical procedures are
required for dealing with non-paying subscribers; this would enable bad
debts to be reduced, collection procedure to be simplified and therefore
collection costs improved. In addition, working canital requirements would
be less.
In the regions outside Addis Ababa, the collection record is much
better but a review of manual billing procedures is required if demands for
additional clerical staff from regional management are to be avoided. The
necessary improvements could be completed by June 30, 1970.
3. Supply
IBTE's inventories are too high.  Although the management contend
that suppliers' long delivery dates, difficulties of shipping and a widely
dispersed network necessitate the holding of large stocks, the mission
were unanimuiously of the opinion that they were too high for an undertaking
of IBTEts size. Evidence of over-ordering was pointed out, holdings of
certain items being sufficient to cover the requirements for three years.
As a preliminary to the reduction of stocks, inventory levels require to
be reviewed in the light of future requirements, and ordering strictly
controlled.  It is impossible to overlook the fact that this situation calls
for better coordination between engineering planning and the supply divi-
sion, and improved financial management. Taking into account the time re-
quired to set up the new Planning Branch (see para. 7.04) and to adjust
stock levels, IBTE should be able to correct its supply problems by December
31, 1971.
4. Accounting and Costing
In order to Provide management with the essential information to
accurately plan its activities and to control their execution, it is neces-
sary for IBTE to have a costing system based on modern concepts and a newl
accounting plan. Weakness in both of these fields, particularly in the
allocation of costs, was clearly brought out during the appraisal of the
capital costs of the program and related operating income and expenditure.
IBTEls Board recognize the defects in present costing methods and have
agreed to establish a costing section within the Financial Division which
will be responsible for preparing and operating a new system. A revised
accounting plan is at present unders tudy. IBTE should be allowed until
December 31, 1971 to complete the work which would include the basic pre-
paratory work for the mechanization of the costing.
5. Data Processing
To improve subscribers' billing and provide for the future ex-
pansion of IBTE's financial services, the management entered into a rental
coiltract for a small IBM ccmputer which was delivered in mid-1966.



AN1NEX 9
Page 3 of 3
Development of the use of the computer has been slow and up to
the present time, it has only been used for the processing of the monthly
bills for the Addis Ababa subscribers (about 21,000 telephones). The
machine is underemployed and therefore costly for the work which it is per-
forming. The computerization of salaries and wages is expected to be car-
ried out within the next six months, but even after that work is completed,
there will still be too much spare capacity on the machine, and, although
IBTE is considering the mechanization of stores and cost accounting, a
period of not less than two years will be required before the work can ef-
fectively be transferred. Having committed themselves to computerization
and to help in reducing the present high cost of the work performed by the
machine, IBTE urgently requires advice on extending its use, possibly to
the billing work for the Asmara region. IBTE is hoping to have the services
of a data processing expert to advise on these problems. In addition, the
chief of the data processing section is being sent to the United States for
an appropriate course of instruction under the auspices of American Aid.
IBTE should be able to regularise this situation by December 31, 1972.
6. Internal Audit
IBTE's internal audit group is in the early stages of its forma-
tion and considerable time must elapse before it can be fully efficient.
Additional suitable staff require to be selected and trained and new audit
programs need to be prepared and put into operation. Later, the work of
the group should be extended to cover certain inspection duties carried
out in the technical divisions. IBTE should aim at having an efficient
internal audit group by December 31, 1971.

DPERIAL BOARD OF TE=ECOIDUNICATIONS OF ETHIOPIA
Notes on Financial Statements
A. Balance Sheets in Annex No. 11
1.      Gross plant for the year 1967 includes a sum of Eth$2.6 million
for the revaluation of land (see para. 8).
2.      Work in progress at December 31, 1963, through 1973 has been
assumed to be equal to 40% of the sum total of the work in progress
brought forward plus the gross capital construction for the year.
3.      Accounts receivable assume that IBTE will show a reasonable
relative improvement in its outstanding receivables.
4.      Accrued revenue provides for higher unbilled revenue at the end
of each year.
5.      Inventories (including goods in transit) assume that IBTE wi]l
effect some reduction in the level of stocks, taking into account the
increased network.
6.      Current liabilities for 1968 take into account the conversion
of a current liability of Eth$2.0 million to the Public Service Pension
Commission into a long-term loan. Increases in current liabilities for
subsequent years are related to IBTEls increased development.
7.      Share cal-ital for Eth$7.7 million was issued between 1952 and
1956 for Eth$4.0 million cash and against the receipt of goods for
Eth$3.7 million acquired under the first IBRD loan to the Ethiopian
Government. Share capital was further increased as at Decernber 31,
1967, to Eth$20.0 million by the capitalization of reserves, Eth$11.3
million being transferred from Capital Reserve and Eth$1.0 million from
Expansion and Renewal Reserve. The capital is composed of 20,000
shares of Eth$1,000 each.
8.      Capital Reserves, Eth$8.7 million, related to the land, fixed
and current assets taken over by the IBTE from the Government on
January 1, 1953.  Following the findings of a Committee of Experts ap-
pointed by the Ministry of Finance, the value of land was increased by
Eth$2.6 million on December 31, 1967, and a total of Eth$11.3 million
was converted to Share Capital at that date (see previous paragraph).

Page 2 Df 2
9.        Expansion and Renewals Reserve consists of accumulations of
annual net surpluses. Approximately Eth$1.0 million from this account
was converted to Share Capital on December 31, 1967 (see paragraph 7).
10.       Long-term debt excludes current maturities.
B. Income Statement in Annex No. 12
11.       Telephone revenue
(a) Installation fees have been forecast on the basis of the
estimated number of telephones to be installed during each year.
(b) Rental and Urban, Interurban and International calls and
other revenue have been forecast on the basis of the estimated average
number of telephones in operation during each year.
12.       Internal and international telegraph revenues have been assumed
to increase at an annual rate of  21  and 6% respectively.
13.       Telex revenue has been forecast on the basis of an annual in-
crease of 1%.
14.       Operating expenses,other than depreciation, have been projected
on a basis of a 12~ annual increase.
15.       Depreciation has been assumed at a composite rate of 4% on
the annual average gross fixed assets in service.
C. Source and Application of Funds in Annex No. 13
16.       Capital construction figures for the years 1963 through 1967
have been adjusted to show gross construction costs rather than construction
costs after plant withdrawals.
17.       Variation in working capital shows increases or decreases in
net current assets other than cash together with adjustments relative to
gross construction costs as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
