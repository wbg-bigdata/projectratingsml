1. THE SECTOR
Indigenous Sources of Energy
1.01      Haiti's indigenous energy resources are limited to hydro power
and some coal (lignite). Four sites suitable for hydro developments have
been identified 1/ on the Artibonite river downstream from the existing 47 MW
Peligre plant, Electricite d'Haiti's (EdH) only larger hydro station. On the
Guayamouc river, a tributary to the Artibonite, additional potential could
be developed at two small dams that would be constructed to decrease siltation
of the Peligre reservoir 1/. The aggregate installed capacity of these new
developments would be about 90 MW, generating about 550 GWh/a.
1.02      Small lignite fields have been identified 1/ at Maissade and Camp
Perrin. A preliminary investigation of Maissade initially indicated reserves
sufficient for development of a steam power station, but subsequent more
detailed surveys financed by the Federal Republic of Germany, have cast some
doubts on this conclusion. The lignite deposits now appear smaller and more
exploration is needed to reach a final conclusion.
1.03      Charcoal is used extensively for domestic and small industrial
purposes; highly valued trees, e.g. mahogany, are still felled for its
production. A Bank energy mission which visited the country in 1980 2/
estimates that, in 1979, wood accounted for about 72% of Haiti's gross energy
use of some 69 x 1012 Btu, bagasse (sugarcane waste) for 8%, petroleum products
for 17%, and hydro power for 3%. Due to the high use of wood, much of the
country has been denuded of trees; land erosion is progressing rapidly and
considerable areas of once fertile land have been stripped of soil.
1.04      Various public institutions in Haiti are at present engaged in
evaluating solar energy technologies, windpower, ethanol production from
sweet sorghum, etc. Although some of these technologies have been economi-
cally proven in specific instances, they are unlikely to have a substantial
impact on the energy supply situation; furthermore, they divert the scarce
technical and managerial capability from more urgent development objectives,
and in the case of the ethanol project, implies sub-optimal use of already
scarce land.
1.05      Haiti's large agricultural sector offers opportunities for con-
verting agro-industrial waste products into usable forms of energy. However,
further investigation 1s required to determine the volumes and geographic
location of potential materials (besides sugar bagasse which is already
being used (1.03)), such as those derived from coffee, cotton, vetiver,
urban waste, etc., before alternative technologies and demonstration plants
can be considered.

1.06      The siltation of the multipurpose Peligr s reservoir has increased
markedly from the original estimate of some 3.3 Mm /a in 196  to 6.5 Mmn3/a
in 1980 and its useful volume has declined from about 470 Mm 2to 375 Mm
Annual silk carried by the river increased from some 280 t/km .a to
1,500 t/km .a; the reservoir may be complet2ly filled around the year 2020.
It is estimated that presently about 2.6 km of agricultural and forest lands
is los  each year of the upstream Thomonde and Samana basins (total area
343 km ). Siltation could be decreased by about 30% by the construction of
two small dams on the Guayamouc river. A further decrease of some 40% could
be made, should it be feasible to construct a dam in the region of the border
with the Dominican Republic. Finally, embankment improvements, reforestation
and improvement of land use would allow an extention of the useful life of the
reservoir still more. Because the irrigated area fed by the Artibonite river
is relatively small (24,000 ha) it would be largely unaffected in the medium
term (some 20 years) by the siltation problem. The main beneficiary of any
reduction in siltation during this period would be hydro power since any
power plant would, to a large extend, be converted from the regulated type
of generation to the run of the river type. The design of any new plant,
therefore, depends on the timing of upstream actions to be taken to
decrease siltation. First priority has been given to plans to close the
Guayamouc river, i.e., to impound silt in an additional reservoir. The
Government is also planning to create a special agency to follow-up on
consultants' recommendations for improved land use and contacts have been
made with the Dominican Republic to investigate the feasibility of construct-
ing a further dam on either side of the border.  The proposed third credit
would finance the Guayamouc surveys and detailed study.  A dam alignment study
and an optimization study of future dams and power facilities in the basin is
being financed by the Association's second credit (895-HA).
1.07      Haiti is wholly dependent on imported oil derivates since the country
neither has local petroleum sources nor a refinery.  The estimated 1979
consumption was 1.79 Mbbl, of which 15% was consumed by the cement factory, 3%
by bauxite production, 9% by EdH, 38% by road transport, 10% by aviation, and
the remaining 25% by others, including some 2% in gas and 3% in kerosene for
household purposes. Although surveys have indicated the possibility of some
off-shore oil, exploratory efforts have, so far, been unsuccessful. However,
it is possible that oil fields of some significance could be found in the
foreseeable future, once more exploration is carried out.
Sector Organization and Regulation
1.08      EdH, an autonomous Government agency, is the sole entity responsible
for power supply in Haiti. It was established in 1971 to take over the
Government-owned Peligre hydro plant and the privately owned Compagnie
d'Eclairage Electrique of Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien, whose concession
expired that year. In 1974, it was also entrusted with the operation of
various isolated power facilities in the provinces, mostly Government-owned.



-
1.09      The authority to regulate the power sector is vested in the President
of the Republic of Haiti and exercised through key officials who also form
EdH's Board of Directors (2.03). There is no separate regulatory body as such,
and EdH's 1971 decree, as amended in 1977, states that tariffs, as well as
investment programs and borrowings, are to be approved by the President of
the Republic with the advice of the Board.
IDAs Participation in the Sector
1.10      In 1976, the Association made its first credit (645-HA, MUS$16.0)
for power development in Haiti, covering investments for 1976-78. The benefi-
ciary was EdH.  The Association made its second credit (895-HA, MUS$16.5)
in 1979 covering 1979-82, complemented by funds from the European Economic
Community (EEC, Special Action Credit 4-HA of MUS$6; with IDA acting as
Administrator) and by a grant (MCan$17.1) from the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA). Further assistance, on an annual basis is provided
by the Federal Republic of Germany through the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau
(KfW). These international financing agencies meet annually in Port-au-Prince
with EdH to discuss future financing possibilities for the power sector. The
most recent meeting, in March 1980, also included the Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) which is now financing the la Chapelle hydro development study
(the next largest hydro developent after Peligre) and may assist in financing
this plant located downstream from Peligre. At the time of the first credit,
the Association recommended carrying out a five-year program (now effectively
7 years) in two stages, in view of financial constraints on both external
and counterpart funds and the need to strengthen EdH institutionally before it
undertook larger investments. The first and second projects overlapped and
in most respects constitute a single program.
111      The main objectives of the IDA-assisted projects were technical and
institutional, to provide a sound basis for long-term development. Haiti
had a history of power shortages, obsolete facilities and lack of managerial,
technical and administrative skills. Technically, the first project addressed
the need to promptly install 21 MW additional diesel generating capacity in a
new powerstation (Varreux), followed by another 21 MW in the same station under
the second project. Institutionally, EdH was to be reorganized and freed from
unnecessary government interference while technical assistance was to be provided
For engineering, supervision and training. In these respects, the first and
second project covered the same objectives and can hardly be distinguished.
1.12      A Project Performance Audit Report on the first power project, 1/
concluded that the project's institutional objectives were largely fulfilled,
whereas the technical ones were only partly fulfilled due to substantial
contractors' delays in the colmissioning of the Varreux power station.
The realization of the second project's associated technical and institutional
objectives suffered a setback in early 1979 when, due to internal controversies
in EdH concerning the IDA financed contract for the Varreux station, work was
delayed for about one year. When a new cabinet was formed at that time, the
new minister responsible for the sector dismissed the General Manager, the
Technical Director and the consultants whom he deemed responsible for the
delays, without prior consultation with IDA. These occurrences caused serious
1/   Sec. M80-948 of December 30, 1980.



- 4 -
repercussions in EdH, a delay of about one year in effectiveness of the second
credit and delays up to one and a half years in both the institutional and
technical aspects. Cost increased commensurately which, in turn, forced a cut
in the project, mainly in distribution, in order to remain within the funds
available. By allowing overlapping consulting services, the Association has
endeavoured to minimize the effect of these occurrencies. The new general
consultants (Hydro-Quebec International, Canada), as could be expected,
differed in opinion from the previous consultants on how to reach objectives
and needed time to adjust to the particular situations in EdH. The consultants
for improving EdH's administration (Price Waterhouse of Canada) were engaged
with several months delay. Similarly, CIDA's consultants for the second
project (BELT of Canada) were engaged 8 months late; in total the CIDA program's
main component, transmission, is expected to be about 12 months late. The
only component that was not delayed by more than 3 months was the main techni-
cal item in the IDA/EEC project: the extension of the Varreux power'.station.
The contractor was able to decrease the estimated completion time of 27 months
to about 20 months. Renovation of the Port-au-Prince network, however, has
not even started due to design changes and because of the mobilization time
needed by the new consultants.
1.13      The present situation is as follows:
(a)  EdH has implemented substantial organizational changes and is in
the process of introducing further important steps, particularly
in the financial departments, as suggested by Price Waterhouse.
Experienced staff is still largely lacking, but on-the-job
training has markedly improved administrative capabilities.
(b)  A number of engineers, accountants and technicians were trained
substantially as envisioned under the first project. A training
center for lower level technicians, financed by the first credit,
was opened in March 1980. A similar center for diesel station
operators would be ready in August 1982 under the second project.
After a delay of about one year, training of specialists started
again and local training by experts from the general consultants is
under way. A subsequent program which would be financed by the
third project, has been designed to ensure continuity.
(c)  A new tariff structure and rates were instituted under the first
project. This, coupled with improvements in operating efficiency,
has resulted in the present satisfactory financial situation of
EdH. The latter, however, is also in part the result of lower than
anticipated investments, due to the technical delays referred to
above (1.12).
(d)  The first phase (21 MW gross) of the power station at Varreux,
financed by the first credit, was completed (15 months late) in June
1978. Due to cooling system deficiencies, the station cannot be
operated at more than 90% of capacity and it has suffered many
unscheduled outages due to poor contractor performance and lack of
experience in maintenance procedures. However, actions to improve
the situation have been taken since the new consultants have been
appointed. A team of diesel experts have evaluated the technical
conditions at Varreux, identifying as the main problems unsatisfactory



erection-workmenship of the auxiliaries and underdimensioning of the
lub-oil heat exchangers. This is expected to be corrected after the
Varreux extension (see below) is operational, i.e. in 1982. A
diesel expert/operator from the consultants was assigned to train
personnel at Varreux. A two-year maintenance sub-contract was
included in the contract for the Varreux extension, as well as a
training component for the initial period of operation. Negotiations
are underway with a brewery to allow access to an ample source of
cooling water rather than the municipal potable water system. The
cooling system for the Varreux extension is of the radiator, air-cooled,
type. The 21 MW (net) extension, financed under the second project,
was commissioned by the end of 1981, just prior to the beginning of
the dry season.
(e)  The main transmission lines and substations (first project) were
completed substantially on schedule. For the second project (CIDA
financing) the consultants have redesigned the system, requiring
changes in the present layout. Completion (lines will be doubled,
some added, together with the extension of some existing substation)
is now expected by about September 1983, except for the IDA financed
extension of the substation which connected Varreux to the network
in September 1981.
1.14      The Bank acted as executing agency for two UNDP-financed studies: a
sector study, completed in 1979 and the study of the siltation of the Peligre
reservoir 1/. These studies, together with the CIDA-financed study of the
country's hydro resources, provided the necessary basic information for the
formulation of the development program under the second project and the
proposed project; in fact, these studies largely outline required sector
development until about 1990, subject to timely adjustments in the light of
new and updated information.
Network Standardization
1.15      The existing supply system in Haiti is largely based on American
standards and practices. The frequency is 60 Hz and the supply voltages are:
- High voltage: 115 kV (Peligre - Port-au-Prince);
- Medium voltage: 12.47/7.2 kV and 4.16/2.4 kV;
- Low voltage: 120/240 V - 3 wire, single phase and some
120/208 - 4 wire, three phase.
Under KfW financing, EdH had introduced the European type of network at Cap
Haitian and in the Gonaives-St. Marc-Drouet area (medium voltage 23 kV, low
voltage 120/208 V - 4 wire; 60 Hz). During the March 1981 Sector Meeting, EdH
and the external financing institutions agreed that the further extensions in
the country would be based on American standards. The general consultants are
presently designing the construction standard for networks, which would apply
throughout the country, for submission to a coordinating committee comprising
EdH and the consultants financed by the various financing institutions.

Power Market
1.16      Historical consumption and supply data is available only for
Port-au-Prince as shown below; data has been collected for the provinces only
since 1977 (3.01).

1/   Data has been reanalyzed and differ from previous information.
2/   In GWh and % of generation.
The notable features of this development are that (a) industry's share in the
market increased from about 31% to about 51%; (b) losses declined from 36%
in 1972 to 24% in 1977, but again increased to 27% in 1980 in the aftermath
of EdH's internal difficulties (1.12). It should be noted that generation
in the provinces (3.01), about 27 GWh in 1980, accounts for only about 10% of
total generation.
1.17      The proportion of Haiti's population with access to electricity is
extremely low. By the end of 1980, EdH had about 69,000 consumers, of whom
about 15,000 (18% of total, consuming 9% of total sales) were in the provinces.
Assuming five persons per family among the about 800,000 inhabitants of
Port-au-Prince, connection density in this city would be about 34%, compared
with some 29% in 1977. Access to electricity in the country as a whole
(some 5 million inhabitants) is only 7% compared with about 5% in 1977.
The distribution of energy consumption is very uneven; in Port-au-Prince
nearby half of EdH's residential consumers are presently estimated to
account for only 2.5% of total consumption (3.05), whereas industrial and
commercial consumers together account for about 60%.  The average per capita
generation in the city is about 28 kWh/m. The low level of connection
density and of consumption may be attributed to the extreme poverty of the
population: with a per capita GDP of US$270 in 1980, Haiti is the poorest
nation in the Western Hemisphere and one of the 30 poorest in the world.

Captive Plant
1.18      Little is known about captive plant capacities and generation.  The
largest plants are owned by Ciment d'Haiti (6,250 kW, and an additional 4,000
kW planned), the HASCO sugar factory (2,250 kW) and the Minoteric d'Haiti
(1,000 kW). Some 6,000 kW in small units were imported during the record dry
year 1977 and a large number of small units have been installed all over the
country (e.g., many hotels have their emergency units) but no information
is available on their locations and capacities. A rough estimate sets captive
plant capacity at some 20-25 MW, all thermal type.
Electrification of Provincial Towns and Areas
1.19      Because of financial and planning constraints, EdH has not yet been
able to define a program for rural and village electrification.  A modest
program of rehabilitation in the provinces financed by KfW has virtually been
completed. A new power station was built at Cap Haitien, Haiti's second
largest city. Of the six 850 kW diesel units installed, 4 were financed by
the Government and 2 by the Association. CIDA will finance another 2 units
under the second project. The networks were completely renovated. Additionally,
KfW financed a 3,000 kW hydro plant at Drouet and the renovation of networks
in the St. Marc and Gonaives areas. The Government, mostly on an ad-hoc
basis, has instructed EdH in the last few years to electrify a number of small
villages, for which programs were not included in EdH's annual budgets. Since
1977, this has increased the number of villages with electric service from 12 to
26. A comprehensive village electrification program is desirable and is being
developed by CIDA, which is considering the possibility of further assistance
in financing socially beneficial projects (e.g., rural electrification).
1.20      Although village electrification should be encouraged, EdH's financial
position at present should not be endangered by unscheduled expenditures.
Also, early planning is an obvious requirement for sound development. For
these reasons, the investment limitation covenant under the second project,
stipulating that any single EdH investment in the power sector which exceeds
1% of its net fixed assets requires IDA's agreement, has been expanded to
include the requirement that the aggregate annual amount of unbudgeted invest-
ments in village and rural electrification should not exceed 0.2% of net fixed
assets, unless IDA otherwise agrees.
Sector investment Proram
1.21      Power sector development in Haiti and the sector expansion program
of which the proposed project is part, are based on an elaborate UNDP-financed
"Long-term Pre-investment Study of the Power Sector", executed by the French
consulting firms SOFREMINES and SOFRELEC during 1976-78, and supervised by IDA.
This study has been updated and complemented under the second IDA power project
by a Canadian consortium of consultants led by Hydro-Quebec International (HQI),
who since 1980 have been retained as general consultants to the Haitian national
power company. The conclusion of both studies is that the economic and social
situation of Haiti make it necessary to develop immediately an expansion program
and to invest in the power sector without delay, in order to supply the main
urban centers with electricity. The 1981-86 development program is described
in paras. 4.01-4.02,  The immediate needs (up to about 1984) would be met
largely by the proposed IDA credit, some continuing KfW contributions and the
possible 1DB assistance for EdH's next hydro plant at La Chapelle (about 30 MW).



In essence, possibilities for financial resources for EdH's other future hydro
plants and some additional thermal plant have not yet been identified except to
the extent of EdH's own internal contribution of about 34% (5.05). EdH investment
priorities would be (a) a further increase in generating capacity in Port-au-Prince
in 1984, 1985 and 1987; (b) completion of the La Chapelle hydro plant; (c) comple-
tion of the Guayamouc I hydro plant (as the first high priority step to decrease
siltation); (d) continuation of the renovation of the Port-au-Prince networks;
(e) expansion in the provinces; (f) initiation of construction of the remaining
hydro plants on the Artibonite river; and (g) preparation for a larger thermal
plant addition by the end of this decade or early in the next decade (large
capacity diesel or coal fired steam plant).
Tariffs and Rates
1.22      In 1976, EdH implemented a new tariff structure in Port-au-Prince,
which was later extended to the country as a whole, based on the principle
of marginal costing, but modified to allow social pricing below a certain
level of consumption for low income families and small artisan workshops.
A fuel cost adjustment clause was implemented at the same time to compensate
for fuel cost changes as well as an adjustment clause to take account of
variations in the cost of salaries and materials. The latter clause, however,
was never applied and now appears redundant because the relevant cost increases
are adequately covered under the minimum 8% rate of return covenant included
in the IDA Credit agreements. The frequency of fuel clause adjustments was
changed in late 1979 from a yearly to a quarterly basis, following IDA's
suggestions. Current tariff levels (include fuel surcharge) are about in line
with EdH's long-run marginal cost. The general consultants, as a routine
matter, are reviewing the adequacy of the tariff structure, 5 years after imple-
mentation; this study should be completed no later than September 30, 1982.
1.23      The social part of the rates (Annex 1.1) is reflected in the residential
charge (including fuel adjustment) of USI10.8/kWh for consumption below 30 kWh/m.
The next 170 kWh/m are charged at USJ12.9 and any excess at USJ14.4/kWh.
The minimum monthly bill is US$2.97. Because 43% of EdH's consumers have a
monthly consumption below 30 kWh, a strong social cross subsidization is
apparent (3.05). Cross-subsidization is also strong for the provinces, since
v rage revenues do not even cover the cost of fuel (estimated at USll/kWh).
Although since 1979 the electricity supply in the provinces rose from about 7%
to 10% of the total country supply, the subsidy does not yet pose an undue
financial burden of EdH. However, the company will have to monitor carefully
the revenues-versus-cost situation in the provinces as compared with that of
Port-au-Prince, because of the higher growth in the provinces. A reasonable
balance of relative cross subsidization should be maintained; the forthcoming
updating tariff study (1.22) would provide information on the current and
future level of the cross-subsidy.



2. THE BENEFICIARY
Institutional Framework
2.01      The beneficiary of the proposed IDA credit of MUS$26 would be EdH,
an autonomous Government-owned agency, established by presidential decree in
1971 (1.08) as a corporate entity whose president is the President of the
Republic. The decree specifies that, for ordinary transactions ("travaux
ordinaires"), the president delegates his authority to the Minister of Public
Wo* ks Communications and Transport who is the chairman of EdH's Board of
Directors
2.02      The 1971 decree establishing EdH, and subsequent amendments thereto,
state that the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity
constitute a State monopoly to be exercised through EdH. Notwithstanding
these broad powers, EdH's activities until 1974 were confined to the operation
of the Peligre hydroelectric complex and the diesel facilities and networks
in Port-au-Prince and Cap Haitien because any additional activity would have
overtaxed the company's administrative and technical capacity. Facilities
in the provinces continued to be constructed and operated by private entities,
municipalities and other government agencies (primarily the Institute for
Agricultural and Industrial Development and the Ministry of Public Works5
Communications and Transport). In 1974, EdH began systematically to assume
control of all the public service facilities in the country.
2.03      Policy directives at EdH are set by its (ex-officio) President and
exercised through EdH's Board, comprising the Minister of Public Works,
Communications and Transport (Chairman); the Minister of Finance and Economic
Affairs; the Minister of Commerce and Industry and the governor of the Central
Bank and EdH's General Manager. No sector regulatory agency exists as such;
therefore, as is the case for policy formulation, authority for regulating
EdH is vested in the Presidency and exercised through the key officials on its
Board of Directors. The strong governmental representation in the regulation
and direction of EdH has on the whole, worked reasonably well. The Board has
confined itself to approval of EdH's major investment plans, tariffs, borrowings
and broad policies, and the General Manager has had, in practice, a reasonable
degree of autonomy in directing the company's daily operations.
Organization and Management
2.04      EdH has been organized along functional lines (Annex 2.1) since
about 1977. The company's chief operating officer is the General Manager, who
is appointed by the President of the Republic. He is assisted by three
directors for operations, planning end administration, all of whom are appointed
by the President on the recommendation of the Board of Directors. EdH has
been streamlining its operations and is expected to soon formalize the major
changes introduced in the administrative department in recent months. A new
Chief Internal Auditor was appointed (2.13). Clear lines of responsibilities
have been defined for department heads. Accounting and administrative procedures
have been improved markedly and are expected to continue improving gradually
while on the job training takes place. To this end, the administrative
consulting services would continue to be provided, and financed, under the



- 10 -
proposed credit. Courses have been initiated to prepare EdH personnel for
the installation of an in house mini-computer, because dependence on outside
facilities for billing has been unsatisfactory (many delays have occurred
resulting in substantial delays in the preparation of financial statements).
Warehouse facilities and administration have been upgraded to adequate levels.
A continuing problem is the constraint imposed by the extremely cramped head
office, located in two buildings. This would be solved by construction of
a new single head office building, to be financed by the proposed credit
(4.05).
2.05      Because the present general consultants were contracted only in July
1980, further improvements in EdH's technical departments and sections could
not be initiated concurrently with those of its administrative services.
With the start of renovations of the Port-au-Prince networks in the near
future, chiefs and crews will be trained and procedures clearly defined,
in accordance with methods that are now being designed for the distribution
system by the general consultants. Operation and maintenance procedures have
been improved at Varreux. Similar actions are expected to be introduced
gradually in the provinces in the near future.
2.06      EdH, in mid-1981, employed about 1,050 people (about 1 employee per
65 consumers), of which about 230 are in the provinces. In general, it
continues to lack sufficient depth in managerial, technical and administrative
skills and it is not expected that EdH's onerously high dependency on consul-
tants can be diminished significantly during the execution of the proposed third
project because of EdH's rapid growth, which outstrips training capabilities.
This lack typifies the country's scarcity of personnel with sufficient training
and experience in the power sector. EdH's salaries are modest, ranging from
US$535/m for a recently graduated engineer to US$950 for a department head or
well qualified accountant.  At present EdH has 41 graduate engineers (i.e.,
they constitute about 4% of its work force). Although training programs
financed by the IDA credits have provided specific training to engineers, a
number still do not fill positions commensurately with their education, partly
because they could not - in the past - obtain the necessary experience (under
guidance of experts) in EdH. With the changes to be introduced in the near
future (2.05) this situation should be rectified.
Training
2.07      Under the first project, 20 engineers and technicians were trained
abroad; on the job training was provided for administrative personnel and
EdH constructed a training center for which the equipment was also financed
under the credit. Although training being financed by the second credit
suffered delays (only a senior storekeeper was trained abroad and presently a
few people are being trained by Hydro Quebec in Canada), the program is now
being implemented. Senior staff (e.g., chiefs of the transmission, dispatch,
and meters departments, personnel manager, etc.) will be trained abroad for a
total of 15 m.m. A training specialist will assist the general training center
for about 3 months and other experts will be provided by the consultants as
needed. The program was revised in July 1981 with the assistance of an IDA
training expert. At the same time a program was defined to be carried out
under the third project in order to assure continuity (4.18).



Ii -
Provincial Operations
2.08      Until recently the provincial branches largely operated rather
independently from the head-office except that billing and accounting was done
at Port-au-Prince where requisitions were also processed. Under the second
project, a study was financed to modify the system and the consultants'
recommendations are now being implemented. The objective is to decentralize
activities (except centralized billing and main accounting) as much as possible,
while still maintaining close head-office supervision in the application of
the common rules and regulations. For this purpose, an assistant director
("coordinateur des provinces") was attached to the office of the technical
director, with the responsibilities similar to those of the technical director
for Port-au-Prince but restricted to the provinces. He would also report to
the financial and planning directors, depending on the nature of the activities.
Once enough diesel operator and maintenance people have been trained, a team
would be formed to allow for improved maintenance of diesels in the provinces,
which is still inadequate (to the extent possible small diesel groups are
currently being repaired in Port-au-Prince).
Mana ement Systems, Accounting and Audit
2.09      During preparation of the first power project, consultants (Howell &
Co., USA) had been engaged to train EdH's accounting staff and help set up a
new accounting system (based on the Federal Power Commission Class A system).
Further assistance in the financial and administrative areas has been provided
by Price Waterhouse (Canada) from November 1979 to August 1981, under the
second IDA credit; their program encompassed a wide range of tasks including,
inter alia, the setting up of systems for management reporting, inventory
control and budgetary control, and the drafting of procedural manuals for the
provinces and headquarters. Additional assistance by Price Waterhouse over a
30-month period is included in the proposed project: it provides mainly for
the continuation of the on-going assistance for inventory control and personnel
management as well as training of financial and administrative staff, assistance
in setting up data and filing systems, and services of a data processing expert.
2.10      Upon EdH's request, Price Waterhouse undertook an analysis of the
costs and benefits of acquiring an in-house computer. The study recommended
in favor of such a computer, mainly in view of the unsatisfactory services
currently provided by an external service bureau for EdH's residential billing,
and the low cost of currently available hardware (a mini-computer with a
memory size of 520 kB, at a cost of US$220,000, is deemed sufficient to cover
EdH's needs for the next five years). In addition to billing, priority appli-
cations would be for customers' accounts, inventory control, payroll and
accounting. EdH has hired a data processing specialist who is supervising the
setting up of EdH's data processing systems and ultimately would head a new
data processing department. He would be assisted, over an 18-month period, by
a Price Waterhouse expert, under financing from the proposed credit. The
computer itself is being financed by IDA Credit 895-HA.
2.11      Since 1976, EdH's accounts have been audited by Price Waterhouse
& Co. (Puerto Rico), an independent auditing firm acceptable to IDA, albeit
with some delays caused primarily by EdH's own delays in the preparation of
its internal financial statements. As in previous agreements, EdH should



- 12 -
continue to have its accounts audited annually by external auditors acceptable
to the Association, and to send their reports within four months of the end of
each fiscal year.
2.12      EdH recently reorganized, with the help of Price Waterhouse (Canada),
its internal audit department and appointed as its head a well-qualified
individual recruited from outside, who reports directly to the General Manager.
The new department has already started to perform effectively and its role in
gradually rectifying unsatisfactory practices in EdH will be crucial. For
this reason, and because of the sensitivity attached to his function, the
position of Chief Internal Auditor has been added to those of General Manager
and Directors, that are, under the second credit, to be filled at all times
with competent and experience persons, whose qualifications shall be satis-
factory to IDA.
3. THE POWER MARKET
Historical Data and Existing Power Facilities
3.01      Since the Peligre hydro station was completed in 1971, sales in
Port-au-Prince have grown at an average of 16.4% per year, from 58.5 GWh in
1972 to 197.3 GWh in 1980 (Annex 3.1). Sales in the provinces are presently
about 10% of those in the Port-au-Prince area. Information for the provinces
continues to be unreliable, due to the lack of meters, however the situation
is improving, particularly because the network renovation at Cap Haitien (which
constitutes about one-third of total sales in provinces) has been completed.
Approximate data in the provinces for the last 3 fiscal years is as follows:

3.02      Because of the lack of reliable data for the provinces and their
small share in EdH's sales, the discussion below will concentrate on
Port-au-Prince.



- 13 -
3.03      The sales growth figures for the various consumer categories has
been very erratic, as shown in the following:
Port-au-Prince Growth in Sales (X)
1976   1977   1978   1979   1980
Residential and Commercial                28.3    9.7   10.4   11.1   11.4
Industrial                                24.3    6.6   35.0    6.3   22.9
Public Lighting                           16.7   -7X1   -3.1    3.0    9.2
Others                                    -1.5    4.7   17.9   -3.8   21.0
Overall Growth                            23.8    7.1   21.3    8.1   14.0
The low growth rate in fiscal 1977 was due to the lack of capacity during one
of the driest years on record, which caused extremely severe curtailments,
especially during the dry season (November to April). In the same year, a
sharp increase in rates was implemented, which also may have had some effect
on demand. The relatively low growth rate for 1979 has no obvious explanation,
except the downturn in Haiti's economy during that year. However, although
the economy has not improved, electricity sales increased by 14.0% in 1980.
3.04      System losses and thefts have also been erratic and consistently
high, peaking at 33% of generation in 1973 (as an indication of the unreliability
of the data, it should be noted that under the second project the estimate for
1973 was 42%, whereas a recent re-analysis decreased this figure to 33%). EdH
performance in reducing losses through policing of unregistered connections
and checking of meters has been similarly erratic. Under the first project, a
target was set of reducing losses to 28%. EdH passed the target easily through
vigorous action and reached about 24% in 1976 and 1977. However, the program
ran out of steam and losses reached 31% in 1979, compared with the 1981 target
of 20% set under the second project. Because of the changes in management
and consultants (1.12), policing stagnated and network renovations were not
executed as planned. Due to improper conductor size, excessively long lines
and continued poor maintenance practices, the network is still in a bad
condition. Consequently, the proportion of line losses and thefts is difficult
to estimate. During negotiations, EdH agreed to include in its performance
indicators for Port-au-Prince a loss target of 27% for fiscal year 1982 and
decrease losses by not less than 2% in each subsequent year compared with the
results of the previous year, until a more normal level of 15% is reached.
3.05      As an indication of the poverty of the population, it should be
noted that about 50% (24,000) of the residential consumers in Port-au-Prince
are classified under the so called "social rate" (for consumptions up to
30 kWh per month). They represent 43% of EdH's 55,800 consumers and consume
an average of 20 kWh per month, while contributing only 3.5% of total revenue
(Annex 3.2). Because the minimum monthly charge is US$2.85 this group barely
covers amortization of the capital cost of the house connection and meter (let
alone cost of the network, generating plant and operating cost), and a large
cross subsidization by the richer part of the population--expressed in terms
of electricity consumption--is apparent. 1/
I/   However, because the social group, on average, consumes 20 kWh/m, the
consumers, in effect, pay USfl4.2/kWh, i.e. almost as much as the
highest block of consumers.

3.06      As of July 1981 EdH had 121 MW of installed capacity.  The effective
capacity during the wet season is about 101 MW and about 79 MW during the
dry season; of this, hydro plant represents 46% during the wet season and
only 30% during the dry season. EdH's plants and their capacities (Annex
3.3) are summarized as follows:

1/   Derated to 44 MW for technical reasons.
3.07      Comparing EdH's present capacity with its 1979 capacity, as reported
under the second project, the following should be noted:
(i) No additions have been made in the Port-au-Prince area; in fact
generating capacity decreased because three of the 2,000 kW emergency
groups in the Janvier station, installed in 1977, have been ruined
beyond repair, and two ancient groups have been retired. The cause
is partly lack of adequate maintenance and partly inadequacy of the
Janvier emergency groups (each unit consists of 2 high speed diesels
driving a single generator) for the type of sustained service to
which they were subjected. This issue was raised by the Association
at the time they were acquired by the Government as emergency groups
during the 1977 drought.
(ii) The installation of 3 x 7.6 MW (gross) additional units in Varreux
financed under the second project was completed in December 1981.
(iii) The installed capacity in the provinces doubled in this period from
11.2 MW to 22.6 MW; the main additions were a hydro plant (Drouet,
3.0 MW), diesel plant (6 x 0.825 MW) at Cap Haitien, and several
small diesel units installed by EdH in newly electrified villages or
as larger replacements in villages with existing service (3.4 MW).



- 15 -
3,08      Supply in the provinces continues to be unreliable, due to lack of
trained personnel. Although a training program was started in 1978, it was
only partially effective due to EdH's difficulties that developed in 1979-80
(2.08). The training program is being re-initiated and is expected to improve
the situation in the near future.
Forecasts
3.09      EdH's general consultants have used two models for forecasting future
electricity requirements: trend and econometric. The first investigates the
historic use of electricity (for categories of consumers and overall) over time
and the second assesses the historic relationship between the use of electricity
and one or more socio-economic variables such as gross domestic product (GDP),
population, commercial or industrial data. For overall requirements, the
exponential trend model shows an average annual growth rate of 14.8% for the
next 6 years. Only the relation between electricity production and GDP
provided a meaningful econometric model with an average growth of 15.0%, i.e.,
in close parallel with the trend model. The assumption of a GDP growth 4.0%/a
for the period 1976-83 and 4.3%/a for 1983-90 appears reasonable for basic
forecasts although this is slightly higher than the Government's most recent
short-term target of 3.5%. For residential/commercial consumption, GDP was
again found to be the most significant variable; for street lighting and
Government requirements only the trend model appears appropriate. Due to lack
of data no reasonable reliable forecast could be made for the provinces.
Demand in the provinces has been rising rapidly (in excess of 20%) due to the
fact that in 1977 the Port-au-Prince rates were applied throughout the country,
reducing cost of electricity by a factor 2 or more, depending on the area.
3s10      Among the different scenarios indicated above, two have been retained
for planning purposes for Port-au-Prince. They correspond to the following
economic forecasts:
GDP Growth Forecast
1981-83          1983-86
For planting-up                        4.0%            4.3%
For financial planning                 4.0%            3.5%
EdHKs available generating capacity has been perennially weak and the assump-
tion of a relatively strong economic growth appears appropriate in order
to avoid underinvestments in power as an important basis for such growth.
A conservative forecast should be retained for financial planning in view of
the inherent weaknesses of the Haitian economy. This would also take account
of some elasticity with respect to rate levels that may develop in the medium
term; thermal generation will continue to increase rapidly in the next few
years and rates in current terms are expected to rise commensurately with
higher fuel prices. No historic data is available which could serve as a
basis to estimate the elasticity of consumption in relation to price. Medium
term forecasts will be made annually, to adjust the development program as
closely as possible to real growth.



- 16 -
3.11      Annex 3.4 shows the resulting financial planning forecast for
sales and gross generation. Because of the delay in network renovations
losses have been conservatively assumed to decrease to 27% in 1982 and
by 2%/a in the subsequent years.
3.12      Energy and capacity balances for planting-up purposes were prepared,
using the higher rate of growth (3.09), both for an average hydrological year
and for a dry year, supposed to occur once every 5 years (Chapter 6). The
additions planned for the system would adequately cover market requirements
through 1990, with a reserve equal to the dry year capacity of one unit at
Peligre--which is equal to two larger diesel units out of service--plus 5% of
maximum demand. The additions are the following:
(a)  Varreux diesel plant (3 x 7 MW net) under IDA financing (second power
project); commissioning during November/December 1981;
(b)  Carrefour diesel plant, first stage (2 x 7 MW net) proposed for
IDA financing under the third project, for operation in 1983-84,
and a second stage of 3 x 7 MW net for 1984-1985. In addition, new
thermal generation (diesel units, gas turbines or coal fired
plants) would be required as follows: 21 MW in 1987, 7 MW in 1988,
28 MW in 1989 and 14 MW in 1990.
(c)  Guayamouc I hydroelectric station (3 x 3 MW) for operation in 1986;
(d)  La Chapelle hydroelectric station (2 x 15 MW) for operation in 1986,
with possible IDB financing (subject to the usual caveats of
feasibility and approval);
(e)  Verrettes hydroelectric station (2 x 11 MW); operational in 1988,
and hydroelectric station sites code-named A-177 (2 x 8 MW) and
A-166 (2 x 6 MW) scheduled for operation in 1990; and
(f)  new thermal plant (possibly coal-fired), 50-60 MW in the early
nineties.

4. THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
Development Program
4.01      EdH's 1981-86 development program (Annex 4.1) is expected to cost
about MUS$309 in current prices, excluding interest during construction:
Local    Foreign   Total   % of Total
-              MUS$------------------
Generation                              35.2      174.7    209.9        68
Transmission                             9.4       16.3      25.7        8
Distribution                             3.7       13.5      17.2        6
Various                                 30.0        3.7      33.7       11
Total Construction                      78.3      208.2    286.5        93
Consultants, studies and training        1.8       20.2      22.0        7
TOTAL                                   80.1      228.4    308.5       100
The high cost of the generation component is mainly due to the construction plan
for relatively expensive hydro plants, which either would be completed during the
period (La Chapelle, Guayamouc I) or of which construction would start (3 plants).
Expenditures during 1981-86 for hydro plants amounts to about MUS$137 or about
45% of total cost (66% of the cost of generating plant). The remaining
generation component is largely diesel plants required in Port-au-Prince; by
1987 about 60 MW thermal plant would have to be added. The transmission
component is substantially the work still to be completed under the CIDA part
of the second project in Port-au-Prince (about MUS$11) and the balance consti-
tutes the 115-kV facilities which would connect the La Chapelle hydro plant to
Peligre and Port-au-Prince by 1985-86. Distribution development would largely
comprise rehabilitation and expansion in Port-au-Prince; development in the
provinces (probably about MUS$2 in 1981, rising 10%/a in subsequent years, in
1981 prices) and other routine investments such as consumer connections and
small extensions have been included under "various" development.
4.02      The inclusion of some 90 MW in 5 future hydro plants, costing about
MUS$220 in 1981 prices, or an average of about US$2,500 kW, is defined by the
least-cost development program (6.05). In fact, because Peligre, EdH's only
hydro station, is already operating at full energy capability and the increment
in energy demand would have to be generated thermally, the least cost develop-
ment program requires that all hydro plants should be operational as early as
1987/88. In view of expected physical and financing problems it was assumed
that the hydro development scheme would be completed by about 1990. Even this
may be rather optimistic in view of the large sums to be financed. An all
thermal development, however, would require in 1990 some MUS$40 in foreign
expenditures for fuel alone at 1981 prices, increasing 15-18% annually,
depending on the growth rate.



- 18 -
4.03      The project (4.05) would comprise the next step in generation, a
new 14 MW (net) diesel power station at Carrefour in the western part of
Port-au-Prince, continuation of renovation and a modest extension of the
distribution network, mainly in Port-au-Prince, consulting services and
training. Ongoing works comprise largely the second power project; KfW
financed works in the provinces has practically been completed. KfW will
probably continue to finance two small hydro stations (Saut Mathurine, Caracol)
in the provinces, and the renovation of the network of Jacmel, but no loans
have yet been made. The IDB final feasibility study, including the preparation
of bid documents, for La Chapelle, is expected to be completed by the end of
1982. EdH hopes that IDB also would finance construction and include in its
financing the studies required for Verrettes, the next hydro plant in the
development program after la Chapelle and Guayamouc I. The geological
survey and study of the Guayamouc I hydro plant, considered of the highest
priority in view of its role in decreasing siltation in the Peligre reservoir,
have been included in the consulting services to be financed by the proposed
credit.
The Project
4.04      Objectives.  During execution of the proposed project, IDA would
continue to emphasize the sector and project objectives initiated under the
first project. These are:
(a) rationalize sector development and promote the use of indigenous
resources;
(b) provide access to electricity to a greater number of households;
(c) accelerate connection of labor-intensive industries;
(d) meet electricity demand in Port-au-Prince with adequate and
reliable facilities;
(e) establish a continuous training program for EdH personnel;
(f) determine the nature of the presently high energy losses, and
establish a program to reduce them to acceptable levels;
(g) achieve EdH's financial independence through emphasizing adequate
pricing and reduction in losses and thefts; and
(h) increase the institutional and managerial efficiency at EdH.
4.05      Description.  The proposed third project would consist of:
(a) Installation of two diesel generating units rated 7.0 MW net
each, in a new power station to be constructed at Carrefour in
Port-au-Prince. The power station would be build to accommodate
5 units (as required by 1985).
(b) Rehabilitation of about 10 km2 of the Port-au-Prince distribution
network. Normal extensions either in Port-au-Prince and the
provinces would be financed with Ed'H own funds.



- 19 -
(c)  The survey, feasibility study and preparation of bid documents for
the Guayamouc I hydro plant (Guayamouc II is a second site, upstream,
that could be developed). The study would assess whether it would
be economically feasible to construct Guayamouc I in several stages.
Its main function would be to impound silt (the power component
would be small) and this can be done also with a low dam having a
limited life time (say 5-10 years), but which could be raised under
a next stage once this is required by the amount of silt impounded.
Funds saved could, in the meantime, be applied to other hydro plant
with higher energy capabilities.
(d)  Construction of a new head office.  Under the second project a
preliminar- -,sign haci alraady been prepared by SOFRELEC, EdH's
former consultants; it is now being updated by the general
consultant.
(e)  General and administrative consulting services would continue as
in progress under the second project. They cover all managerial
operational aspects of EdH and minor studies (e.g. under the second
project, a study for dam and power station optimization is underway).
(f)  Repair of the Peligre hydro facilities.  Several hydro mechanical
components have to be replaced or repaired and extensive concrete
repairs are required particularly in the stilling basin.
(g)  Training, to continue programs financed by the second project.
4.06      With the completion of the Varreux power station under the second
project at the end of 1981, Port-au-Prince has an available thermal capacity
of 54 MW of which 42 MW (77%) operates on Bunker C oil. To meet future
requirements, another 14 MW net capacity is required in 1983/84 at the
beginning of the dry season (November through April of the next year), 21 MW
one year later and another 21 MW in 1987. The proposed credit would finance
the 14 MW in capacity required in 1983/84. Because the Varreux station cannot
be extended beyond 7 units, a new site has been planned in the western part of
the city, near Carrefour. In order to avoid controversies as referred to
above (1.12), during negotiations it was agreed as a condition of effectiveness
that the contract for the supply of the two generating unit for Carrefour
would have to be signed.
4.07      The renovation of the Port-au-Prince network, which stagnated for
almost 2 years, is urgently required. The urban area of Port-au-Prince and
suburbs is about 35 km2 and at least three-fourths of the network is in very
poor condition. Many lines have been extended indiscriminately; conductors
are undersized and much of the equipment is obsolete. It is hoped that
starting with renovations covering about 2 km2 in 1982, an annual objective of
4 to 5 km2 can be reached in 1983, using both EdH's crews and local contractors.
This appears the limit, taking into account financial and physical constraints.
Credit 895-HA will finance approximately 4 km2 in 1982-83, and the third project
would cover 10 km2 overlapping the period 1983-85; therefore, by the end of
1985, about 40% of the network at Port-au-Prince would have been renovated.



- 20 -
Normal extensions, of course, would continue, for which material and equipment
is being financed under Credit 895-HA. Under the second project, agreement
was reached between EdH and the telephone and television companies, that these
companies would renovate their networks (poles are used in common) concurrently
with EdH.
4.08      The present head office can not adequately house EdH's personnel and
serve the public. A new head office, designed to meet EdH's future require-
ments is urgently needed; it should be suitable to absorb about 5 years of
manpower growth and should be expandable to meet requirements under a next
stage. The general consultants are now finalizing the preliminary design,
while final design would be executed by a local architect under supervision of
the consultants and financed by EdH.  The head office is expected to be
located on or near the premises of the old power station, near the center of
the city. A manpower study, which inter alia, determined the size of the
new head office, was completed by the general consultant.
4.09      Since 1971, when the power facilities were completed at the
Peligre dam, no inspection took place of the waterworks until recently,
under the second project. Deterioration of concrete was observed in many
places as well as extensive damage to the floor of the stilling basin.
Except for the immediate -- and already completed -- repair of an emergency
gate, the safety of the structures is not in immediate danger, but the
consultants (TAMS of the USA) proposed a three-year repair program because
most of the works can only be carried out during the dry season. A seismic
study would also be made to determine whether or not the structures meet
present day requirements (which appears likely, but should be confirmed).
In view of the importance of facilities, the repair works have been included
in the project, provided the Government - which is responsible for irrigation,
also regulated at Peligre - finances 50% of foreign costs. The consultant
services would be financed by the proposed credit to the extent that they
exceed the amount still available (about US$270,000) in the funds allocated to
the Government for the Peligre study under Credit 895-HA (US$450,000). During
negotiations EdH agreed that starting in 1986, periodic inspections to the dam
would be conducted, in order to certify its safety, in accordance with Bank
Group regulations. In addition, the Government agreed to finance 50% of the
foreign construction cost required for the repair of the dam, and EdH the
full local cost.
4.10      The services of the general consultants and the administrative
consultants would continue under the third project. Their assistance relates
to all of EdH operational, planning and construction aspects, with the objective
that the assistance would gradually decrease, commensurately with EdH's growing
capabilities. In this respect, EdH created in 1979 a planning section which with
the help of 2 or 3 technicians/draughtsmen from the consultant, would form the
nucleus of a future proper planning department which would train local staff.
4.11      Cost Estimate.  The project cost estimate is shown in Annex 4.2

4.12      The original cost estimate was prepared during appraisal on the
basis of information provided by EdH and the consultants, and was updated
with recent estimates submitted by HQI in December 1981; it reflects
January 1982 prices and expected inflation. It excludes interest during
construction and import duties and taxes from which EdH is exempted. A
physical contingency, considered reasonable, of 10% was assumed for construc-
tion, except distribution networks for which zero percent was used, because
the uncertainty factor already had been taken into account by slightly over
estimating the work that probably can be performed. A price contingency has
been added using the following assumed inflation rates: local cost 1982
onward - 10%; foreign cost 1982 - 8.5%, 1983 through 1985 - 7.5%, 1986
onward - 6%.
4.13      Financing.  The total foreign exchange requirement for the project
is MUS$27.0, the foreign cost represents 79.4% of the total cost of MUS$34.0.
The proposed credit would amount to MUS$26 and the financing plan is the
following (rounded):

The Government contribution of MUS$1 represents the estimate for the 50%
portion of foreign cost for the Peligre repairs to be financed by the Govern-
ment (4.09). Early in 1981 CIDA expressed interest in co-financing about
MUS$3.5 of the project, amount which could have financed a third diesel
generating group of 7.0 MW at the new Carrefour power plant, however, no
firm commitment has been confirmed. If in the near future, CIDA or any
other bilateral or international agency should decide to co-finance the
project, its scope could be expanded to include the third generator for
operation in 1984, at an estimated cost of MUS$3.5 (January 1982 prices;
of which 86% are foreign cost), and the renovation of some additional 5 km2
of distribution network in Port-au-Prince, now planned for after 1985 at a
cost of US$2.0 (of which 80% are foreign costs). The bidding documents for
the project have provisions for EdH to take an option for the third generator,
and for increasing the orders for distribution materials.
4.14      Retroactive Financing.  Retroactive financing not exceeding MUS$0.8
is proposed for consulting services since July 1, 1981 for the final design
and preparation of bid documents for the Carrefour diesel plant, and for the
surveys, feasibility study, final design and preparation of bid documents of
the Guayamouc I dam and the power station (4.05(c)).
4.15      Engineering, Construction and Management.  HQI and Price Waterhouse
would continue as EdH's general and administrative consultants for the project
and for management and operational matters respectively. HQI would also carry
out the Guayamouc I study, because one of the partners (LGL of Canada) in the
consortium forming HQI has carried out the Peligre siltation study; on the
basis of data already available the high priority study can therefore proceed
without delay. Final design and bid documents for the new head-office would
be prepared by an experienced local architect, assisted and supervised by HQI.
The estimated cost of consultant services to be financed by the project is
about MUS$5.1 in 1981 prices of which about 17% constitutes the reimbursable
part (i.e. travel, per diem expenses, etc). About 470 mm of services would
be provided at an average cost of about US$9,000/mm (1981 prices). During
negotiations, EdH agreed to continue employing consultants satisfactory
to IDA, as under previous credits.
4.16      In view of the above arrangements, no particular difficulties are
expected in the execution of the third project. Local contractors' capabilities
have increased markedly during construction of the first and second projects and
these contractors will continue to be requested to bid, mainly for civil
works. In view of the limited number of artisans available to EdH, contractors
may also have to be engaged for renovation works in Port-au-Prince. Employment
and training of technicians for distribution works are expected to increase
gradually during execution of EdH's long-term renovation program.
4.17      Implementation.  During negotiations EdH agreed with the key dates
for implementing the project which are shown in Annex 4.3. These dates would be
used to monitor progress during the project's execution period. The project is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1985.
4.18      Training.  For the third project a modest 1983-84 fellowship program has
been designed by EdH's training committee in consultation with an IDA training
advisor as a follow-up to training under the second project. Training abroad
will be given to 13 engineers and technicians (11 in Canada, 2 in France).
As before, the program to be followed would be presented in detail to IDA



- 23 -
before the participants leave. The major training effort, however, taking
advantage of the expertise of consultants to provide counsel, improve curricula
and training, will be made to improve the technical capacity and productivity
of the training center to meet EdH's needs at the middle level. Although there
is a lack of expertise in EdH for on-the-job training of young engineers who
have joined (and will join) the company, a more systematic approach is being
planned, which would gradually improve the situation. For administration, the
approach is largely through on-the-job training by the consultants who have
also set up a series of courses and seminars addressing specific subjects, so
as to increase managerial skills and to give a better understanding of the
rationale of the reorganization and modernization. A course has also been
initiated to prepare staff for the use of a computer. An allocation of
MUS$0.2 has been included in the proposed credit to meet the training require-
ments for 1983-84. As under the previous credits, EdH should carry out the
training in accordance with a satisfactory program in consultation with IDA.
4.19      Procurement and Disbursement.  Procurement of goods and services
to be financed by the proposed credit, other than those of consultants, would
be procured by international competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank
Group Guidelines for Procurement. Although presently none of the project
equipment is being manufactured in Haiti, local manufacturers, if any were to
emerge, would receive a preference of 15% or applicable duties, whichever is
the lower, for purpose of bid evaluation. Similarly a preference of 7.5%
would be given to local civil work contractors. Disbursements would be made
for 100% of the foreign expenditures for IDA financed contracts, or IDA
financed portion of contracts (Peligre), awarded for equipment and materials
and associated services (e.g. erection services of diesel plant) and for
consulting services and similarly for 60% of expenditures under civil works
contracts; the latter percentage represents the estimated foreign cost of such
contracts; disbursements would be made against fully documented withdrawal
applications. Estimated credit disbursements are shown in Annex 4.4 1/. The
closing date would be June 30, 1986 to allow for payment of retention money
and for unforeseen delays.
4.20      Environment.  As for the first and second project, specifications
concerning maximum sulfur dioxide emission, maximum noise level and thermal
polution, as suggested by the Association, are being required for generating
facilities. Lines will be routed to minimize visual impact.
4.21      Project Risks.  Because the second project's objective of higher
self-sufficiency has only been partially met, minimal risks in execution of
the project are still not ensured, as is obvious from occurrences in 1979-80
(1.12). To a large extent, EdH will depend on its consultants, who will
continually supervise contract execution and assist EdH's staff in assuming
greater responsibilities. Up to now, participation of EdH's staff in the
execution of IDA-financed projects has been disappointingly small, in part
due to the lapse resulting from the change in consultants. This situation
is expected to improve under the proposed project.
4.22      Project File.  Reference is made to Annex 4.5 for the contents
of the project file.
1/   The forecast disbursement profile is based on detailed construction
programs recently prepared by the consultant HQI, based on the expe-
rience with the two previous IDA power credits to Haiti. For this
reason, the Bank's standard profiles are not applicable. The closing
date was assumed to be 9 months after project completion date.

5. FINANCES
Financial History and Current Position
5.01      The financial condition of EdH was weak from its inception in 1971
up to the time of its involvement with the Association in 1975, mostly because
of inadequate tariffs, excessively high energy losses, non-payment of electri-
city bills by the public sector, and excessive reliance on short-term debts.
However, starting in 1976, and particularly since 1978, EdH's finances
improved gradually as a result of increased operating efficiency and the
change in tariff structure coupled with increased rates, including the fuel
surcharge (which, since 1979, is adjusted on a quarterly basis), EdH's average
revenue per kWh rose from USg6.5 in 1978 to an estimated US11.2 in 1981, i.e.
an increase of about 20%/a. In spite of rates of return on revalued assets
lower than the covenanted figures in 1979 and 1980 (4.4% and 5% instead of 7%
and 7.5% respectively), EdH was able to self-finance about 54 % of its invest-
ment program in those two years, due both to lower-than-expected construction
expenditures following delays in the second project (1.12) and to low debt
service charges: although concessionary power loans or grants to the Govern-
ment from IDA, CIDA and KfW are on-lent to EdH on commercial terms, related
interest charges are capitalized and deferred during project construction.
The Association agreed to grant waivers of the rate of return covenant for
both years, as further rate increases would only have inflated EdH's already
comfortable cash position.
5.02      Estimated results for 1981 show a rate of return of 7.4%, i.e.,
slightly lower than the covenanted 8%, and a substantial cash surplus (MUS$9
estimated), as a result of rate increases (18% in August 1980 plus subsequent
quarterly fuel surcharge adjustments), a low debt service burden and an
improved working capital position (5.09). These cash surpluses, however, are
only temporary and will be absorbed as EdH's investment requirements rise
rapidy from 1983 onwards. As of end-1981, EdH's debt-equity ratio was esti-
mated at a healthy 32:68.
Prospects for FY82
5.03      According to EdH's latest financial forecasts (Annexes 5.1-5.3) and
in order to reach the minimum 8% rate of return covenanted under Credit 895-HA,
the company raised its basic tariff rate by about 10%, effective May 1, 1982,
in line with the expected rate of local inflation. This would enable EdH to
self-finance about 50% of its investment program for 1982 (estimated at
MUS$27.5).

Financing Plan
5.04      EdH's financing plan for 1982-86 is summarized below (Annex 5.2):
Financial Requirements                                 MUSs
Construction Expenditures (excl. IDC):
On-going works                                      25.9              9
P -posed Third Project                              34.0             11
Other future works                                 231.6             79
Total construction expenditures               291.5             99
Changes in working capital                             1.9              1
Total financial requirements                 293.4             100
Sources of Financing
Gross internal cash generation                       129.7             44
Less:  net debt service                            (29.2)           (10)
Net internal cash generation                         100.5             34
Borrowings:
Existing loans                                      20.1              6
Proposed IDA Credit                                 26.0             10
Other future loans 1/                              137.5             47
183.6             63
Government contributions                               9.3              3
Total sources of financing                  293.4            100
5.05      Financial forecasts show that, for EdH to earn 8% on its revalued
assets during 1982-86, its average revenue per kWh (including fuel surcharge 2/)
need only be raised by about 10%/a on average, i.e. maintained constant in
real terms vis a vis local inflation (assumed at 10%/a in the forecast). The
corresponding revenues would enable EdH to contribute internally about 34%
towards its investment program during the period, i.e., not only cover all of
the program's local component (estimated at 23%), but some portion of the
foreign component as well; the latter is subject, however, to macro-economic
variables, since it involves conversion of local to foreign currencies. During
negotiations, the Government and EdH agreed to maintain the minimum 8% rate of
return covenant under the proposed credit. The average tariff forecast at distri-
bution levels for the period 1982-86, in 1981 constant prices, including fuel
surcharge, is approximately 13 USO/kWh, about equal to the long run marginal cost.
1/   Including possible future loans from KfW and IDB.
2/   Assuming fuel prices will increase by 3%/a in real terms (above
international inflation).



- 26 -
5.06      Most of the remainder of EdH's financing requirements would be
financed by borrowings: existing loans--mostly the undisbursed portions of
IDA Credit 895-HA and the on-lent proceeds of the CIDA grant--will cover the
foreign component of on-going works (mainly the second project), while the
proposed third IDA Credit would cover the foreign component of the third
project. Other future loans include (i) possible future KfW financing,
totalling about MUS$ll between 1982 and 1984 mainly for small hydro stations
(Caracol and Saut Mathurine) and associated distribution; (ii) a possible IDB
loan in 1983, of some MUS$52 to finance the foreign cost of the la Chapelle
hydro project; and (iii) unidentified future foreign loans from 1984 onwards,
of some MUS$75, to finance the foreign component of other future generation
projects (excluding Guayamouc I) 1/ and the transmission line from La Chapelle
to Peligre. The Association's involvement is expected to be instrumental in
the mobilization of such other future financing; processing of the proposed
third Credit should thus not be made contingent on the formalization of other
future loans. About 3% of EdH's total financing requirements would be covered
by Government contributions (estimated at about MUS$9 over the 5-year period)
which would consist mainly of the reimbursement by the Government of most of
the interest charges paid by EdH on the on-lent proceeds from the CIDA grant
and the KfW loans 2/, as agreed under the respective subsidiary loan agreements,
plus the Government's contribution towards the cost of the Peligre repairs
(4.09).
5.07      The proposed third IDA Credit of MUS$26 would be made to the Govern-
ment of Haiti on standard IDA terms and on-lent to EdH at the Bank rate pre-
vailing at the time of Board presentation 3/ 4/ and a maturity of 20 years,
including a 4-year grace period. A subsidiary loan agreement, acceptable to IDA,
would have to be signed as a condition of effectiveness for the proposed credit.
An additional loan is assumed for an amount of MUS$3, on similar terms, to
finance part of the foreign cost of the third generating set at Carrefour
(4.13). Assumed terms and conditions for other future loans are shown in
Annex 5.7.
Future Finances
5.08      EdH's financial situation is expected to remain healthy during the
forecast period. Both its annual debt service coverage and debt/equity ratios
would remain within a comfortable range (respectively 3.1 and 51:49 by 1986).
1/   Essentially, 42 MW in extra diesel capacity at Carrefour (1984, 1985 and
1987), Verrettes, and Sites A177 and A166.
2/   100% for CIDA and 95% for KfW, to be used to finance rural electrification
projects.
3/   Interest charges would be capitalized during construction; financial
projections assume a rate of 11.6%.
4/   Local inflation was estimated at 15% in 1981 and is expected to average
10% p.a. between 1982 and 1986. The Banque de la Republique d'Haiti
(Central Bank) charges interest at a rate of 8% p.a. on EdH's revolving
account.



- 27 -
To provide the Association with the opportunity to review the terms of any
future borrowings, the provision under previous credits that EdH would not
incur any long-term debt without the Association's agreement, unless its
internal cash generation covers its maximum future debt service at least 1.5
times, would be repeated under the proposed credit. Similarly the short-term
debt limitation (to one-sixth of annual cash operating expenses) covenant
under Credit 895-HA has been maintained.
5.09      In spite of the government's obligation, under Credit 895-HA, to
ensure prompt payment of electricity bills by its Departments and agencies,
public sector arrears stayed at a very high level during 1979, 1980 and 1981,
reaching over MUS$2.0 (equivalent to more than one year of public billings)
in December, 1981. To ensure continued prompt payment of government
electricity bills, the provision under Credit 895-HA that the government
should take all measures to ensure prompt payment of government electricity
bills under arrangements satisfactory to the Association, has been main-
tained under the proposed credit. EdH's total accounts receivables, which
were equivalent to 90 and 110 days of total billings at end-1979, 1980 and
1981 respectively, mainly because of large public sector arrears, are thus
expected to decrease to 60 days by 1982, a level in line with EdH's billing
cycle and collection procedures.
5.10      To ensure that only technically, economically and financially sound
projects are undertaken in the power sector, the current major expansion
limitation to 1% of net fixed assets in operation stipulated under Credit
895-HA has been maintained under the proposed credit; however, it also has
been complemented by a limit on unbudgeted village electrification (to an
aggregate annual amount not exceeding 0.2% of net fixed assets) in order to
avoid an excessive strain on EdH's financial resources (1.20).
5.11      Finally, it is essential that EdH follow a sound cash management
program and devote all of its financial resources to the development of the
sector, if it is to self-finance a satisfactory proportion of its investment
program.  The current provision, under Credit 895-HA, that EdH's resources
should not be put to any use other than for the execution of its construction
program, the payment of its debt service, and its operations, has been maintained
under the proposed Credit. Furthermore, in light of EdH's expected substantial
temporary cash balances in the next three years, during negotiations assurances
were received that EdH would be allowed to maintain its liquid funds in interest-
bearing accounts or in investment accounts not exceeding six months maturity.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
5.12      During negotiations EdH agreed with the performance indicators shown
in Annex 5.4 which define targets for improvement in EdH's operations and
would be used to monitor EdH's performance during project execution. EdH
also agreed to prepare and send to the Association quarterly progress reports
and such other reports as the Association may reasonably request, including
a project completion report.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Network Evaluation
6.01      Similar to the first and second project, the third project is a
mixture of renovations, replacements and extension. The network is of the
radial type, relay protected at higher voltages (12.47 kV and 69 kV) and
generally fused below this level. Some reclosers are used for principal lines
and medium-sized industries. Although some KfW-financed networks in the
provinces are of the European type, the bulk of the networks are in accordance
with American standards. During the March 1981 sector meeting it was agreed
that future networks will be designed according to American standards, but
construction would be adjusted in certain respects to allow for more labor
intensive construction methods in order to decrease the imported components,
reduce cost and create opportunities for local inputs. This assures that the
network renovations and extensions would be at least cost to the Haitian
economy.
Comparison of Generating Developments
6.02      KfW continues to develop a number of small hydro sites, comparing
them with diesel alternatives using the discounted cash method of analysis.
In view of the high diesel oil prices (US$47/bbl in Haiti), the cost of small
hydro stations (500-2000 kW), up to US$4,OOO-5,000/kW--and even higher,
depending on the plant factor, i.e., availability of water--can now be
justified.
6.03      The CIDA-financed study of Haiti's hydro resources (1977) has
identified the Artibonite river basin as the only river where additional hydro
sites of reasonable size can be developed. The UNDP-financed siltation study
of this river, and in particular the multipurpose Peligre reservoir (irrigation
and power), has shown, however, that siltation will remain a major problem in
the basin unless adequate counter measures are taken. The recommended measures
would extend the storage life of the Peligre reservoir, but in the longer term
(20-30 years) any power development can be expected to convert from the
regulated type to the run of the river type, requiring increasingly more
thermal plant. Another possibility of further extending the useful life of
the reservoir would be to reach agreement with the Dominican Republic on the
construction of a dam (with or without a power station) in the region of the
border. Reforestation, improvement of embankments and similar conservation
actions, even if executed on a large scale, would alleviate, but not overcome
the problem.
6.04      It is obvious from the above that the optimization of least cost
generation developments on the Artibonite river is difficult because of the
uncertainties inherent in the future estimates of the degr-ee of siltation.
Because none of the hydro plants identified can be completed before 1986,
no other alternative than extending EdH thermal generating capacity can be
considered up to that time.



- 29 -
6.05      The consultants, using diesel developments as the base case, have
compared 7 alternative hydro developments by mutating the six identified
hydro developments to obtain least cost. Because the estimated 1981 hydro
plant costs are relatively low, ranging from some US$2,000/kW to US$3,500/kW,
in comparison with any thermal development the conclusion was obvious: all
hydro stations should be completed as soon as possible, but the last plant not
later than 1988. In view of the total cost of some MUS$230 for an installed
hydro capacity of about 90 MW, expenditures averaging about MUS$30/a for hydro
alone (i.e., not taking into account the thermal back-up capacity), are beyond
the short term financial capacity of Haiti. For this reason it was reasonably
assumed that the last plant would be completed by 1990.
6.06      The forecast of required generation and expected maximum demand to
be used for planting-up purposes, in accordance with the econometric model
with a GDP growth of 4.0% for 1981-83 and 4.3% for 1983-86 (3.10), indicates
an average 1981-90 growth of 13.1%. As can also be observed (Annex 6.1), the
thermal plant would annually, on average, not exceed 3,000 hours of operation.
As a consequence, it is obvious that low capital cost thermal plant is required
for the least cost development scheme. The capacity balance (Annex 6.2) has
been prepared--similar to the first and second project assumptions--for a
one-in-five (20% probability) dry year. It appears improbable --until at least
the early nineties--that Haiti could financially afford to invest in generating
plant to obtain a reliability of supply meeting, say, 93-95% of requirements
(in such case it would only once in 20 years not meet requirements, should all
reserve plant be inoperable). The forecast, of course, has an implicit
reserve component because of the relatively high assumption for the GDP growth;
this requires annual review of the forecast ts adl"jt development as closely
as possible to real growth (3.10).  On this basis about 100 MW additional
thermal plant would be required by 1990, mainly for capacity reasons.  The
thermal plant would only reach, on average, a plant factor of some 50% during
the dry season of an extremely dry year (some 3,000 hours during the 7 months
of the longer than normal dry period).
6.07      The least cost development as defined above (6.05; Annex 6.2) has
three sub-alternatives i.e., whether to meet thermal generation requirements
by medium speed, low speed, or gas turbine plant (or any combination); the
hydro development being common to any of the alternatives, can be omitted from
the comparison. Special circumstances rule the present case:
(a)  Operating hours of thermal plant, on average, is expected to be
low, i.e., not exceeding some 3,000 h/a.
(b)  The development program, although defined in accordance with least
cost, is not assured until financing had been obtained for the
planned hydro plants.
(c)  In any event, hydro resources are limited and later this decade or
early in the next decade a larger thermal plant has to be introduced,
e.i. either large diesels (20 MW and up) or steam-electric coal
fired plant (probably having a unit size of not less than 50 MW).
Consequently, older plant would move practically permanently to a
stand-by position. In the event, operating hours of the old thermal
plant would continue to be very low.



- 30 -
Id)  Demand up to 1985 would probably be too low (less than 100 MW) to
warrant the intro:luction of gas turbines, but it is more important
to note that no new technology should be introduced before operators
have been thoroughly trained in operating and maintaining diesel
plant.
6.08      The comparison of medium speed and slow -.eed diesels, as alterna-
tives for the new thermal plant, to be added untii i90, carried out by HQI
and discussed with EdH showis (Annex 6.3) that up to ac least a discount rate
of 16%, the medium speed diesels would constitute the lower cost alterna-
tive. Although slow speed diesels are expected to be more reliable than
medium speed diesels, it would not be warranted--in view of the low average
annual hours of operations--to install for this reason more medium diesel
capacity than slow speed diesel capacity; sufficient time for repair and
overhaul would be available. In order to leave no doubt as to the neec to
install medium speed diesels, rather than slow speed diesels, the comparison
was sLanted in favor of slow speed diesels, assuming that fuel cost of slow
speed diesels would be 95% of similar cost of mediuii speed diesels -- while
only 97-98% appears, in practice, normally attainabie. Lub-oli consumption
was set at 80% -- although in practice 85-90' appears more probable.  Operation
and maintenance cost was set at 70% -- whether this would be attainable at all,
in the light of maintenance problems experienced up to now in Haiti, appears
rather doubtful. Finally, in view of probable differences in economic life,
15 years was assumed for medium speed diesels and 20 years for slow speed
diesels. Because larger thermal plant will have to be introduced early in the
next decade, largely replacing existing plant, the development program beyond
1990 would substantially be common to any of the alternative developments
prior to 1990 and, for this reason can be ommitted from the comparison.
However, so as to take account of uncertainties in this assumption, system
effects were considered equivalent to replacement of the medium speed diesels
every 15 years and every 20 years of the slow speed diesels, for 60 years (the
common multiple), while 1990 operational cost would remain constant at the
1990 level for a period of 10 years -- thus further slanting the comparison
in favor of slow speed diesels.
6.09      On this basis, a sensitivity analysis shows that, at the opportunity
cost of capital, estimated to be 12% in Haiti, and with a total fuel and
operating and maintenance cost of slow speed diesels of about 95% of those of
medium speed diesels, the capital cost of slow speed diesels should not exceed
about 120% of the capital cost of medium speed diesels; in practice cost is
expected to be in the order of 150-160%. Conversely, should the capital cost
of slow speed diesels be 50% higher than those of medium speed diesels, its
total fuel, operation and maintenance cost should not exceed some 77% of those
of medium speed diesels, which is impossible.
6.10      As indicated above (6.07), gas turbines can be considered as an
alternative for plant to be installed during 1986-1990. The hours of operation
of existing plant could be increased to, say, an average of 5,000 h/a for
energy reasons, the gas turbines providing the capacity reserves (they are
expensive to operate, but would not be required to generate electricity in
any substantial amounts). By 1985, a total of 77 MW of Bunker C oil plant
would be available; operated at 5,000 h/a, its production would be 385 GWh/a.
This is well in excess of the required thermal generation during an average



- 31 -
wet year rising to 225 GWh for 1990, and about equal to the 400 GWh required,
should 1990 (or any previous year) be a dry year. The 84 MW capacity in gas
turbines required would cost about MUS$34 (at $400/kW), compared with 70 MW
in diesel plant costing about MUS$53 ($750/kW). The comparison (Annex 6.3)
shows that also in this case, the combination of medium speed diesels, followed
by gas turbines, would be the most economical solution for discount rates up
to at least 16% although the difference in present values declines. 1/ With
total fuel, operating and maintenance cost of slow speed diesels of about
95% of those of medium speed diesels, the capital cost of slow speed diesels
should not exceed about 125% of the capital cost of medium speed diesels (in
practice expected to be some 150-160%). Conversely, would capital cost of
slow speed diesel be 50% higher than those of medium speed diesels, its total
operational cost, including fuel should, not exceed 87% of those of medium
speed diesels.
6.11      In view of the above considerations and taking into account the
uncertainties in Haiti's hydro developments, as well as the forecast relatively
high growth of requirements, it is concluded:
(a) EdH's thermal generation requirements should be met by Bunker C oil
fired diesel plant until about 1985. A new diesel plant should be
constructed to accommodate 5 units, each of of about 7 MW net.
(b) The least cost development indicates that gas turbine plant should
be introduced. However, no technological concept new to Haiti
should be introduced before operation and maintenance of existing
plant has been improved adequately, reaffirming about 1985 as the
year after which gas turbine plant can be considered. However,
financing of new hydro plant is by no means assured and, should
delays occur, generation of existing and new thermal plant would
markedly increase and continued addition of diesel plant may be
required to meet energy requirements, rather than capacity require-
ments.
(c) The least cost development plan should be reassessed annually
to adjust development as closely to real growth and to the pace
of actual construction of new hydro plants.
Internal Economic Rate of Return on the 1981-86 Investment Program
6.12      As the proposed project consists of several components of EdH invest-
ment program, components to which it is not possible to allocate benefits
separately, the internal rate of return has been calculated for the investment
program as a whole.
1/   Assuming that oil prices would rise 3%/a in real terms, does not change
this conclusion.



- 32 -
6.13      The cost streams (Annex 6.4) consists of EdH's investment program
expenditures (Annex 4.1) and the related fuel, operating and administrative
costs, expressed in 1981 constant prices. It is not possible to make direct
estimates of the benefits resulting from the increased availability of elec-
tricity supply, such as its effects on the expansion of industrial and commer-
cial activity, the increased employment opportunities generated and the social
benefits of public lighting and domestic supply. Consequently, the incre-
mental revenues attributable to the investments are used as a minimum estimate
of benefits, since it is known that the public will pay at least this much to
purchase electricity. The benefit stream in 1981 and subsequent years is the
increase in EdH sales above their 1980 level, valued at the deflated price per
kWh, ranging from the 1982 rate of USU13.2/kWh to USJ13.0/kWh by 1986, after
which the rate is assumed to remain constant in real terms.
6.14      On the above basis, the return on investment is 13.5% (Annex 6.4),
compared with the opportunity cost of capital for Haiti, estimated to be 12%.
6.15      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to measure the impact of
major uncertainties underlying the return calculation. Should fuel cost
increase by 3%/a, or should the average rates, in real terms, remain at the
1981 level of about USll/kWh, the rate of return would be 10%. With respect
to percentage changes in cost and benefits, the analysis shows the following:
Parameters
---------- Change from Base (%) ----------
-20      -10          0        +10      +20
----------- Rate of Return (%) -----------
Benefits (Revenues)              9.0       11.2       13.5      15.6      17.8
Capital Cost                    16.1       14.6       13.5      12.4      11.4
Operation and Maintenance
(including fuel)              15.6       14.6      13.6       12.5      11.5
Total Cost                      18.7       15.8       13.6       11.4      9.7
Only in the extreme case of benefits (revenues) decreasing by some 15-20%, or
total cost (capital, fuel maintenance and operations) similarly increasing,
would cause the rate of return to drop to 1.5-2 percentage points below the
opportunity cost of capital.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
Conditions of Effectiveness
7.01 (i) The contract for the supply of two generating units for Carrefour
would have to be signed (4.06);
(ii) A subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to IDA would have to be
signed between the Government and EdH (5.07).
Other Conditions
7.02      During negotiations, assurances have been received on the following:
(i)  EdH investment limitation covenant (Credit Agreement Section 4.01,
Joint Project Agreement Section 4.06) would be expanded to stipulate
that the aggregate annual amount of unbudgeted village and rural
electrifications be limited to 0.2% of net revalued assets, unless
IDA otherwise agrees (1.20);
(ii)  A review study of EdH's tariff structure and rates would be completed
by September 30, 1982 (1.22);
(iii) The provisions under Credit 895-HA for the annual audit of EdH's
accounts and financial statements including the timely furnishing
of the information to IDA (Joint Project Agreement Section 4.02)
would be applicable to the proposed project (2.11);
(iv) The position of Internal Auditor would be added to the positions
of General Manager and Directors (Joint Project Agreement
Section 3.01), whose qualifications are subject to acceptance by
IDA (2.12);
(v) The undertaking in the agreement for Credit 895-HA (Joint Project
Agreement Section 3.02) with respect to losses would be repeated
for the proposed project; the performance in this respect should be
a loss target of 27% by December 1982, decreasing by not less than
2% in each subsequent year (as referred to the result during the
previous year), until a level of 15% is reached (3.04);
(vi) The study of the Guayamouc Hydro Station would be executed under
terms of reference acceptable to IDA (4.05(c));
(vii) The Government would finance 50% of the foreign construction cost
required for the repair of the Peligre facilities and EdH the full
local cost (4.09);
(viii) EdH would continue to employ consultants satisfactory to IDA (Joint
Project Agreement Section 2.02) (4.15);
(ix) EdH would monitor execution of project in accordance with an
agreed schedule of key dates (4.17);



- 34 -

onwards (5.05);
(xi) The provisions under Credit 895-HA (Joint Project Agreement Section
4.05) for long-term and short-term debt limitation would also
apply to the proposed project (5.08);
(xii) The provision under Credit 895-HA (Credit Agreement Section 4.03)
for the prompt payment of all Government Departments' current
bills, would also apply (5.09);
(xiii) EdH would be allowed to maintain its liquid funds in interest-
bearing accounts or in investments not exceeding six months to
maturity (5.11);
(xiv) EdH would agree to an acceptable set of targets to improve its
operations (5.12); and
(xv) EdH would make satisfactory arrangements for periodic inspections
of the Peligre dam, starting in 1986, in order to certify its safety,
in accordance with Bank Group regulations (4.09).
Recommendation
7.03      With the above assurances, the project would be suitable for an
IDA Credit of MUS$26 equivalent, to the Republic of Haiti, to be on-lent to
EdH for a period of 20 years, including a 4 year grace period, at the annual
interest rate of standard Bank loans.

1/ Expenditures. Assumed: 55Z of expenditures for new additions in the first year of construction; 45% in the second year.
2/  Generation:  See Annex 6. 1 -   Hours of operation and required generation of Bunker C fired plant.  Example calculation
for 1985 with h = 3,085 hours of operation; generation of Bunker C fired plant is G   269 GWh; existing
capacity = 42 MW.  Assume: additions to be commissioned each year in September (h  = 0.25 h).
GWh (1985) = A + B (G - A) = A + B1

gravity 0.85); US$47/bbl (159 1) or US49.06/kWh; 90% Bunker C oil of 9.8 x 103 kcal/kg at 3.69 kWh/kg or
0.249 1/kWh (spec. gravity 0.94); US$37.80/bbl (159 1) or USO5.33/kWh.  Total 10Z/90% mix cost USO6.24/kWh
(US$62,400/GWh).
4/ Lub-oil Cost. Estimated at 6% of fuel cost.
5/  0 and M Cost.  Estimated at US$U1.20/kWh (US$12,000/GWh), or 19.232 of fuel cost.
6/ Capital cost, repeat factor: If the present value of expenditures over a number of years is p, and the cost stream is
repeated every n years, total PV will be, at discount rate i
PV = p (I +    I  n +       I   2m+ +
(I +i)   (1+ i))
Consequently, the equivalent pv factor (F) for PV = pF will be:

Calculation for medium speed diesels:  Compute basic present value of capital cost (BPVC)ms
and multiply by repeat factor F
(PVC)ms = Present Value = (BPVC)ms x F
Calculation for low speed diesels:       if slow speed  diesels cost F  times per kW the cost of medium speed diesels, their                        ,
present value, taking into account the repeat factors F15 (medium speed) and F20 (slow speed),
is:
(PVC)Ss 2 (F20 / F15) (PVC)M  x FC
7/ General Case (Medium Speed vs. Slow Speed Diesels)
(a) The capital cost relation of medium speed and slow speed diesels is (see above)
(PVC)S   = (F20/F15) (PVC)Ms x Fc
(b)  Assume that the present value of operational cost of medium speed diesels to be (PVO)   and those of slow speed diesels a
fraction of this:
(PVO/     (PV)MS X Fc
(c) Consequently, the net present value of capital and operating cost is defined by
(NPV) = (PVC) M    (PVC)s + (PVO) Ms   (PVO)s

8. Medium Speed or Slow Speed Diesels Followed by Gas Turbines
a)   A balance of capacities, adding 20-21 MW gas turbine  units as of 1987 shows that one unit is required in each year 1987
through 1990. Capital cost are assumed at US$400/kW.
b)   Capital cost of medium speed and slow speed diesels and their present values are equal to those stated (page 1) for the various
years. The cost of a 20-21 MW gas turbine would be, at US$400/kW, an assumed MUS$8.1, with 55% of expenditures in the
first year and 45% in the second year. Although the capital cost are irrelevant since they are common to both alternativpn,
they have been included, together with their present values, in order to make total present values comparable with the
base case (page 1).
c)   Operational cost are equal to those stated on page 1, because gas turbine operation is not required, except in emergency
cases, up to 1990:

Only during an extremely dry year 1990 would gas turbine operation be required.
d)   To repeat the calculation for the general case (Section 7 on pages 4 and 5), capital cost of gas turbine plant has to                     X
be excluded and tables 7(d) and 7(e) would become:

Rate of Return on the 1981-86 Investment Program
Notes
1.   Capital Cost.  See Annex 4.1.  Capital cost is deflated by the inflation factors
as shown below (para. 2). Cost of studies was allocated to Generation. One
third of "Various" was allocated to distribution and subsequently Consultant
Cost and Training was included in "Various".
2.   Operation and Administration Cost.  Derived from the details pertaining to the
Income Statements. Inflation indexes and factors were assumed as follows:

3.    Additional Operation and Administration Cost
3.1   Because for benefits additional sales will be taken into account reflecting
the portion of investments made during 1981-86 in generating plant, a similar
portion of operating and administration cost has also to be taken into account
for 1987 and subsequent years (MUS$).

is spent before 1987 (see Note 4.2) and 58% of fuel cost for three units has to
be allocated (21 MW of the 98 MW in thermal plant available in 1987, or about 20%;
generation of Bunker C oil fired plant is 269 GWh in 1985) or (rounded)
0.5 x 0.2 x 269 = 26 GWh, at a cost of USU6.24/kWh, costing US$1,620.

of 1% for investments for Site A177 and 6% of 1% for Site A166 (see Note
4.2) or kUS$200.
3.2   In 1986 administration cost is about 20% of total 0 and M cost; incremental
cost is assumed to rise similarly.

a/ Total gross GWh cannot be used, because the incremental consumption is lower than the new
energy capability (fuel savings could be assumed, but his was neglected).
5.    Discount Period. The discount period beyond 1990 was set at 25 years (for a
total of 35) as a reasonable estimate of the average economic life of the plant
involved. Individually, economic life would be:
Type of Plant               Economic Life (Years)
Diesel                        15
Hydro                         40
Transmission                  30
Distribution                  25

6.    Sensitivity to the Rise in Fuel Prices.  Should fuel prices rise on average
3% each year, equivalent discount rates have to be used as follows
(example for i = 12%)
1.03  =     1        iR7(
1.12      1.087       eq
The equivalent discount rates are then to be used for discounting fuel cost.
This gives the following present values for fuel cost and the resulting net
benefits:
