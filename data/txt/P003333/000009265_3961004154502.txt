Project Objectives.,
The paramount goal of the project is to help GOZ to reduce the incidence and impact
of sexually transmitted infections in a cost-effective manner. To achieve this goal,
the project will provide critical programmatic and commodity support to
Goverment's integrated and comprehensive program for preveAtion and care of
sexually transmitted infections (STls). The project has several specific objecdves:
(a) to ensure an adequate supply of condoms for disease prevention; (b) to ensure
implementation of the National Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Prevention and
Control Program, which provides a policy framework vital to the success of STI
control; (c) to enhance Government capacity to identify and treat, in those most at
risk, the STDs that facilitate transmission of human imimunodeficiency virus (HIV);
(d) to treat selected HIV-related infectons, especiaUy those that pose a genera
public health threat, such as tuberculosis (TB); (e) to facilitate HIV testing and
counseling of persons seeking to know their HIV status; (t) to ensure the continued
safety of the blood supply; and (g) to protect health care workers and facilitate
home-based care for AIDS patients.
Project Description:
The project focuses on strengthening detection and cure of STDs, one of the most
cost-effective interventions to inhibit the spread of HIV infection. It also provides
essential drugs and protective supplies to enable the health care system to manage the
increased demands made by the AIDS pandemic. In particular, it would finance
(base costs in US$ millions): (1) Condoms to ensure that IEC efforts to change
behavior and promote their use are accompanied by adequate supplies ($10.7); (2)
STD Program suXort and drugs and diagnostic tests for $1rDct   one of the
most cost-effectve interventions to inhibit the spread of HIV and medically
justifiable in its own right to prevent STD complications and congeni  disease
($21.8); (3) drugs to treat B and other seletd AM        c infecons
($31.2); (4) tests and supplies for HIV diagnosis and blood screening ($2.7); and (5)
r   *t civs ies for health care givers-gloves, disinfectans, syringes ($8.3).



- HI -
Justfcaton and Risks:
Combating STs is importa  both in public health and socioeconomic terms, and
indispensable to preserving the gains Zimbabwe has achieved in health since
independence. Rapidly expanding awareness of STls will have no impact on the
disease incidence if drugs are not available. An unierupted supply of condoms,
drugs and diagnosdcs is viz.al to any reasonable chance of success for Zimbabwe's
AIDS control and prevention efforts. Modest investments In Identification and
treatment of STDs (US$1.00-2.50/person) could help protect those most at risk from
RN. It is esdmated that STD treatment costs less ta US$1 per healthy lifeyear
saved - an extremely cost-effective intervention. Complications of SIDs ca
painful illnesses, infertility, and can result in severe adverse effects to newborns,
including death. HIV rans second among all diseases in the toll it takes, measured
in productive healthy life years lost. Each AIDS case in Zimbabwe costs over
US$1,000 in direct costs, and many times that in indirect costs. Each TB case
successfully treated will avert many other TB infections. The project would directdy
benefit all existing and potential condom users, and all those at risk of STms.
Control of STIs would save families of all walks of life from the terrible toil of
RN-related illness and death, STD mortality, and the adverse cffects of STDs on
fertility and births. It would ease the explosive demands on the health care system
and budget. It would hold down the indirect economic costs of AIDS-the losses of
productivity and human capital, which threaten long-run economic and social
development in Zimbabwe.
The main risk is that the HIV prevalence rate andlor active TB prevalence rate, both
already high, could swell so quicldy as to overwhelm even an effort of the projece's
magnitude. A secondary risk is that the health services may lack the capacity to
implement an effecive STD screening and prevention program, or that sufficient
Government budget support may not materialize. The high public awareness about
STU, Governmt's keen interest in the project, and the integrated effort already
underway all limit this risk. Finally, behavioral changes are difficult to promote,
but experience in other countries suggests that the literal life-and-death choice posed
by the presence of STIs and availability of safer alternatives have proven compelling
enough to override the inherent resistance to change.

ISSUES RELATING TO
SEXUALLY TRANSMTTED ]INFECTIONS
PREVENTION AND CARE IN ZIABWE
A. ITRODUCrOJN
1.1        Since Independence, Zimbabwe has made impressive and consistent progress in
health, population, and nutrition. Goverment decisions to reorient public health expenditures
from high-income households tr poor rural families, and to focus on primary and preventive
health, nutrition and family planning programs have helped bring about dramatic changes.
Between 1980 and 1990, infant mortality declined from over 100 per 1,000 lIe births to 53, and
life expectancy increased frhm 56 to 64 years. Prevalence of severe malnutrition in children fel!
from 22% to 12%. Great headway was made in controlling communicable diseases. However,
as is the case in much of the world today, the unrelenting growth in HIV infections and AIDS
cases threatens to undermine and reverse these gains.
1.2        Neatly 19,000 AIDS cases have been diagnosed and repoited, a fraction of the
55,000 cases that are estimated to exist. At least 10% of suiually active adults (ages 15 to 49) in
Zimbabwe are estimated to be infected with HIV. Thirty to forty percent of children born to HIV
positive women contract the virus, and most of these infants die within three years. Thousands of
children are being left orphaned by AIDS. The toll of illness and death is heavy and growing.
About one third of medical inpatients in some hospitals in Zimbabwe are thought to have HIV-
related illnesses; so do many of the children in pediatric wards. TB cases, as a result of HIV,
exceeded 12,000 in 1991, and are expected to continue to increase by about 15% each year. A
rough estimate puts the direct medical costs of 7IVIAIDS at 2-3 times per capita GDP, which
would amount to around US$1 billion for the 800,000 people currently estimated to be HIV
positive. Because the disease selectively kills people in the most economically productive age
groups, the toll in lost productivity and human capital is several fold greater.
1.3        Government was slow to respond. In 1987 the health ministry developed a
program of action, some ministries are only now beginning to recognise that they also have an
important role to play. Government is now implementing a comprehensive, multisectoral
program of activities to educate people about HIV/AIDS and empower them to protect themselves
from this deadly disease. Success has been achieved in attaining over 90% AIDS awareness
among Zimbabweans and some gradual progress is being made in increasing knowledge of the
available prevention measures. Additionally, there is evidence of behavior change encouraged by
interventions with specifically targeted groups who appear to be frequent transmitters of STIs
(e.g. sex workers and their clients). A national program to improve the detection, treatment and
prevention of the STDs, which play an important role in faciitating HIV transmission, is
beginning to be implemented. In addition, the TB control program is being strengthened and pilot
efforts to improve home-based care of AIDS patients have been initiated. These ijiitiatives
cuntribute to an integrated, multisectoral program for preventing and caring for HIW/AIDS and
other STDs-sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A number of donors are funding selected
IEC, condom and STD care-related activities, but significant funding gaps remain. This project
would support Zimbabwe's efforts at STI prevention and care by concentrating on two main
areas: strengthening STD prevention and control and providing crucial commodities-condoms,
drugs, and limited diagnostics, without which program objectives could not be achieved.

BAt PREVALENCE AND PRoJWcrioNS OF HIV AND AIlDS CASES
1.4         HIV PWlence Over 800,000 Zimbbeans are currently estimated to be infected
with HIV. Studies on RIV prevalence among various population groups have been limited to 16
seiel swveillance sites throughout the country for antenatl attendees, SID patients, and blood
donors. Table 1.1 shows HIV prevalence for STD patients (an at-risk population) to exceed 50%
in some locations, for antenatal tendees, to range between 8% and 42%, and to have settled to
2.S4% in blood donors. The decrease in IIV incidence among blood donors is attributed to
highly selective recruitment of blood donors and donor promotion campaigns in recet years.
There are no RIN prevalence data for special groups such as commercial sex workers (CSWs) and
their clients, commercial transport drivers, miners, members of the armed forces and other
persons in situations vulnerable to HIV transmission.

1.5        HIV Tesdag Few people in Zimbabwe know their HIV stats. The limtd
availability of diagnostic kits has led to a decision not to make testing widely available, but to
limit the use of HIV tests to confirm clinical diagnoses and for screening blood. Even so, a
shortage of HIV diagnostic kits is thought to be the reason why the number of AIDS cases
reported dropped significantly in the second quarter of 1992.
1.6        AIDS cases As many as 55,000 cumulative cases of AIDS are esmated to have
occurred in Zimbabwe. By December 1992, 18,731 AIDS cases had been diagnosed and
reported. More than half of the reported cases are in the 20 to 39 year age group, suggesing that
most people become infected with the virus as teenagers and young adults. This is particularly
true for women, as female AIDS cases reported in the 15 to 19 age group far exceed males cases
(1:0.18). Overall, men exceed women in nber of total cases, (1:0.78). Children under four
account for 16% of cases reported.2/
1.7        AIDS Case Repoiln  Reporting of AIDS cases is dependent on two procedures:
requests for HIV blood tests and physician reports on AIDS patienve. Neither are complete. A
form is supposed to be filled out for all persons receiving an HIV blood test. The form, although
anonymous, includes demographic data and AIDS symptoms. The forms are sent to both public
and private laboratories and the data enteed in a computer if the test is confirmed positive for
HIV. Thus computerized printouts should be available on all laboratory confirmed HIV
ZI The majority of these infections are estimated to have occurred through perinatal transmission.



infections, with or without AIDS symptoms. Reporting compliance by private laboratories is said
to be poor, however. Physicians are required to report all AIDS cases under their care, but their
reporting is also thought to be incomplete.
1.8         HIV and AIDS Projecdows Using the following assimptions: (i) transmission of
HIV began in 1980, (ii) 500,000 people were HIV positive in 1989, and (iii) HIV incidence
begins to decrease gradually over the next decade and beyond, and (iv) the mean survival after
progression to AIDS is approximately six months, the WHO HIV\AIDS Epidemic Projection
Model projects that the number of HIV infected people could increase to 1.35 million in 1995 and
surpass 2 million by the end of the decade. (See Annex 9 for more details.) Even if there were
no new HIV infections, the number of AIDS cases would continue to increase each year to the
end of the century. Including expected new infections, it is estimated that in the year 2000, there
will be 50,724 new cases of AIDS reported and about the same number unreported, for a
projected total of 101,448 new cases of AIDS that year.
1B.2 CONSEQUENCES OF lHIV INFEmTIoN AND AIDS
1.9         Prgression To AIDS As HIV destroys the immune system, a patient begins
falling prey to various infections that mark the onset of fill-blown AIDS. These "opportunistic
infections" have devastaing consequences for patients, their families and communities, and the
health care system. On average, each Zimbabwean adult who contracts HIV is likely to suffer
nine episodes of severe illness. This figure is unknown for children with AIDS, but was
estimated at 6-7 episodes in Tanzania. On average, AIDS patients in Zimbabwe survive 1.5
years after diagnosis.
Tuberculosis
1.10        One of the most serious AIDS opportunistic illnesses i tuberculosis (TB). TB has
resurged alongside HIV worldwide and is the single infectious pathogen most responsible for
world deaths. As in other countries with AIDS epidemics, TB has re-emerged as a serious public
health problem in Zimbabwe. After twenty years of decline, the number of cases of TB has more
than doubled, from 4,759 in 1985 (56 per 100,000 population) to 12,198 in 1991 (121.1 per
100,000). Both genders and all regions seem to be equally affected, with the increase most
marked in the adult population aged 25 to 55 years. The case fatality rate has increased as well
from 6.2% in 1989 to 9.6% in 1990 and 12.3% in 1991.
1.11        HIV is the most important factor contributing to the increase in TB cases. It is
estimated that 40 - 60% of adults with TB are infected with HIV. TB incidence is likely to
continue to increase, with those infected with HIV representing an increasing proportion of cases.
The Impact of AIDS
1.12        AIDS will have a larger impact on Zimbabweans than other more common diseases
because it is always fatal, it strikes the economically active, it affects both the poor and the elite
and it is widespread. Little data exist in Zimbabwe on exactly what effect AIDS will have on
society and development but studies and literature elsewhere suggest the following:



-  -
1.13       Impact on Households HIV/AIDS will reduce labor supply within households and
lowet productivity of people with AIDS and family members who care for them. In coping with
the impact, households are likely to change their levels and composition of production,
consumption, savings and investment. HIV/AIDS will alter the distribution of income in society
and create new groups in poverty.
1.14       Impadt an h Health Sector AIDS will raise the demand for and expenditure on
health care, while slowing or reducing the supply of medical personel. Health ecnomists have
been particularly concerned about the impact of AIDS treatment on public sector expenditure on
health care. There are no accurate measures of actual public or total expenditures on AIDS
treatment in African countries, nor projections of these costs into the future. However, the
magnitude of the costs per case suggest that if every AIDS patient were to receive modern
treatment, the potential level of expenditure wouzd be enormous. In Zimbabwe, if all cases of
AIDS had beer treated in the health care system, it is estimated that total expenditure on AIDS
treatment costs in 1990 would have been 26 percent of total public health care spending.3a
Ibis assumes an expenditure per case ranging between $64 and $2,574 (Z$390.4 and Z$15,701),
with a mean expenditure of $614 (Z$3,745), depending on the cost of hospitalization.4/
1.15       TMe estimated recurrent cost per patient-day in hospitals in Zimbabwe ranges from
US$6-12/day for most rural hospitals, about US$17/day in Harare Hospital and about US$35/day
in Parirenyatwa Hospital. The Von AIDS patient may be hospitalized for anything from 25 to
50 days. Using the MOH budget planning figure of Z$110/day, this implies direct hospitalization
costs of Z$2,750 to Z$5,500 (US$450-900 equivailent) per patient. The average total claim for
medical treatment by AIDS patients paid by CIMAS, the largest insurance scheme is over
Z$5,000, ($820.) and tends to be up to the claim limit of Z$1,800 (US$295) for drugs. Only
about 4% of the population is covered by medical insurance. Uninsured people pay only about
2% of the costs of health care, the rest Is borne by taxpayers through the MOH budget. (See
para 3.21 and Annexes 9 and 12 for a discussion of the projection model and direct costs used to
estmate costs for this project.)
1.16       Impad on Other Sectors School-aged cohorts will be smaller than they would have
been and many teachers will be lost to AIDS. The epidemic is already creating large mmbers of
vulnerable survivors - orphaned children and elderly - with no incomes, which will in turn create
greater demand for social welfare services. HIV/AIDS will have multiple effects on firms: lower
productivity of workers; higher absenteeism; reduced stock of trained workers; higher job
turnover, recruitment and training costs; and greater outlays for health, funeral and death benefits.
Key industries ta rely on very scarce highly-skillO manpower -such as mining and insurance-
will be especially vulnerable to the deaths of their most skilled workers. Since most people
infected with AIDS live in rural areas, agriculture is also likely to be affected, although
quantfying the impact has been difficult.

1.17        Demographk Impact Models project that AlDS mortality will raise the death ra,
lower life expectancy and slow population growth below what it would have been in the absence
of AIDS. However, even with no slowing of HIV infection, the Afhican population will conti
to gow rapidly-at 2 percent per year or more-more than doubling in cize by the year 2020.
B.3 PREVALENCE OF OTHER SEXUALLY TRANSMnTED DASES
1.18        The incidence of STDs is high in Zimbabwe. STDs and their complications have
become a major health problem, and are one of the 10 most common causes of outpatient
attendance among patients above 5 years of age. National STD public sector attendances for 1990
and 1991 were over 1 million each year, close to double the approximately 600,000 attendances
reorted yearly in 1988 and 1989.Y  Predictably, the areas with the most STDs also report the
- ost AIDS cases. Harare accounted for 30% of the 1509 AIDS cases reported in the second
ter of 1992, followed by Mashonaland East (10%) and Masvingo, Midlands, Bulawayo and
tanlcaland at 9% or over. Over 55,000 cases of STDs were reported by Harare province In the
first quarter of 1992, followed by the same provinces Masvingo, Manicaland, Midlands,
Mashonaland West (the one exception) and Bulawayo. Harare accounts for 18 - 35% of all
reported STD cases in the country, but this includes patients referred from elsewhere.
Nationwide, 249,155 STD episodes were reported for the first quarter of 1992, a 13% decrease
compared to the preceding quarter. Similarly, STD first attendances and cases have decreased in
Bulawayo, from 8,000 cases in January of 1991 to just under 5,000 in December of 1992. The
poor economy and increase in fees are thought to be the cause for this decrease by some public
health officials, while others believe this is a true sign of decreased disease transmission in the
community as a result of behavior change.
1.19        As expected, the incidence of STD is highest in the sexualy most active age group
(19-25 years). A 1986 survey of young people aged 14-21 revealed that 13% of men and 7% of
women who had ever been sexually active reported that they had had an STD. Il In a 1991
study, 45% of residents in one community reported a history of STDs. V/ Men use available
services more frequently than women becmse the majority of men have more obvious clinical
anifestations. For Harare and Bulawayo, where data are available, approximately 60% of
attendees are male, and uretral discharge (specifically gonorrhea) is the most often reported
syndrome seen, with genital ulcers, (syphilis and chancroid) second most common. The
predominant STD nationwide is chacroid, followed by gonorrhoea.
1.20        Few data exst on STD populaion prevalknce. The limitd data available on
prevalence of STDs in Zimbabwean women atending antenatal services range from 2.5% for
E/ Provincial STD reports do not distinguish between attendances and cases. We have used the term
aenances.

syhiblis to as high as 12% for trichomonas. These rates are similar to other African
countries.l/
1.21        Reposlng of STDs Harare and Bulawayo PHC clinics report their STD cases
based on syndromes and regularly transmit reports to the city council health departments. All
other health facilities in the country simply record the total number of STD patients seen. These
reports are compiled at the districts, sent to the provincial health departments and flnally reach the
epidemiology unit of the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, which produces an annual report.
Officials involved In the system believe that the reporting percentages ftom the PHC facilities are
high.
BA4 CoNNEQuENcEs OF OTiHER SEXUALLY TRANsmTE DISEMES
1.22        Besides greatly faciitating HIV transmission, the other STDs can cause discomfort
and pain, chronic ill-health and even death. Typically, infections in men produce mild to severe
genital or urinary tract problems and can result in male infertility. The severe consequences are
far more frequent for women than men because few women have warning symptoms early on in
the course of the infection. SMDs cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), cervical dysplasia,
and infertility among women. 9/ Pregnancies affected by STDs can result in ectopic pregnancy,
abortion, stillbirth, and infected newborns. Untreated congenital syphilis is often disfiguring,
debilitating, and can be fatal for newborns. Twenty cases of congenital syphilis were reported
alone in Harare in 1991. Both gonorrhea and chlamydia can cause conjunctivitis in newborns,
eventually leading to blindness. Harare City reported 137 cases of ophtamia neonatorum in
1991, where eye prophylaxis at birth is recommended. Over 90% of these cases were due to the
gonococcus.
B.5 BIOLOGICAL AND BEAVIORAL RS  FACrRs FOR STS
blogical Link betwe  HV and other SIDs
1.23        Convincing data suggest being infted with other STDs increases the transmission
probability of HIV infection several fold -5 to 10 times if genital ulcers are present. By
altering the host's immune response, H infection may in turn change the epidemiology of
STDs, thereby making HIV and STD mutually enhancing infections. Data from Africa suggest
that HIV-infected women may be more susceptible to gonococcal infection, and to PID. STDs
are also associated with earlier and more severe symptoms and altered response to therapy in
HI-positive patients.
I/ A. De Schyver, A. Meheus. Bulletin of the World Health Organization, 68 (5): 639-654 (1990).
2/ The economic costs of these physically and emotionally painfidl complications can be high. The
economic costs of PI), PID-associated ectopic pregnancy and infertility exceeded $3.5 billion in the
U.S. in 1990.



- 8 -
1.24        STIS disproportionately compromise the health of women. Women are less able to
prevent exposure to an STD than men, because of the lack of available female-controlled barrier
methods and because the power dynamic in sexual relationships frequenty limits their ability to
negotiate the conditions under which intercourse occurs. For anatomic reasons, transmission of
HIV trough discharge STD syndromes (e.g. gonorrhea, chlamydia) following exposure appears
to be more efficient from male to female (60% transmission risk per coital act) than from female
to male (30% transmission risk). Overall, women - especially young women - appear to be more
susceptible biologically than men.
Behavioral Risk Factors
1.25        The majority of risk factors for STs are directly related to patterns and modes of
seu  behavior. These include: having frequent unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple sex
partners, a history of STDs, and infrequent use of condoms. Sexual behavior can be very
difficult to change, because it is highly motivated, private and often clandestine, and varies within
and between groups.
1.26        Compared to most African countries, Zimbabwe has an extensive collection of
studies and litature regarding sexual practices and beliefs. Much of this information has been
collected in urban areas for famfly planning programming and more recently, to plan AIDS
interventions. Several large knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys were completed in
the late 1980's and early 1990's focussing on sexual behavior, disease and contraception
awareness and contraceptive/condom use. There are additional recent descriptive surveys and
studies based on focus groups and informant discussions and observations which include pregnant
women, employees and core groups such as truck drivers and prostitutes.10/
1.27        The dimensions of sexual behavior that influence most the risk of contracting STDs
and thus the dimensions that should be studied include: age of sexual debut; number of sex
partners accumulated over one's lifedme; number of sex partners over a specific recent time; how
one recuits sex parners; d .mographic characteristics of partners; behavioral characteristics of
partners; frequency and timing of intercourse; sexual practices and sexual/health practices and
related aspects (e.g. use of contraceptive methods, male circumcision, etc.)lU/ Published
infmation for Zimbabwe regarding these sexual behavior dimensions is summarized below.
1.28        The age of i,d*on of sal redations apparently is not particularly early in
Zimbabwe. Ihe median age at first sexual intercourse is 19 for women and 18 for men according
.lQ/ Core group' refers to groups whose behavior tends to place them at particularly high risk of

to a 1986 fertility and contraceptive survey among respondents aged 14 - 21.12 These data
are corroborated by other surveys of teenagers.fl/ A 1989 study of 17 and 18 year-olds
reported that 34% of men and 17% of women had had sexual relations. A review of 16 studies
found 50% of married women and 80% of ever-married women had first married before their
20th birthday. IN4
1.29       Little discussion of sexual maers and reproductive health appears to occur between
parents and children in the home, and the Ministry of Education has been slow up in introducing
these topics in schools (this is to be done soon). Friends, radio and newspapers and in urban
areas, television are most often mentioned as sources of information regarding AIDS and STDs.
1.30       Kwowedge  Contraceptive knowledge is high for women and men of all age
groups (over 90% among survey respondents). Almost everyone in Zimbabwe has heard of
AIDS. Over 90% of recent survey respondents are aware of AIDS and know its major mode of
transmission (sexual). Knowledge of the other modes of transmission and of the asymptomatic
stage is far less. Misconceptions regarding transmission and cures still exist among many
respondents. Overall, knowledge is still poor among uneducated rurd women. Since testing for
HIV is expensive and not widely available, few Zimbabweans know their HIV Infection stas.
1.31       Multpk sexual pailtners and commercl sex Having more than one sexual
partner or participation in commercial sex is not uncommon. Forty percent of 711 men in a 1988
male fertility survey said they had bad sexual partners other than their wives in the past year and
nearly one in three had had sex with a prostitute in the past year. A 1991 survey of 513 adults in
communities of the Chiredzi District reported that 35% to 49% had sought commercial sex in the
past year.
1.32        Research undertaken in order to develop community interventions against SIDIHIV
in Bulawayo reached these conclusions about commercW sex: 21/

'Seventy percent of truckers drove long-distance within Zimbabwe and 30% drove
internationally. Eighty four percent were married, but less than half their wives
lived all year in town. Sixty percent had girlfriends and 64% visited prostitutes
when away. Sixty six percent had used condoms with prostitutes, but condom use
with wives or girlfriends was markedly lower. In their last commercial encoune,
48% were drunk. Most knew of AIDS, mostly via radio but knowledge was
uneven. Trucking and prostitution were closely interwoven: prostitutes knew truck
stops, frequently provided companionship and sex for free transporation and
brothels often abutted trucker's hostels. Bar and hotel owners along highways
encourage prostitutes because they attract the patronage of truckers. Truckers hired
prostitutes because of loneliness, tedium, the dreariness of hostels and
predominantly male 'anti-community' environments." 1i/
1.34       Low condom use  The pill is the most known and used contraceptive. Fewer than
3% of contaceptors report using condoms in Family Planning surveys. Condom use has been
increasing; the condoms that were distributed in 1992 were enough to provide a year of protecon
to about 16% of sexually active couples (with the standard assumption that 100 condoms provide
one couple-year of protection).12/ Even so, most sex is unprotected, with concomitant high
rates of unplanned pregnancy among young people, and high susceptibility to sexually-tranmtted
diseases, including HIV infection.
1.35       Behavor Change Little data exist documenting change of behavior in response to
te prevention messages promoted in Zimbabwe. The national AIDS prevention program has
only recenty begun making plans for a comprehensive strategy to evaluate the impact of efforts to
change behavior. IEC activities tend to be weak on evaluation and monitoring. One exception is
the Bulawayo peer education project, which was able to show an increase in the proportion of sex
workers who reported consistent condom use from 5% in 1989 to nearly 50% by early 1992.
Monitoring data confirm the success of this intervention in severa other cities. Another exception
is the Kariba fishermen project where a 30% decrease in reported STDs may be attibuted to the

C. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE To IIV/STDS/AIDS
1.36       MOH policy is that AIIS/STD prevention and mitigation activities be fully
itgraed as part of primary health care. The MOH has developed two policy documents on
AIDS in the workplace and on humtan rights, and established a sub-committee to advise on policy
for care for AIDS patients. The capability of MOH is described briefly below, as well that of the
National Family Planning Council, before discussing the specific national programs for
AIDS/STD prevention and control. The National AIDS Coordination Program coordinates
naional efforts both within and outside government. The government's comprehensive
muttisectoral strategy for AIDS prevention and care Is set out in the National Medium Term Plan
for AIDS (1988-1993). The National STD Control Program strategy and activities will be fully
incorporated into the new Mid Term Plan for AIIDS (1994-1998). These are described in section
C2. The key preventive activities are: educating the public about the risks associated with
STD/HIV transmision; promoting condom use; and diagnosing, treating and following up
persons with other STDs. Section C2 also describes the coping strategy for care of HIV/AIDS
patients. The emphasis is on community and home based care, which is the most affordable and
appropriate option. Priority is also being given to treatment of TB, which, if left untreated, could
develop into a public health problem of major proportions.
C. 1   sNT     oNAL CAPACITy
Mnistry of health and Child Welfare
1.37       The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOH) has rightly not developed a
vertical AIDS control program, and made efforts on a broad front to integrate HIV/AIDS
prevention and care into general health care. There is a strong network of health care facilities
country-wide, generally staffed with dedicated and well trained people. Various programs are
strengthening and developing the system, and working to improve its efficiency and effectiveness,
icluding the activities being supported under the Family Health Projects. The MOH provides a
sound institutional base and capable people to mobilize against 5sT.
1.38       2he lea th CAre System Government, municipalities and local authorities, church
missions and other NGOs, industries and mines, private practitioners, and traditional healers al
play significant roles in providing health care. The four-tiered system provides adequate access, a
good balance of preventive and curative care, and an efficient chn of patient referral. Ihe firs
level consists of 56 rural hospitals and 927 health centers (about 132 MOH, 510 local
govemment, 70 mission, 55 urban, and 160 industry-owned facilities) and focuses on primy
health care, community involvement, and preventive health practices. Ihe second level has 55
& Wilson et al.



- 12-
district hospitals (MOH and church mission-operated), although half require upgrading and
expandting. A District Health Executive headed by the District Medical Officer and District
Nursing Officer work to integrate preventive and curative services and to promote intersectoral
collaboration. At the third level are 8 provincial and 4 general hospitals which provide specialist
services. A Provincial Health Executive led by the Provincial Medical Director (PMD) is
responsible for the planning and supervision of heath services dtroughout the province. At the
apex are 5 cenal hospitals in Harare and Bulawayo (imcluding the specialist psychiatric hospital).
1.39       Heath Personnel Including both public and private institutions, Zimbabwe has a
total of about 1,250 doctors and 10,000 nurses, and about 700 environmental health officers and
technicians. In all, MON h&: a total staff establishment of 23,380, with most posts currently
filled. Nearly a third of the 1*OH posts are in the four central hospitals. PMD offices and rural
health centers account for 12% of the total posts, and MON Headquarters for 2.4%. The
restricted growth in the number of additional posts over the last two years has resulted in a sharp
drop in vacancies. There are some importat exceptions, however, including hospital equipment
technicians (67% of posts vacant), physiotherapists (42%), dieticians (36%), nutritionists (32%),
pharmacists (23%), and radiographers (23%).
1.40       Tnere are also approximately 6,000 village community workers (VCW) country-
wide who were trained as village health workers before their mandate was changed to multi-
purpose community development workers. About 12,000 traditonal healers are registered in a
Government-sponsored association, and their total number is believed to be close to 20,000.
1.41       A wide range of basic health training programs are provided by the University, the
Polytenic and the Mission Hospitals as well as the MOH. Turnover for a few cadres is
alarming (e.g., physicians, pharmacists, and hospital equipment technicians), but for others the
loss rate is well below the rate at which new personnel are being trained and employed (e.g.
SCNs).
1.42       M     *isty of Heat ad Chd Welfare Budget In 1980, Zimbabwe's per capita
health care ewpenditure of about US$30 was one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, and then
rose steadily to about US$45 in 1987 (at prevailing exchange rates), nearly two-thirds financed by
Government. Since 1981, the MOH budget has averaged around 5% of total Governmt
expenditures (which were rising in real terms until 1990). This is in the middle of the range of 2-
11% for developing countries with similar per capita GDP. Undl recently, the health budget was
adequate, and provided for considerable service expansion in rural areas. However, recent cuts in
Government spending, slow economic growth, very high inflation, and the need to divert
resources to import food have led to sharp real cuts in the MOH budget, despite MON's 1991/92
budget share being maintained. MOH's budget fell about 35% in real terms over the 2 years
1990/91 - 1992/3, to only about US$11 per capita (using an exchang4 rate of US$1 =Z$6.3).

STD2H7 VPreventon and Care
1.43        The management of STDs is integrated into PHC services, which makes STD car
accessible and avoids stigmatizing. There exists an excellent manual on the management of STDs
for PHC workers, which is available in most facilities. Limited availability of appropriate drugs
in PHC facilities is reported sometimes to constrain effective STD management. MCH/?P
services provide appropriate opportunities for implementing comprehensive STID care for women.
Coverage of women is high: over 90% of pregnant women attend for ante-nal care, and about
half of all seually active women seek PP services. Although excellent curative services are
available for symptomatic women who are referred, routine screening for STh, diagnosis,
treatment, counseling and follow-up of sexual partners have not yet been sufficiently provided in
MCH/FP services. Even screening MCH/FP clients for syphilis - a well defined MCH policy -
has been limited. The five year national STID Control Programme (summaized in paras 1.82-
1.90 below) is the MON blueprint to address these weaknesses.
1.44        Depending on the degree of expertise at PHC clinics, the severity of complications
and the level of intervention required, STD patients (of whom the majority are male) are referred
to district, provincial or central hospitals. The only specialized SMD clinic is the Genito-uriny
Mbae Center in Harare, although the Khami Clinic in Bxlawayo has gained in repution as a
PHC clinic with skdlled STD care givers. Because of their integration and coverage, Zimbabwe's
curative STD services are regarded as the best in Africa. Training of health personnel has been
conducted by the Harare Genital-urinary (GU) center without any outside support, although the
numbers trained each year are limited due to lack of resources and limited space in the old Harare
Municipal building. More than 150 nurses from PHC clinics throughout the country have been
trained at the GU center since 1985. Equipment in the center needs upgrading and health
education messages, counseling techniques and partner notification need extensive strengthening.
1.45        Private practioners and clinics managed by commercial companies provide STD
services to a significant number of prople (estimated at one-third of persons seekng SMD care).
Some, but not all of these clinics follow standard STD treatment protocols. An unknown
proportion of STD patients seek treatment from traditional healers; little is known about the
effectiveness of the STD care provided.
1.46 In summary, STD care in Zimbabwe is PHC facility based, with genito-urinary reference
available, strong on curative practice and weak in reaching women and preventive measures.
Similar strengths and weaknesses are common in many STD programs worldwide.
Family Plnning Seics
1.47        Zimbabwe has one of the best family planning delivery systems in Africa. One half
of the country's family planning (FP) clientele are served by the Zimbabwe National Famfly
Planning Council (ZNFPC, a parastatal organization which provides contraceptives and FP
information through 33 fixed-location and 5 mobile PP clinics, 668 Community Based
Distributors (CBD) and a small Youth Advisory Service. Family Life Education (FLE) is
provided (on a voluntary basis) by 23 youth advisers to nearly 850 schools, some parents and out-
of-school youth. Ihese efforts will be complemented once the Ministry of Education (MOE) has
ready its mandatory STID/AIDS education modules for schools. There is a strong EC Unit, and



- 14-
an Evaluation and Research Unit which collects routine data and undertakes periodic surveys and
studies. ZNFPC provides training in PP service delvery and counseling to its own staff including
CBDs, to MOH trainers, the private sector and (on a limited scale) to other countries in the
region. ZNFPC is regarded as one of the most efficient and effective PP organizations in Africa.
1.48        Concerted efforts have been underway since the mid-1980s to integrate FP services
fbily into MOH health care provision (supported by FHP1 and PHP2, see paras 2.4-2.6 and
2.17). FP has been included in basic nurse and physician training since 1989. About 900 nurses
have undergone 4 or 6 week training courses in FP, and at least 6,000 nurses and nurse aides
have completed shorter in-service training sessions. Staff in rural health centers around the
country have carried out 1-3 day courses on FP for an estimated 4,500 traditional midwives and
1,500 village community workers, and reached 13,000 community leaders w,th information.
1.49        FP service delivery is widespread and generally good. In the 1988 Demographic
Health Survey, 36% of married women were using modern methods. The November 1991 MOH
MCHIFP survey sample suggests that contraceptive use has increased to 45% of married women
of reproductive age (although the use of different sampling methodology undermines the
comparability of the results). The current emphasis for the PP program is on improving the
quality of counseling and increasing the use of longer-term and more permanent methods.
Presently method use is dominated by the pill (80% of methods used). Condom use, as
mentioned earlier, is marginal (2 to 3%) and other barrier methods account for less than 1%.
Pew facilities carry these othier barrier or spermicide methods. 12/ IUD promotion ard use is
low, because of the concern that IUDs may increase the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in
women who contract gonorrhea andlor dchamydia. MOH and ZNPPC staff recognize that
promotion of longer-term methods will not help prevent disease transmission. It appears that a
policy has yet to be clarified on what method or mix of methods are recommended for clientele at
risk of STls.
1.50        A situation analysis of the FP program in September, 1991 by the ZNFPC and
USAID found that most CBDs are experienced FP workers, have received adequate basic and
ref^resher training and are visited frequently by supervisors. However, disease prevention
measures performed by both the CBDs and staff in the sample of MOH and ZNFPC clinics were
less than satisfactory for a population with high rates of STIs. Less ta 15% of clinic service
providers discussed health issues with their clientele; only 6% of the health discussions dealt with
reproductive trac infections, STDs, and/or AIDS. Pelvic exams were performed on only 57% of
new/restarting and method-switching clients. No mention is made in the analysis if women were
screened for STDs and how STD history or present status affected method promotion by staf.
The checklist for screening new or restaing clients includes quesdons to ask about irregular
bleeding (a rare symptom of some STD complications) but does not include a history of STDs or
STD symptoms.
1.51        Until recently, ZNFPC shared the reluctance of many FP programs to integrate PP
and H1V/AIDS prevention activities. Ihere was concern that multiple objectives might underme
FP program effectiveness, and that negative associations with HIV/AIDS might rub off onto
attitudes to PP. However, in the past year, ZNFPC has decided that they no longer have any
12/ The Situation Analysis Survey found them in stock in only eight percent of clinics sampled.

choice; the severity of the HIV problem requires that every possible opportuity be taken for
addressing It. FP clients include nearly half of all sexually-active people, many of whom are at
risk. The contacts that these clients have with service providers for PP are opportunities that
should not be missed in preventing HIVlAlDS.
1.52       The FP program has always supported STD screening and prevention in its service
provision, although actual performance is variable. ZNFPC is now strongly committed to
strengthening this part of the program to include HIV information. HIV testing with pre- and
post-counselling services will be set up in some PP referral facilities. A clear strategy has not yet
been developed for integrating overall STI prevention, but some first steps are being taken:
training curricula are being revised to strengthen the attention to STls, including HN; all
guidelines and checklists for providers are being revised to reflect this change; IEC activities,
materials and priorities are being reviewed and revised, and infection control measures are being
strengthened in all PP facilities (eg sterilization procedures, and use of disposable gloves).
The Zimbabwe National AIDS Coordination Program
1.53       NACP The Zimbabwe National ADS Coordinaion Program (NACP) was
established in 1988, with support from several international agencies (known at that time as the
National AIDS Cntmr Program) in response to the growing number of AIDS ases. The NACP
is responsible for coordinating overall national efforts of the 30+ organizations (national and
international, governmental and non-governmental) in Zimbabwe involved in prevention and
control of HIV/STDsJAIDS. Recognizing the importance of decentralization, NACP program
management has appropriately limited its role to implementation of national activities, providing
national leadership, and technical and financial support to implementors at operational level.
1.54       NACP Organiaion Overall management of the NACP is the responsibility of the
National Program Coordinator. He is supported by an Assistant Programme Coordinator funded
by UNDP (not yet filled) and an administrator. There are coordinators for STD control,
Counseling, and Communwity Home Based Care. Tbree EC Officers coordinate IEC activities
'targeted at three population groups: (1) general public and women, (2) youth in and out of school,
(3) men and women in the workplace. This focus on population groups and their points of access
illustrates the NACP's clear and accurate conception of the ultimate goal: that of reaching the
poplation. The WHO GPA has assigned an epidemiologist (WHO Team Leader), a counsellor
md technia-administrative officer to the NACP since 1989 to assist in strategy development and
oordination. Annex 7 contains the NACP organizational chart.
1.55       Evauation of NACP instituional effeiveness NACP program reviews were
conducted in 1990 and 1991. The 1990 review recommendations included actions to strengthen
NACP management capacity. The second review in 1991 noted difficulties and delays in
confirming NACP staff positions, in expediting financing flows and in supporting local initiatives.
Since then, several posts have been confirmed, and financia procedures are said to have
improved. The March 1993 evaluation wil determine the extent to which NACP has overcome
these problems, and whether additional measures are needed to improve their managerial and
administrative capacity.



. 16-
Other Coordinating and Technical Bodies
1.56       There are three other AIDS coordinating bodies. The National AIDS Coundi
(NAC) is a policy oriented, multi-sectoral advisory body, representing all relevant public and
private sector agencies. It has not been as successful in attaining broad political support as
originally hoped. Membership is impressive, but the lack of a budget and legal authority limit the
impact this body can have. The 1991 review of the NACP recommended that the NAC mandate
and structure be revised, and the leadership strengthened. Since then, the NAC have held regular
bi-monthly meetings (initially meetings were infrequent and ill-attended). NAC's
accomplishments are impressive given its voluntary status. The NAC has helped initiae a
program through which Health Programme Facilitators (HPF) plan and coordinate health
promotion activities of the government and private sector.
1.57       The Zimbabwe AIDS Health Expert Committee includes physicians and other
experts from a variety of disciplines in and outside of the government. It provides technical
advice on program implementation. Success has been limited. It met only twice between June
1990 and June 1991, and few sub-committees on the specific technical subjects were active. The
terms of reference for the Committee have been redeveloped, the structure reorganized and
priority issues identified to strengthen its effect. It has met once, in June 1992, since these
changes were implemented. Several subcommittees are active, notably those dealing with
Community Home Based Care, Condom Supply and Logistics Management Systems, and
Laboratories.
1.58       The Zimbabwe ADS Network (ZAN) is an umbrella body that facilitates
coordination among many of the AIDS service organizations and NGOs working in the country.
ZAN includes a large number of NGO and private sector organizations, and aims to enhance
communication and coordination among organizations involved In AIDS control actvities at boti
national, regional and international levels.
1.59       National capacity outside the government to help fight the epidemic is impressive.
There are various community and workplace projects being carried out by the University of
Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Red Cross Society, the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, and many
others. The Southern African Foundation for Economic Research (based in Harare) is considering
setting up a regional AIDS information network.
C.2 PROGRlAM INTERVENMONS
1.60       Zimbabwe's strategy to prevent further STI transmission and to cope with AIDS
and STD morbidity and mortality attracts high praise from WHO and other technical leaders in
the field. The strategy is multisectoral and decentralized, supported by an open government, and
implemented by a wide variety of NGO, academic and private organizations aside from the
government. It is heavily weighted towards the "only' available interventions to prevent sexual
transmission: (1) changing behavior through IEC efforts; (2) promoting the use of condoms; and
(3) effectively diagnosing, treating, and counseling STD patients. The strategy has also responded
to the ever increasing demand to cope with the consequences of HIV infection, by vigorously
initiating counseling and community care activities. Evaluation of the strategy has so far



- 17 -
measured mostly so-called 'process Indicators' such as the number of persons trained, workshops
held, condoms distributed, etc. Litte data exist to measure Impact on behavior change and
subsequent dsease reduction among target population groups.
1.61       NACP Mediwn Term Plan Planning of prvention and control activities is
coordinated under the 1988-1993 Medium-Ten Plan (MTP). The MT]? appropriately plac
major strategic importance on EC to prevent sexual transmission of HIV. There are 8 program
areas. The 1993 workplan clearly descnrbes each of the program areas, including major and sub-
objectives, strategies and activities to atain the objecives, indicators to measure attainment, a
timefiame for completing the activities, estimated costs and a responsible finding agency
identified. Ihese are all reviewed and adjusted as necessary for each annual plan revion,
keeping the specific objectives, strategies and targets responsive to progs and needs.
1.62       The MTP and 1992 and 1993 workplans and budgets are on file, and the latest ones
will be included in the implementation volume. The major objectives of each program area are as
follows: Management: Strngthen the mgerial capacity of the NACP and provincial and
municipal health administrton to effectively plan, manage and coordinate AIDS/HIV prevention
and control activities at the operational level. IEC Reduce/prevent HIV/STDTFB among the
general public and among women in partcular through effective IEC programs, among youth,
both in and out of school, and among the workforce. Cmmwnb Home Basd Care: Reduce the
physical and psychosocial impact of HIV/AIDS. Coaneftng: To enable individuals, fmilies,
care givers and other community members to tackle and overcome psycho-socia and cultural
barriers that are likely to inhibit the development and sustenance of positive emotional, attitudinal,
and behavioral chmges necessary for the prevention of H1V/STDs trnsmission and reduction of
impact of HIV/AIDS/STDs. Caidcal Managememn To ensure early detection, treatmnt and
overall management of HIV/AIDS/STDs.  idemdologicld Swwance-: To strengthen data
collection, reportig and epidemiological surveillance of HIVIAIDS/STDs. Laboratory syqport:
To establish and strenghen HIV/STD diagnostic capabilities and ensure safety of blood
transfusion.
1.63       NACP Budget The proposed budget for the five year MTP was US$13,281,547.
This total, consisfing of contributions from the World Health Organizaton (WHO), United
Nations Development Program (JNDP) and seven donors from North America and Europe will
be exceeded if the $10.6 million for years 1992 and 1993 pledged by the donors is received. Of
the eight program areas, IEC activities receive the highest proportion of the 1992 and 1993
budget. Ihe budget allocations, by program areas, are as follows: Program Management
$659,741, fEC: $4,351,624, Counseling: $647,862, Surveillance and Control: $1,065,700,
Clinical Mangement: $1,159,065, Research: $160,278, Public Labortry Support: $1,747,339,
Blood Transfusion Services $769,859. A description of program directions and achievements
follows in paras 1.69 to 1.07.
Evautons of NACP hPgrm
1.64       NACP program reviews were conducted in 1990 and 1991. Both review reports
cited considerable progress in training health personnel, increasing awareness among the general
population and in learning more about infected populations through improved srveillance. The
1990 review recommendations included actions to enhance government policy development,



- 18 -
sharpen communication strategies and strengthen training, counseling, and HIV/AIDS surveillance
activities. The reviewers noted two key weaknesses: little progress In developing the planned
STD program, and drug shortages at the peripheral levels.
1.65       The second review in 1991 highlIghted two major achievements over the year:
improved government AIDS policy directives and the drafting of a five year STD control plan.
However, the review team felt that there was still not enough broad political commitment to AIDS
prevention. as sectors other than health shoered limited involvement. Notable examples were the
very slow response of the education system to incorporate STD\HIV prevention messages into
their school curricula and the lack of an effective multisectoral coordinating body.
1.66       New M712 Plans In response to these reviews, the process for developing the new
MTP for 1994-98 has included a multi-sector planning met*ing in November 1992, at which a
team was put together, involving senior officials from the Ministries of Health and numerous
other Ministries and organisations.;Q/ This team is takdng the lead for ensuring that the MTP2
includes broad multi-sectoral interventions, that are well integrated into each Ministry or agencies
activities.
1.67       The MTP2 will continue the present broad directions of the Program, but with
much stronger involvement from other sectors. There will be increased attention to identifying
and developing AIDS policies, and improved support interventions for community based care.
Overall training is to be continued in preventive measures, impact aspects and monitoring.
Evaluation will take the form of (1) sectoral reports to the NAC, (2) monitoring of financial and
human resources devoted to the multisectoral strategy, and (3) measuring the impact in decreasing
HIV transmission.
1.68       The recoendations of the March 15-27, 1993 evaluation of the preceding five
year plan will be incorporated into the new MTP. Commentary on the four key intervendons of
prevention (IEC, condom promotion, STD control and blood screening) and the one mai
intervention of coping (caring for HIVIAIDS patients) follow.
Public Information, Education and Communication Activities
1.69       IEC Strategy - ahwnes Of ConwwnicatiOn The IEC strategy of NACP has three
main objectives: to increase public awareness, to encourage behavior change to reduce HIV
transmission and to strengthen the capacity and capabilities of institutions (community groups,

NGOs, etc.) Involved in IEC activities. The NACP has helped national efforts to use all
communication channels including media (radio, TV, newspapers), fora (workshops, seminars,
World AIDS Day, the Agricultural Show, the Trade Fair), art (drama, poems and song) and print
(posters, newsletters, pamphlets). In addition, schools, workplaces, and community meeting
places have been used to reach specific target groups. Person to person communication activities
such as counseling, information exchange and peer education - recruiting and educatng
individuals to act as leaders, mobUizers and agents of change among their peer groups - are also
receiving supprt. Such peer education efforts have shown through out the world to be
instrumenta i increasing condom use, and are proving low-cost and highly effective in
Zimbabwe. (More information on IEC appears in Annex 8.)
1.70        IEC Srtegy - Coordn&on IEC activities have been implemented by a broad
range of governmental and non-governmental organizations, at central and peripheral levels.
Coordination and monitoring of activities have been inadequate leading in some instances to
unnecessary duplication and ignorance about what other organizations are doing. There has been
no standardized reporting system for IEC activities, but a summary of efforts is under
preparation. Additionally, the recently revived EC subcommittee will provide a forum for better
coordination. This committee includes representatives from NaOs, armed forces, several
ministries, universities and the mcdia.
Overview of Recent IEC Activites
1.71        IntensUication of pubc awaeness of AIDS/STD: Print and electronic media
have been used to disseminate AIDS/STD education messages to the general public in order to
intensify and sustain awareness. Awareness campaigns (mtense media coverage) are typically 3
months long, and follow themes chosen for the annual World AIDS Day as well as other special
topics and messages. The high cost of television air time and print media are a constraint -
NACP does not get concessional rates even from Government meJia. Posters on care and support
for people with HIV/A1DS and on living positively with EIIV/AIDS have been produced and
distributed widely. Bitlboards with prevention messages are planned for 1993. Provinces and
NGOs have received funding through NACP for activities targeted to the general public and
specific groups. One national workshop and approximately 30 district workshops are planned this
year for political, religious and community leaders. Persons with AIDS (PWAs) will assist the
NACP in sensitizing the public.
1.72         Targetn Youlh: The Ministry of Education and Culture has developed a school
AIDS/STD education program including training materials, with assistance from UNICEF and the
NACP. These will become compulsory in grades 4 through A levels (ages 9 through 18 yeas)
from 1993. Sucb efforts will complement the optional ZNFPC Family Life Education courses.
AIDS-STD prevention messages will reach students in many subject categories aside from health,
(social studies, religion and moral studies, etc). Additionally, songs, drama and poems have been
used to inform students beginning at age 10. Aside from extensive use of radio programs, work
has begun in 1992 on a film on AIDS and STD for adolescents. The youth peer educator
program for youth in and out of school, initiated in 1989 and inactive in 1992, will be reactivated
in 1993. The most important event for 1993 will be the convening of a national planning meeting
to develop strategies, messages and activity packages for reaching youth at all access points.
Activities to reach University students and to complement ZNFPC courses for parents are planned
as well.

1.73       Ta,e*tg Women: A number of women's groups had raised concern about women
and AIDS and ttie need to develop and strengthen IEC programs specily targeted to women.
Consequently, an IEC officer In NACP wa assigned to coordiate the mobilization of women and
women's groups and related NGO's in the fight against AIDS. Twelve women's groups (such as
Women and Law, Women In the Armed Forces, Women in Professions) wl be mobilized witi
the help of ZNFPC to develop relevant messages on STD-IIV provenion and to discuss how to
address other -dated issues.
1.74       Tageln commerd  sex paiptmw: A peer educator program for commercial
sex workers and their clients in Bulawayo City which began in 1990 was evaluated in 1992. The
programme focusses on STM prevention and control and promotion of condom use and
development of self help projects. Eighty sex workers, musicians and others were trained as peer
educators. There are an estmatd  12,500 prostitutes in Bulawayo city alone. Within 2 years,
over 4,500 education meetings were attended by more than 380,000 people, and 2.4 million
condoms were distributed. W   Similar programs are being initiated in several other towns in
the county. Ihese interventions are very low cost: less than US$10 per meeting, US$0.16-22
per face-to-face contact, and only 1 cent (US) per condom ditibuted.
1.75       Tatgeftlg at the Workpwace: Substantial progress has been made, despite initial
reservaions and concerns by management in some companies. A tot of 60 Health Program
Facilitators (HPF) in private commerce, uniformed forces, and the transport and hotel industries
have been trained and are actively involved in organizing education actvities wi  their
workplaces. Now hat the NACP has a full time IEC Coordinator for this intervention, a total of
585 HPF are to be traind by the end of 1993. Ihe NACP, Harare City Health Department and
NGO's have provided technical support at several of the workplace meetgs and seminars held.
A program of AIDS/STD education and promotion of condom use for commercial farm workers
has been initiated in the Mutorashanga area in Mashonalnd West province. A peer-education
project worldng with fishermen ihving in camps in the Kariba area held 1,700 meetn  attended
by 74,400 people and dItibuted 1.33 million condoms in one year, and reports a significant
decrease in STDs. There remain many workplaces where condoms are not yet promoted and
distributed. MOH policy protects against mandatory HIV screening and subsequent firing because
of HIV stats, but there is no legal protection.
Condom Promotion
1.76       Condoms are the only proven reliable means of preventing the trnsmission of STIs
during sexual intercore, and hence are indispensable in STI control. In recent years, demand
has grown rapidly-from 3 million In 1985 to 35 million in 1992-and is expected to continue
rising. This is a notable achievement for the Government's IEC efforts, and an important step
toward achieving a condom use rate sufficient to stop the growth in new HIV cases. Until
recently, most condoms were distributed by ZNFPC, but now more than half are provided
through Govenment health facilities. Distribution to facilities is efficiently hadled by ZNFPC
(using private transport companies as necessary). As volumes condue to grow and ZNFPC takes

on more of the logistics, greater funds and expertise will be needed. ZNFPC recognises this, and
is planning to train a full-time logistics manager. At the same time as demand is increasing, the
futre supply of condoms had become insecure. Condoms in Zimbabwe had long been provided
by donors, but there had been no identified source after the last donor shipment scheduled to
arrive in September 1993. Therefore, although the health sector is succeeding in persuading
people to use condoms, success would be threatened if an adequate supply is not maintained.
1.77       The supply of condoms threatens to be a serious impediment to efforts to increase
their use. Ihe ongoing peer education projects at the community level have relied on free
condoms, and are now required to pay ZNFPC lOc (=US 1.6c). These projects will continue to
depend heavily on free or highly-subsidized condoms, as many of their target clients have very
low incomes and may have fairly high price elasticity of demand for condoms, especially given
that consistent use is still fairly new.
1.78       The condom is very little used as a contraceptive, and has tended to be
recommended wifhin the FP program only as an interim measure for new contraceptors. The
recent srvey of FP serice provision found that 17% of the CBD's sampled had no condoms in
their bags. Only two percent of the interactions with clients during 146 home visits made by
CBDs resulted in clients accepting condoms. Clinics were slightly better on this front: condoms
were available in 89% of the 181 clinics visited by the analysis team, and 27% of the clinics
reported new clients for condoms (versus 74% of clinics with new clients for pills).
1.79       The NACP and ZNFPC IEC teams have worked together on campaigns to promote
condom use, and with the social marketing initiative. A 5-minute television spot has received
wide coverage and won an award for the best advertisement in Zimbabwe in 1992. Newspaper,
posters, drama, and radio spots have been widely used as well.
1.80       IEC efforts have begun to show results. As noted above, the use of condoms has
increased consistently since the NACP was established, from approximately 6 million in 1988 to
43 million in 1992, and is projected to reach 70 million by 1997. The intensive peer-educator
interventions among prostiutes show very strong relationships between condom use and
attendance at community meetings to talk about AIDS and condoms, and with peer education
sessions. Virtly all this increase in use reflects enhanced awareness of AIIDS. The social
markedng of condoms which tends to focus on family planning has made relatively little headway
(see para 1.81 below). Much more remains to be done. The successful intervenions need to be
replicated country-wide, and other target groups reached as well.
1.81       Social Mwading of Condoms As part of SOMARC, a USAID-funded population
project, efforts to use commercial marketing techniques to increase the demand for condoms and
to make them available commercially began in 1988. In 1991, 1.18 million condoms were
ditributed commercially, this increased to 2 million in 1992. Under the standard assumption that
100 condoms provide one couple with a year of protection, these condoms could have protected
12,000 couples in 1991 and 20,000 couples in 1992. This is an achievement, but is only 1-2% of
sexualy active couples. It lags far behind what is possible, as demonstrated by social marketing
projects in other countries, and far below the program's own targets. The SOMARC group
believe they could sell 12-14 million condoms, given their prices, and the middle- and upper
income group that they target. Achieving this will require expanding gready the number of
distibution points. However, SOMARC aims at a limited target group, and has a conservative



- 22 -
family-planning orientation. Much broader targeting, using bars and hotels as distribution points
is being discussed by others.
National Sexually Transnitted Diseases Prevention and Control Program
1.82       In 1991, after a national conference on STDs, MOH developed a five-year National
Sexually Transmitted Diseases Prevention and Control Programme (STD Program). TIhe program
addresses the problems identified at the conference, including: lack of a clear-cut policy on STD
control and of a comprehensive STD control program; inadequate health education and
community participation; inadequate training for health care workers; poor laboratory facilities;
poor partner notification tracing; shortages of drugs; and an irregular supply of condoms.
1.83       The national SlT  Program has 7 key objectives, for each of which there is a clear
set of strategies, programmatic and temporal targets, monitoring indicators, and proposed budget.
The objectives are as follows:
(1)    To develop a national policy on STD prevention and control and ensure its
implementation through inegrated health services
The plans for developing a national policy on STD control are consistent with MOH's overall
policy of keeping activities integrated into primy health care, ensuring good coordination
through joint STD-AIDS bodies, and taking a multisectoral approach. MOH needs to clarify the
priority to be placed on STD control, and improve STD screening whin MCH/FP services. A
dynamic and skilled full-time STD Program Manager/coordinator will be essential. Ihe NACP
National Program Coordinator now has this responsibility, helped by one Assistant. There is a
clear need for 2 program officers for overseeing supervision and training in the field. Their
duties would include organizing all training of health personnel, carrying out supervision visks at
the provincial level, assisting in the development of operational research including partner
notification systems, and ensuring project monies effective reach provincial and district levels in
the form of equipment, training costs, training and health education materials, etc.
1.84        (2)   To reduce the incidence of STDs through Information, Education and
Counselng
The STD Prevention Program identifies IEC efforts both in and outside health facilities as an
essendal component of STD care. At present, health workers do not counsel STD patients
effectively - that is, talk with them about prevention, the threat of HIV and promote condom
use. The continued increase in STD cases in Zimbabwe despite excellent curative services is an
indicator of many missed counselling opportunities to motivate clients to change behavior. In
addition to improved counseling, STD messages will be incorporated into the ongoing NACP IEC
activities in the community, especially peer education programs targeted at special groups:
commercial sex workers and clients; ante-natal and FP clinic attendees, adolescents and young
adults, and others. Operational research on partner notification schemes will entail substantial
input from the IEC experts in the country.
1.85        (3)   To ensure early detection, treatment and overal management of S119
patients and improve the diagnostic capability for STDs by strengthening
fte existing public health laboratory system at key points



-23 -
The STD Prevention Programme has four basic stategies for cast management: (1) detecting
disease through screening individuals, finding cases based on clinical or laboratory evidence and
diagosing primarily by syndrome; (2) treating individuals with medications that ate efficacious,
safe, low cost and available; (3) follow up of sexual contacts with either examinaon or
prophylactic treatment; and (4) providing clinical services throughout the coury that wil provide
diagnosis, treatment, counseling, and partner notiflcation. Although the majority of patients
seeking STD care will be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms (the WHO-recommended
syndromic approach), some simple and sophisticated laboratory support will be needed throughout
the country to deal with treatment failures, rare infections and research. Case management of
STDs is clearly set out in algorithms in the EDL1Z. Selection of drugs conform with current
WHO recommendations.
1.86        (4)   To strengthen data collection, reporting and epidemiological surveillance on
STDs
Iresently, only two facilities report SIDs by syndrome category; all other reports make no
distinctions among STDs. Reporting of positive serologies for syphflis is irrgular. Data are
limited on prevalence of STDs in particular groups, by biographical and risk factors, and numbers
of partners examined as a result of partner notification. The Five-Year plan includes syndrome
dagnosis at all provincial levels (beginning with phased sentnel surveillance), regula
epidemiological reports on STDs, disease prevalence and behavioral studies, and pilot reporting
systems for sexual contact tracing. These activities will greatly strengthen overall program
nmagement by providing the necessary data for decision-ming and monitoring of progress.
1.87        (5)   To train all health care providers in prevention, diagnosis, treatment and
management of STDs
Training is extremely important since the program's effectiveness is depenant upon motivated
and competent personnel performing thorough case management. Additionally, this component
will require considerable input from the NACP and MOH in terms of course organization,
development of training content, training materis, and on-the-job follow-up and supervision. In-
sevice training is planned for 2 doctors, 50 Snurses at the GU centers, and 10 to 15 social health
workers, 25 health assistants, and 48 laboratory technicians at PHC or GU facilities, for each
year of the five year program. As mentioned previously, two program officers from NACP will
be needed to coordinate such efforts.
1.88        (6) To carry out operational and other research activities in priority areas on STD
one national workshop to identify top resea  priorities wil be required to sa  this component
in the right direction. Both basic and applied research will be needed. Research activities are
likely to include the following:
-patterns of antibiotic sensitivities
-propordon of pathogens constituting urethditls and ulcer disease
-prevalence of STDs and prevailing pathogens among populations
-idenfication of nsk factors among STD patients and other groups
-understanding of social, sexual, economic, and cultural aspects of STDs



-24 -
-improved case management (simplified diagnosis for women)
-improved clinic management (patient flow, patient education)
-improved methods for community outreach (contact tracing, prevention)
1.89       Seventh and findi objective:
* to ensure continuous monitoring and evaluation of planned activities
Both process and impact indicators will be required to monitor progress in decreasing STD
mortality and morbidity. The NACP current process indicators will suffice in many instances and
the proposed STD Prevention Program process Indicators appear highly appropriate for the iniial
stages. The WHO indicators for measuring impact, once field testing is complete, will need to be
adapted by the NACP for STD-HIV-AIDS monitoring. The current lack of STD prevalence data
on groups considered at risk in Zimbabwe means that there are few valid baseline data. The
MTP2 evaluation strategy will address these deficiencies.
1.90       The activities in the National STD Plan will initially increase thli demand for
services, and thus the need for drugs and diagnostics. (As the program succeeds, STDs and
therefore drug and diagnostic needs should eventually decline.) Budgetary and likely donor grant
resources fall far short of the need for drugs to treat STDs or AIDS opportnistic infections.
Drug shortages are reported and discussions with the MOH chief pharmacist and budget officers
confirmed insufficient finances for previous and current procurement needs. A rough estimate
suggests that the drug budget needs to increase by at least 30%, and then to increase steadily over
the coming years, to keep pace with population growth, usual trend increases in drug use, and the
growing number of AIDS cases.
Natinal Blood Trnfusion Service - lilV Screening, Testilg and Counseling
1.91       The National Blood Transfusion Service (NETS) is a non-profit organisation, and
finances itself from sales of blood and blood products (MOH hospitals being the main customer),
and from some private local and inteational donations. A National Advisory Committee which
includes represenaives from MOH, the Public Health Laboratory and veteran blood donors, sets
policy.
1.92        There are 5 centers (Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Masvingo and Mutare) where
donors are recuited and screened, and blood is collected, processed and distributed. About
80,000 pints are processed annually, with Harare accounting for over half, and Bulawayo for
about one quarter. The NBTS has some problem meeting the demand for blood. All of the
whole blood avaiable is used, and about 30% of the plasma.
1.93       Every blood donation is tested for HIV antibodies, Hepatitis B, syphilis (and some
other less common conditions). Testing is centralized in Harare and Bulawayo for efficiency and
economy, and bett quality control. About 9% of all blood is discarded, only 2.5% becuse of
HIV, and about 2.8% because of Hepatitis B. ELISA tests are used for HIV. with a secondary
confimatory test for all positive results. Blood used to be pooled (5 units) for testing, until 1989,
when NBTS switched to testing individual units, because of the high seroprevalence. The BTS



-25 -
has progressively instituted selective screening procedures that have made an impressive
improvement in the percentage of donors testng HIV positive:
Year            1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992
% Donors HIV+   2.3   2.6   3.2   5.2    4.7   3.0    2.5
Information talks at the beginning of donor sessions explain the screening, and that all blood Is
tested (said to be a deterrent to some people), and that people with dmltiple sex partners risk
failing the screening criteria. Medical histories are taken from all potea  donors, to screen for
treatment for STDs since 1985, recent treatment with antibiotics, and possible AIDS symptoms,
including night sweats, diarrhea, fever, skin diseases, swollen lymph glands. AU donors are
given the option of getting test results, and asked for names of doctors to whom they can be
referred for counseling if necessary. It is reported that almost all donors ask for test results, and
in fact the NBTS thinks that people may even be ging blood in order to get a free HIV test.
1.94        WHO has been providing the ELISA diagnostic test kis needed for screening the
blood supply, but funding problems mean that they are unlikely to be able to continue to do so.
Irregular supplies have forced the NBTS to buy tests themselves. Ihey buy directly from
suppliers in Germany and South Africa. This poses a problem for the service, given its reliance
on cost recovery financing. Ultimately, costs have to be passed on to MOR, their main
customer.
1.95        There has not yet been much demand for HIV tests from the public, but as people
become more aware of their own personal risk of HIV, exprience from elsewhere suggests that
this demand may grow as concerned individuals seek to know their HIV status. The feasibility of
making tests available to the public is being debated in Zimbabwe. Tesing costs are falling
dramatically and testing technology is improving. Several new low cost scrnig devices bave
recently come on the market. A new visually-read, rapid HIV-1 +2 screening dipstick test bas
been developed and tested by PATH. It costs only US$0.40 compared to US$1.S0-2.00 for an
EL1SA test. Evaluation in the laboratory and in the field, including in Kenya and Cameroon, has
demonstrted a sensitivity of virtuay 100% and specificity of approximatey 98% .22
CARING FOR IWVIAMDS PATIm
The National Tuberculosis Plogram
1.96        Tuberculosis (TB) control activities are directed by the Disease Control Unit in the
Epidemiology Departnent of the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. In response to
recommendations made by a national program review, an official of the MOR has been given
exclusive responsibility to head the national program. TB control activities are speised at the
provincial level by the PMDs and other Medical Officers. District Medical Officers supervise
facilities in their districts that serve as TB diagnostic and treatment centers. The Environmental
Health Technicians (EHTs) are responsible for TB case detection, contact tracing and TB case

holding (making decisions about whether to refer a TB case to hospital). Despite a heavy
workload - the EHTs have many other responsibilities, and are fairly thin on the ground, with
only 1 E.HT per 14,700 population - the staff at all levels are reported to be motivated and
dedicated to their workL
1.97        A thorough review of the natdonal TB program was carried out in March 1992
jointly by the MOH and WHO. The purpOSe of the review was to assess all aspects of the control
program in order to identify program strengths and weaknesses; and to recommend practical
measures to Improve the effectiveness of treatment, case-finding and prevention, as well as the
use of available resources.
1.98        The review team found case-finding activities to be effective, although data were
not available to estimate the proportion of new TB cases detected by the present system. TB
surveillance and notification were found to operate reasonably well.
1.99        Severa weakness in laboratory services were identified: facilities and capacity of
district laboratories are inadequate and the quality of smear microscopy questionable. The
performance of the national TB laboratory in Bulawayo suffers from inadequate staffing, transport
problems and processing delays. The review team recommended: training for laboratory
technicians, quality control of smear microscopy, and culture and drug sensitivity testing.
1.100       The provision of in-patient treatment of two months for most TB patients was
deemed a major achievement of t e program. Unfortuately, the modification of the TB
treatment regimen in order to respond to the rise in HIV infected-cases contributed to drug
shortages and stock-outs. Consequently, the review recommended that an uninterrupted supply of
all drugs required for TB be ensured by the gov:rnment and that the several treatment regimens
be re-assessed to improve effective treatment of all forms of TB and to reduce costs.
1.101       Since the review, a national action program has been developed. It is complete
and systematic, and outlines specific actions, responsibilities and costs (both MOH budget and to
be covered by  tern   funds) to address all the weaknesses identfied during the March review.
The Dutch Government has expressed an interest in fimding the implementation of this program,
and is providing a one-year buffer stock of drugs.23/ The Dutch have strong tehnical
comparative advantage in this area, with a health advisor resident in Harare, who has considerable
experience with TB programs.
Community Rome-Based Care
1.102       The majority of AIDS care in Zimbabwe is given in the home, through Communty
Home-Based Care (CHBC) activities. In CHBC, a patient receives drugs through the usual
chamel of a hospital or clinic, but receives more comprehensive care - including counseling ad
vital psychological support - at home. Caregivers include family members, community
volunteers, staff of NMOs, ad regular health workers. It is planned that caregivers would use a
home-care kit equipped with items such as analgesics, simple antibiotics, antifingals, gloves,
aI Shipment is expected in April and May. These drugs are valued at Dutch GuAders 1.5 mfllion.



-27-
soap, disinfectant bleach and sometimes clean linens. Their responsibilities are: to provide
emotional support to patient and family, check on the patient's medication compliance, inquire
about new symptoms and ask the patient and family about any other needs.
1.103      Recognizing the social, psychological and financal Importance of a robust home-
based care program, the NACP in 1990 set up a CHBC unit to begin coordinating and drawing
lessons from the several pilot projects already mounted by MOH, city health departments, NGOs,
the Red Cross, and clinics. Over the next two years, the progrm incorporated nearly SO pilot
projects across all eight provinces into a loose confederation. Through ongoing study and support
of their efforts, the NACP identified a four-tiered approach to AIDS care, in which each level
would reinforce the level below with training and resources to achieve maximum outreach and
impact:
(1) Venicci: hospital-based care and follow-up
(2)   ainic-based: integratig HIV care Into community follow-up of other
diseases such as diabetes
(3)   Commwdiy-Ine8rad: integrating community and NGO initiatives with
regular health services
(4)   Commwdy-based: a pure community effort, often local women taking the
initiative and soliciting local volunteers
1.104       CHBC's plan is to use this structure to empower caregivers at the grassot level.
Especily by raining of trainers, CHBC aims to maintain the decentalized nature of community
care while ensuring effective care. The objective is to make community groups self-reliant and
independent of clinics except for the provision of kits and regular monitoring. Trainers across the
country currendy give a five-day course to health workers both in the fimdamentals of home-
based care and in supervising other caregivers. Training is given by provincial medical officers
and various NGOs. It includes actual home visits as well as practice in counseling in hospital and
homes. When a province expresses interest in training, a planning workshop is held to identify
local needs. Specia emphasis is placod on community relations, to inform and prepare the
community for the presence of caregivers. Some training of family members is also being done.
Once caregivers are trained, their only responsibility to the clinic is to report regularly in small
notebooks issued by CHBC using a supervision checldist or, for illiterate caregivers, an oral
report.
1.105       Ihe program has been highly successful within the severe limits imposed by budget
and personnel constrains. Once informed of CHBC, communities are eager to be trained and
receive kits. Caregivers themselves are reportedly enthusiastic, and there are few dropouts. To
date, however, only a small fraction of AIDS patients have received such care, and even they are
visited on average only once a month. Simple supplies such as gloves and disinfectant are in
short supply, and training has not yet reached enough caregivers to ensure even moderate
coverage of AIDS patients. Transportation remains a central problem, as many caregivers must
travel long distances among homes on foot.
1.106      In August 1992, NACP convened a national planning workshop with the key
objectives of inventorying all current pilot projects, examining prevafling practices, identifying
ways to strengthen community caregivers, and drawing up standardized national guidelines. Most
of the attendees were health workcers and other caregivers. Workshop participants stressed the



-28 -
impotance of autivatin community understanding of AIDS in an appropriate language and in
taloring iervenons to   cicumstnces of each community. EC and individual family
counseling were cited as especIly Important. With respect to standardizing CHBC practice, the
workshop proposed a six-point Implementation approach: (1) mobilization of families and
community resources; (2) EC in support of AIDS patients and their families; (3) counseling and
social suppot; (4) training; (5) monitoring n evaluation; and (6) promoting multisectoral
cooperation in CHBC. To help implement these components, the workshop made several
recommnendations, including bettwr protection of client confidentiality, development of a clea
referl system, improvement of the recording and reportng system, adoption of monitoring
indicators, and identification of criteria fr seleceing community members as caregivers. I also
called for training guidelines, which are due in draft in mid-March 1993. Those guidelines will
feed Into a follow-up workshop on training of trainers to be held in June or July 1993. These
effrs  will then be combined Ito an operational strategy for CHBC that is expected to form an
important plank of the Second Medium Term Plan of the NACP.
1.107       In summry, the current status of the response to the H1V/AIDS epidemic in
Zimbabwe shows real achievements;
- over 90% awareness of AIDS among the popuation,
- a variety of IEC activities and projects to encourage behavior change,
- an impressive incrsase in condom dbution,
- merous active partcipas (public and private), and
- good PP and STD care programs committed to improving the quality of care,
which all show excelent potenta for making strong headway against this disease. However, this
potetal could be seriously jeopardied by inadequate funding for three critical inputs: condoms,
drugs, and diagnostics tests. Without sufficient supplies of these commodities, the programs and
resources devoted to them will fall to make a significant impact.
D. PHAMCEUIICALS
The Essenti Drg Pioram
1.108       EDLIZ. Zimbabwe has better drug contol procedures than most African
countries, due in large part to its adoption of an essential drugs' program. The essential drugs
approach, spearheaded by WHO, is designed to ensure that basic medical needs of all sectors are
met, consistent with each country's resources. It concentrates on the drugs most commonly used
to treat about 90 percent of the causes of morbidity in developing countries. Most essential drugs
appear on WHO's Essential Drg List, are listed in accepted international compendia, and are
available under generic names, which keeps costs low.
1.109       At Indce,Zimbabwe began developing a national drugs policy in line with
WHO's Action Prom    on Essential Drugs. In 1981, the country published a proposed
essential drugs list, focused on pharmaceicals considered essendal for treating conditions
common in Zimbabwe. The list was formally adopted by the National Drugs and Therapeutics
Policy Committee as the first Essental Drugs List for Zimbabwe (EDLIZ) in 1985. It included



-29 -
375 drugs classified by use, as well as treatment guidelines for common conditions. It established
a national policy that all prescribing, ordering, labeling and dispensing of drugs be carried out in
accordance with the EDLIZ, and that (with limited exceptions) all drugs be labeled generically.
EDLIZ has become a model adopted by many other countries. Reliance on low-cost regimens
and the required use of generic drugs have helped keep Zimbabwean health care relatively cost-
effective. Updated twice (in 1988 and 1989), the EDLIZ is currently undergoing another
revision, and a fourth edidon is due in 1993. The revision process has involved public and
private health professionals.
1.110       ZEDAP. The Zimbabwe Essential Drugs Action Programme (ZEDAP) was
launched in late 1986. The aims were to evaluate the country's drug needs, to ensure a regular
supply of low-cost drugs used in an optimal manner, and to provide personnel to train staff in all
phases of drug supply-selection, procurement, distribution, storage, management and use. With
support from DANIDA and WHO, a ZEDAP team briefed all eight provinces, began estimating
national drug requirements, and undertook a baseline survey. Using a demand-morbidity method
and taking into account EDLIZ standard treatment regimens, the team projected costs for 159
basic drugs. In 1987, a national workshop on drug policy and management (involving several
ministries and private sector suppliers) reviewed the team's findings and developed a plan to
alleviate shortages. The workshop recommended, and in 1987 the Cabinet agreed, to establish a
special reserve of foreign exchange for drugs and the finance ministry committed fuids to clear
the bacldog in public sector tenders. The baseline survey of 1987 revealed an acute need for
more relevant reference materials and guidance in case management. Since then, ZEDAP has
produced more than 20 modules covering clinical subjects ("STDs," 'Gynecology and Family
Planning-) and management topics ('Ordering and Stock Control," "Dispensing Drugs"). The
modules include the minimum necessary knowledge for effective clinical and drug management at
the PHC level, and case provider knowledge is comparatively good. Phase II of ZEDAP, begun
in early 1993, focuses on improving logistics, particularly transportation and communicaton, and
eorganization of Government Medical Stores.
1.111       The first decade of the essential drugs approach has brought significant success.
Zimbabwe has managed to contain drug costs to a far greater degree than many similarly siuated
countries. The private sector is using-and even reconunending-cheaper generic drugs in place
of brand names, a principal goal of the EDLIZ. A survey at the end of 1990 showed that referml
hospitals reported having 82% of 342 EDLIZ drugs in stock, while rural health ceters' stock was
lower on average, and varied widely among facilities. However, further improvements could be
made. Stockuts periodically occur of such essentials as anesthetics and key antibiotics.
Government Medical Stor
1.112       All public sector pharmaceutical and consumable medical supply needs in
Zimbabwe are handled by Government Medical Stores (OMS), which is part of the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare. OMS supplies MOH (which pays for drugs out of the Medical Care
Services section of the MOH budget), as well as the army, police, prisons, and parks and
wildlife, which pay out of their own budgets. The head of GMS, the Controller, reports directly
to the Director of Pharmaceutical Services in MOH.
1.113       OMS has two centrl supply oudets, each supporting two provincia medical stors
(PMS) and directly supplying two other provinces:



-30-
GMS Nothem-Harare, supporting
PAMS I Mashonaland West (befi built in Chinoyi)
PMS 2 Maicaland (Mutare)
Mashonaland EM   (direct supply from Harare)
Mashonaland Cen*d (direct supply from Harare)
GMS Southern-Bdawayc, supportng
PMS 3 Mkgands (Oweru)
PMS 4 Masngo (Mvingo)
Matabeleland North (direct supply from Bulawayo)
Matabeleland Sowh (direct supply from Bulawayo)
1.114      The central GMS in Harare handles all management, accounting and buying; the
other stores serve as delivery depots. Good use is made of commercial transportation (Swift
Transport, Railway Motor Service) which is available throughout Zimbabwe. GMS vehicles
deliver to district level, and sometimes beyond, though the district typically takes responsibility
for getting supplies to the clinics. For oudying clinics, this has posed problems. In its support
program to GMS, DANIDA intends to provide one additional vehicle and trailers at each of the
PMSs to Increase service and ensure a backup for breakdowns. GMS is also considering a
proposal to establish up to 20 district stores to help alleviate shortages.
1.115      Through the Government Tender Board, GMS handles most drug procurement for
Zimbabwe. The MOH budget for medical and surgical supplies in FY93 was Z$70 million.
Drugs accounted for Z$61 million of that, in addition to which GMS had to handle some Z$30
million for other agencies. To finance its purchases, GMS draws on a revolving capital fund of
Z$17 million. The fund, however, is not an endowment, but a loan from the Ministry of Finance
on which GMS pays interest (currenty at 11.5%). Until 1992, GMS resold the items to health
fcilities at average historical cost plus a 15% an   fe6, and was not permitted to retain
any revenues. Since July 1992, GMS has been allowed to charge at acta cost, but remains
consistedy underfunded. Despite the growth in drug demand and high domestic inflation over
the past several years, the GMS revolving fund has remained at Z$17 million, tius eroding its
real value significandy in the past two years and constricting the inventory GMS can hold.
Accordingly, stocks have been depleted over the years and delays in paying suppliers have
become more common.
1.116      The lack of funds is one of two important problems that donors are addressing with
support. The EC has signed a grant of Z$27 million, of which GMS can use $17 million to pay
off the MOF loan, relieving GMS of interest paymens. The remaining Z$10 is intended as seed
capital for an independent revolving fund, which will need to be augmented to enable OMS to
purchase more regularly, in economic quantities, ard to maintain adequate stocks to overcome the
constant shortages. (However, this still would not address the inadequate MOH budget allocation
for drugs.) The project also alms to help make instttional improvements at GMS; a report is
due in April 1993.
1.117      The other central problem is GMS's stock management. It is widely agreed dat
stock management-especially inventory-is the weakest aspect of GMS operations. The ratio of
turnover/inventory, an indicator of sound stock management that should exceed three, has



-31 -
declined at GMS from more than 3.1 in FY89 to 1.1 in FY92. GMS has had increasing trouble
in recent years as its working capital has declined, turnover and needed inventory have expanded
without a corresponding increase in personnel or resources. One result is shortages, which have
been high over the past three years, with 45-48% of requested line items out of stock. The goal
is to reduce this to 30%. The percentage declined slightly in 1992, with improvements in EDLIZ
and with obsolete line items no longer being ordered.
1.118       Improved inventory is a key to better stock management. Inventories are still kept
manualy, making updating difficult. A computer has now been secured, and staff from the
government Central Computer Office are being seconded to operate it. A DANIDA advisor is
helping automate inventory in the provinces. This will enable several important improvements:
New EDLIZ items could be obtained quickly and remaining stocks of deleted items
imPediately distributed. At present, changes to EDLIZ take months to implement rather
than weeks.
Required tender quantities could be revised quarterly rather than amnally, and gauged
more accrately.
Shortages/overages would be recognized Immediately rather than  ree months after the
fad.
Expiry dates couid be monitored in each store.
Drugs nearing expiration date in any PMS could be rapidly redistributed to other PMS's
for immediate usage.
Only appropriate drugs of an assigned category would be sent to each level of treatme
center. Special treatment cases of certain diseases could be individually assigned and
monitored.
* Usage profiles could be established for each facility and monitored for variation. This
could be tied to disease pattern reporting, a powerfud management and monitoring tool.
Significant changes in drug use by any facility would have to be justfied to rule out
over/under prescribing, over/under ordering, theft, and unrecorded use (which is an
occasional practice with STD drugs because of the stigma antached to such diseases).
1.119       With the steady expansion of the national public health care system, the workload
and size of the GMS have rapidly increased. Some capacity building has taken place with the
assistnce of DANIDA, and more is underway. Under Phase I of ZEDAP, enlarged bulk storage
wiUl be Installed in all the PMSs. The expansion of present facilities and distribution centers,
makes the need for computerized central inventory control even more urgent.
Procurement
1.120       Drug requirements are estimated once a year, based on consumption data reported
by health facilities, adjusted by the morbidity pattern and avail3bility of resources. Although it is
growing oudated, the standard, nationwide system of stock control Zimbabwe uses has served as
the foundaion for a relaively effective drug supply system. Zimbabwe has differed from other
countries in using a "pull system' in which health care workers in facilities make needs estimates,
rather than having centrally located staff dictate supply in a top-down 'push system." (in other
words, the system is demand-driven rather than supply-based.) Manuals have been written on
drug ordering and workshops held for personnel in health facilities. Health care workers are



-32-
instructed to note balances on hand and quantites required; any subsequent deparure frm thee
numbers must be justifled in writing before extra supplies are sent.
1.121      At present, drugs are procured through open general local tender. Since June
1992, all EDLIZ drugs (or their constituent raw materials for locally processed drugs) hae been
on the OGIL, although many single component diagnostics are not. Invitations for bids are
published in the local newspaper. Local subsidiaries receive a 5% advantage, and local
manufacturers 10%. Where there is no local supplier or local agent, tender documents a  sent
overseas in response to supplier requests, primarily from the United Kingdom, Germany, Soudt
Africa, and the United States. Tenders are all adverised in generic terms, but if a brand name
product is tendered at the lowest price (and meets quality criteria) it will be awarded the tender.
The GMS prepares tender documents and evaluates bids, and the Government Tender Board
handles bid submission, opening and approves the evaluation and tender award  Cotact awards
are conditional on drug registration by the Drug Control Council (see par  1.22-1.24). In total,
the process typically takes three to six months from solicitation for bids to plaement of orders.
If an awarded tender cannot be delivered in the allotted time, the second-lowest priced tender will
be awarded. Bid prices are valid for three months, after which a supplier may apply for a price
increas by providing written justification.  is occurred quite fuedtly prior to 1991; since
then, price increase requests have declined to about 5-10% of tenders. Delivery is by sea firelgt
through Baira and Durban, South Africa. Drugs typically take two months to reach port and
another two to four weeks from there to Zimbabwe. For bulky items or large quantties, sal
smaller deliveries are taken every 3-4 months. The GMS has agreed to the two minor
amnendments to their us:dal procedures that will bring them into conformity with IBRD Guidelines:
iternational advertising, and the standard 15% price margin of preference to locally
manufactured goods with at least 20% domestic value-added. The new Bank sample document
for drug tenders is to be used.
Registratlon and Quaity Control
1.122      All drugs avallable in the country are registred and their quality controlled. The
Drugs Control Council (DCC) and the Zimbabwe Regional Drugs Control Laboratory (ZRDCL)
regulate the use of drugs. The Health Professions Council (IPC) indecly plays a role as well,
in that it examines and registers all health professionals, and monitors professional ethics and
continuing expertise and capabilities. The HPC handles ethical problems reported by the public,
the recognized professional bodies or the Drugs Control Council.
1.123      The DCC controls drug quality, efficacy, safety, advertg. The Council meets
monthly, and is very acdve in maintaining standards. Upon winning a tender, a supplier has 60
days to register their drug(s) with the DCC. Registration Is reported to be quick where an
equivalent drug (the same chemical compound) is already registered, or is on EDUZ. During
appraisal, registration requirements and procedures were reviewed, and fonmd to be non-
restictive. It was agreed that the tender documents would require bidders to submit neesary
documentation with bids for unregistered drugs, to speed the process. Regisraton costs Z$1500
for an imported processed product, Z$700 for a locally manufictured product and Z$400 for a
product imported in bulk and repackaged locally. Currny, 1550 drugs are listed as registed
and in use, with another 196 pending registration. An additional 423 drugs that predate the DCC
have not yet undergone Council review but remain in use. In the past, drug shipments could



-33 -
arrive that did not meet   X s rds of samples first supplied with the tender submission. It is
now required ta all shipments be inpcted prior to leaving their country of origin.
1.124       The ZRDCL is located on the grounds of the DCC and serves as the tchnical arm
of the Council. Under the auspices of the DCC, it helps to guaran  the safety and quality of
imported and local products. The ZRDCL s crucial to quality control, since developing countries
frequently receive products with falsified expiion dates, or products registered but not used in
their countries of origin. Ihe ZRDCL offers sevice to the whole Southern Africa region (except
South Africa). It has impressive capabilities. Ihere are backups fr all necessary instruments,
important given that local repair and mainance are such a problem. Its current worldoad is
dominated by condom testing and by extending expiry dates on outated pharmceuticals.
Although delays in testing have decreased from 6-8 weeks to around 3 weeks, the ZRDCL will
need new and more advanced instruments are needed to keep pace with the increasing demands.
An automatic condom tester is being procured, which will greatly enhance efficiency. But a
personnel crisis may be looming: in the past year, the ZRDCL has lost its principal analytical
chemist, its main microbiologist and two seior technicians. Government salaries are not
competitive with the privae sector or nearby countries.
Loca Production
1.125       Zimbabwe has outanding capabilities in phceutcal production considering its
size. It has a high quality infrastructure, and produces 80% of its generic needs (by quantity, but
about 20% by value), as well as producing intenationa   brand name products under license - a
good proxy for quality. There is no raw materWi synthesis capability as yet. (The only raw
materil producer in the region is Noristan, in Pretria, South Africa.) Ihere are plans to
implement raw matera man re of some pharmaceuticals which are in high demand for
Africa. The project is likely to have a salutary impact on the local market and on tender prices
by increasing resources for drug procurement, under an openly competitive system that gives local
manuacturers a 15% margin of preference.
1.126       There are three main phamaceuical m  rers. ITe government is the major
shareholder of Central African Ph cals (CAPS), which owns both the largest wholesaler
and importer (Geddes Ltd) in the nation and the largest chain of pharmacies. CAPS has recenly
updated its ma   in plant and has a separte penicillin production plant as well. Datlabs,
Pharmanova and Varinchem all manufacture many internationally recognized products under
license for local use and for expor, plus other products of their own design. There are several
other smaller manufacturers who have won government tenders for generic products. Zimbabwe
has avoided misallocating foreign currency to acquire brand name products and many unnecessary
pharmaceuicals available in many other countries.
E. CoWr REcovERY
1.127       Zimbabwe has a long history of levying fes in government health facilities. Ihe
post-independence government decided to de-emphasis cost recovery, to improve equity, and fee
collection was lax in the 1980s. The real value of fees was allowed to erode through inflation,
being adjusted only once during the decade. In 1990, fee revenues covered only 2% of MOH



-34-
expenditures. In 1992 the government renewed eforts to enforce the colleton of fes, as part of
a response to stagnating fiantcial resources, rising costs and iceing s4ee demands. Cost
recovery is expected to genera  only a modest part of the mources needed, but X conidered an
important part of financial reform for several reasons: (a) increased fee revenue generaton would
be an important lobbying tool in the annual budget discussions with Ministry of Finance; (b)
eventual retention of fees at collecton poins could be a powerful incentive to facility staff to
enhance revenue collection and service quality; (c) on equity grounds, higher-income patients
(most of whom have health insurance) should pay for health care, allowing public resources to be
targeted to low-income people; and (d) research suggests that even middle- and low income
people are prepared to pay for most curative services, especially if revenues sre used to Improve
service quality.
1.128       Fees increase in level and complexity as one moves up the hierarchy of ficilities,
being lowest at health centers, and highest in the private wards of the centra hospitals. Most
curative services carry charges, while most preventive care is provided free as an oulpatient
service. Chemotherapy for TB and leprosy are free. Fees a  well below the cost of services,
and charges at private hospital which must cover their costs are 2-5 dmes higher than the highest-
cost MOH facilities. The fee schedule omits fees for physicians' services to in-patiens.
1.129       The policy on charges for drugs has been ambiguous. A foote in the 1985
Circular on 'Rules and Charges at Government Hospitals' states tat 'An outpatient/casuaty fee
is inclusive of the drugs and medical supplies used during the ,tement, but does not cover
supplies for the patient to take away, unless oherwise authorized.2Al This has led to a wide
variety of practices in charging for outpatient drugs. Some facilities charge Z$0.50 for all the
medications ta a patient takes home, while others chge cost-plus-S0 percent for each item at
a patient takes away. In-patient drugs are not explicitiy covered in the circular. Individual
failities have developed a range of idiosyncratic practices. These ambiguities have resulted in
revenue losses, lost opportunities to curb unnecessary drug consmption and inconsistent ae-
inequitable financial demands on MOH clients, unrlated to their ability to pay. At the end of
1992, the MOH issued a directive that patients were to be charged for drugs at t*v. price paid by
MOH (tender price plus 15%). The MOH recognizes that not all facilites have chaged their
practices in accordance with the directive yet. This is being addressed as part of a wider initiative
to work with city councils and missions to agree on common fee schedules.
1.130       The MOH and a consultant team worked together in 1990-91 to identify a set of
reforms to the system of cost recovery. These are summmized in a Technical Working Paper
published by the World Bank in June 1992: Improving the Implemetation of Cost Reoovery
for Health: Lessons from Zimbabwe. Facilities need clear, unamiguous instuctions on drug
charges for in- and outpatients, inpaiet charges should include fees for physician time, prices
need to be adjusted periodically for inflation, charges for medical aid and private patients should
cover the full costs of services, fee schedules must be simple and easy to apply, and MOH needs
greater capacity for monitoring and admnisering its cost recovery. A start bas been made: a
revised fee mana prepared, revenue targets set for facilities, a media information campaign
carried out, MOH staff trained, and a monitoring system developed, and now the policy on drug
W/ MOH Circular minute 29 of 1985.

charges has been clarified. Activiies funded by ODA under FHP2 wil contne Implementation
of reforms.
1.131      HRemnos People with an income below Z$150 have been exempt from aU
payments. In 1992, as part of the Govenment's actions to protect the poor during the ESAP, the
exemption income level was raised to Z$400, which exempts all but about 5% of the population.
Inpatient fees are graduated into 7 bands, depending on income, and there are higher levels of
outpatient fees for patients with incomes above Z$800/month. The onus is on the patient to prove
eligibility for exemption. Ihis requires a letter from the Department of Social Services or a pay
slip. This is time consuming, and impractical, given the small numbers of Social Services staff.
In practice, clerks in health facilities exercise discretion over whom to exempt.
1.132       Contrceve caes  There Is no charge for FP, including contracepWtves at
MOH facilities. ZNFPC institted modest charges for contraceptives in November 1992, but has
a liberal exemption policy for clients who are say they are unable to pay. It has not been possible
to esdmae price elasticity of demand for contraceptives, but ZNFPC has based its decision on
financial need Cn the face of declining recurrent budget support from Government while trying to
epand services) and the aeperience of the City Health Departments in Harare and Bulawayo
which saw no drop off in demand after significant increases in contracepive prices in 1991.
Efforts are underway to monitor carefdully the Impact of these and the MOH efforts to increase
revenues. Support to these efforts will be an important part of the supervision of this project.

LESSONS FROM PAST EPE                                ,
OTHER DONOR SUPPORT AND BANK STRATEGY
A. WoiD  BAmUALTf SECt Suppowr E ZBABwE
2.1         Thore are two Bank-supported health projects underway in Zimbabwe, which have built
upon a sound analytic bae provided by several sector studies. The first activity after Independence
was a PUN Sector Survey, completed in 1983. The first FamUiy Health Project - FHP1 (total cost
US$S25 million) became effective in early 1987. FHP1 supported Government's efforts to (a)
expan famiy planning services by training MOHJMOLG nurses and by supporting IEC activities; (b)
strengthen the managamet of health services at district level and in MOH headquarters by training
heat  administrators and other speciized staff; and (c) provide improved rural health care by
upgrain and Uipping eight district hospitals, about 60 rura health centers and 20 small rural
hospitals. While FHP1 was being implemented, the Bank and local officials collaborated on two
maor secr  studies concerned with Population and Family Planning Progams (1989) and Options
tfor Ubnandng Health Services in ZImbabwe (1989).
2.2         Bi-anmual reviews of FHPI and a mid-term evaluation in 1989 conducted by MOH and
tms  of donor officials and Bank staff have found tat overall implemeion has been good, and
more or less on schedule. Disbursees have been sasfactory, except for delays in the early years
in some traning and MEC activities. Project targets for facility upgrading and family planning and
manageme_t training have for the most part been achieved. The project has begun to have a
dIsrnible positive impact on the quality of health and family plmning services in rural areas, and on
cpacty+uildng at district level, especially through the training of district health teams, the posting
of district hedth amin rs, and the provision of quality housing for MOH staff. The closing
date has been extended to September 1993 to allow some extra works to be completed, using
additional project funds which accrued from retained investment earnings of undisbursed donor funds.
2.3         In May 1989, preparation of a follow-on project - FHP2 - began. The process was
guided by a Project Planning Commi    (PPC) which included representatives of MOH departments,
provncial officials, and the ZNFPC. The project was developed with very broad participation within
MOM and ZNFPC. A large number of proposals were submitted, including 24 very detailed
proposals from the provinces and two districts in each provice, selected by provincial and district
heat teams as most in need of infastrucre upgrading. All proposals, including 12 submitted by
head offlce departme  were reviewed by the PPC and World Bank/donor missions, revised and
costed, and in some cases augmented by consultants engaged by the Government and Bank with
financing from the Japanese Grant Facility. FHP2 was appraised in November-December 1990 by a
Bank/donor team, launched one year later, and became effective in February 1992. IThe total cost is
US$117 milion.
2.4         FHP2 is a broad program of support to the sector, and aims to improve maternal and
child health and nutrition; expand and strengthen family planning services; and improve access to
PHN servics for the 40% of Zimbabwe's population living in the 16 worst-served rural districts.
Ibere are six main components: 0) Family Planning: traiing, community outreach expansion and
ic ficility strenghenig youth services, EC, evaluation and research and beter management; (ii)
Maternl and Child Health: midwifery training and curriculum improvement, materity equipment,



-37 -
school health program, operations research; (iii) Nutrition: Community food and nutrition program
expansion and redirection, inft feeding program and community-based growth monitoring, micr-
nutrient supplementation, EC and training and staff development; (iv) Rural Health Delivery:
upgrading 16 district hospitals and about 80 rural health centers, provision of staff housing,
supervisory transport, ambulances, and radio communication; (v) Health Human Resource
Development: institutional strengthening, curriculum reform, systems development, and construction
of simple district training facilities; (vi) Health Management Strengthening: training and system
development in financial management, materials/equipment management, district-level Information
systems and sector planning. As a by-product of the preparation of the nutrition component, a
comprehensive Nutrition Sector Report was written by the head of the Nutrition Unit and a
consultant.
2.5         FHP2 was derived from the overall MOH strategic plan for the health sector, and funds
a large part of the overall investmeat program for health, population, and nutrition during the period
of the five-year plan (1991-95). Development of this plan and of FHP2 were concurrent, and were
guided by the same MOH officials to ensure consistency. Extensive efforts have been made (and
continue) to coordinate with all donors active in the sector, especially in Family Planning. ZNFPC
prepared a National Five-Year Family Planning Strategy and Implemention Plan which incorporates
all program and project plans, and indicates sources of funding, to prevent funding gaps and overlaps.
This helped ensure that FHP2 contributes to a well thought out broad strategy for improving and
expanding family planning services in Zimbabwe.
2.6         FHP2 supports the Government's structural adjustment program in several ways.
Investments are targeted to the most underserved rural districts of Zimbabwe, and to low-income
households in those districts who need to be protected from adverse social impacts of the adjustment
process. The project includes support for nutritional surveiRlance to monitor the impact of the
adjustment program and enable timely action to be taken if neeary. The incremental reurreri
costs associated with the project are being minimized by careful review of hospital designs, and
emphasizing rehabilitation of existing facilities and redeployment of staff (especially from urban to
rural areas). Furthermore, by assisting improvements in MOH plaming, budget and accounting
procedures and an increase in cost recovery through adjusted fees and strengthened billing and
collecion performance, the project should lead to a substal rise in direct charges for health and
family planning services, to supplement allocations from general Government revenues.
2.7         While FHP2 was being developed and debated in 1989, 1990 and 1991, the Ministry of
Health felt that there was no need to include pharmaceuticals, contraceptives or AIDSIHIV control
activities. All drugs were carried on-budget and financed by GOZ, and earlier budgetary shortfalls
were being addressed. USAID, supplemented by UNFPA and WHO, was supplying all the
contraceptives needed; and Govermment committed itself gradually to take on the financing of pills
(the bulk of contraceptives used), expecting to be in a position to do this beginning in 1992193. At
that time, there were many donors willing to fund AIDS/HIV activities and the National Program was
adequately funded.
2.8         However, during 1991 a new situation was developing which led to a crisis Lrn the
availability of condoms and pills, and the threat of shortfalls in fumding for the AIDS program A
vigorous public education campaig on AIDS was succeeding in causing a dramatic increase in the
use of condoms. Delays in shipments of condoms and some brands of pills led to stock-outs,
hoarding, and rationing. The Government had not made any budgetary provision for the 21 % of total



-38-
pill needs for 1992 that they had agreed to finance as USAID's phase-out began. In November 1991,
a conference was convened on "Contraceptive Supplies for Zimbabwe: Donor Coordination and Self
Reliance". There was consensus at the meeting on the critical importance of ensuring sustainable and
reliable contraceptive supplies. The World Bank representatives noted that the Bank would work with
the government to implement the action plans dev,eloped from the conference recommendations.
B. BANK ROLE IN THE PHN SECrOR IN ZIMABwE
AND ILICATIONS FOR THE PROJEcr
2.9         The Bank's role as a source of funds for the PHN sector has been small, but Important
(and growing), and we have been a lead donor in other ways. Zimbabwe has wished to limit its
borrowing from the World Bank for the social sectors, and uses the Bank as a "funder of last resort"
for high priority programs, for which grant funds are not able to be mobilized. In FHP1, the
Govrment contribution far exceeded the amount of the Bank loan (US$10 million), and in FHP2,
Government Is matching the US$25 million Bank loan. The Government has relied on our help in
mobilizing as much co-financing from other donors as possible, and in playing a very active role in
donOr coordination. We administer the funds contributed to FHP1 and FHP2 by Norway, the
Netherlands, Sweden and part of the Danish funds. UNFPA ancl the EC are funding sub-components
of activities that come under our supervision. We have built ar extremely good, open and trusting
working relationship with the Ministry of Health and Child W ifare and ZNFPC. Government has
followed a clear course In health policy that we have been aL, to endorse, and so we have been able
to support MOH's efforts.
2.10        Our sector studies have made an important contribution to sector dialogue and policy
formulation. The first sector report took stock of the sector overall, and assessed priorities and the
new directions that the Government was taking. The next three studies were more focussed, dealing
with financing, family planning and nutrition, and were able to pay more attention to specific policies,
programs and activities. The next analytic piece planned on health care costs and cost effectiveness
should feed directly into resource allocation decisions that face the MOM.
2.11        The Bank has not yet participated directly in effbrts against AIDS. In 1991, plans for
a proposed analytical study on the economic and other impact of AIDS were shelved in deference to
the Minister of Health's view that action was the highest priority, and that a Bank analytic study
might deflect energy away from action. Until recently, the AIDS program was adequately funded by
other donors, and it was felt not to be necessary to Include support for the program in FHP2. There
have been two thorough GOZ/multi-donor reviews of the AIDS program, with a third scheduled for
March 1993, and program efforts have been redirected in line with the review recommendations. A
well-justified, well-prioritized program has now taken shape, particularly with the recently completed
STD Control program. Despite considerable support, the escaating needs and difficult economic
situation have opened some serious gaps.
2.12        A year after the Zimbabwe contraceptive supplies conference, it has become clear that
USAID is keeping to the original planned phase-out of funding for contraceptives, and no other donor
is willing to take this on. (Several donors were willing to provide one-time shipments of condoms to
avert an emergency and ODA has fimded 66 million condoms, shipped in 1992193.) Goverment has
acdmowledged its agreement to allocate budgetary funds for pills, but is in an extremely diffict

budget siuato   The worst drought of the centry has dramatically reduced export earnings and tax
revenues while necessitating the import of 2.5 million tons of foodstuffs, at a cost of over US$500
million. Combined with a commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit as part of the ESAP, all ministry
and paratata budgets have been squeezed. The MOH budgetary allocation for drugs is estimated to
cover only about two thirds of needs; deep real budgetuay cuts leave no slack for reallocating fimds
for the commodity inputs that are crucial to the implementation of the well-conceived programs now
developed by Government in respc'ise to the growing problem of STs, including HIV. A number of
donors are supporting various activities, especially public education, information and commnication
activities (see below), but none is prepared or able to fimd "big ticket' consumables, notably condo
and drugs, which are crucial to control of STIs.
2.13        In Identifying and preparing this project, we worked with all retevant Government
agencies and consulted carefilly with other donors, to review the eforts underway and planned and
the activities that were already funded, and identify the remaining gaps. In particular, there was a
consensus among the key actors - MOH, NACP, University of Zimbabwe, UNICEF and USAID
officals - ta the highest priority for World Bank funds was provision of the commodities crtical
for diagosis and prevention of HIV and other STIs (condoms and diagnostics) and care of STVHIV
patients (drugs). The STD prog-am was included because it is a very clear priority, but has nto yet
been unded. The STD and TB control programs cannot be effective without adequate drugs to cure
the infectious diseases detected, and there is little point in educating people to use condoms if
condoms are not readily available.
C. SUPPORT FOR STI AN)D TB PROGRAMS BY OTHER DONORS
2.14        SIDA 'Me Swedish lnational Development Assodaon (SIDA) has been one of the
biggest contributors to the NACP. SIDA contributes approximately US$600,000 to the MWP each
year, with the only condition on its expenditre that priority be given to IEC acdvities. SD)A is also
providng about US$1 million over three years to the UNICEF AIDS program (described below) and
US$20,000 a yea to various community projects. These lat funds have supported the AIDS
Counseling Trust, National Association of Traditional Healers, Women and AIDS Support Network
and CONNECr Zimbabwe Institute of Systemic Therapy). SIDA plan to participate in the
upcoming 1993 evaluation and foresees continuation of their support, possibly at an increased level.
2.15        UNICEF is curentiy funding three IEC officers in the NACP and focusing
considerable attention on helping the Ministry of Education to develop AIDS/STI) education training
modules. Additionally UNICEF has been assisting in building national IEC capacity. A key element
of UNICEP's implementation strategy is to promote participation of target groups (particularly youth)
and active responses to AIDS issues, "hoping to accelerate the breakdown of barriers of denial and
judgement frequentiy found in society." UNICEF has funded a bibliography of behavioral research
efts In the county and a directory listing all organizations involved in AIDS efforts, which have
aided coordination of the various programs in Zimbabwe.j/ A resource center is being created
within the NACP for collection and distribution of materials. Other UNICEF supported activities
include strengthening community level initiatives with an emphasis on operational research to

determine what interventions are successfiul. UNICEF has put together a US$10.3 million, three yea
project consisting of 6 components which includes numerous acvitis targeted to primary, secondary
and tertiary education students, youth outside the formal educadon sector and over US$2 million for
general IEC, although only part of ihe funding has been secured.
2.16        The European Commuities EC) are dbiuing with the NACP uding a pilot STD
project in each of two provinces. STD clinic and community seve traning would be provided a
well as personnel, equipment and some rerent costs, for a total estimated amount of 200,000
ECUs. The EC has also notionally earmarked other fuis for H1V-reldaed acdtvies, but no plans yet
exist. In 1992 the EC provided support for the Blood Trasfion Service to open 2 additional sites,
and may provide funds for another site, possibly in Mutare. Mentioned previously, the EC funds the
2 year STD Coordinator position in the NACP.
2.17        DANIDA has provided considerable support, including severa resident advisors to the
Essential Drug Program (EDP), and is working with the Govemen Medical Stores (GMS) to
strengthen their capacity. DANIDA is also supporting the NACP in stetitg laboratory trang,
supply of laboratory equipment and consumables, improvement of blood donor reriment and dat
management related to HIV sero-prevalence. The institutions eceving Danish asstace are the
National Public Health Laboratories, Medical Training Laboratories, the Nationa Blood TransfLsion
Service and the Health Information System Unit In the MOH. Close coordina    will ensure dt
there is no duplication between this support and the items to be provided dtrough the proposed IDA
credit. Danida is also providing approximately US$6.5 miWlion for family planning activities through
FHP2, and an advisor for 5 years to ZNFPC, with the explicit agreement that these resources would
be used to help integrate HIV-prevention activities into the family planning program.
2.18        USAID has been supporting several AIDS prevention activities over the last six years,
totaling US$8.3 million. The majority of these projects bave contributed to community eforts that
work with youth, employers and employees at the woplace, sex wokers and their clientele, and
considerable support to the WHO/GPA. Results are expected sborly on an evaluation of condom
promotion activities at three intervention sites. USAID is currently working with the Govemment to
design a substantial project for five years that may include some of the following: STD prevention
and control training, policy development, and peer education projects targeting trsport worker, sex
workers, agriculural workers and uniformed personnel.
2.19        WHO has supported a broad range of inpUts to AlDS programs in Zimbabwe,
including personnel, equipment and supplies. At the NACP, WHO cuely fiuds an epidemiologist,
a counselor and a technical officer serving in adm on. It has suported program management
by fimding many of the running costs associated with field supervision and moniorng. In blood
screening, WHO long provided ELISA tests both to the National Public Health Laboratory and to te
Blood Transfusion Service, although this support has had to be reduced. At the facility level, WHO
has provided or funded such infection control items as gloves, syringes and needes, as well as audio-
visua equipment. In addition, WHO has funded some local persond working on epidemlological
surveillance.
2.20        ODA is providing 66 million condoms at a cost of approximaly US$1.5 million, as
well as funds for a short-term consultant to help GOZ work on a long-term strategy for procumnt
of contraceptives, contributed US$695,000 in 1992 to the NACP Medium-Term Plan, and has
provided modest support for the National Blood Transfusion Service. The British Council Is fnding



-41 -
a 6-month course In counseling to be held at the University of Zimbabwe. ODA has decided to fund
the STD program and condom supply for 5 years on a parallel basis within this project.
2.21        In 1992 NORAD made an undesignated gra  of NK1.5 million to the NACP tbrough
WHO/GPA, NK4 million to UNICEF's AIDS program, and NK1.5 million to various community-
level activites,  luding peer education anw other progms managed through the University of
Zimbabwe, the Family AIDS Caring Trust, and the AIDS Counseling Trust. NORAD has also
fiuded several seminars, workshops and conferences. Support in 1993 is expected to be similar.
2.22        The 1988 UNFPA five year plan (which will probably be extended by two years until
1995) Includes fimds for developing EEC messages dealing w.th both FP and STD/HIV prevention in
order to raise the level of awareness among women, adolescents and men towards mnore responsible
'family life behavior.' UNDP has provided Z$1 10,000 for the salary of an Assistant Program
Coordinator for the NACP drcugh 1994; however, the post is vacant.
2.23        The Netherlands intends funding a behavioral scientist to work with the NACP to
inventory existing knowledge, instigate research, and draw out the implications of research findins
for InWventions. They also contribute to the GPA and directly contribute to the Zimbabwe NACP
and provide about US$60,000 each year to small projects including local drama groups and NGOs. A
contbution to the UNICEF project and to the proposed IDA-project are being considered. The
Netherlands provide substntial support to the TB program.
2.24        In 1992, ClDA provided US$300,000 for community-based AIDS interventions and
US$88,000 to the NACP for EEC activities. Areas of priority have included community home-based
care, counselling, and strengthening of AIDS programs such as those conducted by the Zimbabwe
Public Health Organization and tae Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions. In addition, the Southern
African AIDS Training Program, a regional program funded by CIDA, has supported about 20
community projects with a total of about US$800,000, and provided technical assistance or training
valued at about US$400,000 to these projects.
D. LESsoNS FROM PROJEcr EXPERIENCE IN ZIwBAWE
2.25        The Bank can make a significant and positive impact on the sector even if Bank funing
is restricted to limited areas. We need to respond to requests for funds or advice, propose (but not
push) our support where we see gaps and unmet needs, but not insist that we spread our support over
the entdre sector. Our comparative advantage does not cover everything. Ihis makes it essential to
coordinate carefully and connually with other donors to make sure that our support is
complementary, and that there is rational 'division of funding" even if this results In particular
projects not standing completely alone. It greatly simplifies MOH aid management if pardeular
activities are not funded by a multitude of donors.
2.26        Disbursements have been slow in many projects because of inadequate atention to
planning procrement details during project development, and poor familiarity with Bank procedus
by Goverment staff who are responsible for implementation. In addition to concerted efforts to
provide fequent training in Bank procedures in Zimbabwe, the appraisal of this project included
careful and deted attention to procurement plans and advance preparations. Documents for the first



- 42 -
tnders will have been reviewed well before effectiveness, and some staff in all implementing
agencies wUi have a good understanding of Bank procedures and the procurement plan, and
responsibilides for these activities have been clearly spelled out.
2.27        Effectiveness of several projects has been delayed in Zimbabwe while waiting for the
Government legal opinion, or for the project to be presented and approved in Parliament. Three
measures should avoid a delay of this project: (i) briefing the Attorney General's office during
appraisal to review the timetable for effectiveness; (ii) follow-up letters affirming the timetable after
appraisal and after negotiations; and (iii) allowing a realistic time between presention to World Bank
Board and effectiveness deadline.
2.28        Project management systems need to be well established at the outset of the project and
strengthened systematically, through a combination of adequate staffing in MOH, short courses and
on-e-job training, use of local consultants, and provision of office equipment and supplies and
supervisory vehicles. Under FHP2, much has been done to expand and strengthen the capability of
the Project Management Unit. These efforts will continue throughout implementation of PHP2 and
this project.
2.29        The project has been kept simple. Related activities or items that were proposed for
funding have been turned down if they were not of high priority or likely to promote the successfl
Implementation of the agreed main project activities. Some needs were taken care of without waiting,
through other exting projects. An example of the latter: as condom use has grown, the condom
testing center in Zimbabwe, which also serves 15 other sub-Saharan countries has become
overstrethed. An automated condom testing machine that could handle a week's workdoad in 6 hours
proposed for inclusion in the project is being procured through FHP, which had unallocated funds and
consistent objectives.
2.30        Special attention has been given to project monitoring and reportng systems, budgeting
and accounts, and procurement. Standard formats and forms for monitoring and supervision will save
time for those who have to collate and provide the information, ensure key data are collected, and
ensure consistency in reporting over time and a better basis for tracking progress. These are being
drawn up and will be discussed and agreed before effectiveness.
2.31        More systematic follow-up of supervision mission recommend Ions is needed. The
MOH will be requested to provide a follow-up progress letter, specifically reporting on actions
recommended in aide-memoires, at an appropriate time after the mission.
E. LESSONS FROM PROJECS AND PROGRAM ELsEWHR
A3IDS and Other SWIs
2.32              Generml Lessons. After a decade of AIDS prevention actvities, several general
lessons can be derived from global experience. Some have only recently come to light, since
evaluations are often not completed untl several years into implementation Z/ Others are lessons

commo  In hum  resource work, but which bave added imporne In the multisectoral context of
AIDS. Ihese lessous are weli-reflctd In the Zimbabwe response to AIDS/STDs.
2.33        No smpk  soludowns ex  to prevent the spread of HIV, because interventions must cope
with one of the least undetood, most complex and most difficult to measure aspects of human
beavior - sexuality.
2.34        Nevertheless, Ineventions have resulted In large observed changes In seua behavior
and slg^iycat increases In condom use. t has been determined that these behavioral changes have
been responsible for the reduction In new cases of STIs, including HIV.
2.35        Mass media progms bave promoted widespread AIDS awareness, safer sex and
condom use and have demonstrated impressive coverage. Considerable evidence from several bealt-h
areas Indicates ta mass medla Is most ecthw (f It Is lned wih community and interpersonal
niatives, all within an overall JEC stategic frmework. Community and employer effbrts using
peer education have been found to be Instrumental in changing behavior of certain groups. NMOs
have played an important role in many of thes activities.
2.36        Large scale condom promotion and distribution programs will require Increased
condom suppy, Wroved quity control, better ditribudon and enhanced collaboraton and
cmmunication between consumers, the private sector, national governments, and international
orgaiaions.
2.37        Promotion and dribution of candoms can and should take advantage of several
avenues: socia marketing, public and private health services (including company-based services),
traditional praiioner associations, bars and hotel distribution, and vending machines.
2.38        Self-esteem and status in negotating condom use should be regarded as vital
determins of condom use. This is exeemplified by the difficulties experienced by persons most
vulnerable to inbction - such as many women and various marginaized groups of people - in
insisting on condom use. Accordingly, interventions and messages must be gender responsie.
2.39        Both interaional and ationl programs have paid insufficient antion to STD care.
STDs are both a risk factor and a proxy for potenti for HIV infection. Because effective SID
services reach tose who are epidemiologically most at risk with condoms, treatment and information,
combied SIDIHV ware andpreven services should befavored in order to realize their mutaly
reinforcing effect. Where feasible, integratng S2D services with MCII and FP can be effective as
well.
2.40         IV testng and conseling of coqples may be an effectve preventon strategy In high
prevalnce areas, although the wide-scale feasibility of the approach requires further analysis.-/
2.41        CrfW operadonal ruesch of interewntions Is portant if they are to be expanded or
replicated successfully. The Imsive work performed to date in Bulawayo attests to this
experience.

2.42        As is evident in all development projects, evaluation Is not a one-tie actvty. Project
shoud include an on-going evaluaton stategy encompassing three types (and phases) of evaluatdon
(1) fmative or baseline; (2) process, and (3) outcome/impact.
2.43        SPec*c Wodd Bnk and Other Donor Projed tkpedence. Approximly 36 Wodd
Bank health and population projects to date have included AIDS-related componen. Only two
projects-one in Zaire, the other in India-have been AIDS-specific (plans are underway In Brazil and
Nigeria). Several early lessons emerge from those experiences: (1) commodities play a critical role
in implementation (2) collaboration among the active donors (especially WHO) is very important; (3)
HIV and STDs should be addressed together; (4) social marketing of condoms brings significant
benefits; (5) Mid Term Plans (MTPs) tend to be too general, spread too thin, too concermed about
mutisectoral involvement and not disciplined enough in prioritizing interventions and activities; (6)
the private sector and NGOs are better equipped than most governments to reach many communities;
and (7) investing in the safety of blood transfusions is a cost-effective measure, despite havi  limited
Impact on HIV prevalence.
2.44        Lessons from other country projects suggest that the sooner HM  prevention progams
are initiated, the bet  - even in the absence of HIV. When a country shows evidence of other
STDs an those factors that place persons at risk of ST/IMW (e.g. unprotected polypartuerism,
commercial sex, migration, subordinate status of women), HIV infection will soon appear. Nigea,
land, Indonesia and India are examples of such situations.
2.45        Lastly, as is true in many projects, if political support and commment are not
forthcoming, little progress can be made in changing norms and in mobilizing effectve responses.
Most national leaders have appeared to follow a similar series of stages in confonting the epidemic:
denial; a reluctant accept ce of the epidemic threat; attempts at raising awareness directed at the
general population; and, finally, full-fledged support for intensified comruilty-evel participatio
Drugs
2.46        Bank experience in drug procurement Is limited, but growing. It has been difficult to
develop a uniform approach because drugs differ from most other commo ities in diversity, range,
the terminology used to express their specific charac cs, stability criteria, shelf life limiatons,
storage requir_eme, quick obsolescence, the need for rigid quality control and the exteme price
differental between proprietary and generic drugs. With Bank financw  for drugs now reahn
US$100 milion a year, however, certain lessons are becoming clear and have been set out in a recent
daft Procrement Technical Note.
2.47        From the outset, appropriate specifications should be developed that clear'y define the
required standards, quality control procedures, packaging and dosage requirements, shelf life, mode
of delivery and realistic delivery schedules. These specifications, as well as any special technical or
ote fures of individual drugs, should be clearly listed in the bidding documents. In view of the
available economies of scae and the need for strict quality control, centraized pocement is
advlsable for high-volume items on the essentW drug list. The end users of the drugs, however,
shud be carefully consulted on technical specifications. Unlike in large constuction wors and
equipment contas, post-qualifying bidders based on experience and quality control facilities is
generally preferable to pre-qualification when procuring drugs. Where a borrower requires
vegtration by law, the Bank should encourage the adoption of a fast registraion process.



-45 -
2.48        The vagaries of drug production and distribution also require special measures to
maximie competition and quality. Procurement packaging that follows standard classification
techniques discourages bidding by manufacturers (thus limiting competion to merchant exporters)
and should be avoided. Each bid package should instead be designed to cover individual large
consumption drugs. To ensure adequate competiton, all bids should be Invited using generic names
and "Iternational Non-Proprietary Names" as well as brand names. All essential drugs not covered
by patents should be grouped as much as possible into packages of US$100,000 or more and procured
through ICB. Small volume purchases of essential drugs should be made through LCB. Limited
international bidding should be reserved to those special drugs in which an oligopoly exists, and all
qualified manufacturers should be invited to bid. Direct contracting is acceptable only if drugs are
avaiable from one source. In such a case, borrowers should prepare for price negotiations by
reviewing historic prices and the drug price bulletins issued periodically by UN and other health
organizations.
2.49        It is important to include certain detaDs in all invitations to tender. Documents should
specify any extreme conditions shipments will undergo and require drugs to arrive in country withb at
least five-sixths of shelf life remaining. Drug labels should bear the generic name as well as any
brand name, the date of manufacture and the date of expiry. Prices quoted should be c.i.f. at a
specified delivery point. It should be specified that any "overages" (additional quantities of active
ingredients introduced to maintain drug potency) must fall within compendia standrrds. Bidders
should submit with their bids a certificate from the drug authority of their home country dth the
firtm's manfacturing premises have been inspected periodically during the preceding two years and
that the bidder has not been prosecuted for any violations of good manufacturing practices. As a
General Condition of Contract, a successful bidder shoula be required to advise the borrower of any
adverse drug reactions or interational drug recalls. Ihe General Conditions should also spell out
that a supplie; is required to furnish a manufacrer's quality test certificate, and that inspection
agents will periodically take samples fom lots ready for shipment for independent testig at the
manufacturer's expense.
2.50        Changing Treatment Regimens In 1992, the treatment regimen for TB was changed
without ensuring that the new drugs would be available. This is a lesson on the importance of
coordinating procurement, distribution and stock management of drugs with changes in regimen.
Condoms
2.51        Condoms have been procured with Bank funding as part of the Kenya Health Project.
Some of the lowest-cost producers may not be very reliable in meeting delivery dates, and make
unacceptably low quality condoms. Experienced colleagues caution that quality control Is of critical
importance, and recommend post-qualification based on proof of recent interational orders of at least
10 million condoms, and testimony of satisfied buyers. The tender and contract should specify
clearly condom size, delivery schedule and the procedures to be followed for quality testing, and
request samples of condoms for testing as part of the bid. Arrangements for testing by an
independent, technically competent endty should be made.
2.52        Internal transport of condoms from the warehouse to point of sale or distribution has
been problematic in some programs. ZNFPC is responsible for this in Zimbabwe, and contracts a
private sector transport company. Limited capacity should therefre not be a problem, as it well
might if a ministry or agency were relying on their own vehicles etc. If the company presendy being



-46 -
used is unable to handle growing volumes, there are many other similar companies In Zimbabwe.
These logistic arrangements will need to be monitored during the project to ensur that the present
well-fincioning system is sustained, and that adequate fimds are allocated In ZNFPC's budget to
cover the rising volumes.
2.53        Tbere are many potenial condom users who are unlikely to visit health facilities or
family planning clinics. In order to make condoms easily available to them, a wide range of other
oudets need to be used-bars, general stores, pharmacies, etc. Withcut a wide diversity of
distribution points, there are conints on the rate at which the number of condom users will
expand. The lesson is to ensure that good arrangements are made for involvement of a wide variety
of private sector distributors. During appraisal, new plans to fcilitate wider private sector
participadon in condom disbution were discussed. These wil be able to go ahead without inputs
from the Bank.

THE PROJECT
A. PnoJwr OBECIES
3.1       The goal of the project is to help GOZ to reduce the incidence and impact of sexually
transmitted infections In a cost-effective manner. To achieve this goal, the project will provide
critical programmadc and commodity support to Governme's integat  and comprehensive progrm
for STI prevention and care. The project has several specific objectives:
(a) to ensure an adequate supply of condoms for diseasm preventon;
O) to ensure implementation of the National STD Prevention and Control Program,
which provides the policy framework vital to the success of STI control;
(c) to enhance Goverment capacity to identify and treat the STDs that facilitate HIV
tnsmission in those most at risk;
(d) to treat selected HIV-related illnesses, especially those that pose a general public
health threat, such as TB;
(e) to facilitate HIV testig and coumeling of persons seeking to know their HIV status;
(t) to ensure the continued safety of the blood supply; and
(g) to ensure an adequate supply of gloves, needles and syringes and disinfects to
protect health care workers and facilitate home-based care for AIDS patients.
3.2       To monitor project ImplementatIon, several key project Indiators (discussed in detail In
paras. 3.36 and 3.37) will be tracked: (a) condom supply; (b) the specific indicators set out in the
STD Program; (c) supply of STD drugs; (d) supply of drugs for HIV-related infections; (e) number
of persons receiving HIV and/or syphilis testing and counseling; (t) HIV tests on national blood
transfusion blood; and (g) delivery of medical supplies and equipment.
3.3       The effectiveness of the project will depend on successful implemention of the overall
STI program for prevention and mitigao  of STDs/HIVIAEDS and of the TB program. These
programs will be moniored using broad program Impact Indicators discussed in para. 3.37 below.
The project is designed to complement support from other donors and Government's own fiing for
these program. If the impact inditors point to problems in implementation of the programs,
project funds may need to be reallocated to address these problems.
B. PRoJECr DESCRITION
3.4       As described in hapter 1, Government has already designed a coordinated STI program
consisting of four preventive Interventions against STh: condom promotion, STD control, IEC, and
blood supply screening; and iDterventions to care for AIIDS patients. Despite considerable support



-48 -
from mumerous donors and Government's own funds, there are serious resource shortages.
Accordingly, the project will fill the gaps In the program by complementing Goverment and donor
efforts with inputs vital to the prevention, detection and treatment of SlT. It will focus on
prevention and cure of STDs, which is one of the most cost-effective methods of Inhibitg the spread
of HIV iection. It will also attempt to stem the spread of HIV-related infections, especially TB,
thereby limiting their attendant costs on the health system. The project will finance implementation of
the National STD Prevention and Control Program, increase the supply of underfinded items
curenty on Government budget, and finance additional activities needed for a comprehensive STI
program. It comprises five components, described in detail below:
(1) condoms;
(2) STO Program support, and STD diagnosis and treatment;
(3) ratment of HIV-related infections;
(4) HIV diagnosis and screening;
(5) health system support.
(1) Condoms (base cost US$10.7 million)
3.5 This component will meet the total cost of projected demand for condoms through the life
of the project Although a small percentage of condoms are used for contraceptive purposes, more
han 90% are used primarily to prevent disease, and this proportion is exected to grow as people
become more aware of the risks of ST1s. Accordingly, the project does not distinguish between
condoms used to prevent disease and those used to prevent conception. Condom demand data have
been derived from three sources: the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey; ZNFPC, which
with the assistance of a USAID-financed project in Harare, contiualy tracks condom use and

-Contaeptive Requirements and Logistics Management Needs in Zimbabwe."
3.6       Through ongoing IEC, Zimbabwe health officials aim to Increase the percentage of urban
males IS-59 years old consistently using condoms (i.e. in all marital and non-marital sex) to at least
21.5% by 1997, and 25-30% by 2002. It has been suggested by a recent model of 11V transmission
that a 20% use rate may be sufficient to reach an inflection point on the HIV incidence curve, at
which new infections decline..j/ In Zimbabwe, use is already estimated to have increased from
3.7% in 1988 to 16% in 1992 (assuming couples use an average 100 condoms per year). Combined
with an ssumed modest decline in fertility between 1993 and 1997, the following need is estmated:

It X estimated that with international procurement, condoms will be available at about 3.5 U.S. cents
per piece. ZNPPC will be responsible for all logist;s of condom procurement and distribution. 'he
total base cost of the component is US$10.7 million.
(2) ST1D Progam (base cost US$21.8 million)
3.7       Progrm  Support (base cost US$2.1 million). The NACP has identified the National
STD Prevention and Control Program as its most important instrument in preventing and treaing
STIs. Because the Program provides a strategic and policy framework for STD control, its successfhl
implementation will play a determinative role in overall project success. Indeed, it has been observed
tha although Zimbabwe has had for several years some of the best STD treatment practice in the
world, its STD prevalences have continued to rise, in large part because an effective prevention
campaign has never gotten off the ground. The NACP will take primary responsibility for
coordinatng the program's implementation. ITis subcomponent will finance the six overarching
objectives of the STD Program that remain unfimded, as follows.
3.8       Poicy FPonuaon and Iprlemenaon (base cost US$39,500) NACP wiUl coordinate
the development and dissemination of guidelines for policy implementation, guided by advice from
the existing AIDS Health Experts Committee. Activities will include quarterly meetings ($6,300),
gideline development ($1,6W), provincial planning worlshops ($23,800), evaluation and revision of
clinical STD guidelines ($3,800), an implementation workshop ($1,900) and one personal computer
for the NACP central office ($2,000).
3.9       Reseawh (base cost US$213,700) will focus on priority areas concerning STDs aimed at
developing improved case management protocols. Activities will include a national workshop to
identify priorities ($5,000), an inventory of current research ($1,600), research grants ($158,700),
rats to atnd international conferences ($32,500), and a scientific conference to presen ultimate
findings ($15,900). The Medical Research Council reviews and approves all research in the country.
3.10      Training (base cost US$815,100) will be given to health care providers at all levels in
STD prevention, diagnosis, treatment and management. Activities will include appropriate training
courses for doctors ($165,100), nurses ($503,200), health workers ($107,100) and laboratory
technicians ($39,700). NACP wil coordinate this training. Trainers will be drawn from the medical
profession, with occasional outside support if necessary.
3.11      Srengthening data colection (base cost US$79,400) will be achieved through the
establishment of integrated STI senti  surveillance centres in six key sites and in all provinces
undertaking serological studies.
3.12      Imroved Detecon and Tmabnent of STDs (base cost US$916,500) will be achieved
through workshops to disseminate case management guidelines ($3,800), upgrading the genito-uriary
centres in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare and Chitungwiza ($396,800), establishment of STD
deparmens in the central hospitals of the same cities ($79,400), and strengthening existing hospkal
SM1 facilities in other hospitals ($436,500).
3.13      Monitodng and EwdB aon (base cost US$31,700) of the STD Program will include
regular supervision visits ($23,800) and a final project evaluation ($7,900) coordinated by NACP.

3.14      IEC activities, discussed in chapter 1, will be undertaken as part of the NACP Second
Medium-Term Plan and funded separately by various donors (see paras 2.16 - 2.24).
3.15      Diagnosdis and Associated Supplles (base cost US$4.2 million). In the Essential Drug
List for Zimbabwe (EDLIZ), Z;mbabwe has set out a cost-effective and low-cost approach to the
idendfication of STDs. For most STDs, it promotes the practice of diaosis based on syndome, in
which medical personnel diagnose STDs by the presence of symptoms such as urethral discharge and
genital ulceers. This avoids the use of laboratory tests, which are ime-consuming and, even In the
cheapest case, casn cost more      the remmended trt     drug itself. For most patients, it i8
more cost-effective merely to tra the observed syndrome. Because women are often asymptomatic
for STDs, however, the syndromic method alone is frequently inadequate. Zimbabwe has a policy of
testing every pregnant woman who attends a facility for syphilis (with the rapid plasma reagin test),
which helps prevent congenital syphilis and concentrates simple diagnostic tests where they will have
the greatest impact.
3.16      This subcomponent will provide the basic diagoic tests and supplies used in laboratory
confirmation of STDs. Levels of current diagnostic use have been esdmated on the basis of data
provided by the district/provincial referral centers and assume periodic testig for drug sensitivities.
Current coverage is not comprehensive because supplies are inadequate; the syphilis screening
program in particular has not been fully realized. Accordingly, esdmated needs were increased to
cover comprehensive testng of pregnant women and enhanced diagnostic capacity. Basic diagtics,
set forth in detail in Annex 12, include tests such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR), and confirmatory
tests for syphilis, chancroid and chlamydia, used when syndromic diagnosis is not adequate or
treatment failures occur. The subcomponent also provides specimen collection devices, such as slides
for wet mounts, and sundry small supplies used to carry out the tests. Itsestdmatd that base costs
will be US$800,000 per year for diagnostics and US$40,000 for associated equipment, talling
US$4.2 mfllion over the life of the project. GMS wfll handle procement and distribution.
3.17      STD Drug (base cost US$15.5 million). Treaing STDs is an important element of an
inegated program because of the role STDs play in facilitatg transmission of HIV. t is lso cost-
effective in reducing STD complications and the incidence of congenital disease. As with digostics,
Zimbabwe has adopted a low-cost but ffectivo apprach to the teatme  of STDs. EDL1Z treatment
protocols call for basic antibiotics in treating ulcer dies  (syphilis and carid) ta most readily
facilitate HIV transmission, as well as gonorrhea, chlamydia, tuichomoDas and venereal warts. The
drugs indicat  are those recommended by WHO and meet WHO's crteria for drug selection, and
nearly all have been placed on the OGIL. The drugs are not, however, in every case the most cost-
effective in practice, and several changes have recently been Introduced to improve protocols. One of
the more importa  modifications was to prescribe two dnrgs when a patient pret  with symptms
possibly the result of one of several Inown cas agents. The use of a broad-based antibiotic
treatment is more cost-effective than postponing treatment, awaing reslts f&om expensive tests and
asking the patient to return. It is expected that Zimbabwe will continue moving to more cost-effecdve
protocols.
3.18      The project will fiance sufficient quani es of pharmaceuticals to meet-projected needs
for the next five years. Cost projections include an increment to cover the added cost of moving to
the more expensive WHO regimens. Need forecast were derived from the WHO estimates based on
morbidity projections, which are discussed in Annex 10. GMS wiUl procure and distribute all drugs.

are sought to advise interested individuals of their status. Zimbabwe uses enzymelinked
immunosorbent assay (LISA) tests, which confirm the presence of H1V antibodies. Unil recently,
WHO financed procurement and delivery of these diagnostics. Funding cutbacks will soon force the
organization to end thi support, however, just as demand for HIV tesdag begins to increase as a
result of spreading awareness and declining test  costs. DANIDA are already supplying the
National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) with some 120,000 tests per year, but growth in demand
by asymptomatic people can be expected. Accordingly, this component will complement the
DANIDA contribution to the NPHL with an additional 115,000 tests annually ($1.2 million). It will
include tests both for symptomatic patients and for persons seeking to know their status. Data on
current levels of use for symptomatic patients wer provided by Government Medical Stores,
confirmed by WHO procurement records. lhe component will also provide the several refrigerators
and other small supplies used in conjunction with HIV tesdng such as pipettes, microwells and
glassware ($400.000).
3.23      Ihe second purpose of HIV diagnostics is to ensure the safety of the blood supply.
Transfusions are given only when necessary to save life in Zimbabwe, and all blood must be tested by
the National Blood Transfusion Sevice (NBTS) for HIV. To date, WHO has financed blood
screening tests, but may need to withdraw support after this year. This component would support the
cost of 110,000 ELISA tests ($1.1 million) and associated supplies ($85,000) for NBTS nationwide
for the life of the project. No increase is foreseen in needs; a slight decrease is even possible, as
more alternaives to transfusions are used. Data on current use were provided by WHO. In all, the
cost of the diagnosdcs and supplies for NPHL and NBTS will total US$2.7 million before
c-ontingencies.
(5) Health System Support: Protctive Supplies (base cost US$8.3 milion)
3.24      The AIDS crisis has placed unprecedented stres not only on Zimbabwe's STD services,
but on the health care system in general. This component will bolster the system at various critical
points by providing protecive supplies associated with the intensive demands related to STI treatmeuL
Such items will not only help the formal system to cope with the explosion in cases, but will also
facilitate home-based care. Home-bsd care is a critical element in trating many HIV-related
ifections, includi  TB, and also serves cost cnainme  objectives by relieving the forml health
care system of somo of the AIDS caseload.
3.25      Proive supplies comprise three items cridcal to protecting health workers and patients
from exposure to HIV, all of which have been in chronically short supply. Latex gle prevent HIV
transmission among health workers and patients in health care settings-both in facilities and in the
home. Shortages are so severe that many medical personnel are said to be eamining with no gloves
at all. The current supply, figures for which were obtained from GMS, is estimated to meet less than
two-thirds of demand. Projected supply was increaed accordingly; the project will finance 96,000
boxes of 100 gloves per year at an esdmated US$4 per box, for total costs over the life of the project
of US$1.9 million. GMS will procure and distribute these items.
3.26      The shift from resable to diposable sy*iges and neeles as a result of HIV prevalence
has increased consumption of these commodities and therefore their overall cos. Cumt supplies
distributed by GMS are thought to meet only about two-thirds of noeds. ITis subcomponen wWi
provide 130,000 disposable syringe/needle combinations and 156,000 disposable needles per year, the
costs of which will total US$6.3 million over five years.

3.27      DWfectans, mainly sodium hydrochlorite 5% solution, are vital to prevent infections of
other patients In hospitals and to ensure sterile conditions in home care. They have been in short
supply in Zimbabwe since the AIDS crisis broke out. Data on current use were provided by GMS,
with additional costs to reach full supply esdmated at just over one bottle per health facility per
year-about 12,000 bottles in all. The total cost over the life of the project is US$76,800.
C. PRoJEcr ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
3.28      Within MOH, the NACP will take the lead In day-t-day project coordination although
project accounting and finance will be handled by the existing MOR Project Management Unit (PMU)
which has greater capacity to do so. Responsibility for execudng various compone will be
delegated to pertinent departments within MOH, ZNFPC, GMS, and Harare City Health. NACP wfll
coordinate and monitor project implementation and report on progrs to MOR management and the
Bank. In light of the strong emphasis on commodities, however, the added worldoad on the NACP
will not be excessive. ODA intends to support measures to strengthen NACP, based on the
recommendations of the March 1993 review.
3.29      PMU In MOH Is responsible for the Family Health projects, the GOZ-funded investnent
program, and other donor-funded projects. The PMU has been strengthened through FHP1 and
FHP2, and now includes a co-ordinator and deputy, finance and accounting officers, commissioning
officer, procurement officer, facilities planner, part-time expatriate architect adviser, computer
ystems officer, secretary and driver, and several other staff. All full-time staff are on MOH payroll,
except three on fixed-term contracts (on equivalent terms to the civil service) paid through FHP.
3.30      All project activities will be carried out by existng entities in the health care system; no
new agencies, units, or organizational layers will be createA. Condom procurement, stoage and
distribution will be handled by ZNFPC and GMS. The procurement of drugs, diagnostics, medical
supplies and minor laboratory equipment will be done by the GMS, in liaison with the NACP and, for
TB drugs, in liaison with the TB program controller. The NACP will oversee implementation of the
condom, STD, HIV and blood-screening components and also ensure consistency of project activWies
with the 1994-98 Second Medium-Term Plan for AIDS control. All other procurement wil be
handled by MOH.
3.31      Status of Project Preparation. The project was able to be prepared very quicldy,
because Government had already developed a detailed five-year plan for the Natlonal STD Control
Program and regularly updates projections of the country's condom needs. Preparation of a TB Plan
of Action in response to the detailed review of the TB Program was well in hand, as was the drawing
up of a new Medium-Term (5 year) AIDS Plan, which is being finalized In the light of the March
1993 review of the AIDS Program. A DANIDA-funded project to strengthen the Government
Medical Stores began to be implemented in 1992.
3.32      The appraisal mission reviewed the TB Plan of Action, National STD Prevention and
Control Program, NACP Workplan 1993, proposed strengthening measures for Government Medical
Stores, proposed changes in treatment protocols, and procurement records of Government Medical
Stores for the last two years. A detailed procurement plan has been drawn up (see Annex 5). Sample
tender documents for drugs and condoms were drafted during appraisal and submitted for review

wihin the Bank. These will be revised as necessary by Goverment and sent to the Bank before
negotitos.
3.33      Inplementadon Schedule. Project implementation is expc   to take five yeas,
starting in August 1993. The project will be completed by June 30, 1998 and project accounSt will be
finalised by December 30, 1998.
D. MoNrroWING AND EVALUATION
3.34      The success of the project will depend on two factors: (1) how well the focused
objectives of the project itself (essential commodity support) are pursued; and (2) Government
performance in implementing the overall STI program. Consequently, two sets of beneficiary
asessment Indicators have been developed, which are set out below. Drawing on these indicators,
the NACP will have responsibility for project monitoring, with each implemnt  unit and the NACP
expected to report semi-amnually on progress or delays in specific oomponents. As it has ber
accountng capacity than the NACP, the PMU will manain up-to-date project accounts and prest
summary accounts to the Bank every 6 months. The NACP will collte the various monitoring data
in semi-annual progress reports, which will be forwarded to the Bank, and which will form the basis
for discussions of supervision missions. Assurances will be soughtfrom Governme  ta progress
reports and beneflcaiy assessment data wUIl be consoliated by the NACP and sent to the Bank evey
six monts. In addition, to ensure that an assessment is undertaken when its conclusions may stll be
of use to the project, Govemment and IDA wfll conduct a mid-term evaluation of the project in 1996.
Government will also prepare a project completion report within six months of the project closing
date, based upon a format to be agreed with the Bank.
3.35      The project and the program will benefit STI clients, condom users and their sexal
partners, pregnant women who are screened against syphilis, TB patients and their families and
cleagues, health care workers who are trained and who treat HIV-posltive patients, and home-ce
givers for people with AIDS. It is important to monitor (a) whether these intended beneficiaries
indeed benefit in the way expected, and also (i) to get feedback on their attitudes and satscn  (or
othewise) to help reorient and improve the program. Selected indicators (dcussed in paras 3.37 and
3.38) wiUl track project success with regard to (a). As far as possible, monitoring will be
hworporated into MOH, ZNFPC and NACP routines and systems, to build caacity and avoid
duplicative monitoring and reporting.
3.36      Benefciary Assessment. Qualitative surveys, focus groups, key inrmt interviews,
and roudne feedback wil be used to collect information and views on program implementation and
impact from beneficiaries. Before deciding to undertake selftandng beneficiary assesments, effr
will be made td incorporate relevant questions and modules into the MOHI regular biennial MC/FP
survey and the existing UNICEF-supported sentinel surveillance surveys to monitor the socia impact
of ESAP. The USAID-supported project is expected to include periodic beneficiay assessments;
once detailed plans are formulated, decisions can be made about whether additona aements need
to be carried out directly tihough this project. Japanese Grant Funds ad FHP2 resources will be
used for supplementary efforts. The first of these: a study of condom use, access to supplies, and
price responsiveess, is planned to begin in June.



- 55 -
3.37      ProJed Indicatois will monitor implementation performance with respect to the project
objectives set out in para. 3.1. The STD Program sets out a list of measurable process Indicators
linked to each of its objectives; these wIll be tracked by the NACP and are incorporated by reference
here. For components other than STD program support, project success in meeting the objectives in
para. 3.1 wIll be measured by the indicators:
(1) Total number of condoms available for distribution at the centra level during the
preceding 12 months divided by total population aged 1549.
(2) Number of people estimated to have access to condoms divided by total population
aged 1549.
(3) Total supply of STD drugs requested by all public health facilities compared with the
supply of STD drugs procured and distributed by the GMS, during the preceding 12
months.
(4) Total supply of drugs for HIV-related infections (including TB) requested by all
public health facilities compared wih the total supply of such drugs procured and
distributed by the GMS, during the preceding 12 months.
(5) Total number of persons who requested HIV and/or syphilis testing and counseling
compared with the total number of persons who received such testing and counseling,
during the preceding 12 months.
(6) The total number of blood samples tested in the national blood transfusion center
compared with the total number of blood samples received, during the preceding 12
months.
Baseline data will be collected for project purposes on the above indicators in late 1993. Realistic
targets for the indicators to demonstrate progress will be developed (for example, if baseline data
show 95% of blood samples are currently being screened, the end-of-project target may be 99%).
Data will again be collected in 1995 and at the end of the project in 1998.
3.38      Program Indiators. The second set of indicators are national and tied to the overall STI
program objectives. Most are standard indicators, developed and field-tested by WHO and considered
state-of-the-art. Since overall success of the national program is of major importance to the project,
the aaminment of these objectives, as measured by the selected indicators, will be monitored closely
by project management. If, as a result of monitoing, it becomes evident that progress is not being
made on the national program objectives, project funds may be reallocated to help attain these broader
program objectives. Those objectives, and associated indicators, are:
Objetive I:   Reduce/prevent STD/HIV infection and AIDS among the general public; particuarly
high-risk and vulnerable groups, e.g. youths and women of child-bearing age.
Indica1r la:   Number of pregnant women aged 15-24 seropositive for HIV dvided by
the total number of pregnant women aged 15-24 attending antenal
clinics whose blood had been screened.



-56 -
IjWi=lb:   Number of pregnant women aged 15-24 with positive serology for
syphilis divided by the total number of pregnant women aged 15-24
atending antenatal clinics whose blood has been screened.
Indicatotr  :   Number of reported episodes of uretiis in men aged 15-49 in the last
12 months diided by total number of men aged 15-49 surveyed.
Ojecv 2:   Increase public awareness and knowledge of prevention measures against
HIV/AIDSISTDs.
Indicator 2:   Percentage of people aged 15-49 citing (in periodic surveys) at least two
acceptable ways of protecting themselves from HIV-infection.
Objective 3: Promote and enhance relevant behavioral changes and use of adequate inwventions,
especially of condoms to reduce HIV transmissions.
Iadicator 3a:   Percentage of people aged 15-49 reporting (in periodic surveys) the use
of a condom during the most recent act of seul intercourse.
Indicator 3b:   Number of people aged 15-49 who report having had at least one sex
partner other than their regular partner(s) in the last 12 months dividd
by total number of people aged 15-49 who report having been sexually
active in the last 12 months.
bjective 4:   Ensure early detection, treatment and overall management of patients with STD/HIV
,AIDS.
Iadicat~Aa:   Number of individuals seeking STDIHIVWAIDS care in health facilities
assessed and treated in an appropriate way (according to national
standards as dewmined by observation of sample facilities) divided by
total number of individuals seeking STID care in health facilities.
Idi=r 4b:  Number of individuals seeking STD care in health facilities who received
a condom and advice on partner notification divided by total number of
individuals seeking STD care in health facilities.
Indicator 4c:   Percentage of skills performed appropriately as reflected in case
management checklists for STD, HIV and TB patients. Randomly
selected health care facilities will be observed periodically to monitor
this.
3.39      Cost-effecdveness estmates Several decisions on which interventions to undertake have
been based on cost-effectiveness data collected elsewhere, or very rough 'back-of-the-envelope"
calculations, or educated guesses and expert recommendations. Data should become available durig
the implementation of the project which will enable Zimbabwe-specific estimates to be made of cost-
effectiveness of various options. A sector study on -Health Care Costs and Cost-effectiveness- is
planned so that we should be able to work with the Government (and others in Zimbabwe) to anayse
the data, and use the results to reassess project and program priorities.

PROJECT COSTS9 FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND
DISBURSEMENTS
A. Com
4.1     The total cost of the project is Z$661 million or US$87.3 mfllion equivalent. Base coss are
estimated at US$74.8 million equivalent (86%) and contingencies at US$12.5 million equivalent
(14%). Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$78.4 million or 90% of total project costs.
Taxes and duties are negligible, being less than 1% of total project costs. All costs are based on
February 1993 prices. Project costs are summarized by component in Table 4-1.

4.2         Project costs by expenditure category are shown in Table 4-3. Condoms account for
14.4% of base cost, pharmaceudcals (mncluding diagnostic tests) for 70.9, and medica and office
supplies for 14.7%.
4.3         Sources of cast estimates. All costs are estimates and obviously subject to change.
'Me cost of condoms was based on information from staff at the Family Planning Logistics
Management Project and World Bank staff about current intemational tender prices. Pharmaceutical
costs were estimated from the Zimbabwe Government Medical Stores most recent price list, data



-58 -
from thie Essential Drugs Program, and from WHO for drugs not currendy in use in Zimbabwe. The
prices for supplies (rubber gloves, syringes, disinfectant) and small equipment (petri dishes,
laboratory slides and covers, etc) are based on the most recent GMS price list, quotations from
suppliers, and the UNICEF UNIPAK catogue. Costs of diagnostic tests were provided by WHO.
4.4         The project includes: 307 million condoms at a unit cost of US 3.5& each (c.i.£); 24
million pairs of latex gloves at US 8g a pair; and 12,000 bottles of disinfectant at US$6.40 per botto.
Costs of individual drugs and pieces of equipment are detailed in Annex 12. Local training and
service costs and operational and maintenance expenses are based on current acwal MOH costs.
4.5         Cost Contingendes and Exchange late. The total project costs include an allowance
of US$12.8 million equivalent for contingencies. Physical contingencies are 5% and total US$3.9
million equivalent. Price contingencies have been estimated using Bank projections of interntonal
and domestic inflation, and assume the annual rates of increase set out in Table 4-2. The exchange
rate used for 1993 is Z$6.3 = US$1. The nominal exchange rate is assumed to adjust during the life
of the project so as to maintain a constant real exchange rate, given these projected inflation
differentals.

4.6         Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs of US$80.6 million are calculated
on the following basis: (a) condoms - 100%; (b) pharmaceuticals - 90%; (c) diagnostics - 100%; (d)
office supplies and serices - 50%; (e) medical equipment and laboratory supplies - 100%; (f) latex
gloves - 65%; and (g) disinfectant - 50%.
4.7         Recurent Costs and Sustainabllty. The recurrent cost implications of the project
are small. No new buildings are being constructed, and no additional staff are likely to be hired.
Government will finance the maitance costs of new equipment purchased, through the MOH
budgetary allocation. These costs are estimated at 5% of purchase price annually. Ihe project will
be managed by staff already in place. Most PMU and NACP staff are on MOH payroll, a few are
funded through FHP or other projects. Other PMU running costs are shared between MOH ongoing
donor-funded projects.
4.8         The project contributes straegic inputs to broader programs, making it appropriate to
consider the recurrent cost implications of those programs. The increasing numbers of condoms
being used in the country imply added distnbution costs. Ihese will be borne by Government,
though the subvendon to ZNFPC or covered by ZNFPC's condom charges. Ihe TB program is
expected to be implemented without hiring additional staff. The additional case load implies more
travellng by the exisdng staff who are responsible for case follow-up and con    tracing. These
costs will be financed by the Government, through the appropriae MOH budget item. There are
ecownomies of scale, to the extent that new TB cases are in the same villages or workplaces.
hnroduction of the new dipstick test for HIV will reduce associated recurrent costs, as the test is
much cheaper than those now in use and can be performed at any site. Making cost-efective use of
protective supplies will require local health centers periodically to distribute supplies to communities,
with the costs of deliveries to be borne by the Government. There are no additional incremental costs



- 59 -
awociated with conined testing of the blood supply. Those associated with the STD program and
treatment of HIV-rlated lnfecdons other tha TB, will be borne by the MOH, and will require
budgetary reallocations and savings. Recent decentralisation of budget management to provincial
level facditates this by empowering provincial medical staff to allocate their budgets In accordance
wih halth care priorities.
4.9         The annual cost of the project in the first year is equivalent to about 13% of the
1992/93 toal MOH budget, which was was Z$689 million (US$115 million equivalent). If the MOH
budget is assumed to increase by a nominal amount of only 20% each year of the project - a very
conservative asumption, given inflation - the annual cost of the project will remain around 13% of
the MOH budget (net of the project allocation). It is expected that the MOH budget will rise faster
than this, however. The Ministry of Finance is committed to maintaining per capita health
expenditures, which will require an  nual 3.5% real budgetary increase. Additionally, MOH has
presented an estimate of the expected costs of hospitalizadon for AIDS patients, which will need to be
taken into consideration in future MOH budget allocations. There are an estmated 40,000 AIDS
patients now, and NACP predicts an increase of 10,000 each year. If 75% receive hospital treatment.
at an average total of 50 in-patient days (average cost of Z$110/day), this implies an increase in costs
of Z$165 milion in 1993/94 - 24% of the total MOH budget for 1992/93, rising steadily to Z$330
million over five years.
4.10        Recurrt ost saving. Many of the consumable items being funded are investments
in human capital, and will restore good health or prevent illness. Condoms, drugs for TB treatment
and gloves for health workers are examples. Provision of these items reduces rather than incurs
recurrent costs in the health sector: every TB patient treated, or every HIV-infection averted, reduces
the number of future potenti patients seeking health care.
4.11        Left unecked, STD infections in men cause mild to severe genital or urinary tract
problems and can cause infetility. The consequences for women, who are often asymptomatic and
therefore unaware of the infection, include adverse outcomes of pregnancy for mothers and newborns,
Infections in newborns and i , infertility, cervical cancer, and in some cases death. These
impose vastly higher costs than STD treatment. The direct drug costs of presumptive treatment of the
most common STD syndromes are US$2.91 (for GUD), US$3.43 (for urethral disbcharge) and
US$4.23 (for vaginal discharge). Viewed another way, it has been esmated that at US$10/hour for
clinic time, in a country with an HIV seroprevalence rate of 5% (about half the rate in Zimbabwe),
treatment of a core group of high-risk STD patients costs between US 110 and 96c per healthy life
year saved, and is an extemely cost-effective health intervention.
4.12        With HIVWAIDS, of coue, the inevitable result for the patient is death. The resut
for the health care system is ta the patient suffers an average of nine episodes of HIV-related
infection during the roughly one year between the onset of full-blown AIDS and death. It is
estimated brcadly that each case of AIDS in Zimbabwe inposes direct costs of more than US$1,000.
Moreover, most people with AIDS are in the most economically productive age group (1545), and
leave young and aged dependent survivors, with greater attendant costs to the economy and society.
The total indirect CostS of one AIDS case have been calculated in some countries as 20 times as great
cs te direct cost-perhs as much as US$21,300 per case in Zimbabwe. The direct cost of a yeares
supply of condoms for a sexually active erson in Zimbabwe would be US$5.25. Alternatively, each
unit of blood screened in a ountry with 10% HIV seroprevalence costs an estimated US$9.10 per
EIIV case prevented.

4.13        Sustalnablllty. Considering the salnability of the project in the usual sense, it is
uncertin whether, at the end of the project, Government will be able to take over and sustain the
financing of condoms and all drug needs, particularly if the incidence of HIV-related illnesses
condnues at current rates. Much will depend on how quickly the economy recovers from the drought
and how successfil the adjustment program is in restoring economic growth. The Government has
demonstrated a strong commitment to public bealth care in the priority consistently given to health
since Independence. During the past two years, the health share of the overall budget has remained at
5.0%, reflecting GOZ's commitment to protect social expenditures during the adjustment program.
Nevertheless, the MOH recurrent budget has fallen about 35% in real terms over the past two years,
as Government has sought to reduce the fiscal deficit at a time when export earnings were hard hit
because of the drought, and huge amounts of food had to be imported. The MOH is tying to counter
the budget decline in several ways: by increasing cost recovery; geting private sector outlets to sell
condoms; economizing on the use of drugs and ensuring lowest cost procurement; and by
decentralising budgeting and planning, giving district and provincial health management teams the
authority and incentive to priortize and economize. Steps have also been taken to improve billing
and colection from insured patients of the central hospitals, acting on the recommendations of the
Health Financing Study (1991). These measures will all help to make the financial burden of public
health care manageable.
4.14        There is another, broader aspect to sustainability. Instead of asking, "After the
project, what?" one needs to ask "Without the project, what?" Without the inputs to be provided
tirough the project, a much more serious sustainability problem would arise. The large amounts of
money spent on health facilities and the training and wages of health workers are wasted if adequate
drugs and other supplies are not available. Therefore, the project is helping to ensure the
sustainability and Impact of past and existing large investments in health care. Moreover, the project
will prevent and cure illness and therefore reduce spending on health care, and reduce potential
productivity losses because of illness and death and the loss of accumulated human capital of people
who die young of AIDS.
B. FINANCING
4.15        The total project cost of US$87.3 million equivalent will be financed as follows: a
proposed Bank credit of US$64.5 million would cover 74% of total project cost and 100% of foreign
exchange costs. The Government would finance from its annual budget the remairning costs of
Z$60. 1 million (US$8.0 million equivalent) or 9.1% of the total, including all taxes and duties.

4.17   Drugs and Diagnostics (US$55.1 million) will be procured through ICB procedures
according to IBRD guidelines. These items, which include drugs for STDs, TB and HIV-related
infections, and blood test kits, will be grouped wherever possible and procured on a semi-annual basis
based upon projected requirements agreed t& by the Bank. As there are several drug mamnfacuez in
Zimbabwe, domestic preference will be applied during bid evaluation.
Large tenders are expected to be placed twice each year. Should unforeseen needs or emergencies
arise, international and local shopping according to IBRI) guidelines will be used for goods valued at
no more than US$500,000 per package, up to a total of no more than US$2.8 million
4.18   Medical Equipment and Supplies (US$9.4 million) include such items as laboratory
supplies (e.g. pipettes, slides), latex gloves, syringes and needles and will be procured on a quarterly
basis based upon projected requirements using actual usage historical data. Items will be grouped
together wherever possible. Tenders in excess of US$250,000 will be procured on the basis of ICB
according to IBRD Guidelines. Total ICB procurement of this category will aggregate to about
US$7.9 million. Domestic preference will be employed where applicable in these procurements.
Where procurements are under US$250,000 they will be procured under local competitive bidding
(LCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. LCB procurements should total US$1.0 million. Small
off-the shelf items required to meet unanticipated emergency requirements will be procured through
international or local shopping requiring three quotations in accordance with IBRD Guidelines.
Proper planning should enable this type of procurement to aggregate no more than US$0.5 million.
4.19    Office Equipment, Supplies and Services (US$30,000) will be grouped together wherever
possible and procured using LCB practices acceptable to the Bank. For small contracts or goods and
services for which there are only a small number of suppliers, procurement will be by international or
local shopping, according to IBRD guidelines. Among the items included in this category are office
furniture, computers and printing services to produce training materials.
4.20   Tender documentation format. The Bank's standard bidding documents wiUl be used in all
ICB procurements under this project. (Where no relevant standard bidding documents have been
issued by the Bank, documents based on accepted international standard forms will be used.) The
appraisal mission reviewed and approved a draft ICB bidding document for condom procurements,
which followed the Bank sample bid document format, and drew on the lessons leant in procuring
condoms under other Bank-funded projets. The Borrower submitted a draft bid document for drugs
to the Bank prior to negotiations, also drawn up following the new Bank sample document.
4.21    Procurement Review Thresbholds. Bidding packages for all ICB procurements in excess
of US$250,000 will be submitted to the Bank for prior review of tender documentation in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines. The amount of these procurements will exceed 90% of the total project
procurement. All other procurements will be subject to selective post review by the Bank. Therefore
the Borrower is required to maintain proper records for easy access by the Bank.
D. DISBURSEMENTS
4.22    Disbursements from the World Bank credit will cover the percentage of total expenditures as
indicated in Table 4-5.

4.23 Ihe World Bank credit will be disbursed over a period of five years, from 1993-1998, with
procuremet and disbursements completed by June 30, 1998 (completion date) and December 30,
1998 (closing date) respectively. The proposed allocation of the c:edit and an estated semi-annua
schedule are shown In Annex 1. All applications to withdraw proceeds from the Bank credit will be
foIy doumented, except for equipment conacs valued at less than US$25,000 equivalent, for which
disbursents will be made against certified statemes  of ependitu  (SOE). Supportng
documentation will be retained by project execuing agencies and will be available for review as
requested by World Bank supervision missions and project auditors.
E. AccouNTs AND AUDrT
4.24    Project accunts wil be established and man ined by the eoxsng PMU in MOH. ZNFPC,
Govemment Medical Stores and NACP will send all relevant infomation qartey to the PMU. A
Special Account will be opened for this project and mainained with a commerci bank by the
Reserve Bank, on behalf of the MOH. The maximum balance in the Special Account will be US$1
million, which will cover abu 4 months of expenditure.
4.25    Audit. The Govemment's perfmance in auditng project accounts under FHP1 and FHP2
has generally been acceptable. Delays in carrying out audits at were experienced in the early years
of FHP1 have been overcome, in large part by engaging additional PMU staff to prepare project
acounts. At present, FHP1 and FHP2 audits are up-to-date. The quality of the audits has also been
isfactory. Assurances wil be sobghtfirom Govwment     allproject accouns Wi be audited by
the Auditor Geera and th all audied accounts, togeter with the audtor report, Wll be

In auditing the STI project accounts, t-.e auditors will pay special atoention to verifying the reliability
of SOEs, and to the inal controls and procedures involved in the preparation of SOEs.

BENEIS ADRISKS
5.1         The project will directly benefit 65,000 tuberculosis patients and their families, fellow-
workers and ot'hers who would be at risk of infection through contact with them. It will provide
condoms to an estimated 700,000 persons, thus protecting them and their sexual partners from the
risk of conting HIV and STDs. lhe project will furnish sufficient diagmstics to test every
pregnant women who seeks care for syphilis during the life of the project, benefiting them and their
unborn children. More than 180,000 people wi HIV will receive care for various infections.
Protective supplies will safeard an estimated 5,000 health workers from the risk of HIV and their
tens of thousands of patients from nosocomial and iatrogenic infections.
5.2         ?y the end of the project, Zimbabwe will have developed the capacity to prcure
condoms, giving a greater degree of control and information on deliveries, rather than relying on
donors. Stockouts will have been avoided through the project, and the periodic time- and eneW
consuming fimding and supply crises that have arisen in the past will have been avoided. Country-
wide reliable supplies of condoms will have enabled the 700,000 people who are expected to be
puaded by the public-information campaigns to use condoms, to do so.
5.3         The project will finance implemention of the National STD Prevention and Control
Program. Provided this program is implemented according to plan, by the end of the project,
detection and treatment of STDs should be fully integrated into every level of the health care system.
The project will facilitate the selection of the most cost-effeve treatment regimen, and support a
switch away from sub-optimal regimens where wanted.
5.4          he TB control program will have received the drugs and small increae in operaating
budget needed to treat all identified cases, follow-up patients to help ensure compliance with
tratment, trace contacts, and verify suspected cases and refer them for treamt. Ihe project will
help to avert a major resurgence of TB incidence.
5.5         The project will also ensure ihat procurement of drugs is done in a bighly cost-effective
manner, and will reinforce continued use of the Essential Drugs List. By making available adequate
foreign exchange, it wil prevent some of the irrational ad hoc practices that have occurred in the
past. By making available drugs for tratment of an estmated 1.6 million episodes of HlIV-ated
illnesses (apart from TB), the project will avoid critical shortages of antibiotics that are also needed
for many other uses.
5.6         By the end of the project, an estimated 575,000 people will have been able to find out
their HIV status, the safety of the blood supply will have been ensured for a further five years, and
health care workers will have been able to carry out their jobs without being exposed to the risk of
lIV infection. An 752 rural health centers in the country would have been adequately provided with
disinfectant.
5.7         Project Risks. The principal risk for the project is that the incidence rates of HIV,
STDs or TB, aUl high already, may increase so quickly as to overwhelm even the integted effrt of
Zimbabwe's STI program. The only way of averting this risk is to mount the most inclusive, cost-
effective program possible in the shortest feasible time. Ihe project has been designed to observe the

processing - identification to apprais - took less tfian six months. A secndary rsk is that the health
services may lack sufficient experience and capacity to implement an effective STD screening and
prevention program. During supervision missions, technical eperts will assess capaci and
determine if any speci training or refiesher courses are needed. These will be able to be funded
under other ongoing projects (including FHP2). There is also some risk tt sufficiently broad
Government support and funding may not materWize. Public commitment to STI control is an
important aspect of program success, especially in spreading accurae and timely information. Given
the high public awaness about STIs, Government's forthright treatment of the issue after years of
silence, and the itegraed effort (including IEC) already underway, this risk is regarded as small.
There is a risk thst the important activities that the project complements, notably the public
information efforts to persuadei people to use condoms and seek treatment for STDs, may not be
carried out according to plans. This risk is reduced by the stong Government and donor
commitment to these activides, reflected In fimding, but if this were to chamge, it may prove
necessary to reallocate project funds. Another risk is that the NACP capacity may prove inadequate
to the huge coordinating task facing it. ODA will support measures to strengthen NACP, as
identified in the March 1993 multi-donor/GOZ review. A final risk is that the behavioral changes the
STI program seeks to promote are likely to prove difficult to achieve. Limited experience in other
countries, however, suggests that the literal life-and-death choice posed by the proliferation of STh
has proven compeling enough to override even the inherent resistance to change.
5.8         Envhr_ment. Ihere are no known negative environmental consequences of the
activities being supported through this project. Consequently, i has been classified as category C and
no environmental assessments will be necessary.

THE DISEASE OF AIDS1
1.     HIV belongs to a family of virues called retroviruses, which a  eomposed of the genetic
mateal RNA (ribonucleic acid) and have  mor-causing poteal (Johnson and Vira, 1987). HIV
is infectiou, transmitted by means of semen, vaginal fluid, or blood (WHO, 1988), usuly during
sexual conta  or in blood tsfusions. As a systemic infection, HIV mainly at   and destoys
whie blood cdils, especially T heper lymphocytes, in the b'ood and lymph system  at cause an
inability to resst infections. There are two reported strains of the virus. HIVI is the most commo
strain and salogical evidence is found in those who acquire the disease. A eond less praent
stan, HIV2, is endmi in West Africa, and present in Europe, and has been found In Brazi. HV
i less pathogen   t   HIVi. The modes of transmission are thought to be the sme but to date all
the report cases of H1V2 iMnolve sexual transmission.
2.      The ilcubation period varies from carrier to carrme. It is believed tht the symptoms of
AIDS can surface anydme, normally *om one year to ten o. more years after Inita infection, but
some have suvived for as many as 20 years. Ile duration and isity of infectiousness i8 also
unknown; data have shown, however, ha an HIV carrier can trammit the virus to others shordy
after becoming infected and long before the onset of AIDS proper (Family Health hntatIonal 1937).
The existence of such asymptmatic transmitters,' many of whom may not be aware that they ae
even infected with HIV, ma   the disease particularly difficult to control and interventions hard to
3.      ITe body's initil respowme to HIV infection is to produce antTHodies to the virus. However,
the antibodies are ineffectual becs they do not actually combat the viras but mery mak its
presenc (San Francisco AIDS Foundation, 1986, Glossary). The early symptoms of HIV Infection
may include a shot-erm illness, such as glandular fever, after 2-8 weeks. A common later effect I
pesiteny ened lymph glands (PGL), which generally last thmree months or longer and may
occr in conjunction with diarrhea, weight loss, fever, night sweats, fatigue and opportunistic
infections (e.g. toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus).
4.      About 5-10 percent of patients with PGL revert to an asymptomatic state for an indefinite
perod of time, but in most cases PGL is followed by the AIDS related complex (ARC) and then
AIDS. In Vfull blown* AIDS the iected person contracts and later dies from opportutc infecdons
that a normally finctoning Immune system would repel. With the difficulty in identfying the
symptoms, sig  and ifections associated wih AIDS, WHO has developed a proviona clinical
digosic profile for AIDS thu is particulaly relevant where diagstic resour  are limited: seve
weight loss, chronic diarrhea, and prolonged fever. Ihe following are minor signs- persiet couh,
dmatts, herpes zoster, cadidiasis in the respiratory tract, mouth and/or vagia, herpes simplex
Ifection and PGL. In the absence of other known causes of immunosuppressio, uch as cancer or
malnutrition, AIDS is defined by the existence of at least two of the above major signs in conjuncto
with at least on minor sign.

Modes of Tansmlslon
S.      HIV tansmission can occur several ways. It is primarily rasmitted during sexual ontact,
penaay  (from pregna  mother to the fes) and parenterally (through blood transfusions and use of
conminated needles and syringes).
6.      Sexual tsmi on: Several forms of sexua  tsmission are observed. lbe HIV vims
Canin principa be tasmitted through either anal or vagina inrwcourse, and it is widely believed,
(though les well documented) Xa the virus might be orally transmitble (Population Reos, 1986).
Behavioral and culural fictors appear to play a role in the relevance of the kinds of intercourse.
7.      Parnteral transmisslon: The predominant mode of parentera transmission in the West is
intravenous drug use where needles and syringes are shared. Tramnmission due to trvenous drug
use (IVDU's) is rare in most LDC's, but may be growing due to the reuse of containatd needles
and syinges.
S.      Blood trasusios: In the US, Europe and many other countries, early cases of HIV were
Vraceable to trsfusions of cotamiaed blood. The Implementation of screening techniques for HIV
atibodies have aested this source of spread in industrialized counties as well as in Zimbabwe.
9.       Perntal   a: HIV tnsmssion oc    perinatally from the pregna  mother to
fetus. It is estIma   tat almost 10% of HIV inections are due tD perl    transmission in Tanzania
(Ngaly 1990). The probability of peinata transmission cannot be estmated with eainty as all
newborns carry the mother's ati es at birt. As the unifected baby grows older, the maten
antibody levels will decreas, and EIV antibody tests wiUl gradually show negative results.
10. Rates of vertical transmission are estimted to be around 2S - 50% (Ryder et al 1989) with
mothers in advanced stages of disease showing higher transmission rates.3 With the in Ws trd
twards heteroseul ta smiion   Lai America and Afica, the incidence of prinat
tsmission is likely to grow (Over and Piot, 1991).
Retive Effidency of   n oo  Modes
11.     Risk facto  for HIV infection are simflar to those for sexually tasmittd diseases ad
include a high number of sex partners, unproteed sex with an ifcted person, presence of STD,
history of contac with commercial sex workers (CSW) or being a CSW. Sexual trasmission of I11v
may be facilitaed by the presence of ether STDs, which pardy explains the varying intensity of the
HIV epidemic globally. SIDs and their consequences on HIV infection Is discussed in greater dea
in Anmnx 3.
12.     The relative efficienc. of the modes of trnmission vary a great deal. Co-facts, such as
the increased fivency of contac, the use of condoms, presence of sexaly   an_mtted diseaes can

.xceba  or rard the 'efflciency of transmission, tereby influencing the efficiecy of
transmission and raising the possibility of geti  the HIV infection. Genitd ulcers due to Seually
Transmitted Diseases from syphilis, gonorrhea or chancroid increase the efficiency of transmission 5-
10 dmes (Bjorman 1991, Pepin 1989).

that her child will be born with HIV ranges from 12 - 50%. Mothers with more acute signs and
symptoms of RIV demonstate higher rates of transmission to their cildren.' Approximately a
quarter to half of the infected infants may become severely ill in their first year; others may develop
AIDS later on in their lives (WHO 1988).

NATuRE., INCIDENcE AND TREATbMET oF SEXUALLY TRANSMITtE  DJSASF
1.     Although hiorically considered relatively unimportant sets of dise, seualy transmitted
dises (STDs) have beome of paramount importance due to the emergence of AIDS (a type of
STM) and their Iterconnection with HIV transmIsion and its symptom severity.
2.     SID are now the most common group of ntifiable  fecdous diseas in most ouies.
Over 20 pathogens are known to be spread by se   contact. Over the last 40 years the burden
associated with traditional venereal diseases like syphflis, gonortea and chancroid ha decined,
paricularly in industrial countries, but they have been amply replaced by both bacteral and viral
syndromes including HIV. These agents are difficult to identify and trea and can caue serious
complications resulting in chronic ill-health and even death. Typically, infections In men cause mild
to severe genita or urinary tr  problems and infertility can resu't. The coneuences for women are
far more severe. They include adverse outcomes of pregnancy for ,rothes and newborns; infections
in newborns and infants like ophthalmia and chlamydial pneumona pelvic inflammatory disease;
infertility; ectopic pregnancy; and cancers of the cervix. Table C.l provides the outcomes of
infection with STDs.
3.     STDs are both a risk fcor  and a proxy for HIV inctIon. STDs are biologic evidence of
unprotected sex, which is a key risk factor for HIV. Many STDs have acue clinical manifestions,
which make them more likely to be seen, diagnosed and reported ta IV. However, there are
several Important caveats, namely: (1) there are many differe  STDs, and diagois is based on
clinical and laboratory methods that differ widely In complexity and availability; (2) many STDs are
asymptomatic, particularly in women, and are unlikely to be detected because infected women don't
seek diagnosis or trament and (3) the in&astructure for diagnosing and mangIn STD  is poorly
developed in most developing countries.
Epidemiology:
4.     A critical ayalysis of the relationship betwen E11V and SDs is complicated by the fact hat
IV itself is an STD (Laga 1992). It is believed that STDs Influence the naburl history of HIV. For
example, HIV could conceivably give rise to atypical presentation of other STDs, including larger,
more numerous and more persistent lesions, or accelerate its progression towards clinical symptoms.
STDs could influence diagnosis or patient's response to treatment of other STDs, resulting in more
fiequent or more rapid complications, abrant laboratory test rests, and inadequate mponse to
standard therapy (Mertens et al., 1990). HIV infection is thought to incre the usceptibility to
other STDs. Research on the relationship with HIIV and other STDs has revealed ta STDs may
enhance the se   transmission of HIV by increasing the susceptibility In HIV-negative persons and
Increasing infectivity in 11IV-positive persons. Tbis may partly explain the differ  rates of spread
of HIV around the world.

5.      Studies from developing counties confirm the endemicity (native to a particar locality,
region or country) of STDsV'. The table below looks at the prevalence of various STDs. Gonorrhea
is bdieved to be the most common preventable cause of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) and tubal
infertlity woddwide. Pevalent in most Westen countries, gonorfhea is hyperendemic in most parts
of central Africa (Waserhelt and Dixon-Mueller, 1991).
6.      The correlates of STD incidence include a large number of sex parners, a history of STDs,
urban residence, being single and between the ages of 15 and 44. The highest rates of STDs are
found in urban women between the ages of 15 - 35 (Over M, and Piot P. 1992).
11 A stdy in two Egypi  nural villages confim endcity of STDs. This study found that half of 509 non-
prnat won bdeween the ages of 20.60 had  eproductive tmact infictions. A suddy cooduded in
Iab bsm, uIdia of 650 runl women reveaed that 92% of them had ateast one sexual or gynecological
disa, wit n averg of 3.6 per women (Source Washington Post 7-7-92).

7.     Ihe impact of HIE  on the epidemiology of GUD (Genital Ulcer Disease) is distressing. If
GUD facilitates the transmission of H!V, and HIV+ persons are more likely to have GUDs
(associated with treatment failures due to antibiotic resistant strains), then these two infections are
mutualy reinforcing their spread, resulting in an increased prevalence of HlV and GUD in the
community.
Transmossn:lu
8.     STDs are highly communicable and can be transmitted perinatally, through sexual contact or
intravenous drug use. Commercial sex workers are cited as being the source of STDs in 20% of
identified cases in Europe and North America (D'Costa 1978) and in 80% of the cases in the hird
World (Rajan 1978). They remain a reservoir for sustaining the infection in the general population
everywhere.
9.     Biologically, the transmission of several SMDs is more efficient from men to women and the
consequences for women are more serious. For example, a man's risk of acquiring gottorrhea from
an infected women during a single heteosexual encounter is approximately 20 -25%. A women in
simiar cic    a    carries a 50% risk of acquiring gonorrhea from an infected male (tcher et
il).
10.    N. gonorrhoea and C. trachomatis infection in the mother can be perinally transmitted to
children, and is manifested as conjunctivitis and respirory disease: both are treatable however. The



- 81 -
Page 4 of 6
consequences of syphilis are well documented and cause sevea handicaps In 25 - 75% of exposed
infas (Ingraham, 1951).
Risk:
11.    As with AIDS, STDS are seualy transmitted through genital mucosal contact. Ihe
presence of open ulcerative lesions Inceases the probabilty of tramission of HIV 3 - 10 times (Plot
et al, 1988; and Pepin et al 1988). Genital ulceration such as chancroid, syphilis and herpes increase
the risk of HIV Inoction. Trichomonal, chlamydia ad gonococcal infections in women also increase
the risk of HIV tamission. Tabte C.3 summaizes studies cowiucted in several locations,
demonstrtng tht the presence of SMDs enhances the rik of HIV transmission.

12.    Risk factors for STDs are the same as those for HIV and depend on the cliural and
behavior patterns eting in  y given country. Although women are thought to be at low risk for
STDs in may countre, recent evidence shows dtat India and Africa have a surprisingly high
prevalence of STDs (Bg  1989). In the abce of effecdve disease conol programs, chamydia
rates are 2-3 dmes higher than those in developed countries; gonorrhea rates 10 .15 times as high
and syphilis occurs 10 -100 dmes as much. In addition, gonorrhea is often asymptomatic and women
are unaware dut diagnosis and treatmen are required. Women normally become infected at an
earlier age t men (Holmes, 1992).

SUPEVION STRATEY
Borrower's Contribution to Supvsion
(a)  ITe National AIDS Coordination Programme (NACP) will submit semi-annual rqpors
of project monitoring data to the Bank in March and September of each year.
(b)   Ihe Project Management Unit (PMU) in the Ministry of Health wil mainain up-to-date
project accounts and present summary accounts to the Bank every six months.
(c)   The audits of project acunt by the Auditor General or by independen auditors
acceptable to the Bank will be made available to the Bank within nine months of the
close of each fiscal year.
(d)   Each implementing unit-MOH, ZNFPC, OMS and Harare City Health-will report
semi-amually to the NACP on implementn, including progress and delays.
(e)   By September 1995, the NAC-' will prepare and provide to the Bask for its rpproval a
plan for cayng out a mid-term project review. By March 1996, in consultation with
the Bank, NACP wfll, with the assistance of te Implemening units, cary out a mid-
term review in accordance with the agreed plan. Therefer, Governme  will promptly
tae aii actions recommended as a result of the review that ars required to achieve
project objectives.
(f)   The NACP will be responsible for coordinating arangements for Bank supervision
missions and for providing information required by misions.
(g)   Mission briefing meeings on arrival and wrap-up meeti before depate   will
normally be chaired by the Director of the NACP.
Bak Suprvion Inputs
1.          I is estimated that regular supervision from Washington (to review progress reports,

AIDS EDUCATION ACTVIES IN ZIMAWE
The following are the draft conclusions and recommeons of a comprehensive review
of AIDS JEC actvities In Zimbabwe.
NXo AIS Corinto PoM
Th National AIDS Coordination Programme deserves credit for the extensive support
they have given to educational activities implemeted by other organizations in all sector. Ihey have
facilitated the development of a genuinely multisectoral approach to AIDS education.
DI)ersih and breadth of activi
The diversity and breadth of educational activities in Zimbabwe Is impressive. When the
involvement of the M  y of Education, NGOs and the private sector is considered, it is clear that
Zimbabwe has greater divesity and breadth of involvement in AIIDS preventien programmes han  y
other African country.
QMVMhMhMscvehool AMD  grmmm
Throughout the world, school Ad)S education programmes are extremely sensitive and
have often been deraied or delayed by parental, church or community pressure. Zimbabwe's
emerging sdol AIDS education promme   clearly the most comprehensive in Affica, which Is
fining in a country with among the highest proportions of adolescents attending school in Africa
HIigh knowledgg of AMD
Knowledge of AIDS Is now extremely high. Several stues have reported marked
increases in knowledge since 1987. There hava been no AIDS knowledge surveys done on a
nationally repre e sample. Ite most representative sample is that of the 1988 Demographic and
Health Survey, which interviewed a nationally representative  mple of 4,201 women aged 1549
years. Eighty-six percent of women had heard of AIDS and 75% could spontaneously name one
couect mode of transmission. This was four years ago and knowledge leveis may be expected to be
higher still now.
However, in the same study, only 14% of respondents reported having done anyting
about AIDS, which highlights the limaons of information and knowledgeobased appoaches as an
exclusie stra   for behaviour change.
Notwhtanding the successes oudined above, there are mmerous challenges for AIDS
education activities. These include:

PEogram    mangment MM=  fot thqe Niadop  AIS   gWdinatiga Proe
The NACP have successfiuly started to reorient their activites away from the more
di   programming role that was necessary when few groups were involved in AIDS acdvities,
towards a coordinadon role. However, the unit could benefit fom fiuther programme management
support to help them define their priorities as a coordination and support unit and to develop
strategies to achieve their priorities. In pardcular, constructive ways of apportioning IEC officers time
to ensure the maximum return on time devoted to helping groups design, monitor, rVport and evaluate
their activities are a priority.
ConUuoacftO  f it  flective biLOM
Ihis review has given greater coverage to activities conbining clear follow-up strategies.
Oneoff campaigns without follow-up or campaigns without the effective monitoring necessary for
properly planned follow-up should be avoided. Govenme, NGO and occupational sector AIDS
educators need further training in follow-up strategies.
Successfil follow-up is pardy related to planning, organiational and management skills.
Effective traing in planning, organizing, monitoring and managing health education activities would
gready improve the inensity and contiuty of AIDS education.
Scae of letd WIon
The epidemiological logic of developing targeted interventions for vunerable groups is
widely accepted. However, the scope of existing interventions must be examined.
Sex Rorker
The scope of targeted interventions for sex workers is of concern.
A review by Potts, Anderson and Boilly identified 14 prostitte interventions in seven
African counties, reaching about 24,000 prostiut. Yet there are over 100 African cities with
populations above 100 000, each reqiring prosttute interventions.
A more recent WHO review identified 83 prostite interventions in 38 developing
countries (36 in Africa, 23 in the Americas and 18 in Asia). Some data were availle for 45. ThIrty
(67%) used peer education and 12 (27%) provided STD services. Of 38 reporting numbers reached,
only 8 (21%) reached more than 2,000 prosues. Projec  reported numerous constraints, including
problems created by punitive law enforcement practices, lack of long-term finacial support and
inadequate nmbers and quality of condoms. The authors concluded dtat project were few in relation
to need and small in scope, reaching only a small proportion of prosiutes, in certain categories of
prosi  on.
The conclusions of these reviews are gemane to Zimbabwe. After five years, there are
targeted interventions for sex workers In only seven Zimbabwean sites: Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare,
Masvingo, Kariba, Chiredzi and Shurwgwi. Yet such inteeventions are needed in numerous other sites,
as a first priority the 20 largest towns in Zimbatwe.

Wbht aplies to sex worers applies equaly to other vulnerable groups. There    only
aandful of localized niatives for dt  police or military and still fewer programmes for the a force
or police. What inltlves the are tend to be patchy and sporadic.
Ih programme for truckes is comparatively new and has only been implemented in a
handfl of o       . A natonwide trucker promme Ia urgendy needed.
Similar stures apply to workplac AIDS educadon prgrmmes. Ihe respectve
umbella gu  for commerce and Inty need to play a far more proacdve role in developing and
suppordtg ADS programmes. The parstatal sector has done litde to dat and requies urgent
assistace to develop AIDS prgrmmes. The Commercal Farmers Union initiative, which offers a
higy economical approach to very large nmmbers of otherwise inaccesible people, Is a beacon.
however, It almost ceandy neds ful-time professional staff to realize its ambitious goal of
becoming a truly nationwide progiamme.
It shoud be noted that e prWosed USAID Zimbawe AIDS Prevention and Control
Programme ZAPCP) is serously considering a major uniformed services programme and sub
financi and techical sWport to trucker and workplace programmes, as well as the major
Cmmercal Famers Union project.
Bars are clearly the locus of much casual and commercial sex in Zimbabwe. In one study
also cited above, 100 men were aske about alcohol use and sex over 21 days: of the 271 visit to
proste reported, 265 ocured aftr couming alcohol, usualy In a public plac. Bar-based
interventions are also clearly needed, as bar patrons include a substantial number of very sexually
active people. UNICEF have proposed a programme to ensure that condoms are placed in al bas In
Zimbabwe. Such a programme has the strongest possible epidedological jusfication.
Ihe Zbabwe National Tradltional Healers Association (INATHA) is a truly
indigenou nationwide organizaton with deep, authentc cultura roots which has a crucial role to ly
in promoting behaviour change In Zimbabwe. It has the poteal to be a major vehicle for AIIDS
preventon, counslling, car and support in Zimbabwe. However, in order to realize this potential, it
needs significant capacity strengthening. Its task in servig 45,000 members nationwide is dauntg.
Yet only two of the organizations offices are equipped wih telephones.
b1I9D      S AM  uc on condom  rmotin and STD control
Mahematia models indicate that the combined efects of parter reduction, condom use
and reduced occrrence of sxaly transmitted dise   are much greater than their individ'al effects
would predict, Indicatig importnt synergies. These models undetscore the cruci need to integrat
AIDS eeadon, condom promodon and STM control. Indeed, it could be provocatively argued that it
is only by titly intrai  and vigorously pusuing all thr  sttees that HIV trasmiion may
be reduced.

Page 4 of 8
A maJor wealkess of AIDS education in Zhibabwe has been limited intgration with
condom promotio and STD control.
Numerous AIDS eadcatlon programmes In Zimbabwe, whether govenment, NGO or
occutional sector, have no link with condom promotion. IThis iS completely undtandle In the
cae of youth programmes or religiously inspired AIDS education, but it is a critical weakness in
seizlar AIDS educaton programmes for adults.
Similarly, AIDS education programmes have largely Ignored STD, as the following
points indicate:
* 'here is little emphasis on educating people about the maJor STD,
their symptomns and complications.
* There has been scant atempt to advance the goal of STD control by
elphasizing the need for SD symptom recognition and prompt health
seeking behaviour.
* Similarly, there has been little emphasis on improving STD service
providers' atides and counselling skills.
A major focus on interaing or closely coordinating AIDS education, condom promotion
and SD control is crucial.
_ =cof ADS euco a
Because so few organzations systematicaily monitor their atviies, it is hard to know
the level of AIDS education conducted at an organizational, district, provincia or naional level.
Wihout monitg data, it is difficlt to do justce to an organization. Ibis was true in tis report in
the case of the National AIDS Coordination Programme and the Ministry of Health, who have done
far more activities than have been captured in existng monitoring data. Monhoring of AIDS
education activities is also vital as a planning tool. The brief excerpt below from a paper by Wilsonk
a carefuily monitored Population Services Intemational mass media campaign shows
how helpful monitig is in capig ativities and in enabling them to be properly smmaized:
* Zaire, Africa's second largest county, has invested heavily in
electonic media to reach and provide infrmation to its dispesed,
multi-ethic (over 300 ethnic groups) population.
* Television is relayed by satellite to all 11 regions, watched )y up to a
third of the nation's 13 million urban inhabitants. It has national radio
and regional stations in all 11 regions.
* By late 1990, Zaire's 13 million urban residents received an average
of 10 minuts of telvised AIDS information daily.

Page 5 of 8
* In 1990 done, the region  radio stions produced and brads 28
feature programmes, 22 spot, 8 dramas, 5 qulzzes and 2 songs on
AIDS.
A major  allenge for the Nationa AIDS Coordinaton Programme is to dovelop a
coordiated monitoringsystem that captures the Increasingly broad range of AIDS education actes
unettka in 2Zmbabwe in readily summarzable form. Itsalmportant to devdopa system  at
moive groups to mntai records and to forward them to the National AIDS Control Programme
for compiltio.
A coordinated national AIDS eg4cadla plan to ensure sebo   is  aed
Ibe different groups involved in AIDS education activities ned to plan and coordinate
closely to WIsure that a national plan is developed to easr that all priorty groups have access to
intensive, rerr  AIIDS education. Mach is happening in the sphere of AIDS education, but there is
no sytematic analysis of areas of duplication, or more importat omission.
* The first step in a national AIDS education plan would specify major
focal groups, for example, youth-In-school, youth-out-of-school, men
and women in formal employment by sector, including the uniformed
svices, transport workers, commerce and industry, agriculture and
the public service, urban men and women outside the formal sector,
rural men and women outside the fonral ector, sex workers, clients,
bar patrons and other potentially vulnerable gmups.
* The second step would be to estm  the size and ditbutio of each
group, possible common points of access and organizations with
potenti to reach these growups.
* The next step would to Identfy organizations to reach each goup and
to determine the trining, technical and financial support each
organization needs to reach their target group.
* lben, oue would anayze areas of coverage, duplication and omission.
Duplicadon may be desirable if affordable, but it is essential to
develop a strategy to cover gaps.
* The fna step would be to develop a feasible coordination,
management, monitoring and evaluation system.

In 1992, the World Health Ogzation revioewed 15 promising AIDS prevention
programmes in 13 countries, including 8 project from 6 African cunties, to deterine effective
approaches to AIDS prevention. Tre effective approaches were identified:
* Education through media  d community, person to pern

SIMULTION MODEL FoxR IV/AiDS PQisCrzONS
MIVAIDS projections in Zimbabwe are made on the basis of an pildemlological mcdel
developed by WHO's Global Programme on AIDS in 1989. Ihe model has beean widely applied In sub-
Saharan Africa and, although dated, remains the most commonly used instrme In the highly speculative
process of HIV projection. The working assumptions of the model are summarized here.
(1)    Extensive spread of HIV did not begin un         y 1980 in countries of
sub-Saharan Africa. This is consistent with a Pattern II global HIVJAIDS epidemiology.
(2)    The best esmates available to SPI/GPA of HIV seroprevalence in those resiing
in urban areas and aged 15-49 years in 1986 were used o derive eates of annual new RW Infections
to 1986, in connion with the other assumptions as detailed below (in paras. 3-7). Beyond 1986, the
assumpion is made that HIV incidence begins to decrease gradually over the next decade and beyond.
The lattr is W an import assumption for projection of S cases in the five year liits of the
projections, becaue of the relatively long -latent period' between acquisition of infection and onset of
AIDS (see para 9 below).
(3)    Where information on the magitude of the problem inrl areas wa
unvailable, the rural seroprevalence was assumed to be approximately 10% of the urban seroprevaence.
For counties where such data were available, they vere used. Such rural seroprevalences as a
percetage of the utban ranged from 10% to 55%. Tho projections may therefore for some countries be
relatvely low or conservative.
(4)     HIV infection in chfldren aged 0-1 years was assumed to be 25% of the
rprevalence in the 15-49 year age group. This may be a low esfimate, since mother-to-infant
trasmission may be as high as 50%.
(5)    The number of HIV/AIDS cases ocurring in adts outside of the 1S49 year age
goup was obtained by assuming that proportionately, such individuals wil add approximately 20% more
to the number of AIDS cases in the 15-49 year age group. Ibis factor was derived after examination of
available age-specific seroprevalence data from sub-Saharan Africa. Except for peaiatric AIDS, the
projections geneated are the sum total of the projection in the 15-49 year olds corrected by 120%, plus
the perinaly acquired HIVJAIDS (pediatic AIDS).
(6)    Ihe mean suvival after progression to AIDS has been assumed to be
approximtely six months, given the severity of disease. This was used in estmating the mber of
AIDS cases survving In any one year.
(7)    To estimate the true nationwide HIV seroprevalence in any one year, a figure for
cumulive IIV Infections adjusted for those already progressed to AIDS and dead was calculated
separately for the 15-49 and 0-4 year age groups. The 15-49 year age group result was corrected by
120% (see para 5 above), summed with the 0-4 year age grp  and divided by the total population of
the country. This result is referred to as the "Adjusted HIV Seroprevalence'.
(8)    For countries where HIV-2 prevalence is significant, AIDS case projections have
been adjused down 50% to account for the presmed lower pathogenicity of the HV-2 virus.

QUANTMFICATION OF DRUG NlEDs FOR STD TnASMT IN ZMDABWE
In preparation for the 'Global Progrm on AIDS Meetin on STD Drugs: Mehms
fOr Collaboration, an International meeting on STD drug coordination held among donors in Geneva
on 24-25 September 1992, WHO fimded a study to demine the STM drug needs in the Zimbabwe
public sector. This annex draws on that study, published by WHO in Assessment of SMD Dmug
Needs: Selected Case Studies.*
The WHO consultns had two main methods from which to choose for estimating drg
h _: (1) the adjusted consumption method or (2) the patient morbidity-stadard tratmet
method. These quantification methods are management tools for planning; their use makes neessar
asumption based on the limited information available. These methods should not be used for
scientific studies.l
The cgnsumRl\dn method estimates requirements on the basis of actual drug use per
1,000 patiet contacts in a sample of standard ficilities where consumption pattems are considered
acceptable. In some cases an adjustment upward or downward may be justifiable where consumption
is considered iappropriate. The advantage of this method is that it does not require either detaied
data on morbidity or standard treatment schedules. The disadvantage is that if irradonal consumption
patterns In the sample faitlities are not corrected in the adjustment process, they wil be used as
proies fr all fcilities of the type covered by the calculation. Additionaily, it is importn to note
tat drug use is not identical to drug need, both because of shortages and because of incorrect
prescribbing practices.
The Vlie  morbid  tan    reanent mehod begins witb two sets of data (a) the
number of episodes of each SID problem treated in the types of facilities twr which drug
requirements are to be estimated; and (b) average standard treatment schedules agreed for each STD
problem defined. The quantity of drugs given as a standard treatment for each STM problem episode
yilds the total quantity of drugs required for that STM episode.
WHO chose in Zimbabwe to use the morbidity method, since morbidity data ext and
stand  treauent protolos are followed. Treatment protocols are reproduced in Annea 11.
Total STD cases in Zimbabwe were calculated by adding the SMh cases reported by all
health facilities (cluding city councils) and then adjusting the figures for undeoring. t was
assumed that overreporting only occurs in the diagnosis of Pelvic nflammatory Disease P), which
is excluded from the calculation. These aggregated data were categorized by syndromic diagnosis,
taking Hrr City Health Department's reported relative frequency of STDs as represeaive for the
ooutry (there may be bias in the direction of over-esdmation). All other STDs were excluded. Total
reponed STD cases came to 1,091,750, producing an adjusted total morbidity of 1,357,839. The
quanes and the costs of the drugs needed are calculated on the basis of the WHO r d
tramen, reflected in the Cmre Lb of Essenal Drugs For the De_a W     SeOualy D7m  W

SECTION 4.     SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASFS
General Guidelines
Accurate laboratory-proven diagnosis of sexually transmitted
diseases (STD) is not always possible. The treatment
recommended in this section is based on diagnosis of STI
associated syndromes. Contact tracing is encouraged as an
important means of preventing further spread. Appropriate
health education should be given at every opportunity.
First line therapy is recommended when the patient makes
j his/her first contact with the health care facility.
Second line therapy is administered when first line therapy
' has failed, and re-infection has been excluded.                 i
I Third line therapy should only be used when expert attention
and adequate laboratory facilities are available, and where
results of treatment can be monitored.
In order to ensure complete cure doses LESS than those
recommended must NOT be administered. The use of inadequate
doses of antibiotics encourages the growth of resistant
organisms which will then be very difficult to treat.
1. Urethral discharge in men
The commonest cause is gonorrhoea. Other causes include
Chlamzyda trachoaatis which co-exists with gonorrhoea. Rarely
rrichomonas vaglnalis causes a urethral discharge in men. In
view of the fact that chlamydia infections of the urethra and
cervix facilitate the transmission of RIV it is felt that all
males with urethritis and all females with cervicitis should
be treated for both conditions as soon as they present with
these infections.
First line therapy
KanamycA L2g IM (1g in each buttock) as a single dose PLUS
doxycycline 100mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Treat
contacts471tW Doxycycline to be swallowed with plenty of
fluids.
,NM: a)  Cotriuoxazole may be given as an alternative to
Kanuaycin. Cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim 808g +
sulphamethoxazole. 400mg) 4 tablets twice daily for 3
days.
b) Tetracycline may be given as an alternative to
Doxycycline. Tetracycline 500mg orally 4 times
daily for 7 days.

3. Genital ulcers in men and women (with or without bubos)
The commonest cause of genital ulceration in both men and
wo.men is chancroid. However syphilis occurs fairly frequently
as well. As it is known that genital ulcerative conditions
facilitate the transmission of HIV and that syphilis may
remain undetected in the body for long periods of time both
chancroid and syphilis should be treated in every patient wi-h
genital ulcers.
a) First line therapy
Give all patients Benzathine penicillin 2.4M units stat by
intramuscular injection PLUS cotrimoxazdle 2 tablets (960mg)
twice daily for 10 days.
In patients allergic to penicillin DO NOT USE penicillin but
instead give doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 14 days or in
pregnant women erythromycin 500mg 4 times daily for 14 days.
Second line therapy
Erythromycin 500mg 4 times daily for 14 days refer patient if
no improvement.
b) Recurrent or vesicular genital lesions
These are usually due to genital herpes. Give saline baths
and analgesics.-- Persons who have septic lesions of herpes
will respond to a 7 day course of cotrimoxazole 2 tablets
(960mg) orally twice daily.
c) Granulating ulcers without bubos
This is due to granuloma inguinale. Ulcers are beefy red and
relatively painless.
First line therapy
Cotrimoxazole 2 tablets orally twice daily for 14 days PLUS
Benzathine Penicillin 2.4 MU IN. as single dose.

4. Rubos wlthout Ulcers
This is usually due to lymphogranuloma venereum, which is
caused by chlamydiae. The main effect of this infection is on
the lymphatic system and patients may present with penile or
vulval lymphoedema and inguinal bubos. A small transient
ulcer which may heal on its own may precede the swelling aud
bubos. The bubo is typically multilocular. A grooved or
multilocular bubo in the absence of an ulcer suggests the
diagnosis.
First Line Therapy
Doxycyline 100ms orally twice daily for 14 days. rn pregnancy
give erythromycin 500mg orally 4 times daily for 14 days.
Second Line Theeapy

Exclude other pathology such as torsion of testes.
First line therapy
Kanamycin 2g IM once or Cotrimoxazole (1920mg) twice daily for
3 days PLUS Doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 10 days.
Second line therapy
Erythromycin 500mg orally 4 times daily for 10 days.
6. Acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
Acute PID refers to the acute syndrome attributed to the
ascent of micro-organisms, not related to pregnancy or
surgery, from the vagina and cervix to the endometrium,
fallopian tubes and adnexal structures.
Acute PID can be caused by gonorrhoea, chlamydia, mycoplasma,
anaerobic bacteria and gram-negative organisms. Some of these
patients may require surgery.
a) Mild PID Therapy
Kanamycin 2g IM once
PLUS Doxycycline 100mg twice daily for 10 days
PLUS Metronidazole 400mg 3 times daily for 10 days.
In pregnancy give erythromycin 500mg orally 4 times daily for
10 days.
b) Severe PID Therapy
Patients may be very sick.  In cases of severe PID,   IV
fluids and IV antibiotics should be given.
First line therapy
3enzylpenicillin 5 MU IV 4 times daily PLUS chloramphenicol
5-0mg IV 4 times daily PLUS Metronidazole suppository PR lg 3
times daily for 10 days.
As the patient's condition improves the dosage of
benzylpenicillin may be given IM, the chloramphenicol may be
given orally and metronidazole 400mg 3 times daily may also be
given orally.
Second line therapy
Give IV fluids.
Amoxycillin 500mg IV 3 times daily, PLUS
Gentamycin 80mg IM 3 times daily PLUS metronidazole 1g 3 times
daily for 10 days.
7. Syphilis
a) Early syphilis
This includes primary, secondary and latent syphilis of less
than 2 years duration. Treat with benzathine penicillin 2.4
MU IX as a single dose.
In patients allergic to penicillin, give doxycycline 100mg
orally twice daily for 15 days OR tetracycline 500mg orally 4
times daily for 15 days except in pregnancy when erythromycin
500mg orally 4 times daily for 15 days should be given.

illnesses, t is possible to project with reasonable accuracy the quantites of drugs and tests that will
be demanded over the life of the project. Because international prices of most pharmaceticals are
well-known and relatively stable, cost projections can then be made on virtu4ly a line-item basis.
This annex detail the items and specifications likely to be used In the diagnosis of STDs and in the
treatment of AIDS-opporusic infections. Project cost estimates have been derived from these
projections, with some minor adjustments.
A.  Diagosids for Seualy  nsmitted Diseses
lhe following section offers an analysis of the primary diagnostics used in the
conIraion of STDs. Important traits of various diagnostics are noted, including the drawbacks of
those not recended for use. For those test that are recommended, estimated demand and prices
mre given. Total estimated costs for these tests amount to US$799,000 per year.

*    tJUseful in examining secretions, paricularly urethral pus, for
polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria.
*     Sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of gonorrhoea (ntaelular gram
negative diplococci) in males greater than 90%.
*    Requires microscope glass slide, paraffin burner, gram stain reagents,
immersion oil, microscope and experienced microscopist.
0    Siagli step staing procedv using medthylene blue may be wed rauher
than gram stain.

b.    Cuture Isotlaon of N. gononhoeae
*    Ihis is the gold standard test. Failure to isolate organism may be due to
laboratory error or poor media preparation. Requires fidi laboratory
including media preparation room, supply of C02, incubator and selective
media such as Modified Thayer-Mafin medium or New York City
medium. After isolation the organism needs to be identified by chemical

For persons with HIV, the conversion to fil-blown AIDS Is mare by the onset of
various diseas hat a healthy imune system would generly repd. Typically, an AIDS patent
wil suffr sea  of thies AIDS-opponisti infections before dying. A modd devdoped by Dr.
Richard Laing of Magement Sciences for Health has been widely used to project what per=tg of
AIDS padens wMi cona  each AIDS-opportnistic infection, thte average  mber of episodes per
palent, and the cost of treatment according to a country's prescribed protocols. Ihe model, which
is reinted in the folWowing pages, provided the basis for cost proj sdons under te projL  Th
model esimas   the average drug cost of treating one AIDS padtent in Zimbabwe at US$69.5, ge
curet etmates of HIV seroprevalence. Because of the consirble uncaties ta suroud
HIV/AIDS estmaes, this cost projection has been increased by 30% for project cosig pupos. I
should ao be noted tt becaue TB drugs are addressed separately (in section B, above), thr ctZ
has beean set at zero in the accompanyn model to avoid double counting.

BEARING IN MIND
     Ta AIDS is one other disease among te mydiad health problems of the African Continent.
     That, unlike many or almost all other disea, AIDS has no drugs or vaccines to prevent or
cure It and thos supportive drugs that ate preseny available pose a paticular challenge to
our health budges
3 ThL It is estimated tht, by the year 2000,20 mIllion Africans will be HIV positive, causing
approitely I miion deaths nually.

tuberculoss, ae becoming public hadth problems once again
*     That, with the emnce of AIDS, milions of children wil be orphned over the coming
decade.
*     ThatIthe fpodtive gains in health at  of hildre and women brought about by sucsstal
pimay hath care programmes of Imm    ation in most Afria states are being theatned
and will aculy be tevsed by AIDS.
a     That HIV, the AIDS virus, speads toug the basic human drive for love, inimacy, physcal
closeness and the reprodcon of the spedes and that contoing and channelng this drive
is the only way to eue our species' survival.
*     That AIDS leads to frstra  and despair, and i  youn an middle-aged adults, who ae
the mainsty of de fmly, the bakoe of the w fr.ce, and the key to development
