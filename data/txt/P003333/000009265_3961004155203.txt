MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF IDA TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
FOR A SEXUALLY TRANSMITfED INFECTIONS PREVENTION AND CARE PROJECT
I submit for your approval the following memorandutm and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to Zimbabwe for the equivalent of US$64.5 million. The credit would
be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years to help finance a project for prevention and
care of sexually transmitted infections.
2.          DaclgrouwnA. Zimbabwe has made impressive and consistent progress in health,
population, and nutrition by reorienting public health expenditures from high-income households to
poor rural families, and focusing on primary and preventive health, nutrition and family planning.
Between 1980 and 1990, infant mortality declined from over 100 per 1,000 live births to 53, and life
expectancy increased from 56 to 64 years. Prevalence of severe malnutrition in children fell from
22% to 12%. Great headway was made in controlling communicable diseases. However, the
unrelenting growth in HIV infections and AIDS cases thweatens to undermine and reverse these gains.
3.          By December 1992, nearly 19,000 persons had been diagnosed with AIDS and there
are probably at least another 55,000 unreported. Sentinel surveys have found HIV positivity rates of
25-60% among sexually transmitted disease (STD) patients, 40-60% among tuberculosis (TB)
patients, and 7-42% among mothers attending antenatal clinics (over 90% of pregnvit women receive
antenal care). About one third of all medical inpatients in some hospital in Zimbowe are thought
to have AIDS. The incidence of HIV-related illnesses (e.g. TB, pneumonia, diarrhea) and of STDs
that facilitate transmission of HIV have been climbing rapidly. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs),
which incluee both STDs and HIV, threaten to overwhelm the health care system.
4.          Ministry of Health and Child Welfare (MOH) policy is to fully integrate STI activities
into primary health care. The appraisal mission carefully reviewed all relevant health policies and
found them to be consistent, appropriate, fully adequate and clearly set out in Ministry documents. It
was therefore not necessary to request a letter of health sector policy. Under the National AIDS
Coordination Programme (NACP), Zimbabwe has begun to orchestrate a comprehensive national
response to the crisis through the National Medium Term Plan (MTP) for AIDS (1988-1993) and the
National STD Prevention and Control Program, which is to be incorporated into the new MTP for
1994-1998. The recognition of the links between STDs and HIV is a crucial conceptual step forward
that health experts have long advocated but that has proved politically difficult in many countries.
The key preventive activities are: educating the public about the risks associated with HN/AIDS
transmission; promoting condom use; and diagnosing, treating and following up persons with STDs.
As a result of concerted EC, most Zimbabweans are aware of HIV and its modes of trausmission.
Additionally, there is evidence of behavior change encouraged by interventions with specifically
targeted groups who appear to be frequent transmitters of STIs (e.g. sex workers and their clients).
Use of condoms has increased rapidly from 6 million in 1988 to 35 million in 1992. In treating
STDs, Zimbabwe has adopted cost-effective and low-cost protocols, including diagnosis by syndrome
rather than by laboratory tests, and a policy of testing every pregnant woman for syphilis within
MCH services. It has also placed almost all drugs used in STI protocols on the Open General Import
Licence (OGIL). The 1994-1998 MTP will further strengthen this integrated approach. As for
treatment of HN/AIDS patients, the emphasis is on community home-based care, the most affordable
and appropriate option. Priority is being given to treatment of TB, which, if left uncured, could
develop into a public health problem of major proportions. A draft National TB Program is in final
revision.



-2-
5.          Zimbabwe's health system is well-positioned to carry out this ambitious program.
There is a strong network of health care facilities across the country, supported by a sound
institutional base and good human resources. The lead institution in STI control is the NACP within
MOH, which coordinates more than 30 organizations (national and international, governmental and
non-governmental) involved in STI prevention and HIVIAIDS care. The other key role will be
played by the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC), one of the few successful
national family planning programs in Africa. ZNFPC provides a well developed network for
education, condom distribution and STD diagnosis and treatment.
6.          Until recently, the health budget was adequate aad allowed for considerable expansior.
of services. Over the past two years, drought and the structural adjustment program have sharply
constrained public resources. In order to divert over US$500 million for drought relief over the past
two years, Government had to reduce every ministry's share of the overall budget. It did extend
pre-ferential treatment to the social sectors, and to health in particular; still, MOH's share has declined
from 5.6% in 1990/91 to 4.7% in 1992/93, while total Government spending fell and inflation
persisted around 30%. The MOH budget has fallen 35% in real terms since 1991. Government has
committed itself in the SAC1 letter of development policy to restore real recurrent spending per
capita on health.
7.          Inadequate funding is jeopardizing both the achievements and the future potential of
Government's SIT prevention and care programs. Although the donor community is actively
supporting many aspects of STI control, the STD Program remains unfunded and gaps in financing
have begun to cause dangerously disruptive shortages of three critical inputs: condoms, drugs, and
diagnostic tests for STls. Drug shortages have been reported throughout Zimbabwe, a result of
MOH's inadequate drug budget. The activities called for in the National STD Program are likely to
increase the demand for services, and thus the need for STD drugs and basic diagnostics.
Rifampicin, one of the drugs used to treat TB, has been out of stock periodically through the past
year. Condoms, kng supplied by bilateral sources, were to become Government's sole responsibility
from 1993 after USAID phased out support. Several donors have provided emergency stocks of
drugs or condoms, but there was no sustained donor funding committed beyond this.
8.          Contraceptives, drugs and diagnostics share a single line item in the MOH budget The
funds MOH will need to devote to Government's increasing share of contraceptive financing thus will
likely come at the expense of drugs and diagnostics. Of the three major interventions to prevent
sexual transmission of HIV - IEC, condoms and STD control - only IEC currently receives
satisfactory funding, and it cannot succeed if sufficient quantities of commodities are unavailable.
Without considerable additional external support, Government will be unable to slow significandy-let
alone arrest-the further advance of the pandemic.
9.          projec Objectives. The project aims to help reduce the incidence and impact of
sexually transmitted infections in a cost-effective manner, by providing critical programmatic and
commodity support to Government's integrated program for STI prevention and care. The specific
project objectives are: (a) to ensure an adequate supply of condoms for disease prevention; (b) to
enable implementation of the STD Program, which provides the policy framework vital to the success
of STI control; (c) to enhance Government capacity to identify and treat, in those most at risk, the
STDs that facilitste HIV transmission; (d) to treat selected HIV-related infections, especially those
that pose a general public health threat, such as TB; (e) to facilitate HIV tesdng and counseling of
persons; (f) to ensure the continued safety of the blood supply; and (g) to protect health care givers in
health facilities and in home-based care. The achievement of these objectives will be monitored



- 3 -
through the application of specific process, program, and impact indicators discussed below under
Project Implementation (para. 12).
10.           iroect Description. The project wUl fill the gaps in Zimbabwe's STI program by
complementing Government and donor efforts with i'puts vital to the prevention, detection and
treatment (where possible) of STfs. Prevention and cure of STDs is one of the most cist-effective
methods of inhibiting the spread of HIV infection. There are five components (base costs in US$
millions): (1) Condoms ($10.7, or 14% of project costs) to ensure adequate supplies (307 million
condoms) through the life of the project. (2) The SID Program ($21.8, 29%) provides a strategic
and policy framework for STI control. Six unfunded areas are included (a) policy formulation and
implementation; (b) research; (c) training; (d) strengthening data collection; (e) improved detection
and treatment of STDs; and (f) monitoring and evaluation. The component will also finance the
drugs, diagnostics and associated supplies expected to be used in STD confirmation and treatment
over the next five years. (3) Treatment of HIV-related Infections ($31.2, 42%). This
subcomponent will finance drugs and associated supplies to treat the myriad ailments that patients with
HIV contract. (4) KV Diagnestic tests and Supplies ($2.7 million, 4%) will complement other
donor contributions with an additional 225,000 HIV tests annually for five years. (5) Protective
Supplies ($8.3, 11%). Supplies will be provided (gloves, disinfectants and disposable syringes and
needles) to help prevtent HIV transmission in health care settings.
II.        Proiect Financing The estimated total project cost is US$87.3 million. IDA will
finance US$64.5 million (74%), of which US$55.1 million is for drugs and diagnostics and US$9.4
million for medical supplies. The balance will be funded by ODA - US$14.8 million (17%) and the
Government - US$8.0 million (9%). Schedule A shows the costs and financing plan for the Project.
Schedule B contains procurement and disbursement details. The timetable of key processing events is
shown in schedule C. The status of Bank operations in Zimbabwe and the statement of IEC
investments are given in Schedule D.
12.        Project Implementation. The NACP will take the lead in project coordination and
implementation, while project accounting and finance will be handled by the existing Project
Management Unit in MOH. Responsibility for executing various components will be delegated to the
ZNFPC (technical issues for condom procurement and some condom distribution), NACP (S71)
Program coordination), MOH departments and staff (diagnosis and treatment of STDs and HIV-
related infections, non-medical procurement), and Government Medical Stores (GMS-procurement
and distribution of drugs, diagnostics and medical supplies and condoms). Government will
undertake management strengthening at GMS, by ensuring adequate staffing to operate the new
computerized stock-control system, and taking necessary actions, including designaing and training
staff, for developing capacity to manage condom procurement, logistics and distribution. Both
process and program impact indicators will be tracked. Key process indicators of project
implementation are: (a) condom supply; (b) the specific indicators set out in the STD Program; (c)
supply of STD drugs; (d) supply of drugs for HIV-related infections; (e) number of persons receiving
HIV and/or syphilis testing and counseling; and (t) percentage of blood samples tested by the national
blood transfusion center. Broader program and impact indicators will also be monitored carefully,
including percentages of pregnant women testing positive for HIV and for syphilis, percentage of
survey respondents reporting the use of a condom during the most recent sex act, and percentage of
STD patients who receive condoms and advice on partner notification. If support expected for
important activities from other donors does not materialize, reallocation of funds will be considered.
13.        Sustainability. The project will contribute to the sustainability and impact of the large
investments in health care and the STI program; without adequate drugs and condoms, other



-4-
expenditures and health personnel cannot be effective. By preventing and curing illness, the project
will reduce pote'dtial spending on health care and productivity losses because of illness and death of
people with AIDS, who typically die young. Left unchecked, STD infections in men cause mild to
severe gemtal or urinary tract problems and can cause infertility. The consequences for women, who
are often asymptomatic and therefore unaware of the infection, include adverse outcomes of
pregnancy for mothers and newborns, infections in newborns and infants, infertility, cervical cancer,
and in some cases death. These impose vastly higher costs than STD treatment. The direct drug
costs of presumptive treatment of the most common STD syndromes range from US$2.91 to
US$4.23. It has been estimated that at US$10/hour for clinic time, in a country with an HIV
seroprevalence rate of 5% (about half the rate in Zimbabwe), treatment of a core group of high-risk
STD patients costs between US 11c and 96c per healthy life year saved-an extremely cost-effective
heaeh intervention. As for AIDS, it is estimated broadly that each case of AIDS in Zimbabwe
imposes direct costs of more than US$1,000. Moreover, AIDS affects people predominantly in the
most economically productive age group (15-45) and leaves young and aged dependent survivors.
The total indirect costs of one AIDS case have been calculated in some countries as 20 times the
direct cost-perhaps as much US$21,300 per case in Zimbabwe. The direct cost of a year's supply of
condoms for a sexually active person in Zimbabwe would be US$5.25. Each unit of blood screened
in a country with 10% HIV seroprevalence costs an estimated US$9.10 per HIV case prevented.
14.         Whether Government will be able to take over and sustain financing of condoms and all
drug needs after the project is uncertain, particularly if the incidence of HIV-rela.d illnesses
continues at current rates. Much depends on how quickly the economy recovers from the drought
an how successful the adjustment program is in restoring economic growth. MOH is trying to
counter its real budget decline in several ways: increasing cost recovery; getting private sector outlets
to sell condoms; economizing on the use of drugs and ensuring lowest cost procurement; and
decentralising budgeting and planning, giving district and provincial health management teams the
authority and incentive to prioritize and economize. These measures will all make the financial
burden of public health care more manageable. Commercial efforts to market condoms have begun,
which will also reduce GOZ's need to supply them. The two Family Health projects and the Bank's
ongoing sector work in health will promote several of Government's goals.
15.         Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. In the past, disbursements have been slow
in many projects because of inadequate attention to planning procurement details during project
development, and poor familiarity with Bank procedures by implementors. To ensure that
implementation begins promptly, a procurement specialist participated in appraisal, and sample tender
documents have already been prepared following Bank formats and guidelines. By credit
effectiveness, some staff in all implementation agencies will have a good understanding of Bank
procedures. Effectiveness of several projects in Zimbabwe has been delayed while waiting for
Parliament approval or for the Government Legal Opinion. Measures have been taken to avoid such
delays, including briefing the Attorney General's office on the timetable for effectiveness and
allowing a realistic time between Board presentation and the deadline for effectiveness. Other
potential problems have been anticipated. The project has been kept simple. A clear commitment
was received from the Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Agency at each stage, which
facilitated fast project development. Our support is not spread over the whole sector; where other
donors are already involved, we have kept out, recognizing that our intervention will be more
effective if it fills gaps. Other donors have been consulted regularly to ensure support is
complementary. Regular consultations and exchanges of information will continue throughout
implementation. Chapter 2 of the Staff Appraisal provides detailed coverage of the lessons learned
from project experience in Zimbabwe (paras. 2.25-2.31), and lessons from projects and programs
elsewhere (paras. 2.32-2.53).



-5 -
16.        Rationale for Bank Involvement. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Zimbabwe was last discussed on January 21, 1992, when SAC I was presented to the Board. The
next CAS will be presented to thb Board on June 29, 1993 within the context of SAC U. Sustaining
and extending Government's successful e'forts in the area of human resource development is one o
the basic objectives of the Bank's assistance strategy, and dealing with the current AIDS epidemic in
Zimbabwe will be vital to the country's economic future. Consequently, this project is an Integral
part of our strategy of support for Zimbabwe. Funding from other donors for contraceptives is
waning, and for the majority of STD control inputs, nonexistent. A secure source of financing is
urgently needed. IDA funds will provide crucial support to the Government, especially imporant
while the adjustment program is being implemented. Like the drought, the AIDS pandemic demands
more resources than Government can muster at present, but must be confronted now to avoid far
greater coss down the road. The project will complement and help safeguard the Bank's Second
Family Health Project (FHP2), which became effective in February 1992. The serious funding gap
for STI activities has emerged since the appraisal and negotiation of FHP2, and threatens to
undermine the improvements that FHP2 should achieve in health, nutrition and family planning. By
supporting the STD Program, the project will ensure that Government's sound policy framework can
be implemented. The project will build Government capacity to procure condoms and drugs
competitively and in sufficient quantities to secure the lowest available cost consistent with quality.
17.        Agreed Acio. Prior to effectiveness, the Government will be required to take the
following actions: (a) MOH will furnish the Bank with the treatment protocols then in force for
tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, and the HIV-related illnesses for which drugs are to be
procured under the project; and (b) OMS will provide the Bank with an acceptable tender document
and advertisement ready for issuance for the first tender of drugs. At negotiatons, the Government
gave assurances that: (a) a mid-term review will be held at an agreed date and appropriate follow-up
taken promptly: (b) the distribution of the first and periodic later shipment of drugs will be monitored
and corrective actions taken by GMS if found to be necessary; (c) any proposed changes in treatment
protocols for TB, STDs and HIV-related illnesses that affect the use of drugs to be procured under the
project will be submitted to IDA; (d) STD case management guidelines will be issued to all facilities
(most already have them) and all districts will be required to conduct in-service training on the use of
the guidelines; (e) a draft of the NACP Second Medium Term Plan will be submitted to the Bank by
September 30, 1993; (t) the Government will make necessary staffing arrangements to manage and
operate the new computerized stock-control system at the GMS; and (g) MOH will take all measures
necessary, including designation of appropriate staff, to develop the capacity to manage condom
procurement, logistics and distribution.
18.        Environmental Aspects. This project has been classified as category C in view of its
negligible environmental effects.
19.        Program Qbjective Categories. The project will make affordable, simple, reliable STI
screening and care available to the vast majority of Zimbabweans. It will directly benefit the poor,
who lack the resources-and in many cases information-to seek such services from private sources.
20.         Poject Benefit. The project will directly benefit 65,000 tuberculosis patients and their
families and fellow-workers who would risk infection through cont,ct with them. It will provide
condoms to an estimated 700,000 persons, protecting them and their sexual partners from contracting
HIV and STDs. The project will furnish sufficient diagnostics to test all pregnant women for syphilis
during the life of the project, benefiting them and their unborn children. By making available drugs
for trement of an estimated 2.7 million episodes of RIV-related illnesses (apart from TB), the
project will provide care for more than 300,000 HIV/AIDS patients and avert critical shortages of



-6-
antibiotics needed for many other uses. By the end of the project, an estimated 575,000 people will
have been able to find out their H1V status and the safety of the blood supply will have been ensured
for a further five years. Finally, by supplying all 752 rural health centers in the country with
adequate protective supplies, the project will permit 5,000 health care workers and the families of
persons with AIDS to provide care without being unnecessarily exposed to the risk of HIV infection.
21.         With respect to institutional benefits, by the end of the project, Zimbabwe will have
developed the capacity to procure condoms, gaining with it a greater degree of control and
information on deliveries, rather than relying on donors. Stockouts will have been avoided through
the project, and the periodic time- and energy consuming funding and supply crises that have arisen in
the past will have been avoided. The project will finance implementation of the National STD
Prevention and Control Program. Provided this program is implemented according to plan, detection
and treatment of STDs should be fully integrated into every level of the health care system. The
project will facilitate the selection of the most cost-effective treatment regimen, and support a switch
away from sub-optimal regimens where warranted. The project will also ensure that procurement of
drugs is done in a highly cost-effective manner, and will reinforce continued use of the Essential
Drugs List.
22.         Risks. The main risk is that HIV seroprevalence or active TB prevalence, both already
high, could swell so quicldy as to overwhelm even an effort of the project's magnitude. The only
way of averting this risk is to mount the most inclusive, cost-effective program possible in the
shortest feasible time. A secondary risk is that the health services may lack the capacity to implement
an effective STD screening and prevention program, or that sufficient budgetary support may not
materWize. The high public awareness about STs, Government's keen interest in the project, and
the integrated effort already underway all limit this risk, and supervision missions will assess the need
for any additional training. With respect to the budget, Government is agreeing to targets (set out in
the SACII letter of development policy) to restore real recurrent health spending per capita. Finally,
behavioral changes are difficult to promote, but experience in other countries suggests that the literal
life-and-death choice posed by the presence of STls and provision of ways to safeguard oneself have
proven compelling enough to override the inherent resistance to change.
23.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Zimbabwe has a relatively small and recent portfolio owing to the limited lending program in
the mid and late 1980s. In recent years disbursements have been slower than the Bank
average and we have stepped up our use of procurement and disbursement workshops and
training to improve the disbursement rates. (A procurement specialist was resident in
Zimbabwe for six weeks and the Bank is worldng with the Government to identify a long
term consuitant on procurement and disbursement.) Goverment's own regulations and
modes of operation have been a botdeneck, especially in the use of special accounts and our
loan department has been worldng with Govermnent to try to amend these. The Bank and
SIDA have been providing assistance to the Government in revamping their own procurement
code. A country review was held in Zimbabwe to discuss the Bank's work program and
increase Govenument commitment and ownership of our planned operations. Regular follow-
up meeings have been held to continue the tlaogue -o,rthe country program.
