Environmental Analysis of the Second Plase of the MTHS-5YRPOW2002-2006)
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A.    BACKGROUND
A proposed Second Health Sector Program Support Credit to support the Government of
Ghana's health vision under the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy has been formulated.
The proposed credit would support the Ministry of Health to implement its Medium Term
Health Strategy (MTHS) and corresponding 2002-2006 Program of Work (POW). The
Credit would finance a portion of combined Government and external assistance budgets
for policy development and operational activities.
Programme Description
The programme is the second phase of phase of the Medium Term Health Strategy and
Programme of Work, 2002-2006. The programme involves infrastructure development
which will mainly focus on rehabilitation of existing facilities and only limited new
development in the deprived, low access areas of the country. In this regard the following
infrastructure development activities, which were not completed under phase I would be
undertaken:
*  Construction of 81 new health centres.
*  Rehabilitation of 198 health centres
*  Construction of 2 new district hospitals
*  Upgrading of 11 health centres to district hospitals
*  Rehabilitation of 28 district hospitals
*  Construction of 40 new district health management team offices.
*  Rehabilitation of 5 regional hospitals
*  Rehabilitation of 10 regional health management team offices
*  Rehabilitation of 14 training institutions.
These activities would be financed by the Ministry of Health under it's second phase
programme of work, 2002-2006. The above programme activities constitutes the total
infrastructural development programme of the MOH, which the World Bank's credit
wouldfinance just part of it.
An environmental and social analysis was conducted to:
>     Assess any potential environmental and social impacts that could emanate from
investing in the expansion and improvement of basic health services delivery and
facilities through the implementation of MOH's MTHS and 2002-2006 POW.
>     Assist MOH in defining actions to mitigate the environmental and social adverse
effects of its activities.
>     Assist MOH in planning for the building up of its capacity on the longer term to
address health related environmental issues.

Environmental Analysis of the Second Plhase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
B.    METHODOLOGY
(a)   Methods and Techniques used in assessing and analysing the impacts
In order to meet the objectives of the research primary data was collected and analysed.
The instruments and tools used were mainly interviews, consultations, questionnaires,
checklists and literature such as the terminal reports on the first phase of health sector
support program. The questionnaires were the structured interviewed type consisting of
both closed and opened questions.
(b)   Field Work
As part of the methodology for the environmental analysis, familiarisation visits were
undertaken to some selected health facilities within the scope of the MTHS and five year
POW. During the field visits it was observed that:
(i) Rehabilitation of health facilities in certain areas are completed whilst others are on-
going.
(ii) The current status and potential impacts of the health facilities with regard to the
hospital management practices and body contamination from waste disposal taking into
account HIV/AIDS. At most of the health facilities there are severe logistic inadequacies
in terms of both human and material resources for health-care waste management.
(iii) The existing environmental management responsibilities and organisation are not
adequately addressed, although the awareness to do so exists as there is the unavailability
of sufficient resources for Health-care waste and environmental management. The effect
is the relegation of the focus on environmental management activities, inadequate
resource allocation for environmental management and effective integration of
environmental concerns into the entire Health-care delivery system.
(iv) There are limited training and capacity building resources
(v) Data on waste load generation at the various health institutions are however not
adequate. There are neither sufficient facilities nor reliable scientific methods in place
for health care waste load determination.
C.    POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS
The following are the potential environmental impacts:
(a)   Potential Contamination of Soil, Water, Air and Handlers of Hospital Waste
There is a high potential for infection and chemical contamination of soil, particularly
from liquid wastes flowing into soil.
11



Environmental Analysis of the Second Ploase of the .4THS-5 YRPOW(2002-2006)
The potential of contamination from untreated sharps, placenta, other body parts and
infectious wastes buried or dumped crudely. This may lead to entry of pathogens and
chemicals into the food chain.
(b)   Water and Groundwater Contamination
There is a high potential for infectious and chemical contamination of streams, rivers and
lakes from sources such as:
* Effluents from facilities flowing into gutters/drains and
* Run-off from soil during rains following dumping of infectious and chemical
wastes.
The potential for groundwater contamination from buried infectious wastes, sharps and
body parts is considerable.
(c.)  Contamination of Handlers
Waste handlers are not always aware of risks or do not have adequate protective clothing
and disinfectants. They are therefore exposed to a high potential for infection due needle
stick injuries from sharp objects, handling of infectious materials and body parts.
There is the need for selection of not only environmentally friendly but also human
friendly options to protect people from hazards (infection, chemical and ergonomic)
during the collection, handling, storing, transporting, treating and disposal of waste.
(d)   Soil Contamination and Groundwater Pollution
The use of landfill as a means of waste disposal in several health establishments in Ghana
is a common phenomenon. Even the teaching/specialist and regional hospitals, which are
deemed to be fairly resourced use dumping grounds (the word "landfill" is most often
erroneously used to refer to controlled dumping ground. This is not synonymous with the
well engineered/sanitary landfill site.) through the Municipal Waste Management
Assemblies to dispose off some categories of waste just like the District Health
establishments.
The potential impacts of the disposal in the dumping ground are the release of infectious
pathogens to the air and water or the risk of access by scavengers. Further, there is the
risk of subsequent disease transmission, either directly or indirectly through wounds,
inhalation, or ingestion, or indirectly through the food chain or pathogenic host species.
(e)   Impregnation and Re-Impregnation of Bednets-
From eco-toxicological considerations, deltamethrin, the active ingredient used in the
impregnation has some implications for the environment if not used properly especially
in high doses. Deltamethrin can induce skin sensations in exposed workers. There could
be non-fatal cases of poisoning following occupational  exposure when safety
precautions are not followed.
12



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-SYRPOWt2002-2006)
(f)   Impact of Wastewater Disposal
Wastewater from the Health-care establishments could contain potentially hazardous
components such as microbial pathogens, hazardous chemicals, pharrnaceuticals etc.
There are other related hazards such as cholera. Most of the Health-care establishments
in Ghana do not have sewerage treatment plants and or municipal sewer networks. The
disposal of wastewater from these health facilities finds their way into water bodies and
open public drains. These practice could cause the spread of dangerous diseases and
expose both humans and the natural ecology to epidemic threat and health risks.
(g)   Air Emissions
Few air emissions could be generated from healthcare activities and would be generated
from the sterilisation process (e.g. operating theatre). Other areas will be the catering and
laundry departments. These emissions may be in the form of vapour and smoke. Other
emissions could be generated from the incineration of waste either from open burning or
from the incineration.
(h)   Social Assessment
Among the 390 health facilities being covered by the project, 255 will be rehabilitated, 11
will be upgraded from centres to District hospitals, 81 are new constructions to be
undertaken under the Ministry of Health's programme and that land acquisition may be
necessary in relation to the new construction. As the exact locations are not known, the
Government is taking the precautionary measure to prepare a resettlement policy
framework in compliance with the World Bank Operational Policy 4.12 (Involuntary
settlement), see annex 2.
It is proposed that MOH carry out a social assessment with the objective to identify all
those areas and sites where there will be an impact on land, people and property and
access to resources due to expansion of health facilities.
In cases where land acquisition will cause adverse impact on people and property or
people's access to land or property, the resettlement and compensation procedures as
described in the resettlement framework will be applicable.
(D) PROPOSED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS MITIGATION
MEASURES
In view of the field observations made at some of the health facilities in the country,
consultations held with key persons and concerns of the relevant Departments and
Agencies, the following mitigation measures are proposed:
13



Environmental Analysis of the Second Plase of the MTHS-S YRPOY200 2-2006)
(a)   Policy Initiatives
The main trust of the policy recommendations covers an expedite completion of the
national health-care waste guideline, development of health-care waste management
policy and the establishment of collaboration between the HIV AIDS Project and health-
care waste management activities.
(i)   Completion of healthl-care waste guideline
The Envirormental Protection Agency (E P A) is in process of preparing guidelines as
basis for the segregation, packing, handling, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal
and  monitoring of Health-care waste. This is being done in  collaboration with
individuals, organisations, Ministries such as the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development, District and Municipal Assemblies, Sector
Agencies, and other relevant institutions.
An early completion and dissemination of the afore mentioned guideline provides a very
good foundation and the best strategy for addressing the potential environ-mental and
social impacts arising as a result of the MTHS and POW II. To facilitate an early
completion and dissemination of the guidelines, the Ministry of Health, which is a key
stakeholder institution and beneficiary of the output guideline document must be
supported financially as well the EPA so as facilitate their cooperation towards an early
completion of the document.
(ii) Development of healthl-care waste management policy
Upon completion of the guideline document a policy document and a technical guideline
would be required to complement any legislation enactment process. It is therefore
imperative that a policy document outlining the rationale for the appropriate legislation,
national goals and the key steps essential to the achievement of the goals.
(iii) Collaboration witht HIVAIDS Project on Waste Management
There are potential environmental and social impacts due to the expansion of health
facilities and basic health services particularly HIV AIDS. To mitigate these potential
impacts it is recommended that the waste management programme is designed to
collaborate with the National HIV AIDS project. Waste management activities could
later be linked to the Lagos-Abidjan Corridor HIV AIDS Project ( when it becomes
operational).
(b)   Health-care Waste Management
These health-care waste management improvement measures include the following:
*     There should be regulations, guidelines or effective means of control for the
storage, handling, packaging and transporting of hospital waste in Ghana.
*     There should be health education and training of staff with regard to the
management of medical waste.
14



EnvironmentalAnalysis of the Second Pliase of the faITHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
*     All forms of liquid waste which are drained into sinks should be eventually
channeled into the sewerage system. (e.g. acids and alkali should be
neutralized before disposal.)
*     Hospital and laboratory officials should be able to indicate quantities of
wastes generated.
.     Containers for hazardous/infectious waste should be properly labelled as a
caution to handlers.
*     Most hospitals/clinics should be provided with adequate waste treatment
facilities.
(c.)  Impregnation and re-impregnation of bed nets
For the impregnation and re-impregnation of bed nets, two recommendations arise:
(i)   that non-toxic and environmentally friendlier chemicals be used;
(ii)  training and public awareness building of user on how to dip their beds and
dispose of the used bed nets.
The MOH is aware of the new and less hazardous chemicals for the impregnation of bed
nets, so intended users are being better informed taking into account the increasing cost
implications but being much better suited for babies. This issue is being discussed with
WHO and UNICEF who are importing most of the bed nets into Ghana.
Further, the National Malaria Control Programme was developed by a partnership that
includes MOH, GSMF International, local and international Non Governmental
Organisations, Health Partners and the commercial sector. According to the Final Draft
Policy of February 27 2002 on Insecticide Treated materials (ITM) policy of the Ghana
National Malaria Control Programme a policy would soon be developed by National
Malaria Control Programme to spell out technical issues with regards to net/insecticides,
their usage and relevant roles of stakeholders, regulatory bodies and protection of
consumers. The Ministry of Health and other agencies shall train individuals to treat and
retreat the net and other materials as well as the disposal of the used nets. The MOH and
other agencies shall teach the proper disposal of insecticide residue following treatment.
Other cardinal considerations by the drafted policy regarding the use of the ITMs are:
(i)   The private sector and communities are essential partners who should be involved
in the planning and implementation process.
(ii)   Large-scale use of ITM should be a part of the vector control component within.
the national Malaria Control Programme.
The objectives of the drafted policy are:
* To increase the use of ITMs among the population especially in children under five
years and pregnant women
* To ensure the safety and effective use of the ITMs that are supplied, distributed and
used, and the proper disposal of insecticide.
* To increase the knowledge base on ITMs.
* To specify the roles for the various stakeholders
* To specify the mechanism for periodic review and possible revision of this policy
15



Environmental Analtsis of the Second Phase of the AtTHS-SYRPOW(2002-2006)
It is of interest to recommend to implementers of the policy of the Insecticide Treated
Materials policy to use more environmentally friendly WHO type III Chemicals, which
have comparative advantage in, terms of biodegradability, non toxic as well being non-
persistent. Above all should be cheaper for the pocket of the average Ghanaian.
(d)   Monitoring Plan
Effective control of Health-care waste and monitoring of facilities should be carried
out regularly, in order to maintain and improve management of the waste. Measures
should be adopted to ensure that problems and risks involved are identified while
enhancing safety and preventing the development of future problems.
E.     ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN
(i)   IMPA CTS AND MITIGATION MEASURES
The impacts summarized above in section C of the executive summary constitutes the
main problem area. The proposed mitigation measures are as stipulated in section D of
the executive summary.
(ii) PROPOSED INSTITUTIONAL FRA4MEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT
(a)   Institution Arrangements of a National Capacity Building Programme
Ministry of Health should collaborate with institutions such as EPA, Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development, District Assemblies and Municipal Assemblies in
the preparation of train the trainer activities, and competent institutions or centres for the
trainers programme to be identified. This will ensure an understanding of the
environmental issues. In particular, staff/workers must have an understanding of the
rationale for the recommended mitigation measures and monitoring programmes that they
may be implementing.
(b)   Training/Capacity Building Responsibilities
The infection Control Officer and the Environmental Health Officer should be given the
joint responsibility of training related to the segregation, collection, storage, and disposal
of Health-care waste. These Officers should ensure that staff at all levels are aware of
both the hospital waste management plan and policy and of their own responsibilities and
obligations in this regard.
(c.) Management Responsibilities
Presently, the institutional responsibility rests with the Public Health Department of the
District and Metropolitan Assemblies. There is the need to shift from this situation by
allocating a joint responsibility to include the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development and the Environmental Protection Agency. The
overall Strategic Management function should be the responsibility of the Ministry of
16



Environmental Anal ysis of tfle Second Phase of the MTHS-SYRPOW(2002-2006)
Health, which will formulate policy guidelines and provide general direction for
implementation.
(d)   Management Structure
There is the need for a management structure to run through all levels of the Ministry Of
Health. At each level, the components of the management structure should work in
collaboration with all other stakeholders such as the Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Employment and
Social Welfare, the Ghana Health Service, the Teaching Hospitals, the Environmental
Protection Agency and the District and Metropolitan Assemblies with a responsibility of
environmental management.
The suggested structure to run through the MOH should be as follows:
MOH-An Environmental Health Unit (EHU) should be responsible for policy and
general guidance. The EHU should have close links with the Public Health Units and
Occupational Health units of the Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME).
The functions of the EHU could be combined with policy functions related Occupational
Safety and Health. Additionally, the EHU should have a role in policy and review of
environmental and health assessment.
Ghana Health Service (GHS)- The GHS should have Units within the Public Health
Division to monitor implementation of environmental management within the Regions,
Municipalities and Districts.
Regional Hospitals- Should function under Public Health Units and provide guidelines
for environmental management.
District Hospitals- Should have environmental health officers.
Institutions (Departments and Agencies)-Should have environmental health officers.
Hospitals/Health Centres/Posts- To work with committees in institutions, Departments
and Agencies.
The day to day administration of Health-care waste and environmental management
should be the direct responsibility of a management committee to be headed by Medical
Officer-in-Charge.
(e)   Health-Care Waste Environmental Management Committee
Proper management depends on good administration and organisation, financing and
active participation of trained and informed staff. There is the need to form a Waste
Management Committee to develop the waste management plan. The committee shall
comprise the Medical Officer-in-Charge and several members as shown in Figure 4.
The functions of the committee shall be to;
Develop a waste management plan for the facility which will be integrated into the
daily operations of the health institution
* Ensure that all on-going projects have made room for waste disposal gadgets
* Consider and advise the management of health institutions on all aspects of Health-
care waste disposal within the health institutions
17



Environmental Analvsis of the Second Pliase of the MJTHS-5YRPOWf2002-2006)
*  Inspect Health-care waste generating points to ensure that waste is kept in accordance
with acceptable standards of environmental sanitation
*  Advise hospital management on measures to prevent endemics
The committee shall be responsible to the Chief Administrator/Head of Institutions while
the Public health Unit shall carry out day to day implementation of the plans.

1.0   INTRODUCTION
1.1   Background
Under the Ghana Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS), improving the health status of the
poor is crucial for poverty reduction, given that ill health is both a consequence and cause
of poverty-through lack of funds and knowledge to prevent illness, productivity and
income losses, etc. This strategic position of the Government is consistent with Ghana's
long term vision for growth and development as captured in Ghana Vision 2020
document.
The year 2001 is the terminal year for the first five year Program of Work (1997-2001) of
the Ministry of Health. A review of the implementation of the POW I by the Ministry of
Health as well as participatory assessments provides a number of recommendations for
poverty reduction. These include a strong emphasis on promoting equity of health
outcomes with a special focus on reducing geographical disparities and addressing
diseases that affect the poor most, enhancing efficiency in service delivery, ensuring
sustainable financial arrangements that protect the poor and strengthening links with
health-related sectors of society. An emphasis on district, sub-district and community
based quality are essential for reaching majority of the poor.
The development objective of the proposed Second Health Sector P.rogram Support
Credit is to support the Government of Ghana's health vision under the Ghana Poverty
Reduction Strategy, which has been formulated. The proposed credit would support the
Ministry of Health to implement its Medium Term Health Strategy (MTHS) and
corresponding 2002-2006 Program of Work (POW). To achieve the objectives defined in
the POW, the Second Health Sector Support Program Credit would finance a portion of
combined Government and external assistance budgets for policy development and
operational activities.
Programme Description
The programme is the second phase of phase of the Medium Term Health Strategy and
Programme of Work, 2002-2006. The programme involves infrastructure development
which will mainly focus on rehabilitation of existing facilities and only limited new
development in the deprived, low access areas of the country. In this regard the following
infrastructure development activities, which were not completed under phase I would be
undertaken:
•  Construction of 81 new health centres.
*  Rehabilitation of 198 health centres
*  Construction of 2 new district hospitals
*  Upgrading of 11 health centres to district hospitals
*  Rehabilitation of 28 district hospitals
*  Construction of 40 new district health management team offices.
*  Rehabilitation of 5 regional hospitals
20



Environmental Analysis of the Second P/rase ofthe MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
* Rehabilitation of 10 regional health management team offices
* Rehabilitation of 14 training institutions.
These activities would be financed by the Ministry of Health under it's second phase
programme of work, 2002-2006. The above programme activities constitutes the total
infrastructural development programme of the MOH, which the World Bank's credit
wouldfinance just part of it
An effective EIA system was established in Ghana when the Environmental Protection
Agency Act 490 was passed in December 1994. In the Act, section 2 (i) states one of the
functions of the Agency to be:
To ensure compliance with any laid down environmental impact assessment procedures
in the planning and execution of development projects, including, compliance in respect
of existing projects.
In 1999 the Environmental Assessment Regulations, LI 1652 was promulgated to give a
complete legal status to the Ghana Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedures.
The regulations require all significant impact scale developments to be subjected to
Environmental Impact Assessment. The overall objective of the legislation instrument is
to ensure that development activities are carried out or implemented in a sound and
sustainable manner, with the view to promoting sustainable investments and development
in Ghana.
According to the World Bank's safeguard policies, the Medium Term Health Strategy
and POW II falls under the project categories that require an environmental and social
impact assessment for program financing.
The World Bank, in complying with their safeguard policies as well as the Environmental
Legislations of Ghana have appointed two environmental consultants to a Task Manager
of the World Bank to undertake an Environmental Assessment of the Ministry of
Health's MTHS and POW II. This document therefore reports on the Environrmental
Assessment in accordance with the Terms of Reference in annex 1.
Reference the World Bank Operational Policy OP 4.12 and interactions made with the
World Bank Office, It became very necessary that a Resettlement Policy Framework is
prepared to cover the programme. Consequently, a Resettlement Policy Framework of
the MTHS and 5YR POW:2002-2006 Volume Two (2) has been prepared as a
supplementary Volume to this Environmental Assessment Report, Volume 1.
1.2   Purpose and Objectives of Study
The main objectives of the environmental and social analysis are to:
Assess any potential environmental and social impacts that could emanate from
investing in the expansion and improvement of basic health services delivery and
facilities through the implementation of MOH's MTHS and 2002-2006 POW.
21



Environme,tial Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5 YRPOtV(2002-2006)
>     Assist MOH in defining actions to mitigate the environmental and social adverse
effects of its activities.
>     Assist MOH in planning for the building up of its capacity on the longer term to
address health related environmental issues.
1.3 Scope of Work
The specific objectives to be achieved in line with the above main objectives of the
analysis are:
(i)   Assessing the potential environmental and social impacts due to the expansion of'
the health facilities and basic health services provisions, particularly HIV/AIDS,
road safety, nutrition, malaria control and water and sanitation and propose
mitigations as needed.
(ii)  Assessing the current status of health facilities and basic health services delivery
in the project area and making recommendations for improvement under the
proposed operation.
(iii)  Assessing the potential occurrence of any adverse effects on human health as
accidental infections from syringes and other medical appliances as well as
through handling and disposal of other liquid and solid medical wastes. Studying
how MOH and the Mission sector currently handle this accidental infections and
formulating recommendations for the near future.
(iv)  Assessing the likelihood of soil, water and body contamination from hospital'
waste (both solid and liquid); Studying how MOH, the mission and the private
sectors currently handle this contamination and formulating recommendations for
the near future.
(v)   Reviewing Ghana's National Environmental legislation, policies, regulations and
procedures with a focus on public health. In this context particular attention will
be paid to the country's legislation pertaining to the generation and disposal of
hospital waste. Formulating recommendations to MOH.
(vi)  In conjunction with the World Bank's relevant safeguard policies review Ghana's
land acquisition policies and any related issues of displacement and dislocation as
well as compensation payment if MOH would have to acquire land for hospital
infrastructure. Formulating recommendations to MOH which are in compliancc
with Operational Directive OP 4.12.
(vii)  Regarding the impregnation and re-impregnation of bed nets, assess any potential
adverse impacts on human and environrment; advance plans to mitigate the
problem of aerosol contamination and results of impregnation.
(viii)  Assessing the institutional arrangements within MOH and its capacity to address
environmental and social issues and provide recommendations and how to build-
22

up an appropriate environrnental and social capacity within the MOH. Suggesting
concrete solutions and practical actions (policies, regulations and guidelines, ME,
training, institutional responsibilities and networks etc) that should be put in place
to ensure that social and environmental concerns are fully considered and
potential impacts are identified, prevented and mitigated.
1.4   Field Work
As part of the methodology for the environmental analysis familiarisation visits were
undertaken to some selected health facilities within the scope of the MTHS and 5yr
POW.
In Accra, preliminary discussions were held with the Ministry of Health and the
consultants also participated in the Health Summit organized by the MOH on the MTHS
and 5YPOW prior to the visits. Extensive literature review of relevant project and policy
documents was also conducted.
The field visits provided the opportunity to achieve the following specific objectives
among others:
(i) Investigation on what was done on the expansion of health facilities under the first
phase of the 5yr POW (1997-2001) its implications and other related issues such land
acquisition and compensation payments.
(ii) Assessment of the current status of health facilities and basic health services delivery
and potential impacts with regard to:
* Accidental infections from syringes and medical appliances
* Generation, handling and disposal of liquid and solid wastes
* Soil, water and body contamination from waste disposal
* HIV/AIDS related issues
(iii) Collection of data on social impact indicators such as attendance, health delivery,
family planning, HIV/AIDS etc
(iv) Investigation of how the mission hospitals and private sector handle these potential
contaminants.
(v) Evaluation of existing environmental management responsibilities and
examination of institutional responsibilities and networks.
(vi) Assessment of the capacity building and training needs.

During the field visits the following general observations were made:
(i) Expansion works in certain areas are completed whilst others are on-going. For the 81
new facilities, for which land would be acquired, it is the policy and the practice of the
MOH is to use lands that are not being used by any group of people such as farmers,
firewood extractors etc or lands claimed by any tribe. The areas where these new health
facilities are to be provided are indicated in section 3.0.
(ii)The current status and potential impacts of the health facilities with regard to the
management practices in connection with accidental infections from syringes and medical
appliances; generation, handling and disposal of liquid and solid wastes; soil, water and
body contamination from waste disposal ; and HIV/AIDS related issues calls for much
attention. At most of the health facilities there are severe logistic inadequacies in terms
of both human and material resources for the Health-care waste management.
24



Environmental Anairsis ofthe Second Phase of the MTHS-5 YRPOW(2002-2006)
(iii)Attendance at the health facilities, provision of health delivery services such as family
planning, HIV/AIDS etc are quite encouraging.
(iv) The problems confronting the mission hospitals and private sector in terms of the
management of Health-care waste is not different from what is prevailing in the public
health institutions.
(v)The existing environmental management responsibilities and organisation are not
adequately addressed although the awareness to do so exists. The observation is that
environmental management issues are competing with the core Health-care management
functions. Another major problem is the unavailability of sufficient resources for Health-
care waste and environmental management. The effect is the relegation of the focus on
environmental management activities, inadequate resource allocation for environmental
management and effective integration of environmental concerns into the entire Health-
care service delivery. Presently, the institutional responsibility rests with the Public
Health Department. There is the need to shift from this situation by allocating a joint
responsibility to include the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development and the Environmental Protection Agency.
(vi) There is a significant gap for capacity building and training to provide the requisite
human resources. In most of the facilities visited there are no qualified environmental
management officers and team members. In order that environmental management
functions are properly prioritised and addressed, every health establishment need to have
a professionally trained environmental health personnel with the requisite team members.
The environmental health officer should be placed in a top level management position so
as to contribute effectively to management decision making.
25



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phtase of the MTHS-5 YRPOFV(2002-2006)
2.0 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROGRAMME
The proposed programme for which this Environmental Analysis is being conducted is
known as The Second Health Sector Five Year Programme of Work: 2002-2006. It is a
program which is intended to consolidate the gains made during the First Five Year
Programme of Work: 1997-2001 and apply the lessons learned to find new solutions.
The programme is the second phase of phase of the Medium Term 'Health Strategy and
Programme of Work, 2002-2006. The programme involves infrastructure development
which will mainly focus on rehabilitation of existing facilities and only limited new
development in the deprived, low access areas of the country. In this regard the following
infrastructure development activities, which were not completed under phase I would be
undertaken:
* Construction of 81 new health centres.
* Rehabilitation of 198 health centres
* Construction of 2 new district hospitals
*  Upgrading of 11 health centres to district hospitals
* Rehabilitation of 28 district hospitals
* Construction of 40 new district health management team offices.
* Rehabilitation of 5 regional hospitals
* Rehabilitation of 10 regional health management team offices
* Rehabilitation of 14 training institutions.
The program's overall goal is to help reduce health inequalities in Ghana- between North
and South, urban and rural areas, as well as inequalities linked to gender, education and
disability. For instance the northern regions' under-five mortality rates are 2.5-2.7
percent higher than those of Greater Accra Region, which is in the south of the country.
The increase in non-communicable diseases is adding to the existing burden of
communicable disease, leading to a possible "double burden of disease". This makes it
more difficult to ensure that the limited resources available will target public health
priorities, and that the vulnerable will not be excluded.
2.1   Priorities of the Programme
The government is determined to improve access and equity of access to essential health
care, and ensure that the health sector plays an essential role in the Ghana Poverty
Reduction Strategy. Key components of government policy include:
*  Deal with the HIV/AIDS threat, using the national HIV/AIDS control strategy;
* Shift from facility-based services by emphasizing community based care,
focusing on placing nurses in communities;
* Reduce financial barriers by abolishing the cash and carry system, thereby
ensuring that no one lacking funds at the time of need is denied essential health
care;
* Reform financing arrangements for the entire sector by replacing the requirement
to pay at the time of service with prepayment and insurance arrangements;
26



Environmental Analysis of the Second Plhase of the MTHS-SYRPOW'2002-2006)
*  Increase the use of nongovernmental and private health providers, reflecting the
government's focus on private sector led development;
* Emphasize control of Malaria, Tuberculosis (TB), and the elimination of Guinea
Worm, and strengthen reproductive, maternal and child health, and EPI services;
* Improve staff motivation and health worker incentives.
2.2   Scope of the Health Sector
The definition of the "health sector" has been expanded to include government health
services, private, traditional and nongovernmental providers, civil society, and
community groups. A well functioning health system also depends upon collaboration
and partnership with other ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) whose policies
and services have major impact on health outcomes.
The 5YPOW 2002-2006 comprises all the activities whose primary purpose is to
promote, restore or maintain health. Within these boundaries falls:
* Formal health service including individual clinical care;
* Traditional health care;
* Home care of the sick, estimated to account for about 60 percent of care;
. Public health activities, including health promotion, disease prevention,
environmental safety;
* Health related education, including actions to enhance girls' school enrolment;
* Information to improve better care giving actions.

3.0   DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA OF INFLUENCE
3.1   Programme Categories and Locations,
The programme is the second phase of the Medium Term Health Strategy and
Programme of Work, 2002-2006. The programme involves infrastructure development
which will mainly focus on rehabilitation of existing facilities and only limited new
development in the deprived, low access areas of the country. In this regard infrastructure
development activities, which were not completed under the  phase I  would be
undertaken. Below are the areas where the health facilities are to be rehabilitated,
extended, new ones constructed, their numbers and category.
These activities would be financed by the Ministry of Health under it's second phase
programme of work, 2002-2006. The above programme activities constitutes the total
infrastructural development programme of the MOH, which the World Bank's credit
would only finance part of it.

3.2    Existing Facilities Within The Health Sector
The ownership or providers of facilities within the sector has influenced to a large extent
the type and function of facilities currently available in the health sector. Facilities are
classified as being provided or owned by: Government; Quasi-Government and Private
(divided into 'for profit' and 'non-profit making')
Characteristics of each group are as follows:
i) Government - Facilities provided by government include those provided by the
Ministry of Health whose functions are based on the stepped care approach
At the primary Health care level, facilities provided include:
*     Health Centres and Posts- These are small clinics provided at the sub-district
level. Outpatient and minimal in-patient services are provided from the clinic and also
from outreach points in the community. The latter often comprise non-permanent
structures, which may be considered as simply providing a refuge from the vagaries of
the weather. They may be used as rarely as once a month.
* District Hospitals - These are bigger facilities which provide both out-patient and in-
patient care. Their capacity to provide in-patient care is much greater than obtains in the
health centres. These hospitals constitute the first point of referral for patients from the
health centres and posts.
Secondary level facilities are found in:
*  Regional hospitals- This constitutes the second level of referral ie patients from the
district hospital may be referred here.
The policy of the Ministry of Health has been to provide each district and region with a
district and regional hospital respectively.
ii) Quasi- Governmental - These are facilities provided by government establishments
outside the Ministry of Health e.g. the Police and Military Hospitals owned and run by
the Police Service and Armed Forces respectively. Others include the Trust Hospital in
Accra owned by the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) and the
V.R.A. Hospital owned by the Volta River Authority (V.R.A). Facilities owned by the
these quasi-governmental organizations provide services which tend to be at par with
those rendered in regional and in some instances with those in district hospitals. In some
35



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phlase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
instances, these may be supported by additional facilities in the form of small out-patient
clinics providing primary care with referral of complex cases to the hospital.
iii) Private - The third category of ownership consists of those organizations and
individuals who operate facilities for profit and those who do so on a non-profit bases.
The latter comprise mainly the Mission Hospitals and clinics run by some non-
governmental organizations. The former comprise most other out-patient clinics and
maternity homes found mostly in the cities and towns. A few 'for- profit' organizations
however own hospitals with facilities comparable to those in regional hospitals and
higher e.g. Nyaho clinic.
Most of the facilities run by the 'not for profit' sub-sector are hospitals. Many of these
(located in rural areas) have been designated as district hospitals where they are located
in districts which no government hospital.
3.3    Distribution of Facilities
Though historically, hospitals and clinics have been built in various locations in the
country by the MOH and other health providers with the general aim of providing out-
patient and in patient care for the population, there has not been a clear hospital policy
and strategy to guide the distribution of facilities until the development of a 'Hospital
Strategy' was initiated recently. This has resulted in an inequitable distribution of
hospitals, beds and health personnel throughout the country.
For example, while 55% of districts have their complement of one district hospital, 20
(18%) districts have two or more district type hospitals while 29 (26%) districts are
without hospitals.
The reasons for such a distribution have mainly been historical, eg preference of missions
for certain areas, political influences eg pressure from local politicians, opinion leaders
and chiefs and also the fact that the MOH has not engaged in a serious dialogue with
other providers on the citing of facilities.
3.4   Types Of Undertakings and Definitions
3.4.1  Sub-District Level Facilities
i.    Health Centres, Posts and Polyclinics
This group of facilities tends to be the smallest permanent facilities provided by
government in the health sector. Whilst health centres and posts are found notably in
small towns and villages, polyclinics tend to be located in urban areas. Generally, these
clinics operate on a 24 hour basis. They operate mainly on out-patient basis, but in
addition have a few beds for detaining patients after delivery and very ill patients for
observation.
Specific services provided include:
i) Preventive care e.g. immunizations, child welfare clinics, nutrition rehabilitation
36



Environmental Analsis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
ii)    Curative care e.g. treatment of minor ailments (communicable and non-
communicable) and injuries
iii)   Reproductive Health Services - Antenatal care, deliveries post-natal care and
Family Planning.
iv)   Minor Surgical Procedures eg. Incision and drainage of abscesses, excision of
lumps and bumps etc.
v)     Laboratory services - Basic microbiology/parasitology,clinical chemistry and
hematology.
3.4.2 Out-Patient Clinics
These facilities usually under private ownership provide primary care though a few
provide specialist services. They generally operate only during the day though some may
have facilities to detain patients for a few hours, referring critically ill patients to hospital
by the end of the day. Services provided include:
i)     Curative services
. Treatment of minor ailments (communicable and non-communicable) and
injuries.
* Minor Surgical procedures
(ii) Preventive Services - In some cases eg immunizations, antenatal care
(iii) Laboratory Services - Basic haematological and biochemical.
(iv) Specialist services - These are provided in a few of these facilities e.g.
Ophthalmologic services - Eye examinations and minor surgery
Dental services - minor oral surgical procedures including tooth extractions, fillings
and oral hygiene
* Orthopaedics - Fracture reductions, cast applications and minor surgery.
3.4.3 Small In-Patient Clinics/Hospitals
Ownership of these facilities tends to be by the private sector (for profit and not for
profit) This category of facilities are characterized by the provision of both out-patient
and in-patient services. They vary in terms of bed state as well as range of services
provided. Beds generally range from 2 to 50. Services provided include general out-
patient services, specialist services or a combination of these. They sometimes have
laboratories on site. Examples of specialist services provided such facilities in the private
sector are:
Gynaecology/obstetrics clinics
Maternity Homes
Psychiatric Clinics
* General Clinics/Hospitals
* Paediatric Clinics
37



Environmental Analysis of ihe Second Phase of the MTIHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
3.4.4 District Hospitals
The function of district hospitals is to provide clinical care for a population of 100,000 -
200,000 people in a clearly defined geographical area. It provides curative and preventive
health care for persons in the district.
Skills and competence employed in these facilities go beyond those found in the health
centres. 24 hour service provision is the norm. The number of beds range from 50 to 60
Typical district hospitals are provided by government, though some private facilities
particularly the missions, also provide similar facilities.
Specific services that are provided here include:
Clinical
i)     Treatment of minor ailments
ii)    Obstetrics and Gynaecology
iii)   Child health
iv)    Medicine
v)     Surgery including anesthesia. Major procedures unavailable at health centres

3.4.5 Regional Hospitals
Regional hospitals from a secondary level of care providing services to a geographically
well-defined area of a population of 1.5 - 2 million: They are meant to provide general
specialist care involving skills and competence not available at district hospitals and are
therefore the next level of referral from district hospitals. They provide both outpatient
and in-patient services. Beds number about 150. Teaching of nurses and medical
students also takes place. Ownership of such facilities tend to be by government. Some
mission hospitals have attained this size:
The services provided include
(a) General Clinical services in the following areas:
i)    Medicine

3.4.6  Teaching Hospitals
Teaching hospitals are centres of excellence and facilities for providing complex health
care. It has a higher concentration of resources and care here requires highly skilled
personnel and more complex technology than at the lower levels of care.  Such
institutions in addition to care rendered support the training of health workers both at the
pre-service and in-service and post-basic levels.
Beds in these hospitals are upwards of 200 beds.

3.4.7 Masterplan For The Expansion Programme / Compensation Plan
Construction works in certain areas are completed whilst others are on-going. For the 81
new facilities, for which land would be acquired, it is the policy and the practice of the
MOH is to use lands that are not being used by any group of people such as farmers,
firewood extractors etc or lands claimed by any tribe. The areas where these new health
facilities are to be provided are indicated in section 3.0.
The total estimated area of the land required for the construction of 81 health facilities is
about 64acres.
Where there will be adverse impact in the form of land acquisition, the process as
described in the resettlement policy framework will apply.

3.5    Potential Stakeholders
The potential stakeholders vary to the same extent that providers, beneficiaries and socio-
political influences vary. The key stakeholders include the following:
(i) The patients- They are the main focus of the programme, for which the main strategy
is to reduce the geographical inequality in health while addressing the gender and socio-
economic inequalities. The patients are also to be protected from potential health care
wastes.
(ii) Political Authorities - These vary with the level at which the facility is to be placed.
At the district level, the District Assembly and the District Health Council are key, while
at the regional level the Regional Administration's role is paramount both as a facilitator
and a decision maker.
Other political leaders as chiefs and opinion leaders also have a keen interest and wield a
lot of influence on decisions regarding the establishment and location of facilities.
(iii). Medical and Paramedical Professionals - This includes doctors, pharmacists nurses
and all other professionals and technicians including the support service personnel who
have a role to play in the running of the facilities.
(iv) Educational Institutions, Ministry of Education, the Universities, and other Training
Institutions involved in training health professionals, whose students are trained (either
partially or in full) using facilities of the hospitals or who have to provide funding for
training in these institutions are important stakeholders.
(v) Planning Authorities e.g. Town and Country Planning
(vi) Waste Management Authorities e.g. district assemblies, EPA etc
(vii) Other Regulatory bodies e.g. Private Hospitals and Matermity Homes Board,
Medical and Dental council, Nurses and Midwives Council etc. These are institutions
regulating the practice of medicine in health institutions.

3.6    Health-Care Waste Generation and Management Practices
3.6.1 Solid Waste
The Health-care wastes are generated from various sources. These sources can be
classified as major or minor. The Teaching/Specialist and the Regional hospitals form
the major sources.   Districts Hospitals, Polyclinics, Private Laboratories, Health
Centres/Post, Dental Clinics and Pharmacies form the minor sources. The composition of
the waste is often a characteristic of the type of source. For example, the operating
theatres and surgical wards generate mainly anatomical waste such as tissues, organs,
body parts and other infectious waste.
43



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the !THS-51'RPOW(2002-2006)
Solid waste generation depends on numerous factors, such as established waste
management methods, type of health-care establishments, the proportion of patients
treated on a daily basis and the level of complexity and degree of specialisation of the
health facility. Hence, the Teaching Hospitals generate larger quantities of waste per unit
than other facilities.
Data on waste load generation at the various health institutions are however not
adequate. There are not sufficient facilities and reliable scientific methods in place for
health care waste load determination.
3.6.2 Liquid Wastes
Liquid waste generated include excreta, bath water from wards and waste water from
laboratories (specimens, reagents etc), operating theatres and mortuaries. Some have
highly infectious potential. Excreta is channelled into septic tanks that are emptied
periodically or into various types of treatment plants. Most of the other liquid waste are
poured down the drains of sinks and flow into gutters which enter the external sewerage
system ending up in water bodies draining the area. In some cases (particularly in the
rural areas where plumbing facilities are rudimentary) some of these liquid waste end up
on the ground or on plants in the vicinity of the facilities.
3.6.3 Air Emissions
Few air emissions are generated from healthcare activities. They tend to be generated
from the sterilisation process in (e.g. operating theatre) by far generates most of the
emissions. Other areas are the catering and laundry departments. This emission may be
in the form of vapour and smoke. Other emissions are also generated secondly from the
incineration of waste either from open burning or from the incineration.
3.7    Classification of Wastes
Reconnaissance visits conducted by the consultants to some selected health facilities as
listed in table 2 revealed the following classification of Health-care waste in Ghana based
on the point of generation, method of storage and the treatment options available by the
health establishments:

3.8    Segregation of waste
3.8.1 Solid Wastes
There are several classifications available for solid wastes. That used by the World
Health Organization (WHO) classifies solid wastes into categories: namely general,
infectious, pathological, sharps, pharmaceuticals, chemical, radioactive waste, and
pressurized containers. Apart from the general wastes, all others may be classified as
hazardous.
In practice, there are waste segregation policy nor well-defined system for segregation of
the wastes into various categories. As a result of some of the sensitisation to infection
control practices, of health workers, most institutions now segregate some categories of
waste (sharps, needles and syringes) from the rest of the waste. Pathological waste in the
form of placenta and body parts are also separated from the rest of the waste in most
facilities.
The receptacles for the segregated waste are also non-uniform. Needles and syringes
discarded after immunisation are collected into specially designed UNICEF boxes. In the
Out-patient clinic and wards where these boxes are not available, many institutions use
improvise boxes with holes at the top.
Others drop the needles into plastic "Frytol oil" bottles containing bleach while adding
syringes to general waste. In order instances all the sharps are combined with the general
waste. These practices may all be occurring within the same facility suggesting non-
uniformity in segregating waste.
47



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the AITHS-5YRPO1V(2002-2006)
3.9   Treatment of Waste
3.9.1  Chemical Dis-infection
Used in some facilities for treating pathological waste in the form of placenta tissue prior
to burial. Few institutions chemically disinfect needles before burning or burial. Not
applied to vaccine vials which are either burnt or dumped crudely.
3.9.2 Sterilisation
Dis-infection by autoclave available in larger facilities and not for waste but for re-
useable items e.g. instruments, theatre linings etc. In rural facilities where there may be
no autoclaves, steam dis-infection by boiling is often employed-not so effective as
temperatures reached are not up to the required 1200C attained in autoclaving.
3.10  Waste Disposal Practices
3.10.1 Burial Pathological Waste
Placentas are usually buried. Sometimes the hole is very shallow with high potential of
being dug up by birds and animals. Innovative septic tanks reducing potential for the
tissues to be dug up are created in few facilities e.g. Akosombo and Atua Hospitals.
Other body parts (e.g. amputated limbs etc) are incinerated where incinerators are
available or buried.
3.10.2 Incineration
Modern and efficient incinerators are available only in large health centres e.g. Korle-Bu
and Komfo-Anokye Teaching Hospitals. Other incinerator e.g. UNICEF type are used
for needles and syringes after immunisations. They are efficient but have small capacity
thus reducing efficiency when wastes from entire districts are incinerated.
Improvised incinerators e.g. open metal drum  with wire mesh in middle.  Waste
ampoules and needles are placed on the mesh and fire set to it from below. They are
quite effective, but are associated with considerable air pollution.
Open burning is applied to sharps and other infectious wastes. In rural districts with no
municipal waste management systems, the open burning is applied to general wastes.
3.10.3 Disposal at Dumping Grounds through Municipal Authorities
Method employed for most of the solid waste i.e. infectious, general, pharmaceutical and
in some cases, sharps.
Currently, the dumping grounds are not engineered to serve as sanitary landfill sites.
They therefore constitute high potential for the spread of infections through run offs
during rains and contamination of underground water.
48



Environmental Analysis of tle Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
3.10.4 Disposal of Liquid Waste
Excreta are channelled into septic tanks and emptied often or into treatment plants- e.g.
The 37 Military Hospital in Accra and an uncompleted one at the Central Regional
Hospital in Cape-Coast.
Other liquid wastes are emptied into sinks and drains thereby entering natural drainage
systems. In some cases, liquid wastes are discharged into bushes/ground and may enter
water bodies draining the area.
3.11  Potential Contamination of Soil, Water, Air and Handlers of Hospital Waste
3.11.1 Solid Waste
There is a high potential for infection and chemical contamination of soil, particularly
from liquid wastes flowing into soil.
The potential of contamination from untreated sharps, placenta, other body parts and
infectious wastes buried or dumped crudely. This may lead to entry of pathogens and
chemicals into food chain.
3.11.2 Water and Groundwater Contamination
There is a high potential for infectious and chemical contamination of streams, rivers and
lakes from sources such as:
*  Effluents from facilities flowing into gutters/drains and
* Run-off from soil during rains following dumping of infectious and chemical
wastes.
The potential for groundwater contamination from buried infectious wastes, sharps and
body parts is considerable.
3.11.3 Contamination of Handlers
Waste handlers are not always aware of risks or do not have adequate protective clothing
and disinfectants. They are therefore exposed to a high potential infection following
needle stick injuries from sharps, handling of infectious materials and body parts.
There is the need for selection of not only environmentally friendly but also human
friendly options to protect people from hazards (infection, chemical and ergonomic)
during collection, handling, storing, transporting, treating and disposal of waste.
3.12  Impregnation and Re-Impregnation of Bednets
Impregnation and re-impregnation of bednets are done at some selected District Health
Centres throughout the country using "K-O TAB". This product, an insecticide contains
Deltamethrin (pyrethroid) as the active ingredient. A tablet of 1.6g of'K-O TAB"
49



Environmental Analisis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
contains 0.4g Deltamethrin (pyrethroid) 0.4g/1.6g tablet (250g/kg). This insecticide is
distributed in Ghana by Agri- Mat Ltd.
The treatment of bednets with the insecticide is not done at the hospitals, but rather at the
District Health Administration Offices or in the homes of the users.  The bednet
impregnating process is very simple. It involves the following sequence of steps:
i.    filling the plastic bag (that came with the treatment kit) up to the black line
with water;
ii.   Pouring the water into the bowl and drop the tablet in it;
iii.  Pushing the net into the solution and
iv.   Drying of the net in air but not in the sun
3.12.1 Effects of Deltamethrin on Humans and the Environment
Deltamethrin is highly toxic for fish and aquatic invertebrates. The 96-h LC50 for fish
ranges between 0.4 and 2.0 pg/litre, while the 48-h LC50 for Daphnia is 5pg/litre.. Some
kills of aquatic invertebrates occur in the field, but usually there is rapid compensation.
Deltamethrin has very low toxicity to birds. The LD50 values (single oral dosing) are
>1000 mg/kg. Under laboratory conditions, deltamethrin is highly toxic for honey bees,
but in practice the hazard to bees is low. Although the contact LD50 is 0.051 pg/bee, in
field trials and practical use, bees tend to avoid deltamethrin.In a non-aqueous solvent,
deltamethrin has a high to moderate acute oral toxicity. The LD50 values (non-aqueous
solvents) are 19-34 mg/kg in mice and 31-139 mg/kg in rats, but deltamethrin is far less
toxic when suspended in water (LD50 values >5000 mg/kg in rats). Deltamethrin is a
type II pyrethroid. Clinical signs include tremor, salivation, and convulsions.. Single
applications of technical deltamethrin in rabbits do not irritate intact or abraded skin, but
have a transient irritating effect on their eyes whether or not the eyes are rinsed.
Deltamethrin is not a skin sensitizer in guinea-pigs.
When rats were dosed by gavage with deltamethrin (up to 10 mg/kg body weight per day
for 13 weeks), hyperexcitability occurred in males after 6 weeks at the highest dose. In
males fed 2.5 or 10 mg/kg, body  weight gain was reduced. Deltamethrin is not
mutagenic in a variety of in vivo and in vitro test systems that include: DNA repair,
gene mutation, chromosomal   aberration, sister chromatid exchange, micronucleus
formation, and  dominant lethal tests.
Deltamethrin can induce skin sensations in exposed workers. There have been several
non-fatal cases of poisoning following occupational exposure when safety precautions
were not followed. Vertigo and numbness, itching, tingling, and burning of the skin have
been   frequently reported. Occasionally, a transient papular or blotchy erythema has
been described. Most of these symptoms were transient and disappeared within 5 to 7
days. No long-term adverse effects have been reported. Three non-fatal cases of
deltamethrin poisoning after the ingestion of several grams of the product have been
described.
Human Health Hazards,
Deltamethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide with a high to moderate acute oral
toxicity. The LD50 values in mice range from 19-34 mg/kg. In rats, the LD50 values
50



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006).
range from 31-139 mg/kg in non-aqueous vehicle, but it is much less toxic in suspension
in water,   having LD50 values of >5000 mg/kg Deltamethrin is a moderate acute
hazard. There have been several  non-fatal cases of poisoning during occupational
exposure when safety  precautions were not followed. Severe headaches, dizziness,
fatigue, nausea, and anorexia, together with transient changes in the EEG, have been
reported. In a severe case, there were tremors and convulsions. There was complete
recovery in all cases. Deltamethrin is very toxic for fish, aquatic invertebrates, and honey
bees, but due to the very low exposure levels that usually occur, it will only cause a
problem if spilled. Deltamethrin has a low toxicity
to birds.
3.12.2 Plans to Mitigate Effects of impacts of Insecticide Treated Materials use on
Malaria by National Malaria Control Programme, Ghana
For the impregnation and re-impregnation of bed nets, two recommendations arise:
(i)   that non-toxic and environmentally friendlier chemicals be used;
(ii)  training and awareness building of user on how to dip their beds and dispose of
the used bed nets.
The MOH is aware of the new and less hazardous chemicals for the impregnation of bed
nets, so intended users are being better informed taking into account the increasing cost
implications but being much better suited for babies. This issue is being discussed with
WHO and UNICEF who are importing most of the bed nets into Ghana.
From eco-toxicological considerations, deltamethrin, the active ingredient used in the
impregnation has some implications for the environment if not used properly especially
in high doses. According to Final Draft Policy of February 27 2002 on Insecticide
Treated materials (ITM) policy of the Ghana National Malaria Control Programme a
policy would soon be developed by National Malaria Control Programme to spell out
technical issues with regards to net/insecticides, their usage and relevant roles of
stakeholders, regulatory bodies and protection of consumers. The Ministry of Health and
other agencies shall train individuals to treat and retreat the net and other materials. The
MOH and other agencies shall teach the proper disposal of insecticide residue following
treatment and also on how to dispose of the used nets. Other cardinal considerations by
the drafted policy regarding the use of the ITMs are:
(1) The private sector and communities are essential partners who should be involved in
the planning and implementation process.
(11) Large-scale use of ITM should be a part of the vector control component within the
national Malaria Control Programm.
The objective of the drafted policy are:
* To increase the use of ITMs among the population especially in children under five
and pregnant wommen
* To ensure the safety and effective of the ITMs that are supplied, distributed and used,
and the proper disposal of insecticide.
To increase the knowledge base on ITMs.
To specify the roles for the various stakeholders
* To specify the mechanism for periodic review and possible revision of this policy
51



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
Recommendation for impregnation of bed nets
It is of interest to recommend to implementers of the policy of the Insecticide Treated
Materials policy to use more environmentally friendly WHO type III Chemicals, which
have comparative advantage in, term of biodegradability, non toxic as well being non-
persistent. Above all should be cheaper for the pocket of the average Ghanaian.

4.0 DESCRIPTION OF LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND ADMINISTRATIVE
FRAMEWORKS
4.1   Healthy Public Policy
Ghana's current environmental policies and legal framework are in tune with global and
international principles. These principles include:
• The Basel Convention which is concerned with trans-boundary movements of
hazardous wastes including Health-care waste;
* The "Polluter Pays Principle, which implies that all producers of waste are legally
and financially responsible for the safe and environmentally sound disposal of the
wastes they produce.
• The "Precautionary" principle, which is concerned with the adoption of measures to
protect health and safety when the magnitude of the particular risk is uncertain.
* The "Proximity" principle which posits that, disposal of hazardous waste including
Health-care waste should take place at the closest possible location to its source in
order to minimise the risks involved in its transport.
There are a number of relevant government policies that are essential and give direction
to the effective management of Health-care waste in the country. The tone for guiding
healthy public policies is determined by the constitution of the Republic of Ghana (1 992)
which guarantees the right to public health to every citizen of Ghana. This policy has
also been re-echoed by the national long-term vision (Ghana Vision 2020), which aims at
making Ghana a middle-income country by the year 2020.
Other policies related to the promotion of a healthy environment include the
Environmental Policy that seeks to guide development in accordance with environmental
quality requirements to prevent, reduce and as far as possible, eliminate pollution an
nuisances.
The National Environmental Sanitation Policy (1992) also requires all health institutions
to establish institutional waste management systems for the primary storage wastes. The
health institutions are required to pre-treat Health-care waste (e.g. by autoclaving) prior
to storage. The policy further states that District Assemblies shall provide separate
collection of hazardous and Health-care waste. Transport of such waste shall be in closed
no-compaction vehicles which should be cleaned and/or disinfected at the end of every
collection day.
4.2 Legal Provisions
National legislation is the basis for improving health-care waste practices in any country.
It establishes legal controls and permits the national agency responsible for the disposal
of Health-care waste to ensure their implementation.
Currently, there is no specific legislation, regulations or bye-laws for the management of
Health-care waste in the country. Ghana is also yet to have a Public Health Act. There
53



Environmental Analvsis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5 YRPORY2002-2006)
are however, laws and regulations pertaining to the protection of the environment and
health.
These include:
1. Local Government Act 462 (1993)
2. Town and Country Planning Ordinances Cap 84 (1944)
3. Ghana Building Regulations LI. 1630 (1997)
4. Vaccination Ordinance Cap 76
5. Quarantine Ordinance Cap 77
6. Mosquito Ordinance Cap 75
7. Infectious Disease Ordinance
8. Food and Drugs law 305b (1992)
9. Environment Protection Act 490 (1994)
10. Environmental Assessment Regulation 1652 (1999)
11. Criminal Code Act 29 (1960)
12. Mortuaries and Funeral Facilities Act 563 (1998)
4.3   Institutional Framework
The Ministry of Health (MOH) is the main Ministry responsible for preventive health
services in the country. The Ministries of Environment and Science, and the Ministry of
Local Government and Rural Development also play complimentary roles in the
promotion and improvements in health-care services.
The Medium Term Health Strategy of MOH provides a framework for development in
the health sector within the framework of "Vision 2020". This document identifies the
roles of households, communities NGO's the Private Sector, the donor community and
the different sectors of government in the provision and financing of health. To
operationalise the Medium Term Strategy document, a second phase 5 year programme
of work has been prepared. The document prioritises seven health service intervention
for the next five years (2002 - 2007). These include prevention and control of infections
with epidemic potential and health protection and promotion (e.g. hygiene and'
sanitation).
4.4   Relevant Legislation Enacted
One of the strategies set out in the MTHS was to strengthen the regulatory systems within
which the health services are to ensure more effective implementation of the programmet
The relevant legislation relating to this objective is the Ghana Health Services and
Teaching Hospitals Act, 1996 Act 525. The main principle underlying this act is thg
separation of policy from implementation. Whilst the MOH as the agency responsible to
government for the health of the nation and remains the policy making body on health !
this law establishes the Ghana Health Service (GHS) and Teaching Hospitals Boards as
executing agencies. It provides for the management of institutions in the Health Service
and Teaching Hospitals respectively.
In addition, it provides guidelines on financial management of both the Ghana Health
Service and the Teaching Hospitals.
54



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of tle A'ITHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
The promulgation of this act led to the repealing of the Hospital Administration Law
1998 (P.N.D.C.L. 209).
In conformity with this act, a governing council for the GHS has been established and
members appointed. The Director-General and Deputy Director General have also been
appointed.
A Ministerial Oversight Committee has been commissioned to ensure a smooth transition
from the Ministry of Health to the GHS, to strengthen the Teaching Hospital Boards
which are already in operation and to ensure arrangements are in place for the effective
functioning of the MOH.
4.5   Responsibility For Management Of Health-care waste
The overall responsibility for the management of Health-care wastes in the health
institutions rests with the Public Health Units. The Ministry of Health set up the Public
Health Units to be responsible for all public health activities in hospitals. Each health
institution then established a Health-care waste management committee to supervise,
advise and monitor the performance of the Public Health Unit of the Waste Control
Manager.
In smaller hospitals, clinics and laboratories, a Waste Control Manager is appointed to
handle the waste
4.6   General Overview Of Health-care waste Management Process
The basic elements in the management of Health-care waste is shown in Figure 1. In
order for the health institution to effectively manage its waste, it must have the support
of the Director of Medical Services or the Medical Officer in-charge of the health
institution. At the Director's initiative, and through his/her assignment of management
responsibilities, accountability and reporting would established.

5.0   METHODS AND TECHNIQUES USED IN ASSESSING AND
ANALYSING THE IMPACTS
5.1   Methodology
5.1.1  Restatement of major environmental analysis objective
Assessment of the Environmental and Social Impacts of the Ministry of Health's
Medium-Term Strategy (MTHS) and corresponding Program of Work (POW).
5.1.2 Environmental Analysis Design
The category of methodology adopted is the descriptive type. This type is the most
suitable since the main purpose of the analysis is to provide an environmental and social
impacts perspective of the Medium Term Health Sector Support project and POW.
The main objectives of the environmental and social analysis are to:
>  Assess any potential environmental and social impacts that could emanate from
investing in the expansion and improvement of basic health services delivery and
facilitate through the implementation of MOH's MTHS and 2002-2006 POW.
> Assist MOH in defining actions to mitigate the environmental and social adverse
effects of its activities.
t Assist MOH in planning for the building up of its capacity on the longer term to
address health related environmental issues.
Other reasons for deciding to employ the descriptive approach includes the fact that an
exploratory descriptive studies can be less expensive, relatively easy to implement and
able to yield results in a fairly short period of time.
5.1.3 Key Variables and Concepts
The scope of the environmental analysis covers the provision of health-care services such
as Childhood killer diseases, Malaria control,  Waterborne diseases-guinea worm,
HIV/AIDS, nutrition, road safety etc. The key variables of concern defined and
evaluated as part of the environmental analysis are as follows:
*: Definition and characterisation of health-care waste
* Health impacts of health-care waste
*: Legislative, regulatory, and policy aspects
* Waste minimisation, recycling and reuse
* Handling, storage and transportation of health-care waste
* Treatment and disposal technologies for health care waste
* Application of treatment and disposal methods to health-care waste categories
* Collection and disposal of wastewater
* Costs related health-care waste management
*: Health and safety practices for health-care personnel and waste workers
56



Environmen,tal Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-SYRPOW(2002-2006)
* Emergency response
* Hospital hygiene and infection control
Training
Another vital area of concern is the potential impacts of the MTHS and POW II in
circumstances where expansion works are to be undertaken. In order to quantify the
potential impacts and develop the relevant mitigation measures the following issues were
considered:
*: Pre-constructional phase social impacts
+* The resettlement policy framework will be applicable where land acquisition is
necessary.
Constructional Phase impacts
Environmental Impacts: Solid wastes such as construction wastes, dust,
Operational Phase Impacts
Environmental impacts: Solid and liquid wastes generation; disposal, transportation,
soil contamination, accidental infections from syringes and other medical appliances;
hospital waste generation and management; soil, water and body contamination from
hospital wastes, impregnation and re-impregnation of bed nets
Social impacts
*: Removal of geographical inequalities, management of drugs, institutional
collaboration, Environmental management Capacity . The resettlement policy
framework will be applicable where land acquisition is necessary.
5.1.4 Relationship between Variables
Data collection tools were developed to gather data on the variables identified in section
5.1.3. The data gathered were intended to establish impacts that could be attributed to
the Health Sector Support Program and to provide a picture of what the situation of the
subject matter of concern is in the health institutions in Ghana.

General Characteristics of the Study Population
The study populations, for the purposes of this research are referred to as health
institutions in Ghana. The population is broadly categorized into three main groups,
namely:
(i) Ministry of Health, which comprises of:
Tertiary/Teaching/Specialist Hospital.
Regional Hospitals.
District Hospitals.
* Health centres/Clinics
* Community Clinics/Maternal and Child Health Centres
(ii)  Private Sector Hospitals and
(ii)  Mission Hospitals
5.1.5 Sampling Design and Procedures
The methods of sampling used involved a combination of non-probability sampling,
stratified sampling, convenience sampling, and purposive sampling and snowball effects.
5.1.5.1 Geographical Dimension of study population.
The targeted populations are health institutions in Ghana, which are categorized as MOH,
Mission Hospitals and the Private Sector.
5.1.5.2 Instruments, tools for measuring variables and questionnaires
In order to meet the objectives of the research we collected primary data and analysed.
The   instruments  and  tools   used  were   mainly  interviews,  consultations,
questionnaires(annex 1), checklists and literature such as the terminal reports on the first
phase of health sector support program. The questionnaires were the structured
interviewed type consisting of both closed and opened questions.  This type of
questionnaire allowed us to physically meet the respondents and ask questions face to
face.  This approach yielded a higher response rate whilst ensuring validity and
reliability.
The questionnaire was designed in a manner to explore what is prevailing in the health
institutions in Ghana regarding the issues identified in section 5.1.3 among others.

6.0 CONSULTATIONS WITH PEOPLE AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED
PROJECT
The various institutions, organisations, Ministries, Departments and Agencies,
individuals and stakeholders consulted are:
6.1   Ministry of Health
The Ministry of health was contacted for a number of issues:
> Background information on the MTHS and 5YPOW, the details of what was done
during the first phase (MTHS and 5YPOW 1996 to 2001) and what is envisaged
for the second phase (MTHS and 5YPOW 2002-2006).
> Introductory letters was obtained from the Director of Medical Services to all
areas that were visited to facilitate the administration of questionnaires.
> Policy issues were also obtained from top personnel of the Ministry.
>  Relevant literatures were also obtained from the Ministry.
6.2   Ministry of Lands and Forestry
The Ministry of lands and Forestry was contacted on land acquisition procedures. They
intend directed the consultants to Land lands Commission and Land Evaluation Board
6.3   The Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development
This Ministries were contacted on the role the District and Municipal Assemblies are
playing in the environmental management. The municipal assemblies are responsible for
the disposal of the hospital waste and their concerns were sought.
6.4   Lands Commission
The Lands Commission coordinates with relevant public agencies and govemment bodies
to perform functions such as:
On behalf of the government, manage public lands and any land vested in the president
by 1992 constitution or by another law or any land is vested with the Commission.
> Advise the government, local Authorities and Traditional Authorities on the
policy framework for the development of particular area of Ghana to ensure that
the development of individual piece of land is coordinated with the relevant
development plan for the area concern.
- Formulate and submit to government on national policy with respect to land use
and capability.
> Advise on and assist in the execution of a comprehensive programme for the
registration of title to land throughout Ghana.
With reference to these constitutional functions of the Lands Commission, consultations
on issues within their jurisdiction have been made and their inputs have informed the
relevant recommendations made under this study.
60



EnvironmentalAnalysis of tIhe Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
6.5   Lands Valuation Board
Article 20 clause 2 stipulates that compulsory acquisition of property by the State shall be
made under a law which makes provision for the prompt payment of fair and adequate
compensation. The Lands Valuation Board is the body that determines what is the
appropriate compensation payable for any landed property compulsorily acquired by the
State. The Lands Valuation Board was therefore consulted for modalities of claims and
compensation payments.  In instances where there are discrepancies between the
Ghanaian law and the World Bank Policies, the World Bank policy apply. Compensation
rates, eligibility  and valuation criteria are described in the resettlement policy
framework.
6.6   Environmental Protection Agency
The establishment of an effective EIA system received formal support when the
Environmental Protection Agency Act 490 was passed in December 1994. In the Act,
section 2 (i) states one of the functions of the Agency is to ensure compliance with any
laid down environmental impact assessment procedures in the planning and execution of
development projects, including, compliance in respect of existing projects.
In 1999 the Environmental Assessment Regulations, LI 1652 was promulgated to give a
complete legal status to the Ghana Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Procedures.
The regulations require all significant impact scale developments to be subjected to
Environmental Impact Assessment.
The EPA ACT,1994 ACT 490 also empowers the EPA with regulatory functions and
development of Environmental Standards and Guidelines. In pursuance of these statutory
functions, the EPA has been developing a guideline on bio-medical waste to enable
hospital administrators, engineers, environmental health officers and other para-medical
professionals to be aware of the requirements for the proper and safe management of bio-
medical waste.
Cognisance of the Statutory role EPA and their goal to extend sound biomedical waste
management practices into the health sector in Ghana, the EPA was consulted and their
contributions has significantly informed the undertaking of this environmental analysis.
6.7   Health Institutions
The health institutions namely the teaching hospitals, the regional hospitals, the District
Hospitals, the Mission Hospitals, the private Hospitals and the Health Centres/Posts are
the major constitutes the subjects of the environmental analysis. In this respect field
visits and consultations to some selected health facilities within the scope of the MTHS
and Syr POW was undertaken. The visits and the consultations provided the opportunity
to achieve the following specific objectives among others:
61



Environmental Analvsis of the Second Phase of tie TI-HS-SYRPOWf(2002-2006)
(i) Investigate what was done on the expansion of health facilities under the first phase of
the 5yr POW (1997-2001).
(ii) Assess the current status and potential impacts of health facilities with regard to:
* Accidental infections from syringes and medical appliances
* Generation, handling and disposal of liquid and solid wastes
* Soil, water and body contamination from waste disposal
*  HIV/AIDS related issues
(iii) Collect data on social impact indicators such as attendance, health delivery, family
planning, HIV/AIDS etc
(iv) Investigate how the mission hospitals and private sector are handling this potential
contaminants
(v) Evaluate existing environmental management responsibilities and organisation.
Examine institutional responsibilities
(vi) Assess the capacity building and training needs
6.8   Metropolitan Authorities & District Health Administrations
Ghana has a system of local government and an administration, which is as far as
practicable decentralized. The District Assemblies and Metropolitan Authorities are the
highest political authorities in the districts and they have the deliberative, legislative and
executive powers. The functions of these local authorities include the formulation and
execution of plans, programmes and strategies for the effective mobilization of resources
necessary for the overall development of the districts.
More importantly, the management and final disposal of wastes at landfill sites or into
sewerage systems is the responsibility of the district and the metropolitan assemblies.
An effective management of health-care waste in Ghana cannot be possible without a
deep involvement and participation of the assemblies. The concerns of some of the
District and Metropolitan Assemblies have been sought and factored into this document.

7.0 POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THE
PROPOSED PROJECT
7.1   Pre-Constructional Phase Impacts
In circumstances where expansion works are to be undertaken under the MTHS and
POW II the site will need to be subject to environmental assessment. That assessment
will also identify social and land issues such as land acquisition and potential need for
resettlement and compensation.
7.2   Constructional Phase impacts
Constructional activity at the site will involve mainly the clearing of the plot, digging,
sand, stone, and cement transfer to the site, and mortar and concrete mixing. These would
be followed by transportation of the equipment and machines to the site and subsequent
installation.
7.2.1 Safety
There would be possible conflicts between constructional activities and the current land
uses. The constructional phase would be characterized by transfer of prefabricated
materials, equipment/machinery and convey of workers to the site. These activities would
affect the already heavy vehicular movement of trucks and cars on highway. There would
be possibility of constructional occupational related accidents resulting from lack of
measures to meet constructional occupational hazards e.g. workers falling from heights,
dropping working implements to main themselves and others.
7.2.2 Dust generation / Air pollution
Construction will generate dust as trucks move up and down on the cleared project site.
In moving soils and materials that are to be discarded from the site to their dumping
grounds dust would be introduced into the atmosphere.
7.2.3 Noise
The various constructional activities including moving of heavy construction vehicles and
equipment may generate noise.
7.2.4 Waste
During the constructional stage waste would be generated in the form of debris and
topsoil from constructional activities. These would be carried away from the site by
trucks.
63

OPERATIONAL PHASE IMPACTS
Occupational Safety and Health
7.3   Potential Impacts of Health-care Waste
Health-care waste includes a large component of general waste and smaller proportion of
hazardous waste. This section addresses the potential hazards of exposure to hazardous
(or risk) health-care waste.
7.3.1 Types of Hazards
Exposure to hazardous health-care waste can result in disease or injury. The hazardous
nature of health-care waste may be due to one of the following characteristics:
*  It contains infectious agents;
*  It is genetoxic;
*  It contains toxic or hazardous chemicals or pharmaceuticals;
*  It is radioactive;
*  It contains sharps.
7.3.2  Persons at Risk
All individuals exposed to health-care waste are potentially at risk, including those within
the health-care establishments that generate hazardous waste, and those outside the these
sources who either handle such waste or are exposed to it as a consequence of careless
management. The main groups of risk are the following:
.  medical doctors, nurses, health-care auxillaries, and hospital maintenance
personnel;
*  patients in health-care establishments or receiving home care
*  visitors to health-care establishments;
*  workers in support services allied to health-care establishments, such as laundries,
waste handling, and transportation;
*  workers in waste disposal facilities (such as landfills or incinerators) including
scavengers.
7.3.3  Hazards from infectious waste and sharps
Infectious waste may contain any of a great variety of pathogenic organisms. Pathogens
in infectious waste may enter the human body by a number of routes:
•  through a puncture, abrasion, or cut in the skin;
*  through the mucous membranes;
*  by inhalation;
*  by ingestion.
Examples of infections that can be caused by exposure to health-care waste are listed in
table 3, together with the body fluids that are the usual vehicles of transmission.
64



EnvironmentalAnalvsis of tie Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOWy(2002-2006)
There is a particular concern about infection with immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
hepatitis B and C, for which there is strong evidence of transmission via health-care
waste. These viruses are generally transmitted through injuries from syringe needles
contaminated by human blood.
The existence of health-care establishments of bacteria resistant to anti-biotics and
chemical disinfectants may also contribute to the hazards created by poorly managed
health-care waste. It has been demonstrated for example, that plasmids from laboratory
strains contained in health-care waste were transferred to indigenous bacteria via the
waste disposal system. Moreover, anti-biotic resistant Escherichia coli have been shown
to survive in an activated sludge plant, although there does not seem to be significant
transfer of this organism under normal conditions of waste disposal and treatment.
Concentrated cultures of pathogens and contaminated sharps (particularly hypodermic
needles) are probably the waste items that represent the most acute potential hazards to
health.
Sharps may not only cause cuts and punctures but also infect these wounds if they are
contaminated with pathogens.  Because of this double risk-of injury and disease
transmission-sharps are considered very hazardous waste class. The principal concerns
are infections that may be transmitted by subcutaneous introduction of causative agent,
e.g. viral blood infections. Hypodermic needles constitute an important part of the sharps
waste category and are particularly hazardous because they are often contaminated with
patients' blood.

7.3.4 Hazards from Chemical and Pharmaceutical waste
Many of the chemicals and pharmaceuticals used in health-care establishments are
hazardous (e:g. toxic, genotoxic, corrosive, flammable, reactive, explosive and shock
sensitive). These substances are commonly present in small quantities in health-care
waste; larger quantities may be found when unwanted or outdated chemicals and
pharmaceuticals are disposed off. They may cause intoxication, either by acute or by
chronic exposure, and injuries, including bums. Intoxication can result from absorption
of a chemical or pharnaceutical through the skin or the mucous membranes, or from
inhalation or ingestion. Injuries to the skin, the eyes, or the mucous membranes of the
airways can be caused by contact with flammable, corrosive, or reactive chemicals
( formaldehyde and other volatile substances. The most common injuries are bums.
Disinfectants are particularly important members of this group: they are used in large
quantities and are often corrosive. It should be noted that reactive chemicals may form
highly toxic secondary compounds.
Obsolete pesticides, stored in leaking drums or tom bags, can directly or indirectly affect
the health of anyone who comes into contact with them. During heavy rains, leaked
pesticides can seep into the ground and contaminate the ground water. Poisoning can
occur through direct contact with the product, inhalation of vapours, drinking of
contaminated water, or eating contaminated food. Other hazards may include the
possibility of fire and contamination as a result of inadequate disposal such as burning or
burying.
66



Environmental Analysis of the Second Pliase of the MTHS-5 YRPOWf2002-2006)
Chemical residues discharged into the sewerage system may have adverse effects on the
operation of biological sewage treatment plants or toxic effects on the natural ecosystems
of receiving waters. Similar problems may be caused by pharmaceutical residues, which
may include antibiotics and other drugs, heavy metals such as mercury, phenols, and
derivatives, and disinfectants and antiseptics.
7.3.5 Hazards from Genotoxic Waste
The severity of the hazards for health-care workers responsible for the handling and
disposal of genotoxic waste is governed by a combination of the substance toxicity itself
and the extent and duration of exposure. Exposure of genotoxic substances in health care
may also occur during the preparation of or treatment with particular drugs or chemicals.
The main pathways of exposure are inhalation of dust or aerosols, absorption through the
skin, ingestion of food accidentally contaminated with cytoxic drugs, chemicals, or
waste, and ingestion as a result of bad practice, such as mouth pipetting. Exposure may
also occur through contact with the body fluids and secretions of patients undergoing
chemotherapy.
Many cytotoxic drugs are extremely irritant and have harmful local effects after direct
contact with skin or eyes. They may also cause dizziness, nausea, headache, or dermatis.
Special care in handling genotoxic waste is absolutely essential; any discharge of such
waste into the environment could have disastrous ecological consequences.
7.3.6 Hazards from Radioactive Waste
The type of disease caused by radioactive waste is determined by the type and extent of
exposure. It can range from headache, dizziness, and vomiting to much more serious
problems. Because radioactive waste, like certain pharmaceutical waste, is genotoxic, it
may also affect genetic material. Handling of highly active sources. e.g. certain sealed
sources from diagnostic instruments, may cause much more severe injuries (such as
destruction of tissue, necessitating amputation of body parts) and should therefore be
undertaken with the utmost care.
The hazards of low-activity waste may arise from contamination of external surfaces of
containers or improper mode or duration of waste storage. Health-care workers or waste
handling or cleaning personnel exposed to this activity are at risk.
7.3.7 Public Sensitivity
Quite apart from fear of health hazards, the general public is very sensitive about the
visual impact of anatomical waste, that is recognisable human body parts, including
fetuses. In no circumstances is it acceptable to dispose of anatomical waste
inappropriately, such as on a landfili.

7.4   Public Health impact of Health-care Waste
7.4.1 Impacts of Infectious Waste and Sharps
For serious virus infections such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C, health-care
workers- particularly nurses are at greatest risk of infection through injuries from
contaminated sharps (largely hypodermic needles). Other hospital workers and waste-
management operators outside health-care establishments are also at significant risk, as
are individuals who scavenge on waste disposal sites (although these risks are not well
document). The risk of this type of infection among patients and the public is much
lower. Certain infections, however, spread through other media or caused by more
resilient agents, may pose a significant risk to the general public and to hospital patients.
7.4.2 Impacts of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Waste
There could be an incidence of widespread illnesses among the general public due to
chemical or pharmaceutical wastes from hospitals. However there hasn't been any
scientific research conducted in Ghana attributing any widespread illness among the
general public to chemical and pharmaceutical waste. Improper handling of chemicals or
pharmaceuticals in health-care establishments could cause injury or intoxication.
Pharmacists, anaesthetists, and nursing, auxiliary, and maintenance personnel may be at
risk of respiratory or dermal diseases caused by exposure of such substances as vapours,
aerosols, and liquids.  To minimise this type of occupational risk, less hazardous
chemicals should be substituted whenever possible and protective equipment should be
provided to all personnel likely o be exposed. Premises where hazardous chemicals are
used should be properly ventilated, and personnel at risk should be trained in preventive
measures and in emergency care in case of accident.
7.4.3 Impacts of Genotoxic Waste
To date there are few data on the long-term impacts of genotoxic health-care waste. This,
is partly because of the difficulty of assessing human exposure to this type of compound.
No scientific publication has yet reported adverse effects on health resulting from
mismanagement of genotoxic waste.
7.4.4 Impacts of Radioactive Waste
In Ghana there are no scientific data available on the impacts of radioactive wastes
7.4.5 Soil Contamination and Groundwater Pollution
The use of landfill as a means of waste disposal in several health establishments in Ghana
is a common phenomenon. Even the teaching/specialist and regional hospitals, which are
deemed to be fairly resourced use dumping grounds (the word "landfill" is most often
erroneously used to refer to controlled dumping ground. This is not synonymous with theS
well engineered/sanitary landfill site.) through the Municipal Waste Managements
Assemblies to dispose off some categories of waste just like the District Health!
establishments.
68



Environmental Analysis ofthe Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
The potential impacts of the disposal at the dumping grounds are the release of infectious
pathogens to air and water or the risk of access by scavengers. Further, there is the risk
of subsequent disease transmission, either directly or indirectly through wounds,
inhalation, or ingestion, or indirectly through the food chain or pathogenic host species.
The severity of the impact from the dumping grounds is the fact that none of the
dedicated sites currently being used by the Municipal Assemblies properly engineered
landfills, instead they could best be described as open dumps. There is risk of
groundwater pollution since the dumping grounds are not lined with impervious materials
as practiced in developed countries. In Ghana people depend on underground water for
domestic uses and are likely to be polluted by leachate.
However, attempts are made by the Municipal Authorities to ensure some controlled
dumping but their effort due to limiting constraints such as financing is not adequate.
7.4.6 Impact of Wastewater Disposal
Wastewater from the Health-care establishments could contain potentially hazardous
components such as microbial pathogens, hazardous chemicals, pharmaceuticals etc.
There are other related hazards such as cholera. Most of the Health-care establishments
in Ghana do not have sewerage treatment plants and or municipal sewer networks. The
disposal of wastewater from these health facilities finds their way into water bodies and
open public drains. These practice could cause the spread of dangerous diseases and
expose both humans and the natural ecology to epidemic threat and health risks.
7.4.7 Air Emissions
Few air emissions could be generated from healthcare activities and would be generated
from the sterilisation process (e.g. operating theatre). Other areas will be the catering and
laundry departments. These emissions may be in the form of vapour and smoke. Other
emissions could be generated from the incineration of waste either from open burning or
from the incineration.
7.5   Social Impacts
POSITIVE SOCIAL IMPACTS
7.5.1 Removal of geographical inequalities
The major goal of the Second Health Sector Programme of Work (5YPOW 2002-2006) is
the reduction of health inequalities in Ghana, particularly between the North and South,
urban and rural areas, as well as inequalities linked to gender, education, and disability.
For instance the northern region's under-five mortality rate are 2.5-2.7 percent higher
than those of the greater Accra Region, which is in the south of the country. These
geographical inequalities which exist between the north and the south would be removed
by the following strategies:
7.5.1.1 Improving Geographical Access
In pursuance of the above policy goal, the Ministry would work with communities:
69



Environmental nalysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOI(2002-2006)
to ensure the availability of appropriate community based services and address all
barriers to access at the local level;
* ensure improved geographical access to emergency services (basic health care);
* review facility capabilities to cope with common emergencies and develop, as
appropriate, community ambulatory services, taking into account all health
service providers;
* review patient emergency transfer facilities, and develop them as appropriate.
7.5.1.2 Improving Financial Access
The POW II has the strategic focus of ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent
access to health services. Measures being put in place to realise this strategic objective
includes the following:
* improving access to services for the financially vulnerable-the very poor, the
elderly, children, people living with chronic diseases;
* reviewing and developing exemption policies and practices, and ensuring provider
compliance;
* developing community repayments schemes/health insurance plans to replace
cash and carry systems in both the formal and informal sectors;
*  focusing public expenditure on priority package of health interventions and
supporting people who cannot or will not pay for themselves.
7.5.1.3 Improving Socio-cultural Access
There will be reduction in socio-cultural barriers to access to health services. This
reduction will ensure:
* appropriate access to health services for priority groups (for example women and,
children);
* improved access to services for the socially vulnerable, especially people with
special needs (the disabled and people living with chronic diseases).
7.5.2  Improving Efficiency
7.5.2.1 Improving Cost Effectiveness
The value for money at all levels from public and private expenditure on health services
will be maximised through better integration of service delivery where target populations
or communities are the same.
7.5.2.2 Improving Planning, Management, and Administration
* There will be a review of the location of government facilities to avoid
duplication with non-governmental facilities;
*  Staff deployment to levels of service required shall be related to case loads
(decentralizing staff budgets and management);
* There will be movement towards caseload-based hospital allocations (allocating
global budges for priority services) which will have a comparative advantage'
based choice of providers to supply publicly-financed services.
70



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
7.5.3  Fostering Partnerships
7.5.3.1 Improving Partnerships with Households and Communities
* Households will be well informed about good behaviour and health-care seeking
behaviour;
*  Coordinated inter-sectoral support for community action to reduce environmental
causes of disease will be ensured; and
* There will be development and extension of public information programs.
7.5.3.2 Improving Partnerships between Private and Public Sector Providers
* The programme will develop a common regulatory framework for both
governmental and non-governmental health service providers;
* It will commission and/or encourage non-governmental service providers to
supply services where they have cost or location advantage;
* It will extend continuous learning programs to non-government providers,
including traditional providers; and
*  increase contribution of non-governmental health service providers to national
health priorities.
7.5.3.3 Improving Partnerships with other Ministries, Departments and Agencies
(MDAs)
The programme will ensure coordinated inter-sectoral support for community action to
reduce environmental causes of disease, implementation of intersectoral health
improvement programs fashioned in response to local health priorities.
The programme will provide an opportunity to Ghana Education Service to develop
curricula and teach good health behaviour.
The programme will establish support for District Assemblies to define health need
priorities and plans for addressing them.
There will be advocacy for a Cabinet lead on priority and inter-sectoral health actions to
support and promote proactive policies and implementation by other MDAs, non-
government providers (NGPs), and civil society organizations to improve environmental
sanitation, access to safe water, road safety and population control.
7.5.4 Improving Equity in Financing
7.5.4.1 Reducing the Budgetary Burden of Health-care for Poor People
The programme will provide opportunity to extend repayments schemes to replace cash
and carry systems in both the formal and informal sectors; and develop the appropriate
regulatory and policy environment for health insurance.
71



EnvironmentalAnalysis ofthe Second Phase ofthe MTHS-5YRPOWe2002-2006)
7.5.4.2 Increasing Public Expenditure on the Poor and Vulnerable
Public budget allocations will explicitly be based on poverty-related indicators to ensure
access to care of ability to pay;
There will be development of exemption policies and practices, and ensure provider
compliance;
The programme will ensure that diseases and ailments with gender-differentiated
incidence receive appropriate allocations and attention, and reduce differences in
provision and service standards between rich and poor areas.
7.5.5 Increase in Household Resources
The project would impact positively on the socio-economic resources of households and
communities. The costs, mainly qualitatively described and both direct and indirect
would include the following:
* Increase in household members productivity due to good health or decrease in
illness and death;
* Increase of human resources in the community;
* There would be a social and emotional satisfaction of greatly decreased child and
infant mortality;
* Minimisation of the financial burden of additional funerals and death related
expenses;
* Minimisation of the social and psychological costs to communities of high death
rates in epidemic malaria;
* Improved attendance at school by children.
NEGATIVE SOCIAL IMPACTS
Notwithstanding the numerous positive social impacts of the MTHS-5YPOW, there is
however a very important potentially negative social impact. This negative impact
identified is associated with land acquisition.
7.5.6 Land Acquisition
Among the 390 health facilities being covered by the project, 81 are new constructions to
be undertaken under the programme and land acquisition may be necessary in relation to
these new constructions. As the exact locations are not known, the Government is taking
the precautionary measure to prepare a resettlement policy framework in compliance with
the World Bank Operational Policy 4.12 (Involuntary settlement). MOH will carry out a
social assessment with the objective to identify all those areas and sites where there will
be an impact on land, people and property and access to resources due to expansion of
health facilities. In cases where land acquisition will cause adverse impact on people and
property or people's access to land or property, the resettlement and compensation
procedures as described in the resettlement framework will be applicable.
The acquisition of land for government projects is regulated by the Lands Act 1963.
Under Section 6(1) of the Act, any person who suffers any loss or damage as a result of
construction, rehabilitation, maintenance etc shall be entitled to compensation.
72



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of t/ae MTHS-5 'RPOW(2002-2006)
The processes as described in the framework and how they would be applied covers
issues such as:
Eligibility
Persons that may be classified according to the following three groups as displaced
persons shall be eligible for compensation and resettlement assistance:
* Those who have formal legal rights to land (including customary and traditional
rights recognized under the Lands Act).
* Those who do not have formal legal rights to land at the time the census begins
but have a recognizable legal right or claim to such land or assets.
. Those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are
occupying.
It is the policy of the Government of Ghana to pay compensation or offer resettlement
assistance to people whose properties, lands or landed property are affected by
programmes being undertaken by the Government. Land for land will be provided where
appropriate. The State Lands Act 1963 section 6(1) provides that any person whose
property is affected by public projects shall be entitled to compensation. The same Act
provides avenues for people who are not satisfied with compensation to seek redress.
Valuation
Farm: Where a farm is the perennial plantation type, the investment method is used for
the assessment. In this case the net annual income from the farm is capitalised at the
appropriate interest rate over the expected remaining life of the farm. For others like the
seasonal crops and the isolated perennial ones, the acreage/unit rates are used.
Building/structures
Compensation for land and buildings/structures should also be assessed having regard to
the market value of the affected property. Where particulars on transactions of similar
properties are readily available and easily accessible, the simple comparative approach
could be adopted, with the necessary adjustment made as a result of any minor
differences in the conditions of the properties.
In instances where the properties affected are the types that do not change hands in the
market, the comparative method can be used to arrive at the market value.
The market value should be arrived at by the "Replacement Cost". The replacement cost
figure to be determined which makes the property as if new should be depreciated by an
appropriate percentage to arrive at the figure that is appropriately related to the property
as it is. Drink money to be paid to the traditional land owners for building plots should
be added to the depreciated figure obtained. (Hence the method termed " Depreciated
Replacement Cost of the Development plus the value of the land"). This in turn should
73



Environmental Analysis of thte Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRP01Y2002-2006)
be topped up by 10-15%, representing ' Removal and contingencies', to arrive at the
compensation payable.
Assessment of compensation
Properties to be affected by the construction or expansion of health facilities should be
inspected/referenced or enumerated jointly by the Estate Management/Valuation Unit of
MOH and the Land Valuation Board, the Government's statutorily accredited Valuation
body. The Estate Management/Valuation Unit of MOH should jointly undertake the
inspection/referencing exercise with the Valuation Board's regional offices, according to
the Region where the project is located. The Regional Health Administration Offices
should also prepare independent reports/valuations, applying rates of value/cost
determined by the Board.  The method of depreciated replacement cost of the
development plus the value of the land should be used in the assessment. The two
independent reports/valuations should be submitted to the Board at the national level, for
vetting and final approval for compensation.
Procedures for delivery of entitlements
Entitlements for project affected people would range from cash payments and/or building
materials to the provision of new land, new homes and compensation for other lost
properties in accordance with the identification of the impact on their property to which
they will have needed to agree.
The approved entitlements or amounts should be communicated to the MOH for delivery
or payment to the beneficiaries.  Compensation would be paid before the
owners/occupiers are made to vacate their properties for commencement of construction
or expansion works. To ensure that this procedure is complied with efforts must be made
by the MOH to ensure that no construction begins until project affected people have been
resettled if physical relocation is necessary and/or received their compensations
(according to World Bank Operational Policies OP 4.12).
All compensation, whether cash payments and /or alternative land and house provisions,
would be given to project affected people, prior to any request for vacation of
land/property and before commencement of construction. Under no circumstances would
there be negotiations for the purpose of project affected people to be requested to vacate
their home/cultivations etc because of delay in payments.
Time frame
Approval from the Land Valuation Board should not take more than an average of four
months. No construction will begin until project affected people have been resettled if
physical relocation is necessary and/or received their compensation (according to World
Bank Policy OP 4.12) Additionally the property owners must be given at least three
months notice to quit after payment of compensation.
74



Environmental Analysis of tle Second Phase of the AfTHS-5YRPOWV(2002.2006)
Conflict Management
During consultation processes and at fora, the extent of damage to properties should be
made known. When the amount of compensation to be paid is made known, the affected
people have the right to appeal if not satisfied.
Where grievance entails inadequacy of compensation paid, the law, section 4 of the
Lands Act 1963, provides for appeal to the "Lands Tribunal" -an ad judicatory body.
Where the grievance relates to implementation of the resettlement plan, the affected
persons should appeal to the District Assembly.
Consultation and participation
During the consultation stages of the projects, the affected people should be briefed on
the compensation/resettlement process. Each affected person should be given the chance
to speak on a draft compensation/resettlement plan particularly on issues of concern to
him/her. Names and contact addresses should be compiled for a database at the Estate
Management Unit. The final compensation and resettlement plan should be presented to
the affected persons.
A monitoring team should liase with all those involved in the compensation/resettlement
process (e.g. the Estate Management/Valuation Unit of the MOH, the Legal Department
of MOH and the Lands Valuation Board) to monitor the timing. The affected persons
should be kept informed at the various stages of the process.
Financial responsibilities
It should be the responsibility of the Government of Ghana to pay compensation as
provided under section 6(1) of the State Land Act 1963. The same Act directs people
with claims to forward these to the Minister.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The Ministry of Health shall be responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the
activities stipulated in the resettlement framework. The Land Valuation Board, Ministry
of Finance and the Environmental Protection Agency shall act as independent monitors.
Upon completion of the programme the MOH shall undertake an assessment to determine
whether the objectives of the resettlement policy have been achieved.
75



Environmental A nalysis ofthe Second Phase of the MITHS-5 YRPOW(2002-2006)
Further, the MOH annual sector wide performance review will include a special chapter
regarding the implementation of the resettlement policy. The report would cover issues
such as inputs, outputs, and outcomes for resettlement activities, involvement of the
displaced persons and evaluation of the impact of resettlement.
Additionally, the World Bank team will regularly, during each implementation support
mission monitor the implementation of the resettlement policy.
7.5.7 Review of Ghana's Land Policy
It is the policy of the Government of Ghana to pay compensation to people whose
properties, lands or landed property are affected by projects being undertaken by the
Government. The State Lands Act 1963 section 6(1) provides that any person whose
property is affected by public projects shall be entitled to compensation. The same Act
provides avenues for people who are not satisfied with compensation to seek redress.
Although the Lands Act provides for payment of compensation and resettlement of
displaced people whose lands or landed property are affected by projects being
undertaken by Government, where there are gaps or discrepancies between the Land Act
and the World Bank Policy, the World Bank policy would apply.
Land Acquisition and Compensation laws
Acquisition of land for health infrastructure development projects is regulated by the
Lands Act 1963 Act 186. The instrument contains the following:
A description (with measurements) of the land affected by the Statutory wayleave
together with a plan showing the position of the health facility construction works.
A copy of the way leave is served on the owner or occupier of the land affected by the
Statutory wayleave. Under Section 6(1) of the Act, any person who suffers any loss or
damage as a result of the construction or expansion of the health facility shall be entitled
to compensation. A claim for compensation shall be made to the Minister in the
prescribed form not more than three months after the date of declaration made by the
President under section 1 of the Act.

8.0   ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES
8.1   Analysis of Alternatives to Achieving Improved Health
Since ill health is both a consequence and cause of poverty through lack of funds and
knowledge to prevent illness an effort to achieve improved health status of the population
can be realised by the injection of substantial financial capital into the Ghanaian economy
to boost up the economy. Consequently, the standard of living of the people will rise
thereby giving access to quality education, good jobs, better remuneration.
Arising from the above, people will have better knowledge to prevent illnesses, have
access to more information and can afford better health delivery services.
Ultimately, the incidence of lack of funds and knowledge to prevent diseases will be
greatly minimised.
8.2   Analysis of Waste Management Alternatives
8.2.1 Treatment And Disposal
Proper treatment and controlled disposal of Health-care waste is necessary to ensure
that its impact on the health workers, waste collectors, the public and the environment
as a whole is minimised or eliminated. Proper treatment of solid Health-care waste
ensures that harmful properties of these materials are eliminated and the risk of
contamination and infection minimised.  The treatment and disposal must be
monitored and documented for future reference.
The best disposal methods for treated Health-care waste are controlled disposal at a
proper sanitary landfill and burial in cemeteries or crematorium. Controlled disposal
of Health-care waste will reduce the risk of contamination of the environment (eg.
groundwater with pathogenic micro-organisms). Table 4 shows the different kinds of
Health-care waste and the type of treatment methods applicable
8.2.2 Treatment Options
There are various Health-care waste treatment options. The choice of treatment
option should be carefully evaluated on the basis of the following factors which shall
be integrated into the comprehensive framework of waste management plan. These
are: -
* Disinfection efficiency
* Health and environmental consideration;
* Volume and mass reduction;
Occupational health and safety consideration;
* Quantity of wastes for treatment and disposal/capacity of the system
Types of waste for treatment and disposal
* Infrastructure requirements
77



Environmental Anal'sis of the Second Pliase of the MTHS-5 YRPOWK2002-2006)
* Locally available treatment options and technologies
* Options available for final disposal
Training requirements for operation of the method
Operation and maintenance considerations
Available space
* Location and surroundings of the treatment site and disposal facility
* Investment and operating cost;
Public acceptability;
* Regulatory requirements.
* Risk of toxic emission
The recommended treatment and disposal options are as follows:-
1.    Incineration
2.    Sterilisation by Heat/Autoclave Sterilsation/Dry Heat Sterilsation
3.    Disinfection by Steam/High Pressure Steam Disinfection/Steam Autoclave
4.    Chemical Disinfection
Incineration
Incineration is a high-temperature dry oxidation process that reduces organic and
combustible waste to inorganic, incombustible matter and results in a very significant
reduction of waste volume and weight. Incineration requires no pre-treatment and should
be carried out sanitarily, with the whole container (plastic bags or cardboard box) so as to
prevent infection. Figure 3 below shows the process flow scheme of a typical incinerator
The incinerator used must meet the following requirements:
*  Temperature at the outlet of the main incinerator should be minimum of 800°C
an average temperature of 1 2000C is recommended.
* Combustion must be complete;
The combustion process should be automated and exhaust gas quality must meet
EPA Recommended Guideline Values; and
* It must have an automatically charging closing sluice.
Incinerators range from extremely sophisticated, high-temperature operating plants to
very basic combustion units that operate at much lower temperatures. All types of
incinerators, if operated properly, eliminate pathogens from waste and reduce the waste
to ashes. However, certain types of Health-care wastes, (e.g. pharmaceutical or chemical
waste,) require higher temperatures for complete destruction. The incinerator must be
equipped with exhaust and gas treatment units to remove gases discharged from the
chimney so that they do not contaminate the environment.
Three basic kinds of incineration technology are of interest for treating Health-care
waste These are:
* Double-chamber pyrolytic incinerators, which may be especially designed to burn
infectious Health-care waste;
*  Single-chamber fumaces with static grate, which should be used only if pyrolytic
incinerators are not affordable;
*  Rotary kilns operating at high temperature, capable of causing decomposition of
genotoxic substances and heat-resistant chemicals.
78



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
Incineration equipment should be carefully chosen on the basis of the available resources
and the local situation, and of risk-benefit considerations- balancing the public health
benefits of pathogen elimination. Before waste disposal against the potential risks of air
or groundwater pollution caused by inadequate destruction of certain wastes.
CHARACTERISTICS OF WASTE SUITABLE FOR INCINERATION ARE:-
* Low heating value: above 2000kcal/kg (8370kj/kg) for single-chamber incinerators,
and above 3500kcal/kg (14640kj/kg) for pyrolytic soluble-chamber incinerators.
* Content of combustible matter above 60%
* Content of non-combustible solids below 5%
* Content of non-combustible fines below 20%
* Moisture content below 30%
WASTE TYPE THAT SHOULD NOT BE INCINERATED INCLUDE:-
Pressurized gas containers
Large amounts of reactive chemical waste
* Silver salts and photographic or radiographic wastes
* Halogenated plastics such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
*  Waste with high mercury or cadmium content, such as broken thermometers, used
batteries, and lead-lined wooden panels
* Sealed ampoules or ampoules containing heavy metals

Microwave Disinfection
This method is used to disinfect Health-care waste in stationery or mobile plants. The
waste is heated by means of microwave energy.   This option has relatively high
investment and operating costs and therefore not recommended for use in the health
institutions
Sterilization By Heat/Autoclave Sterilization /Dry Heat Sterilization
This type of treatment is used in health institutions for the sterilization of reusable
medical equipment.
In this process a dry heat steriliser is used and heat of 1800C is made to act for 30 min. /
or longer. A minimum of 121°C at 60 min. cycle is required to inactivate vegetative
micro-organisms and most bacterial spores.
It allows for only limited quantities of waste and therefore commonly used only for
highly infectious waste such as microbial cultures from clinical or research laboratories
which should not leave the investigation area untreated.
The scope is considered same as high pressure sterilization
Disinfection by stean/High Pressure Steam Disinfection/Steam Autoclave
This process is similar to sterilization by heat but in this case shredded infectious waste is
exposed to high temperatures and high pressures. Minimum temperature and contact
time should be sufficient to inactivate most types of micro-organisms which depend on
the moisture content of waste and ease of penetration of steam, under the following
conditions:
20 min. above 121°C and 2 bar (200kPa)
* 30 min. above 1340C and 3.1 bar (31OkPa)
The facility shall be fitted with steam generating unit, vacuum pump, drain connection
and an evacuated air deodorizing unit and manned by well trained personnel. After
disinfection the waste should join the municipal waste and collection mechanism.
Chemical disinfection
Chemical disinfection, routinely used in health institutions to destroy micro-organisms on
medical equipment, floors and walls are now being extended to the treatment of Health-
care waste. Chemicals are added to the waste to destroy or inactivate the pathogens it
contains. This treatment usually results in disinfection rather than sterilization. Chemical
disinfection is most suitable for treating liquid waste such as blood, urine, stools, or
hospital sewage.  Solid (and even highly hazardous) Health-care wastes, including
microbiological cultures, sharps, etc., may also be disinfected chemically. There are,
however, some limitations:
*   Shredding and or milling of waste is usually necessary before disinfection. However,
the shredder is often subject to frequent mechanical failure or breakdown
*  The disinfectants required are hazardous and should be used only by well trained and
adequately protected personnel
81



Environmental Analysis ofthe Second Phlase ofthe MTHS-5YRPOIV2002-2006)
* Disinfection efficiency depends on operational conditions
* Only the surface of intact solid waste will be disinfected.
In planning the use of chemical disinfection, requirements for the eventual disposal of the
residues should be carefully considered; improper disposal could give rise to serious
environmental problems.
Chemical disinfection of Health-care waste is an attractive option particularly for treating
highly infectious physiological fluids such as patients' stools in case of cholera
outbreaks.
The types of chemicals commonly used for disinfection of Health-care waste are
aldehydes, chlorine compounds, ammonium salts, and phenolic compound.
8.3   Disposal Options
The safest disposal method for treated Health-care waste (eg. Incinerator ash,
sterilised/disinfected infectious waste, encapsulated radioactive waste) is controlled
disposal at a properly engineered sanitary landfill site. Other waste such as human
parts may be buried directly at cemeteries or after cremation.
The choice of disposal option depends greatly on availability of space and/or
adequate facilities to ensure the minimisation of risk to public health and the
environment.
8.3.1 Control Disposal at Sanitary landfill
As a minimum requirement, treated Health-care waste (except category C waste) should
be disposed of at designated sanitary landfill sites. The waste to be disposed of shall not
be mixed with the general municipal waste. At the sanitary landfill site, a specially
engineered cell should be designated for the disposal of treated Health-care and other
hazardous waste.
Disposal should comply with the basic principles of sanitary landfill operations including
the following:
* Chlorinated lime must be poured on the waste immediately it is dumped in the cell
* Waste should be covered immediately with 30cm thickness of cover material
* Access to this special cell should be restricted and closely supervised by the
responsible staff to prevent scavenging
The location of the cell should be clearly marked on a map of landfill site and batches
of waste disposed of should be documented for future references.
8.3.2 Landfilling in Municipal Disposal Sites
Treated Health-care waste may be landfilled with municipal waste. However, Health-
care waste should not be deposited or scattered on the surface of open dumps but
deposited in one of the following two ways:
* In a deeper pit (I - 2m) excavated in mature municipal waste (at least 3 months since
being landfilled) which is then backfilled with the mature waste that was dug out.
Scavenging in this part of the site must be prevented.
82



Environmental Analysis ofthe Second Phase ofthe MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
Alternatively a specially constructed small burial pit could be prepared at the municipal
waste disposal site to receive Health-care waste only.
The pit can be 2m deep and filled to a depth of Im. Each load of waste should be
covered with a soil layer 10 -15 cm deep. Lime may be placed over the waste before
application of cover material or where coverage with soil is not possible.
In case of a disease outbreak involving especially virulent pathogens (such as cholera
virus) both lime and soil cover must be added. Access to this area should be restricted
and closely supervised by the responsible staff to prevent scavenging. The waste should
be buried in approved cemeteries or incinerated at a crematorium.
8.3.3 Safe Burial On Hospital Premises
In health institutions that use minimal programmes for Health-care waste management,
particularly in rural areas, the safe burial of waste on hospital premises may be the only
viable option available. However, the following measures should be followed:-
Access to the disposal site should be restricted to authorised personnel only
The burial site should be lined with a material of low permeability, such as clay, if
available, to prevent pollution of any shallow groundwater that may subsequently
reach nearby wells.
* Only patient waste and pathological/organic human tissue should be buried. If
general waste were also buried on the premises, available space would be quickly
filled up.
* Large quantities (>Ikg). of chemical wastes should not be buried at one time.
Burying smaller quantities avoids serious problems of environmental pollution.
* The burial site should be managed as a landfill, with each layer of waste being
covered with a layer of earth to prevent odours, as well as to prevent rodents and
insects proliferating.

8.4   Waste Minimisation Options
Waste minimisation methods for general biomedical facilities can be classified generally
as source reduction methods, which can be achieved through material substitution,
process or equipment modification, or better operating practices; or as recycling.
Various techniques can be adopted to ensure effective reduction in waste generation. For
example:-
improved management oversight, tracking, inventory control, and computerised data
base tracking systems.
(a)   key overall operating strategies include the following:
1.    Keep individual waste Streams Segregated
.  Keep hazardous waste segregated from    non-hazardous waste.   All waste
contaminated with a hazardous substance becomes hazardous.
* Keep hazardous chemical wastes segregated from infectious wastes.
Keep recyclable waste segregated from non-recyclable waste.
* Minimise dilution of hazardous waste.
2.    Ensure that the identity of all chemical and wastes is clearly marked on all
containers.
3.    Centralise purchasing and dispensing of drugs and other hazardous chemicals.
4.    Monitor drug and chemical flows within the facility from receipt as raw materials
to disposal as hazardous wastes. This may be partially or fully automated by the use of
computer systems and computer-readable barcoded labels for incoming chemicals,
similar to those used in supermarkets.

Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MJTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
5.    Apportion waste management costs to the departments that generate the wastes.
6.    Improve inventory control by:
* Requiring users of chemicals with limited shelf life to use up old stock before
ordering or using new stock.
* Ordering hazardous chemicals only when needed and in minimal quantities to avoid
outdated inventory.
7 Provide employee training in hazardous materials management and waste
minimisation. The major generating departments should have a training program for
all staff who may generate or handle hazardous materials. Training should include:
8     Chemical hazards.
9.    Spill prevention.
10.   Preventive maintenance.
11.   Emergency preparedness and response, including spill clean up.
12.   Implement an institution-wide waste reduction programme.
Other approaches that will improve Health-care waste management in the health
institutions include:
* Requiring that all new materials (cleaning compounds, process chemicals, etc.) that
may result in Health-care waste generation be tested in small quantities before being
purchased in bulk to ensure that large quantities of unused materials that do not
perform as expected do not need disposal.
* Encouraging drug and chemical suppliers to become responsible partners in a waste
minimisation programme by ordering from suppliers who will provide quick delivery
of small orders, will accept return of unopened stock, and are willing to offer off-site
waste management outlets or co-operatives for hazardous wastes.
These practices apply to all waste streams. In addition, specific better operating practices
that apply to certain waste streams are summarised and shown in Table 7.
8.5   Wastewater Treatment and Disposal
Wastewater from health institutions is of similar quality to urban wastewater, but may
also contain various potentially hazardous components if the recommendations in Table 4
are not followed. Some of the hazardous components of wastewater from health
institutions include the following:
i.    Microbiological pathogens bacteria, viruses and helminths produced by wards
treating patients with enteric diseases.
ii.   Hazardous chemicals from cleaning and disinfection operations
iii.  Pharmaceuticals from pharmacies and various wards
iv.   Radioactive isotopes
Health institutions should ideally be connected to a sewerage system, but where such
facilities do not exist, technically sound on-site management systems should be provided.
The basic principle underlying effective management is a strict limit on the discharge of
hazardous liquids to the sewers. The options for wastewater management include:
* Connection to Municipal sewage treatment plant without any pre-treatment;
87



Environmental Analvsis ofthe Second Phase of tile MTHS-5VRPOW(2002-2006)
* On-site treatment or pre-treatment of wastewater.
8.5.1 Connection to a municipal sewage treatment plant without any pre-
treatment
It may be acceptable to discharge the sewage of health institutions to municipal sewers
without pre-treatment, provided that the following requirements are met;
* Municipal sewers are connected to efficiently operated sewage treatment plants that
ensure at least 95% removal of bacteria
* The sludge resulting from sewage treatment is subjected to anaerobic digestion
leaving no more than one helminth egg per litre in the digested sludge.
* The waste management system of the health institution maintains high standards
ensuring that significant quantities of toxic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc are not
discharged into sewers.
* Excreta from patients being treated with cytotoxic drugs may be collected separately
and adequately treated.
8.5.2 On-site treatment or pre-treatment of wastewater
If the requirements in connection to a municipal sewage treatment plant cannot be met,
an efficient on-site management system  should be established.  The minimum
requirements for an efficient on-site wastewater treatment system should include the
following operations:
* Primary treatment
Secondary treatment
Tertiary treatment
* Chlorine disinfection
* Sludge treatment
The final effluent from the on-site treatment facility should meet the EPA standards.
(50mg/I BOD, 30mg/l Sand I0 local coliforms/lOOml).
The sludge produced may be disposed of in a sanitary landfill however, if it is to be used
for agricultural purposes, it must not contain more than 1 helminth egg per kilogram and
not more than 1 000g faecal coliforms per 1 00g.
8.5.3 Minimal Safety Requirements
Health institutions that are not in the position to afford any wastewater treatment systems
should implement the following measures so as to minimise health risks.
* Patients with enteric diseases should be isolated in wards where their excreta can be
collected in buckets for chemical disinfection; this is of utmost importance in case of
cholera outbreaks, for example, and strong disinfectants will be needed.
* No chemicals or pharmaceuticals should be discharged into the sewer.
* Sludges from hospital cesspools should be dehydrated on natural drying beds and
disinfected chemically (e.g. with sodium hypoclorite, chlorine gas, or preferably
chlorine dioxide).
* Sewage from health-care establishments should never be used for agricultural or
aquacultural purposes.
88



Environmental Analysis of the Second Ph,ase of the MTHS-5YRPOWt2002-2006)
* Hospital sewage should not be discharged into natural water bodies that are used to
irrigate fruit or vegetable crops to produce drinking water, or for recreational
purposes.
Small-scale rural health-care establishments that apply minimal waste management
programmes may discharge their wastewater to the environment. An acceptable solution
would be natural filtration of the sewage through porous soils, but this must take place
outside the catchments area of aquifers used to produce drinking-water or to supply water
to the health-care establishment.
89



EnvironmentalAnalysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-SYRPOW(2002-2006)
9.0 PROPOSED ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS MITIGATION
MEASURES
Inspections and consultations conducted reveals that there is lack of a well integrated and
comprehensive waste management policy within the health establishments in the country.
Some critical observations made were:
*  There are no regulations, guidelines or effective means of control for the storage,
handling, packaging and transporting of hospital waste in Ghana.
*  There is lack of health education and training of staff with regard to the
management of medical waste.
*  All forms of liquid waste are simply drained into sinks, and eventually into
the sewerage system. (e.g. acids and alkali are usually not neutralized but
occasionally diluted before disposal.)
*  Hospital and laboratory officials are unable to indicate quantities of wastes
generated.
.  Containers for hazardous/infectious waste are not properly labelled as a
caution to handlers.
.  Most hospitals/clinics visited lacked adequate waste treatment facilities.
Amputated parts are therefore being handled by the various Waste
Management Departments (WMD) of the Assemblies.
*  Scavengers visit waste dumps and collect items such as syringes to be sold for
use as rollers for the hair.
*  Animals such as vultures feed on discarded human tissue from hospitals.
*  Foetal parts are found in public drains
*  In some cases, placentae are sent home for burial because of cultural beliefs.
However there some efforts being made at some of the health centres to bring the
situation under control.  In view of the observations through the inspections we
conducted to some of the health facilities in the country, consultations with key persons
and concerns of relevant Ministries, Departments and Agencies, the following mitigation
measures are proposed.
9.1   Policy Initiatives
9.1.1 Completion of Health-care waste Guideline
The Environmental Protection Agency (E P A) is in process of preparing a guideline as
basis for the segregation, packing, handling, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal
and   monitoring of Health-care waste. This is being done in  collaboration with
individuals, organisations, Ministries such as the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development, District and Municipal Assemblies, Sector
Agencies, and other relevant institutions.
This guidelines on Health-care waste management is to enable hospital
administrators, engineers, environmental health officers and other para-medical
90



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-S YRPOW(2002-2006)
professionals to be aware of the requirements for the proper and safe management of
Health-care waste. The main objectives are:
. To provide an appropriate institutional and administrative framework and
procedures within which to manage and monitor Health-care waste.
* To make recommendations that will provide the basis for policy formulation
and legislation on Health-care waste management.
An early completion and dissemination of the afore mentioned guideline provides a very
good foundation and the best strategy for addressing the potential environmental and
social impacts arising as a result of the MTHS and POW II. To facilitate an early
completion and dissemination of the guideline, the Ministry of Health, which is a key
stakeholder institution and beneficiary of the output guideline document must be
supported financially as well the EPA so as facilitate their cooperation towards an early
completion of the document.
Information gathered from the EPA and MOH indicates that it will cost an amount of
thirty eight thousand United States Dollars ($38,000.00) for publishing of the guideline
and $10,000.00 per region for dissemination of the guideline document through fora.
9.1.2 Development of Health-Care Waste Management Policy
Upon completion of the guideline document a policy document and a technical guideline
would be required to complement any legislation process. It is therefore imperative that a
policy document outlining the rationale for the appropriate legislation, national goals and
the key steps essential to the achievement of the goals.
The policy document should among others contain the following issues:
. Descriptions of the health and safety risks resulting from mismanagement of
health-care waste;
* Reasons for sound and safe health-care waste management practices in health-
care establishments;
* Listing of approved methods of treatment and disposal for each waste category;
* Warning against unsafe practices, such as disposing of hazardous health-care
waste in municipal landfills;
* Management responsibilities within and outside health-care establishments;
* Assessment of the costs of health-care waste management;
* Key steps of health-care waste management: minimisation, separation,
identification, handling, treatment, and final disposal of waste; technical
specifications for the implementation of each step should be described in separate
technical guidelines;
* Record keeping and documentation;
* Training requirements;
* Rules governing the protection of workers' health and safety.
91

9.1.3 Collaboration with HIV AIDS Project on Waste Management
There are potential environmental and social impacts due to the expansion of health
facilities and basic health services particularly HIV AIDS. To mitigate these potential
impacts it is recommended that the waste management programme is designed to
collaborate with the National HIV AIDS project. It must be noted however that the waste
management project could later be linked to the Lagos-Abidjan Corridor HIV AIDS
Project when it becomes operational.
9.2   Waste Management
9.2.1 Waste Segregation and Packaging
There are differences in management methods of the various waste generated within the
health institutions. There is therefore the need to segregate infectious and hazardous
waste from others at the point of generation. The key to minimisation and effective
management of Health-care waste is identification and segregation of the waste.
Appropriate handling, treatment and disposal of waste by type reduces costs and does
much to protect public health.
Segregation should always be the responsibility of the waste producer. It should take
place as close as possible to where the waste is generated and maintained in storage
areas, and during transport.  For successful implementation of waste segregation,
personnel of various institutions need to be well educated on the definition and
classification of Health-care waste.  Staff must also be aware of the rational for
segregation as well as colour codes for containers and bags used for different types of
wastes.
Colour coding of waste containers and plastic bags is one of the efficient ways of
achieving segregation of waste and for sorting out items such as paper, plastic, glass
and metal for recycling.
The recommended colour coding scheme is as follows:
BLACK              General waste (e.g. Kitchen waste, paper, cardboard, sweeping
etc.)
YELLOW             Infectious waste (e.g. Sharps, patient waste, human tissue and
culture/specimen)
BROWN              Hazardous waste (e.g. Expired drugs, vaccines, chemical etc)
7 shows the colour coding for the storage and transportation of Health-care waste. It
should always be noted that colour coding for the plastic bags should always
correspond or match with the waste containers both at the internal and external
storage sites.

Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of tlte MITHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
In general, the Health-care waste should be packaged in clearly labelled colour-coded
plastic bags and containers according to the recommendations provided in Table 7 above.
The waste must be packaged in hermetically sealed plastic bags or containers to prevent
spilling during handling and transportation. The plastic bags or containers should be
appropriately robust for their contents (puncture-proof for sharps, for example, or
resistant to aggressive chemicals) and for normal conditions of handling and
transportation.
9.2.2 Storage
Storage is the time lapse between the production of the waste until collection for final
disposal. Storage consideration must be based on the classification or type of waste
being dealt with and the potential risk of infection to health-care workers and waste
disposal staff. Storage time should be reduced as much as practicable to not more
than 24 hours.
Every site within the environment of the health institution (ward, theatre, laboratory
pharmacy, kitchen and laundry etc.) where waste is generated should be provided
with sufficient number of suitable containers with appropriate packaging and
markings for storage of wastes.
9.2.2.1 Internal Storage
This is the temporary placement of waste at the point of generation before transfer to
external storage points. Internal storage considerations should be based on the
classification or type of waste being dealt with and the potential risk of infection to
health-care workers and waste disposal staff. The following measures should be
taken to ensure safe disposal of waste at the points of generation:
* Storage time shall be reduced as far as practicable. Multiple daily removal of the
waste is recommended.
* Every site within the hospital/institutional environment where waste is generated
shall be provided with sufficient number of suitable containers (waste bins) with
appropriate packaging and marking/labelling.
* Waste bins shall be lined with polythene bags to receive waste and shall be
placed with the opening folding outward over the rim.
* Disposable polythene bags shall be of appropriate size with a minimum 60
microns and maximum of 100 microns in thickness. The top of the bin should
have a wider diameter than the base.
* Filled bags shall be closed off using a plastic strip which when fastened must not
be re-opened.
* Polythene bags shall be collected one way to external storage site without
returning to the point of generation.
* Storage bins shall be placed in built-in roofed areas to provide protection from
water, rain and wind.
* Storage areas shall have sufficient space to afford easy removal of bin and
enclosed to prevent rodents, cockroaches and other insect pests from entry into
these areas.
94



EnvironmentalAnalhsis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
* Bio-hazard marks and other warning signs shall be conspicuously posted on door
to prevent people from interfering unnecessarily with the area.
Access (entrance) to storage area shall be securely locked when unattended.
* Sharps shall be stored in puncture resistant containers made of thick cardboard,
plywood or strong plastic/metal.
Sharps shall not be manipulated (breaking, bending) before disposal and shall not
be recapped before discarding since this is a common cause of puncture injury.
* Puncture resistant containers shall be placed as close as possible to the area
where the sharp item is used.
*  Infectious and hazardous waste shall be segregated at the point of origin rather
than at the transfer or external storage site to facilitate appropriate packaging,
colour coding and transportation.
* Transfer of waste bags from internal to external storage shall be done with care to
prevent rupturing or opening of bags which can lead to the release of pathogens
into the environment.
* Vehicles (carts etc.) used for transporting waste from internal to external storage
sites shall be made of a smooth surface material (e.g. plastic) for easy cleaning
and disinfection.
9.2.2.2 External Storage
External storage refers to temporary placement of waste from the points of generation
to an area prior to collection and transport to final disposal sites. The frequency of
removal of waste stored depends on the volume and nature of waste generated. The
following measures should be taken to ensure the safe disposal of the waste:-
Facility for external storage should not shall be sited within 100-200m from
kitchen, laundry, ward etc. but within the precincts of the hospital/institutions and
shall be easily accessible to collection vehicles.
. The facility shall be enclosed and surrounded by an impervious wall of
appropriate height and provided with gate and lock.
The walls and floors shall be smooth, without cracks, impervious, easy to clean
and disinfect.
*   Site shall be spacious enough and well ventilated if it is to accept waste from
other health institutions.
*  All loading and unloading of waste shall take place within the bounded area.
Waste shall not be compressed during collection.
*   Proper drainage shall be constructed around the facility to drain off waste water.
Leakage from the storage area shall not be allowed to drain off to storm water
drainage/streams.
Facilities for washing of hands (basin, piped borne water and soap) shall be
provided.
* Waste bins shall be washed and disinfected.
* Waste bins shall be of larger volume - 240 litres and above - to receive waste
from points of generation and shall be marked for waste segregation. The
marking shall correspond with the colour code used for polythene bags in internal
storage.
95



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of tihe MTHS-5 YRPOK200 2-2006)
. An easily accessible spill kit (absorbents, disinfectant, buckets, shovel) and
protective clothing (e.g. disposable gloves overall, face mask etc.) shall be
provided for staff to clean up spill of infectious liquid and must be placed near
the loading and unloading area.
Only authorised persons shall have access to external storage area.
Conditions at the external storage areas should be suitable for the type of waste
stored (e.g. Refrigeration).
9.2.3 General Requirements For Waste Collection Containers
Containers for waste collection should meet the following requirements:
1. Non-transparent
2. Impervious to moisture
3. Sufficient strength to prevent easy damage during handling or use
4. Leak resistant
5. Close fitted lids
6. Fitted with handles for easy manipulation
7. Light weight and convenient
8. Designed to minimise physical contact.
9.2.4  Transport Of Health-care wastes
All Health-care waste should be sorted on site before transportation. The process is
facilitated by adopting a colour code for containers. This will hopefully bring about
easy identification of content thus preventing careless handling and the risk of secondary
infection.
Where on-site disposal is not carried out and unless equipped to do so every health
institution should appoint a waste management contractor licensed by the District
Assembly. The waste management contractor shall collect and transport the wastes to a
designated site for treatment and disposal. Wastes from health facilities shall be
packaged and transported separately based on the adopted classification as shown in
Table 3
Before commissioning a Health-care waste contract, the Waste Control Manager on
behalf of the health institution should verify details of certificate for the following
Classification of contractor (e.g. collection, transportation and/or disposal);
Type of waste that can be handled by the contractor (scope of contract) Renewal
times of the licence should be annually.
Type and capacity of the facilities of the contractor;
* Any other points of interest.
Transportation of Health-care waste must be done in accordance with the following:
*   Collection, transportation and disposal of Health-care waste shall only be done by
accredited waste management contractors and certified by the District Assembly
according to stated rules. The District Assemblies should work in collaboration
with the health institutions
*   All necessary care must be taken to prevent odour nuisance to the neighbourhoods
during transportation;
96



Environmental Analysis of tlhe Second Phase of the iVITHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
Where infectious wastes and other wastes have been mixed together, they must be
transported and handled as infectious;
Health-care waste must be transported directly to the disposal or treatment site
within the shortest possible time.
Vehicles used for transportation of Health-care waste must be so constructed as to
prevent the scattering of packed wastes, escape of odour, and must be leak proof.
*  Waste must not be compacted or subjected to any other treatment that could cause
the bags to rapture.
*  All vehicles used for the transportation of Health-care waste shall carry the bio-
hazard work on all sides.
In the case of radioactive waste, containers must be brightly coloured and should be
marked "Radioactive waste" and should bear the international radiation symbol to
distinguish it from containers meant to receive other types of waste. The labels should be
firmly attached so that they do not become detached during transportation and handling.
The printing on the labels should be permanent and legible for the entire storage period.
Transportation of radioactive waste should be in accordance with the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulation on safe Transportation of Radioactive
material. Drivers transporting radioactive material have to be suitably trained and carry
contingency plans on the vehicle detailing action to be taken in event of an accident.
9.2.5 Treatment and Disposal Technologies
There are various Health-care waste treatment and disposal options that could be adopted
by any health establishment. Some of these options are as described in section 8.0.
However, the major issue is the problem of selection with reference to the classification
or category of the health establishment as well as issues such as:
Disinfection efficiency
Health and environmental consideration;
Volume and mass reduction;
Occupational health and safety consideration;
Quantity of wastes for treatment and disposal/capacity of the system;
Types of waste for treatment and disposal;
* Infrastructure requirements;
* Locally available treatment options and technologies;
* Options available for final disposal;
Training requirements for operation of the method;
* Operation and maintenance considerations;
* Available space;
* Location and surroundings of the treatment site and disposal facility;
* Investment and operating cost;
* Public acceptability;
* Regulatory requirements;
* Risk of toxic emission.
For the purposes of proposing the appropriate treatment and disposal technologies,
reference is made to the main classification of the health establishments being adopted by
97

Environmental Analysis of tie Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPO(V(2002-2006)
9.2.5.1 Disposal at Sanitary landfill
Treated Health-care waste (except pathological waste) should be disposed of at
designated sanitary landfill sites. The waste to be disposed of should not be mixed with
the general municipal waste. At the sanitary landfill site, .a specially engineered cell
should be designated for the disposal of treated Health-care and other hazardous waste.
Disposal should comply with the basic principles of sanitary landfill operations including
the following:
* Chlorinated lime must be poured on the waste immediately it is dumped in the cell
* Waste should be covered immediately with 30cm thickness of cover material .
* Access to this special cell should be restricted and closely supervised by the
responsible staff to prevent scavenging
The location of the cell should be clearly marked on a map of landfill site and batches
of waste disposed of should be documented for future references.
9.2.5.2 Land filling in Municipal Disposal Sites
Treated Health-care waste may be landfilled with municipal waste. However, Health-
care waste should not be deposited or scattered on the surface of open dumps but
deposited in one of the following two ways:
* In a deeper pit (1 - 2m) excavated in mature municipal waste (at least 3 months since
being landfilled) which is then backfilled with the mature waste that was dug out.
Scavenging in this part of the site must be prevented.
Alternatively a specially constructed small burial pit could be prepared at the municipal
waste disposal site to receive Health-care waste only.
The pit can be 2m deep and filled to a depth of I m. Each load of waste should be
covered with a soil layer 10 -15 cm deep. Lime may be placed over the waste before
application of cover material or where coverage with soil is not possible.
In case of a disease outbreak involving especially virulent pathogens (such as cholera
virus) both lime and soil cover must be added. Access to this area should be restricted
and closely supervised by the responsible staff to prevent scavenging. The waste should
be buried in approved cemeteries or incinerated at a crematorium.
9.2.5.3 Collection and Disposal of Wastewater
Not many hospitals in Ghana have their sewage systems connected to Municipal
treatment plants or sewerage systems. Neither do these hospitals have their own sewage
treatment plants. There is the need for these health establishments to put in place sewage
collection and treatment facilities. It is recommended that efficient on-site hospital
sewage treatment facilities including the following operations are provided.
* Primary treatment
* Secondary biological purification
* Tertiary treatment Chlorine disinfection-This is particularly necessary if the
wastewater are discharged into water bodies. The final effluent from the on-site
treatment facility should meet the EPA standards. (50mg/l BOD, 30mg/1
Suspended Solid and 0 faecal coliforms/l 00ml).

Treated Health-care waste (except category C waste) should be disposed of at designated
sanitary landfill sites. The waste to be disposed of should not be mixed with the general
municipal waste. At the sanitary landfill site, a specially engineered cell should be
designated for the disposal of treated Health-care and other hazardous waste.
Disposal should comply with the basic principles of sanitary landfill operations including

9.2.5.5 Safe Burial On Hospital Premises
In health institutions that use minimal programmes for Health-care waste management,
particularly in rural areas, the safe burial of waste on hospital premises may be the only
viable option available. However, the following measures should be followed:-
Access to the disposal site should be restricted to authorised personnel only
The burial site should be lined with a material of low permeability, such as clay, if
available, to prevent pollution of any shallow groundwater that may subsequently
reach nearby wells.
Only patient waste and pathological/organic human tissue should be buried. If
general waste were also buried on the premises, available space would be quickly
filled up.
Large quantities (>1kg) of chemical wastes should not be buried at one time.
Burying smaller quantities avoids serious problems of environmental pollution.
The burial site should be managed as a landfill, with each layer of waste being
covered with a layer of earth to prevent odours, as well as to prevent rodents and
insects proliferating.
9.2.5.6 Collection and Disposal of Wastewater
Most District/Private Hospitals and Health Centres/Clinics do not have their sewage
systems connected to Municipal treatment plants or sewerage systems. These hospitals
do not also have the resources to own sewage treatment plants. There is the need for
these group of health establishments to be supported to put in place sewage collection and
treatment facilities. It is recommended that efficient on-site hospital sewage treatment
facilities including the following operations are provided.
*  Primary treatment
*  Secondary biological purification
*  Tertiary treatment Chlorine disinfection-This is particularly necessary if the
wastewater are discharged into water bodies.
Sludge from the sewage treatment plant should be subjected to anaerobic digestion to
ensure thermal elimination of pathogens.
9.2.6 Preparation of Waste Management Plans
Waste management plans are plans that have been carefully designed to ensure proper
management of Health-care waste in terms of minimization, segregation, packaging,
storage, transporting, treatment and disposal.
Planning for improvement in Health-care waste management requires the definition of a
strategy that will facilitate careful implementation of the necessary measures and
appropriate allocation of resources according to the identified priorities and for defining
further actions that may be needed.
Surveys on the generation of waste will be the basis for identifying opportunities and
setting targets for waste minimisation, reuse, recycling, reduction in cost and the potential
liabilities associated with handling, transport and disposal.

9.3   Social Impacts Mitigation Measures
The only social impact identified is that associated with the acquisition of land for the
construction of the 81 new facilities. The specific potential social impacts as a result of
land acquisition for the construction of the new health facilities are the involuntary taking
of land resulting in relocation or loss of shelter, loss of assets or access to assets, loss of
income sources or means of livelihood.
Land Ownership In Ghana
Land ownership system in Ghana is governed by a complex operation of both customary,
statute and common law resulting in a rather uniquely complicated land ownership
structure. There are three principal land ownership genuses in Ghana namely:
1.    Customary owned,
2.    State owned
3.    Customary owned but state managed Lands also known as vested lands.
Customary Ownership
Customary ownership occurs where the right to use or to dispose of use-rights over land
rest governed purely by customary laws of the land owning community. Customary laws
in Ghana vary from one community to another and the Ghanaian society is made up of
various ethnic communities with their varying social structure, customary practices and
norms. These customary laws and norms rest neither on the exercise of brute force, nor
on the evidence of rights guaranteed by government statute, but on the fact that they are
recognised as legitimate by the community, the rules governing the acquisition and
transmission of these rights being usually explicitly and generally known, though not
normally recorded in writing (Bower, 1993). Such ownership may occur in any one or a
combination of the following ways:
I.    Discovery and long uninterrupted settlement
2.    Conquest through war and subsequent settlement
3.    Gift from another land owning group or traditional overlord
4.    Purchase from another land owning group.
Within the customary owned land system various schemes of interest with varying
quantum of rights exist. The Allodial title is the highest quantum of land right capable of
ownership and it forms the basis of all land rights in Ghana. The Allodial title in land is
equivalent to the common law freehold rights. These rights are vested either in a stool, a
clan,  a   family,  an  earth  priest  or   a  private  individual  person.
Other lesser interest that such as usufructuary interest, tenancies, licenses and pledges
emanates from the Allodial title. In Ghana customary lands are managed by a custodian
(a chief or a head of family) together with a council of principal elders appointed in
accordance with the customary law of the land owning community. The custodian and the
elders are necessarily members of the land owning community and are expected by
customary law to hold the land in fiduciary capacity in trust for the members of the land
owning community. They are thus accountable to the members of the land owning
102



Environment alAnalvsis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-SYRPOW(2002-2006)
community for their stewardship. Membership is obtained by birth. All grants of land
rights by the custodian require the concurrence of at least two of the principal elders for
the grant to be valid..
Customary ownership presents considerable land acquisition problems in Ghana. The
boundaries of most customary owned lands are not generally surveyed and in some cases
undefined. It is also plagued with land ownership squabbles and trying to identify the true
owner of any piece of land can be risky. There is improper record keeping of judgments,
dispositions and other records relating to the land by the custodians. In many instances
there is the need to distinguish between jurisdictional rights of custodians and propriety
rights in land.
State Lands
State lands are those specifically acquired by government under an appropriate enactment
using the state powers of eminent domain. Currently the principal acquiring legislation is
the State Lands Act of 1962, Act (122) for public purposes or in the public interest.
Under such ownership the allodial rights become vested in government who can then
proceed to dispose of the lands by way of leases, certificate of allocations, licences etc to
relevant beneficiary state institutions as well as private individuals and organisations. The
boundaries of these lands are cadastrally surveyed but are scattered throughout the
country.
Vested Lands
The third category of land in Ghana is the generally referred to as vested lands and they
are lands owned by a stool but managed by the state on behalf of the land owning stool.
Under such ownership the legal rights to sell, lease, manage, collect rent, is taken away
from the customary landowners by the application of specific law to that land and vested
in the state. The landowners retain the equitable interest in the land i.e. the right to enjoy
the benefits from the land. This category of land is managed in the same way as state
lands. Unlike state lands however, the boundaries are not cadastral surveyed and they are
usually larger in size, covering wide areas.
Because in Ghana there is no land without an owner it is presumed that any parcel of land
in Ghana would fall within one of the above-discussed categories and since state and
vested lands are acquired expressly through legislation, all other lands outside these
categories belong to the class of customary lands - stools, clans or families.
The acquisition of land for government projects is regulated by the Lands Act 1963.
Under Section 6(1) of the Act, any person who suffers any loss or damage as a result of
construction, rehabilitation, maintenance etc shall be entitled to compensation. A claim
for compensation shall be made through the Minister in the prescribed form not more
than three months after the date of declaration made by the President under Section 1 of
the Act.
103



Environmental A nalysis of the Second Phase of the AIfTHS-SYRPOW(2002-2006)
To mitigate the potential social impacts of land acquisition, a resettlement policy
framework has been prepared (see annex 2). The resettlement policy addresses the
following issues:
* Resettlement/compensation policy in Ghana;
*  Land acquisition and compensation laws;
* Category of loss;
*  The lands Act (1963) and World Bank OP 4.12;
* Eligibility;
* Valuation;
* Building and structures;
* Assessment of compensation;
* Procedures of delivery of entitlements;
* Time frame;
* Conflict management;
* Consultation and participation and
* Financial responsibilities
9.4   Estimated Costs Of Proposed Mitigation Measures
All Health-care establishments in Ghana are financially liable for their environmental
stewardship and safe management of the wastes they generate. This is consistent with the
"polluter pays" principles, which is fully subscribed to in Ghana.
The chain of cost related activities performed in pursuit of environmental stewardship by
the health establishments mainly involves:
* Capital cost which involve equipment acquisition and installation
* Recurrent cost (a) labour and supplies for collecting, packaging and handling; (b)
operation and maintenance of equipment.
* Provision of services by contractors who provide services like transport, treatment
and final disposal of waste.
The costs of waste collection, appropriate packaging, and on-site handling are internal to
the health establishment and are paid as labour and supplies costs. The costs of off-site
transport, treatment, and final disposal are external and are paid to the contractors who
provide the service.
The costs of construction, operation, and maintenance of systems for managing and
ensuring environmental stewardship can represent a significant part of the overall budget
of a health-care establishment. These costs should be covered by specific allotment from
the health establishment budget.
The estimated costs of the main environmental stewardship activities for the health
establishments and total financial requirement are made up of the elements in the table
below:

10.0 PROPOSED INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT
10.1 Institution of a National Capacity Building Programme
In order to achieve acceptable practices in Health-care waste management  and
compliance policies, it is essential for all managers and other personnel involved to
receive appropriate skills. Ministry of Health should collaborate with institutions such as
EPA, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, District Assemblies and
Municipal Assemblies in the preparation of train the trainer activities, and competent
institutions or centres for the trainers programme to be identified.
This will ensure an understanding of the environmental issues. In particular, staff/workers
must have an understanding of the rationale for the recommended mitigation measures
and monitoring programmes that they may be implementing.
10.1.1 Target Trainees
All hospital personnel, including senior medical doctors, should be convinced of the need
for a comprehensive Health-care waste management policy and the related training, and
of its value for the health and safety of all. This should ensure their collaboration in the
implementation of policies.
Separate training activities should be designed for, and targeted to, four main categories
of personnel:
* Hospital managers and administrative staff responsible for implementing policies
on Health-care waste management;
* Medical Staff-Doctors and Nurses
* Paramedical Staff-laboratory technicians, mortuary
* Support Service Staff-Cleaners, porters, auxiliary staff, and waste handlers.
Since action is needed at management level, by those producing the waste as well as by
the waste handlers, training of all these categories of personnel is equally important.
Medical doctors may be educated through senior staff workshops and general hospital
staff through formal seminars. The training of waste managers and regulators, however
could take place outside the hospitals, at public health/research institutions.
10.1.2 Training/Capacity Building Program Content
Personnel education and training programmes should include:
* Information on, and justification for, all aspects of the Health-care waste policy to
be formulated;
*  Information on the role and responsibilities of each hospital staff member in
implementing the policy;
106



Environmental Analvsis of the Second Pliase of tle MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
Technical instructions, relevant for the target group, on the application of waste
management practices.
In general, the training should be extended to cover the following additional areas:
(a) Personnel should be trained on the hazards, precautions and procedures for safe
storage, handling, disposal and use of all potentially harmful materials relevant to each
person's task and work area.
(b) Training should incorporate information from Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)
for potentially harmful materials.
C) Personnel should be trained in environmental, health and safety matters including
accident prevention, safe lifting practices, the use of MSDSs, safe chemical handling
practices, and proper control and maintenance of equipment and facilities.
(d) Training should also include emergency response, including the location and proper
use of emergency response, including the location and proper use of emergency
equipment, use of protective equipment, procedures for raising the alarm and notifying
emergency response teams, and proper response actions for each foreseeable emergency
situation.
(e) Monitoring procedures
(f) Good record keeping and reporting systems
10.1.3 Training/Capacity Building Responsibilities
The infection Control Officer and the Environmental Health Officer should be given the
joint responsibility of training related to the segregation, collection, storage, and disposal
of Health-care waste. These Officers should ensure that staff at all levels are aware of
both the hospital waste management plan and policy and of their own responsibilities and
obligations in this regard.
10.2  Management Responsibilities
The MOH which has Government's mandate to ensure good health has however not
played a proactive role in coordinating these efforts. For example laws relating to
specific aspects of public health such as bylaws of the District and Municipal Assemblies
dealing with sanitation & vector control, and public safety laws like Factories, Offices &
Shops Act 328 are not under MOH. The MOH is therefore unable to coordinate these
efforts and conditions of ill health that arise as a result of lapses of the key implementers
of these laws end up in the health sector which has to spend its resources to manage them.
The existing environmental management responsibilities and organisation within the
health establishments are not adequately addressed although the awareness to do so exist.
The observation is that environmental management issues are competing with the core
Health-care management functions.
Another major problem is the unavailability of sufficient resources for Health-care waste
and environmental management. The effect is the low prioritisation of environmental
management activities, inadequate resource allocation for environmental management
and ineffective integration of environmental concerns into the entire Health-care service
delivery.
107



Environmen tal Analysis of the Second Phase of tile MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
Presently, the institutional responsibility rests with the Public Health Department of the
District and Metropolitan Assemblies. There is the need to shift from this situation by
allocating a joint responsibility to include the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Local
Government and Rural Development and the Environmental Protection Agency. The
overall Strategic Management function should be the responsibility of the Ministry of
Health, which will formulate policy guidelines and provide general direction for
implementation.
10.2.1 Management Structure
There is the need for a management structure to run through all levels of the Ministry Of
Health. At each level, the components of the management structure should work in
collaboration with all other stakeholders such as the Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Employment and
Social Welfare, the Ghana Health Service, the Teaching Hospitals, the Envirornental
Protection Agency and the District and Metropolitan Assemblies with a responsibility of
environmental management.
The roles of the identified collaborating Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs)
should be clearly defined. The proposed role of the MOH should be to ensure the
formulation of policies, guidelines and provision of general direction for implementation.
The suggested structure to run through the MOH should be as follows:
MOH-An Environmental Health Unit (EHU) should be responsible for policy and
general guidance. The EHU should have close links with the Public Health Units and
Occupational Health units of the Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME).
The functions of the EHU could be combined with policy functions related Occupational
Safety and Health. Additionally, the EHU should have a role in policy and review of
environmental and health assessment.
Ghana Health Service (GHS)- The GHS should have Units within the Public Health
Division to monitor implementation of environmental management within the Regions,
Municipalities and Districts.
Regional Hospitals- Should function under Public Health Units and provide guidelines
for environmental management.
District Hospitals- Should have environmental health officers.
Institutions (Departments and Agencies)-Should have environrmental health officers.
Hospitals/Health Centres/Posts- To work with committees in institutions, Departments
and Agencies.
The day to day administration of Health-care waste and environmental management
should be the direct responsibility of a management committee to be headed by Medical
Officer-in-Charge.
The operational objective of the Environmental Management Unit shall be:
* To initiate plans towards ensuring that the health facility is operated in an
environmentally sound manner;
108



Environmental Analysis of the Second Plhase of the MTHS-SYRPOW(2002-2006)
* To ensure that Health-care waste control and environmental management facilities
shall be integrated into the entire operations of the health establishment in order to
minimise, prevent or eliminate hazards where possible.
The responsibilities of the Environmental Health Officer shall include among others the
following:
* Under the supervision of the Medical Officer-in-Charge shall initiate plans towards
setting up of Environmental Health and Safety Section.
* Plan for the effective management of the Environmental Unit
* Submit regular and periodic reports to the Director of Health Services to ensure
compliance with all Statutory Acts, Regulations and Directives.
* Co-ordinate all environmental, health and safety related activities to ensure a cost-
effective achievement of policy objectives.
* Undertake monitoring, auditing and review through an integrated monitoring system.
10.3 Health-Care Waste Environmental Management Committee
Proper management depend on good administration and organisation, financing and
active participation of trained and informed staff.
There is the need to form a Waste Management Committee to develop the waste
management plan. The committee shall comprise the Medical Officer-in-Charge and
several members and shall include the following shown in Figure 4.
Head of the Health Institution - Medical Officer-in-Charge
All Departmental Heads
Infection Control Officer/Hygienist
Radiation control Officer
Matron/Sister I/C
Financial Controller
Waste Management Officer/Environmental Health Officer or Public Health Unit
Union Representatives
* Representative of the Local Community.
The functions of the committee shall be to;
* Develop a waste management plan for the facility which will be integrated into the
daily operations of the health institution
* Ensure that all on-going projects have made room for waste disposal gadgets
* Consider and advise the management of health institutions on all aspects of Health-
care waste disposal within the health institutions
* Inspect Health-care waste generating points to ensure that waste is kept in accordance
with acceptable standards of environmental sanitation
* Advise hospital management on measures to prevent endemics
The committee shall be responsible to the Chief Administrator/Head of Institutions while
the Public health Unit shall carry out day to day implementation of the plans.
109



Environmental Analysis of the Second Plhase of the MTHS-S YRPO W(2002-2006)
10.4 Environmental Management Systems
Health establishment should develop a comprehensive Environmental & Management
Systems based on ISO 14001 SERIES. The development of Environmental Monitoring
& Management Systems will help Management of development goals, objectives and
targets if not already available. The development of the system will also identify
personnel, responsibility, environmental management and training requirements for each
stage of the project and others and will cover the following:
* Composition and job description of environmental management team
* Structure of reporting for environmental management team and this should be linked
with operational and administrative activities,
* Team information, training and development
* Occupational health and safety action plan
*:  Occupational safety and hazard prevention
*:  Administrative controls
*:  Use of personnel protective equipment
*: Medical monitoring
*:  Accident history
* Monitoring - Parameters to be monitored at sampling sites,
* Frequency of measurements,
* Method of sampling and analysis,
* Monitoring programme,
* Proper and adequate record-keeping.
*:    Documentation control, and
*:    Document control
* Places to be restricted to unauthorized persons
* An environmental audit and review programme covering all activities to assess
compliance with contract requirements and ensure meeting requirements of the EPA
and other stakeholders including the general public. The programme should include:
i.    Internal review - undertaken by staff reporting internally;
ii.   External audit - undertaken by independent consultants

12.0 MONITORING PLAN
Effective control of Health-care waste and monitoring of facilities should be carried
out regularly, in order to maintain and improve management of the waste. Measures
should be adopted to ensure that problems and risks involved are identified while
enhancing safety and preventing the development of future problems.
Compliance and enforcement with legislation shall be ensured through a co-ordinating
and regulatory body. These bodies should include the Ministry of Health, EPA and the
District Assemblies. They shall undertake regular monitoring of these facilities, with the
aim of establishing long-term sustainability in Health-care waste management.
The bodies shall ensure compliance with the following:
Segregation i.e. sharps, pathological, hazardous and radioactive waste from other
waste. Picture stickers shall be used in the rural areas for identification.
Collection routines including packaging and labelling
On-site treatment procedures like sterilisation, disinfection and incineration. It
should be ensured that the incinerator plant continually bums its materials at
temperature of 1200°C and above to eliminate the release of dioxins.
Storage into appropriate, labelled and adequate containers for both internal and
external storage.
Transportation i.e. needs and conditions including certification.
Worker safety measures
* Disposal at sanitary landfills, cemetery or crematorium.
To ensure effective record keeping, each health institutions should prepare and keep
records on the following: -
Date for recording data
The type and volume or weight of waste generated
The means of transportation, type and volume transported
Commissioned waste contractor (name of company, type of license, site of
treatment and /or final disposal).
. Disposal method - volume incinerated, volume of intermediate treatment,
volume disposed of.
These records shall be kept at the Public Health Unit of the health institution for a
minimum of five (5) years, before being sent to the archives. Monthly returns shall
be prepared and submitted to the District Assembly.
Besides this, annual reports shall be prepared by each health institution and copies
sent to the representative EPA Regional office and District Assembly of the
institution. The annual report must also report on waste management within it.
114



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MTHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
13.0 RECOMMENDATIONS
13.1  Recommendations for Improvements of Current Status of Health Facilities
and Basic Healthy delivery Services
The Health-care waste management issues should be tackled seriously. Modem and
efficient technologies of waste collection, segregation, treatment and disposal should be
adopted to replace the present situation in areas where crude technologies and practices
are being adopted. Additionally the waste handlers must be adequately trained so as to
ensure some professionalism in the health-care waste management.
In order to achieve acceptable practices in Health-care waste management  and
compliance with policies it is essential for all managers and other personnel involved to
receive appropriate skills. The Ministry of Health should collaborate with institutions
such as EPA, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, District and
Municipal Assemblies in the preparation of train the trainer activities, and competent
institutions or centres for the trainers programme to be identified.
13.2  Recommendations for mitigation of Potential Occurrence of Adverse Effects
on Human Health through Accidental Infections
To mitigate the potential occurrence of adverse effects on Human Health through
accidental infections it is recommended that a programme of response should be
established to prescribe the actions to be taken in the event of injury or exposure to a
hazardous substance. All staff who handle health-care waste should be trained to deal
with injuries and exposures. The programme should include the following elements:
' Immediate first-aid measures such as cleansing of wounds and skin, and irrigation
(splashing) of eyes with clean water;
- An immediate report of the incident to a designated responsible person;
> Retention if possible of the item involved in the incident; details of its source for
identification of possible action;
3 Additional medical attention in an accident and emergency or occupational health
department, as soon as possible;
> Medical surveillance;
> Blood or other tests if indicated;
> Recording of incident;
- Investigation of the incident, and identification and implementation of remedial
action to prevent similar incidents in the future.
13.3  Recommendations    to  Mitigate  Potential  Soil,  Water  and   Body
Contamination from Hospital Waste
In view of the current status and potential impacts of the health facilities with regard to
the waste management practices in connection with the generation, handling and disposal
of liquid and solid wastes; soil, water and body contamination from wastes disposal it is
recommended that all hospitals and health centres should develop and implement a
comprehensive waste management plan.  For existing health facilities without an
115



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the MITHS-5 YRPOIV(2002-2006)
operative waste management plan, an on-site chemical and waste survey must be carried
out prior to development of the plan. The waste management plan must incorporate the
following principles:
> The plan should be developed under the direction of a properly trained waste
management officer designated for the facility.
> The plan should include the substitution of hazardous chemical agents, where
practical, with less hazardous substances.
> All pathogenic, infectious, and hazardous wastes must be segregated from general
wastes.
> Appropriate handling, storage and transport methods must be established for all
operations.
> Adequate treatment and disposal methods must be used for all wastes.
> A monitoring program must be implemented, including frequent spot surveys in
problem or high risk areas.
For the handling and storage of health-care wastes, it is recommended that:
Pathogenic, infectious and hazardous wastes should be segregated at the source.
Colour-coded containers and labels should be provided to facilitate the segregation and
storage of the health-care wastes.
Puncture-proof containers must be provided for sharp waste objects.
Employees must use protective clothing and gloves, especially when handling blood-
-soaked objects associated with infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and AIDS.
For the treatment and disposal of the health-care wastes:
> Health establishments should recycle or reclaim materials where possible.
>  If recycling or reclaim is not practical, wastes must be disposed of in an
environmentally acceptable manner and in compliance with guidelines.
, All hazardous materials, process residues, solvents, oils, and sludges from raw
water, process wastewater and domestic sewage treatment systems must be
disposed of in a manner to prevent the contamination of soil, ground water and
surface wasters.
13.4 Collaboration with HIV AIDS Project on Waste Management
There are potential environmental and social impacts due to the expansion of health
facilities and basic health services particularly HIV AIDS. To mitigate these potential
impacts it is recommended that the waste management programme is designed to
collaborate with the National HIV AIDS project. It must be noted however that the waste
management project could later be linked to the Lagos-Abidjan Corridor HIV AIDS
Project when it becomes operational.
13.5  Recommendation for Ghana's National Legislation Pertaining to the
Generation and Disposal of Hospital Wastes
As has been noted, Ghana has no framework legislation that seeks to address hospital
wastes management in the country. It is therefore recommended that a legislation must
be enacted.
116



Environmental Analysis of the Second Plaise of the MITHS-5YRPOW(2002-2006)
The legislation must be clear as to the following elements:
# Scope or coverage i.e. the specific type of wastes preferably to be stated in an
appendix;
> The institutional basis for waste disposal (Private Sector Participation, if allowed
must be specified);
> The various methods of disposal must be stated;
> Prohibited acts;
> Deterrent penalties.
There must be widespread consultations so that all stakeholders would see the final
output as their own. This way, efficiency and effectiveness would be assured.
13.6  Recommendations on Involuntary Settlement regarding Land Acquisition
and Payment of Compensation.
It is recommended that the Ministry of Health in compliance with the World Bank
Safeguard Policies OP 4.12 ,Lands Act 1963 and Article 20 of the 1992 Constitution of
the Republic of Ghana, ensure that all exiting policies, statute and the administrative
requirements regarding the compensation are pursued.
In order to pursue these requirements, a resettlement policy framework has been
prepared. See annex 2.
13.7  Recommendation for appropriate Environmental and Social Capacity
Building within the MOH
There is the need for a management structure to run through all levels of the Ministry Of
Health. At each level, the components of the management structure should work in
collaboration with all other stakeholders such as the Ministry of Local Government and
Rural Development, the Ministry of Environrment, the Ministry of Employment and
Social Welfare, the Ghana Health Service, the Teaching Hospitals, the Environmental
Protection Agency and the District and Metropolitan Assemblies with a responsibility of
environmental management.
The roles of the identified collaborating Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs)
should be clearly defined. The proposed role of the MOH should be to ensure the
formulation of policies, guidelines and provision of general direction for implementation.
The suggested structure to run through the MOH should be as follows:
MOH-An Environmental Health Unit (EHU) should be responsible for policy and
general guidance. The EHU should have close links with the Public Health Units and
Occupational Health units of the Policy Planning Monitoring and Evaluation (PPME).
The functions of the EHU could be combined with policy functions related Occupational
Safety and Health. Additionally, the EHU should have a role in policy and review of
environmental and health assessment.
117



Environmental Analysis of the Second Phase of the AITHS-5YRPOW$2002-2006)
Ghana Health Service (GHS)- The GHS should have Units within the Public Health
Division to monitor implementation of environmental management within the Regions,
Municipalities and Districts.
Regional Hospitals- Should function under Public Health Units and provide guidelines
for environmental management.
District Hospitals- Should have environmental health officers.
Institutions (Departments and Agencies)-Should have environmental health officers.
Hospitals/Health Centres/Posts- To work with committees in institutions, Departments
and Agencies.
13.8  Recommendation    of Actions  necessary  to  ensure  full Social and
Environmental Consideration
The MOH which has government's mandate to ensure good health, has however not
played a proactive role in co-ordinating these efforts. Conditions of ill health that arise as
a result of lapses in the operations of the key implementers of these laws end up in the
health sector which has to spend its resources to manage them.
To address this situation, it is recommended that:
> The MOH adopts mechanisms to anticipate health risks;
> Institute Environmental and Health Impact Assessments on projects to reduce
unintended ill-health arising out of development projects;
z The MOH should have an increased involvement in development efforts through
guiding policy formulation at all levels (linking health information with
environmental data) to clarify the relative roles and policy functions of health
sector vis a vis those of other MDAs.
13.9  Recommendation for impregnation of bed nets
It is of interest to recommend to implementers of the policy of the Insecticide Treated
Materials policy to use more environmentally friendly WHO type III Chemicals, which
have comparative advantage in, term of biodegradability, non toxic as well being non-
persistent. Above all should be cheaper for the pocket of the average Ghanaian.

16.1  Annex 1:     Terms of Reference
GHANA SECOND HEALTH SECTOR PROGRAM SUPPORT CREDIT
Introduction
The development objective of the proposed Second Health Sector Program Support
Credit is to support the Government of Ghana's efforts to improve the health status of the
population while reducing the geographical, socio-economic, and gender inequalities. It
will build on progress achieved in recent years, mainly with the financing of the First
Health Sector Support Project (1998-2002). The proposed credit would support the
Ministry of Health to implement its Medium-Term Health Strategy (MTHS) and
corresponding 2002-2006 Program of Work (POW). To achieve objectives defined in the
POW, the Second Health Sector Support Program Credit would finance a portion of the
combined Government and external assistance budgets for policy development and
operational activities.
The main strategies for the next MTHS and 5 year POW are to:
(a) reduce geographical inequalities in health while addressing the gender and socio-
economic inequalities. This will involve among other things investments to
sustain basic health services and improve their quality as well as the quality of
secondary hospitals, the adoption of new allocation formulas for capital and
recurrent budgets, and the development of an overall Human Resource Policy.
(b) Improve health financing and financial accessibility of health services.
(c) Quality and efficiency in service delivery through the adoption of a new human
resource development plan
(d) Better exploit the public sector's comparative advantage in order for MOH to
work more effectively with development partners, civil society and the private
sector
(e) Improve intersectoral collaboration and focus attention on key issues and translate
this focus into practice in HIV/AIDS, road safety, nutrition, malaria control, and
water and sanitation; and
(f Continue to reform the public sector management with special emphasis placed
on the management of drugs, particularly at the central medical store.
Objectives
The purpose of the environmental analysis is to assess the potential environmental
and social impacts derived from the implementation of MOH's 2002-2006 POW.

Scope of Work
In an effort to gain an understanding of the potential environmental and social
impacts of the project, the consultant will:
(i)   Review Ghana's national environmental legislation, policies, regulations, and
procedures in conjunction with the World Bank's safeguard policies and
identify possible gaps. In this context, particular attention needs to be paid to
the country's legislation pertaining hospital waste disposal.
(ii)  Review land acquisition policies and the issue of compensation payment if the
MOH would have to acquire land, (people could be displaced and dislocated)
