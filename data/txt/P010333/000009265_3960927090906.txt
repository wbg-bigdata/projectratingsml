MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECITTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL
FOR AN ENGINEERING EDUCATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Kingdom of Nepal for SDR 8,8 million (US$ 11.4 million
equivalent) is submitted for approval.  The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and wo-.ld heip finance an
engineering education project. The project would be cofinanced on a 8rant
basis by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for US$ 3.95
million and the Swiss Development Cooperation (SDC) for US$8.53 million
equivalent. IDA will act as the administrator for the SDC grant.
2.       Background.   Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed
countries in the world. About 90% of Nepal's population lives in rural areas,
with agriculture being the main source of livelihood. Per capita income is
estimated at US$ 160 (1986), and health and education standards are below the
average for South Asia. Life expectancy at birth is only about 53 years and
infant mortality is high at about 135 per thousand. In the 2C years from 1965
GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.6% barely exceeding the 2.4% annual population
growth rate. Prospects for significant increases in the per capita income are
poor. Sustained longer term growth will depend on sound macroeconomic
management, appropriate investments in social and economic infrastructure,
continued efforts to improve public administration and increased investments
in human resources development.
3.       His Majesty's Government (HMG) has recognized the benefits of
investments in education and skills development.  As a result of Government's
efforts the education system has expanded at all levels. The gross primary
enrollment ratio has risen from 21% in 1972 to the current 83X Lower secondary
enrollment has risen from 7X to 31% over the same period. Tnis augurs well
for continued improvement in the literacy rate, currently about 35X compared
to 5.3% in 1954. Low literacy among rural women, 16% in 1986, coupled with
high school dropout rates for girls is a cause for concern. A lack of
strategic planning for skilled labor needs has resulted in only 5% of
university students studying agriculture and engineering. As a result, higher
education, although growing rapidly, has not contributed the skilled workforce
necessary for Nepal's technological advancement. In fact available indicators
show that there are shortages of skilled labor, particularly in engineering.
These shortages of trained engineers tend to thwart efficient and timely
execution of development projects. Moreover, HMG has planned important
investments in agriculture (irrigation projects), in electric power and
infrastructure (including the rehabilitation of roads, water supply and
storage facilities) and in the expansion of communication& and transport
systems. These will require engineering personnel currently not available.
4.       On the basis of available information on the labor market for
engineering skills, the performance of the ec omy and the priorities for
infrastructure investments, the effective demand for engineers and technicians
is estimated to grow by about 4% per annum. The capacity of the Institute of



-2-
Engineering (IOE) of Tribhuvar University to meet the projected demand is
inadsquate. The IOE is the only Institute to provide engineering e*ucation in
Nep.i. snd graduates about 300 techniciAns in a range of engineering subject.
and aDout 55 civil engineers annually. This level of output, particularly of
engineers, is insufficient to meet existing and projected demand and as a
consequence Nepal remains dependent on foreign-trained engineers mostly
financed by donors. Moreover, opportunities for Nepali students to obtain
good-quality engineering training in neighboring countries are diminishing and
becoming more costly. The nature of Nepal's development efforts, combined
with technological change throughout the formal sector, requires that the
spectrum of engineering skills available to the economy as well as the supply
of engineers and technicians be increased.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Past investments ln the IOE provide a
basis for the expansion and further improvement of engineering education in
Nepal. IDA has had a long association with the IOE and is in a unique
position to provide continued support for expansion and institutional reforms
initiated under the First and Second Education Projects (Credits 772-NEP and
1198-NEP). To date IDA has been the key donor in providing support for
engineering education. Other donors are assisting with improving secondary
education, expanding technical education and strengthening sector management.
In addition, IDA and UNICEF are jointly supporting the expansion of primary
education (Credit 1463-NEP), and IDA with USAID is financing the training of
higher-level agricultural manpower (Credit 1534-NEP).
6.       Project Objectives.  The project is designed to:  (a) expand IOE's
enrollment capacity of the technician program from 1,370 to about 1,700
students and that of the engineering degree program from 360 to about 920
students through construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of facilities;
(b) improve the quality of engineering education through training of staff,
improving curricula, providing educational materials and raising admission and
examination standards; and (c) improve IOE's management through strengthening
the Office of the Dean, training managerial and administrative staff,
developing a Management Information System and establishing a Manpower
Development Unit.
7.       Project Description.  The project would:  (a) finance a program of
construction, rehabilitation and maintenance of facilities at the three IOE
campuses, Pulchowk and Thapathali in Kathmandu and Pokhara in the Western
Region; (b) finance staff development for about 125 teaching, support and
administrative staff; (c) assist with the improvement of existing curricula
and the development of new ones, which would include reforms of admission and
examination standards; and (d) finance management development, including the
strengthening and reorganization of the senior management structure,
establishing executive and governing committees and training of managerial and
administrative staff. The project, to be carried out over eight years, would
finance civil works, furniture, equipment, training, experts, books and
incremental maintenance, salaries ana services.  The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$ 26.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component
of US$ 17.8 million (68X). A breakdown of the costs and financing plan, with
cofinancing, is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Nepal are given in schedules C and D respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7555-NEP dated May 15, 1989 is
being distributed separately.

8.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following key
actions and policy changes. At negotiations, it provided evidence of: the
establishment of maintenance teams, programs and budgets for each campus; the
approval of changes in academic regulations pertaining to teaching load, leave
and sabbatical; and, the approval of the new management organization of the
IOE. During negotiations the Government agreed to: require applicants for the
degree program to sit for a comon admission test by July 1993; carry out the
management reorganization in accordance with a program and timetable
satisfactory to the Association; and, incorporate academic regulations by July
31, 1993 that require students to pass the examination(s) of prerequisite
courses before they are allowed to take follow-up courses. As conditions for
credit effectiveness, the Government has agreed to establish the key positions
in the new management organization of the three Associate Deans and appoint
qualified staff to these positions by July 15, 1989; obtain formal agreements
from the CIDA and SDC; and establish and staff the Project Implementation Unit
by July 15, 1989.
9.       Benefits.  The project would assist the IOE to acquire the capacity
to offer Bachelor of Science degree programs and certificate programs in
Civil, Electrical, Electronics and Mechanical Engineering and in Architecture
and Rural Planning and meet about 90% of the projected demand for engineers
and technicians. With skills tailored to the particular needs of Nepal, these
engineers and technicians wouijd be trained to design, operate, supervise and
maintain the country's economic infrastructure and assets. A manpower unit
would be established to improve manpower forecasting, training and
deployment. The project would achieve cost savings for the economy by
substituting locally trained engineers for higher paid expatriate ones.
Moreover, unit training costs would be lowered by increasing class size and
teaching loads and through better utilization of staff and facilities.
10.      Risks.  The major risk concerns the possibility of a flagging
commitment within the Government to meaningful reforms of staff regulations,
management, maintenance and accreditation procedures. To address this risk,
the GoveLnment provided evidence during negotiations that it has approved such
reforms. It also agreed to appoint key management staff by July 15, 1989.
Because of the current impasse between India and Nepal oni reaching new
agreements on trade and transit, it is possible that there may be delays and
increased costs for this project. However, HMG is making every effort to
resolve this issue, and the financial contingencies provided in the cost
estimates for this project are expected to cover any cost increases caused by
delays.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
