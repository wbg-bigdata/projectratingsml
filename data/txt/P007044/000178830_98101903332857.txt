ADDENDUM
1.        This Appraisal Report was completed on the basis of additional
information obtained from Empresa le6ctrica Quito (EEQ) during negotia-
tions (July 1971). Figures for 1971 revenues shown in this report
accordingly reflect a 35% tariff increase approved by the Government in
April 1971 and introduced in May 1971. However, the new tariffs were
charged only during May and EEQ and the Government subsequently agreed
instead to raise tariffs in stages in such way that the previously agreed
35% increase would not be billed in full until January 1, 1972.
2.        Preliminary financial inforrnation for 1971 indicates that this
decision reduced revenue about S/12 million below the S/136 million
estimated during the appraisal (Annex 11). The effect on EEQ's cash
position during the year was minimal because the construction program
was also delayed. The rate of return on net fixed assets in operation
in 1971 was about 5", compared to the appraisal estimate of 7.6-ot. How-
ever, the financial performance forecast for 1972 is not expected to differ
materially from that estimated during the appraisal. The rate of return
for that year should be over 10% and the substantive conclusions in the
report on the merits of the proposed project remain unchanged.
3.        The delays in construction will cause a slight change in the
disbursement schedule (Annex 5) inasmuch as no disbursement can be made
before the effective date of the credit, now assumed to be not later than
May 1, 1972. Disbursements should be rapid thereafter and are expected
to reach the forecast level by early 1973.

APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
EMPRESA ELECTRICA "QUITO" S. A.
ECUADOR
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Third Power Project of
the Empresa Electrica "Quito" S. A. (EEQ), a power agency owned by the
Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (56%) and by the Municipality of
Quito (hi%). EEQ was established in 1955 as the successor to the Empresa
Electrica Municipal and the Quito Electric Light Company, and is respon-
sible for the generation and distribution of electricity in Quito and its
environs.  In the late 1950's it obtained two Bank loans (137-EC and 177-EC)
totaling US$10 million for the first stage of the Cumbaya Hydro Project,
some diesel plant and distribution. These facilities are operating satis-
factorily.
ii.       The Project includes the construction of a 30 MW hydro-electric
station at Nay6n on the San Pedro river; 18 MW of diesel-electric plant;
22 kV and 46 kV transmission lines and substations; and improvement and
expansion of the Cant6n Quito distribution system. The Project also
includes consultant assistance for management, administrative and tariff
matters of EEQ and a study of its future power generation.
iii.      The cost of the Project is estimated to be US$18.7 million.  It
will be completed in 1974 and is about 85% of EEQ's US$22.3 million 1971 -
1975 expansion program. The Project's foreign exchange cost is estimated at
US$12.7 million. Most of the foreign currency cost would be met by the
proposed IDA Credit of US$6.8 million and by US$5.6 million from suppliers'
credits. The balance of EEQ's requirements would be financed by a loan
from the Corporacion Financiera Nacional of S/65 million (US$2.6 million),
equity contributions of S/84.4 million (US$3.4 million) local bank loans
and internal cash generation.
iv.       In the early 1960's EEQ's finances were in a deplorable state,
mainly due to delay in increasing tariffs. More than two years were spent
in attempts to raise EEQ's tariffs, during which time EEQ was in default on
its two Bank loans, (Nos. 137-EC and 177-EC) which had to be serviced by the
Ecuadorian Government under its guarantee. At the same time several other
creditors had difficulty in collecting payments due. A tariff increase was
ultimately allowed effective January 1, 1964. From 1964 to 1968, EEQ's
financial conditions improved and the company was able to service its debt
and to finance a 20 MW extension to the Cumbaya plant mainly from its own
resources.



- ii -
v.        EEQ requested Bank Group assistance in financing the Project in
1967 and the first appraisal was made at the beginning of 1969. A 10%
tariff increase found to be needed at that time was rejected by EEQ, and
IDA was unable to consider financing the Project. With the appointment
of a new Board of Directors and General Manager in the second half of
1970, EEQ again approached the Bank Group. However, the finances of EEQ
had markedly deteriorated during the period when its expansion was delayed,
and a 35% tariff increase was found to be necessary. This was granted
effective May 1, 1971, and should put the Empresa in a satisfactory
financial position to carry out its expansion program.
vi.       The Nay6n hydro plant is the least cost means of meeting Quito's
electricity requirements for discount rates up to 15%. EEQ's consultants
coipleted a study of the Project in 1966.  Due to lack of funds major
contracting was delayed until this year and Nayon is now scheduled for
completion by the end of 1973. The diesel units have to be installed as
the only means of expeditiously meeting interim demand. With these
facilities generation capacity should be adequate until early 1975, when
Instituto Nacional Ecuatoriano de Electrificaci6n (INECEL), the national
electricity company, hopes to complete the first stage Pucara plant
(65 MW) of its Pisayamnbo hydro development. The Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank is presently considering financing this project.
vii.      Procurement for contracts to be financed by IDA is being carried
out on the basis of international competitive bidding with a preference
up to 15% for local bids on goods produced in Ecuador. Contracts for the
main Nay6n civil works and for 9 MW of diesel plant were awarded in late
1970 with IDA approval. Up to US$1.4 million of retroactive financing is
proposed.
viii.     EEQ's management and administration have been seriously deficient
during the last decade, and for some years the position of Financial Director
has been vacant. The present Board and General Manager appreciate EEQ.s
shortcomings and have engaged the services of management consultants, which
would be financed through the proposed Credit.
ix.       The rate of return on EEQ's average net assets in operation would
rise from 7.6% in 1971 to 9.2% in 1975. The internal financial rate of
return on the 1971-1976 time slice of EEQ's program would only be 8% because
of the heavy backlog of construction to restore adequate service quality
and the high operating cost of diesel plant needed to make up for the
delay in completing the Nay6n plant.
x.        The IDA Credit of US$6.8 million would be made to the Government
of Ecuador which would lend the amount to EEQ at an interest rate of 7 1/ES
per annum for approximately 24 years including a grace period of 4 years.
The Government would include interest during construction of about US$1.2
million in its loan to EEQ to bring the total loan amount to US$8.0 million
equivalent which would be repaid in equal semi-annual payments commencing
July 1, 1975.



APPRAISAL OF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
EMPRESA ELECTRICA "QUITO" S. A.
ECUADOR
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The government of Ecuador has requested a Credit from the Associa-
tion to assist in financing the 1971-1975 expansion program of Empresa
Electrica "Quito" S. A. (EEQ). EEQ is responsible for the supply of
electricity in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, and its surroundings. A Credit
of US$6.8 million equivalent is proposed to cover part of the foreign
exchange cost of the Project, the total cost of which is about US$18.7
million. The Borrower would be the Government of Ecuador and the Beneficiary
EEQ. The loan from the Government to EEQ would be for US$8.0 million equiv-
alent at 7 1/4% interest for a period of 24 years, with a grace period of
4 years, and would include interest during construction of US$1.2 million.
1.02      The Project would comprise the construction of a 30 MW hydro-
electric plant at Nayon on the San Pedro River; an 18 MW diesel-electric
plant in Quito; 46 kV and 22 kV transmission lines; the improvement and
extension of EEQts distribution networks; engineering services; consult-
ant assistance for management; a tariff study; a network study; a study over a
period of time of the social cost and benefits attributable to village electri-
fication; and complementary consultant studies and surveys for generation
extensions.
1.03      The Bank made two loans to EEQ in the late 1950's for the first
stage of the Cumbaya hydro-electric plant, some diesel plant and distri-
bution. These works were completed by the end of 1961 and have been
operating satisfactorily. In the early 1960's EEQ's finances were in a
deplorable state, mainly due to delay in increasing tariffs. More than
two years were spent in attempts to raise EEQ's tariffs, during which
time EEQ was in default on its two Bank Loans, Nos. 137-EC and 177-EC,
which had to be serviced by the Ecuadorian Government under its guarantee.
At the same time several other creditors had difficulty in collecting pay-
ments due. A tariff increase was ultimately allowed effective January 1, 1964.
From 1964 to 1968, EEQ's financial conditions improved and the company was
able to service its debt and to finance a 20 MW extension to the Cumbaya
plant mainly from its own resources.
1.04      In 1967 EEQ requested IDA assistance in financing its develop-
ment program and the Nayon project was appraised for the first time in
early 1969. However, neither the General Manager nor the Manicipality
of Quito (IMQ), which has an important voice on EEQ's Board, were prepared
to accept the recommendations that tariffs be increased by some 10%, as
was required at that time; and IDA was unable to consider financing the
Project. EEQ's financial position deteriorated once more, and the company
was unable to make the necessary further extensions of its facilities,
resulting in the present deficits in capacity and energy capabilities and
in overloaded networks.



1.05      After the appointment of a new General Manager to EEQ in August
1970, and a change of the Board of Directors following the election of a
new Mayor of Quito, EEQ again approached the Association to assist in
financing the Nayon project. The Government has since allowed EEQ to
raise its tariffs by an average of 35% effective May 1, 1971, which, on
present forecasts, is sufficient to enable EEQ to earn a reasonable rate
of return on its net fixed assets in operation and to generate a reason-
able amount of cash towards its construction program.
1.06      This report is based on a feasibility stuly,prepared by EEQ's
consultants, Electric Power Developnent Co. Ltd., of Japan and on infor-
mation supplied by EEQ to an appraisal mission, consisting of Messrs.
W. F. Kupper and Alan A. M. Onslow, which visited Ecuador in January/
February 1971.

2. THE ECONOMY
2.01      Ecuador is situated in the north-west region of the South American
continent. The Andean mountain system crosses the country from north to
south, dividing it into three regions with marked orographic and climatic
differences:  (i) The coastal region is tropical.  About 45% of the total
estimated population of about 6 million lives in this area, where the port
of Guayaquil, the largest and most industrialized city in Ecuador, is
situated; (ii) The central region consists of two ranges of the Andes and
a high valley between these ranges. About 50% of the population lives in
this valley, which has a temperate climate. The city of Quito, capital
and second largest city in Ecuador, is situated here; (iii) The eastern,
largely undeveloped region of Ecuador which has a purely tropical climate,
is formed by the upper Amazon river basin.
2.02      The economy of Ecuador depends to a large extent upon agriculture,
which amounts to about one-third of the GNP. The two main crops are bananas
and coffee which together accounted for about 77% of total 1970 exports.
Industry is mainly concentrated around Gaayaquil and consumes about 40% of
electric energy sold by the Empresa Electrica del Ecuador (EMELEC), a
subsidiary of Boise-Cascade of the USA 1/; and around Quito where it accounts
for about 25% of EEQ's energy sales. No substantial inflationary trends
have been apparent in the economy in recent times. Over 1965-69 prices
increased at about 3.7% per year, which is very modest by most standards.
The higher price increase of 7% experienced in 1970 is largely attributable
to the August devaluation.
2.03      Recent major oil discoveries in north-east Ecuador near Lake Agrio
(see Map 1) may have a considerable impact on economic development in
Ecuador in general and consequently on the development of the power sector.
An oil pipe line, now under construction to the port of Esmeraldas, would
have an initial capacity of about 250,000 barrels per day and is expected
to be completed in 1972. Royalties on oil production are expected to amount
to about US$18 million in 1973 and are expected to be higher in subsequent
years. About 50% of these royalties have been earmarked for development of
the country's power sector, for which purpose a National Fund for Electrifi-
cation was created in May 1970.
2.04      Resources made available as a result of petroleum exports will
enable Ecuador to achieve a much more rapid rate of growth than in the past.
A recent Bank economic report projected the rate of growth over 1971-1976
at 8% per year. Manufacturing, the output of which has been growing at 10%
per year, will grow even more rapidly. Andean integration should provide an
additional stimulus for growth of the industrial sector. It is already
evident that failure to expand electric power generating facilities in Quito
is exerting a constraint on industrial growth. Unless the power supply
situation is remedied, serious adverse consequence for development of the
region could result.

3. THE POWER SECTOR
Characteristics of the Sector
3.01      Except in Quito and Guayaquil, which are supplied by EEQ and
EMELEC respectively, electric supply in the country is splintered and
unorganized. Hundreds of plants, most of them small, cater to small
communities and private industry.  In general, maximum demand is not met
and facilities are overloaded and badly maintained. Ecuador has some
60 companies with plants larger than 100 kW and an undetermined number
of companies owning smaller plants.
3.02      Annex 1 shows national electrical statistics for the period 1964-
1969 in respect of plants of 100 kW and larger. Installed capacity increased
from 175 MW in 1964 to 270 MW in 1969, or about 9% annually. Generated
energy for the same period increased from 524 GWh to about 850 GWK or 10.2%
annually. In 1969, EMELEC and EEQ together accounted for about 65% of the
total generation. Annual per capita generation increased from 104 kWh in
1964. to 142 kWI in 1969 (or 6.3% annually) which is still low. In 1969 the
average for Latin America was about 450 kli/capita.
INECEL
3.03      As a result of discussions between Bank staff and Ecuadorian
officials about how to improve the organization of the power sector, the
Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificacion (INECEL) was created in 1961 but
its assignment has been changed many times. Originally, INECEL's functions
included those of a regulatory agency, but very early in its history these
responsibilities were transferred to the former Ministry of Industry and
Commerce and INECEL's role was primarily that of a State Power Company,
with limited funds and powers, gradually taking over or associating itself
with smaller electric utilities.  In August 1970, however, INECEL was in
addition redesignated the power regulatory agency under the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Tourism (Annex 7).
3.04      INECEL has been preparing a master plan -- with the assistance
of consultants -- with the object of integrating the many utilities in the
country, first on a regional basis and then on a national basis. Due to
lack of funds, and its inability to obtain Government approval for revision
of tariffs, INECEL's effect on the power industry has been small.
Future Developments
3.05      The oil royalties to be received by the National Fund for Electri-
fication are expected to be made available to INECEL which is expected to
finance, construct and operate from 1975 or 1976 onward practically all new
generating and transmission facilities in the country. Gradually INECEL
would interconnect most of the larger companies, and most of the small
uneconomic plants would be put on standby.



3.06      INECEL would, in due course, thus become Ecuador's principal
power company. However, plans for the integrated development of Ecuador's
power sector have yet to be finalized by INECEL. A National Electrification
Program, formulated by INECEL in 1966 and 1967 has not been revised since,
though INECEL subsequently studied the market for both the northern and
southern halves of the country and recently prepared a preliminary study on
the development of the main generation and transmission systems in Ecuador
(see Annex 2).
3.07      INECEL's present plans are to complete by 1975 its first major
generating project, the 65 MW Pacara hydro plant of the Pisayambo Develop-
ment (see Map 1). The Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) has recently
appraised this project which would interconnect and supply electric
energy to the main towns in the central region of Ecuador, including Quito
(see paragraph 4.17). Subsequent requirements in this area would be met
by constructing the Toachi hydro plant (see Map 1) and further extending
Pisayambo.
3.08      By 1977 INECEL hopes to complete a 100 MW plant on the Paute
River in southern Ecuador (see Map 1) for supply to Guayaquil. In the
meantime EMELEC, the Wuayaquil power company, is expected to extend its
all-thermal generating facilities by some 100-150 MW. INECEL would meet
all EMELEC's generation and transmission requirements after 1977.
3.09      By 1985-1989 the whole country would be integrated and further
generation requirements would probably be met from hydro facilities on
the Paute and the lower Jubones River, which together have a hydro
potential of some 1,400 MW.

4. THE BE'EFICIARf
4.01      EEQ was established in 1955.  The company is the successor of
the Enpresa El6ctrica 4Lricipal, established in 1934 as a department of
the Municipality of Quito to supplement the generating and distribution
facilities of the formner Qaito Electric ,ight ComparW, a subsidiary of
the American and Foreign ?ower Company.  In 1946 the Municipality bought
all the fasilities of the Quito El1ectric Light Company.
4.02      At the end of 1970 EEQ had only two shareholders:  the Municipality
of Quito (IMQ) and the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS), which
respectively hJld 44%  and 56% of the subscribed capital  of S/221 million.
A recenrt Governmellt Decree, however, opened the possibility of industrial
companies as wiell as private investors obtaining shares in EQ.  The Decree
obliges industrial consumers to contribute an additional 10% of their
monthly bills to FEQ as equity.  Shares so acquired would be tradeable in
the open market.
Organization and Management
4.03      The Board of Directors, composed of five persons, is elected by
the shareholcers.  Two memabers are appointed by IMQ, two members by IESS
and the fifth is elected by the other four.  The Board elects one of its
members as President of the Company (presently the Mayor of Quito). The
members ser';e staggered terms not exceeding four years and are eligible
for reappointment. The Board controls broad policy. It appoints the
General Marnager - who is responsible for effective day to day operations
of the conpany - the Auditor, the Technical Director, and the Financial
Director.
I4.04     For some time now, EEQ's managerial, financial and administrative
development seriously lagged behind its technical development.  The new
Board and General Manager, who were appointed in the second half of 1970,
are aware of shortcomings in the Em!resa and are taking active steps to
rectify them, including an early appointment to the Financial Director's
post, which has been vacant for some years. The Board has agreed to engage
the services of consultants to improve management methods (paragraph 7.08)
prior to the Credit being made effective.  Although financial planning is poor,
EEQ's accounting is generally good and information is produced promptly.
During negotiations, EEQ agreed to:  (i) cons-alt with IDA from time to time
on actions it proposes to take on the consultants' recommendations; (ii)
appoint as soon as possible but not later than six months after Credit
signing, in consultation with IDA, a properly qualified and experienced
Financial Director; and (iii) consult with IDA on any appointment to the
posts of General Manager, Technical Director and Financial Director.
4.05      EEQ intends to update its charter (Estatutos), dating from 1955,
to reflect present conditions and current law on such matters as shares
and shareholders, tariffs and rate of return.  The company will consult



- 7 -
from time to time with IDA on its proposals. During negotiations EEQ and
the Government have agreed to amend its charter after consultations with
IDA prior to the Credit being made effective, and only to make further
amendments after consultation with IDA.
Staff
4.o6      EEQ's staffing situation is reasonable, and staff relations are
satisfactory. The company employs about 850 regular staff (about one
employee per ninety customers); its staff has been increasing by about 1%
each year. The company's labor union is strong. Wages and salaries are
considered to be above average for comparable work in Ecuador and have
been increasing about 6.5% annually in real terms during 1965-1970.
Tariff Structure
4.07      The structure of EEQ's tariffs has not been revised for many
years, and the 1961, 1964 and 1971 tariff adjustments may have caused
imbalances between the various classes of consumers. EEQ is aware of
this and plans to engage consultants for a study of its tariffs. In view
of its importance, the necessary funds for this study have been included
in the proposed credit, (see paragraph 5.05 (iv) and Annex 7), and, as a
condition of effectiveness, EEQ will appoint consultants for the tariff
study, on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA.
Existing Facilities
4.08      Because of past financing problems and consequent delays in
construction, EEQ's facilities are inadequate to meet demand which from
time to time has to be reduced by lowering voltage during peak hours.
Map 2 shows EEQ's principal power stations and its transmission lines,
which consist of about 20 km of 46 kV lines and about 50 km of 22 kV
lines. EEQ operates four hydro-electric plants totaling 52 MW on the
San Pedro River, of which Cumbay'a with 40 MW is the largest. All the
plants are run of the river type, although Guangopolo (9.4 MW) and Cumbaya.
(40 MW) have daily pondage; thus supply is very sensitive to current
hydrological conditions.
4.09      EEQrs hydro capacity is augmented by purchases from two small
privately-owned hydro plants (1.2 MW). Additionally, EEQ owns and operates
some 9.7 MW of diesel plant. Prior to 1969 the diesel plant was only used
during the three dry season months of the year (July through September),
but it is now operating at least six months a year in order to meet demand.
4.10      Historical demand, generation and sales of EEQ are shown in Annex 3.
The total capability in 1970 was about 63 MW compared with a maximum demand
of about 58 MW, i.e., demand almost reached installed capacity, which
illustrates the necessity to install new plant as soon as possible. An
estimated energy deficit of about 2 GWh (1.5%) occurred in 1969 and about
7 GWh (3.5%) in 1970. The system annual load factor is about 50%. Industrial
sales are forecast to be proportionally higher by 1975, thus increasing
the expected load factor to about 52% in that year.



-8-
4.11      In the past, losses have been as high as 30Q, but by 1968 EEQ had
reduced them to about 19%. The main part of these losses is caused by the
present poor condition of EEQ's network and the lo-wering of voltage at times
of maximum demand.  Losses are expected to approximate 18% by 1974 and may
well be lower in view of EEQ's active program to reduce them.
EEQ's Investment Program
4.12      EEQ's 1971-75 investment program (excluding La Mica (see paragraph
4.17)) totals S/557.7 million (US$22.3 nmllion) and would add 52 MW to EEQ's
capacity. The major item is the 30 IMW Nay6n hydro plant on which construction
was started in 1968 and is about 10 completed. This plant is the least cost
next step in EEQ's generation program (Annex 6).  The access roads, tunnel
adits, a pilot tunnel, the penstock bed, and the power station platform are
completed. Nay6n was originally scheduled for initial operation in early
1972, but when IDA was unable to consider lending (see paragraph 1.04) in
1969, EEQ was compelled to slow down progress because of a lack of funds.
The station is now expected to be completed by the end of 1973.
4.13      The main civil works for Nay6n will be carried out by Mitsui of
Japan, who was awarded the contract at the end of 1970, after international
competitive bidding. Mitsui has a contract calling for cash payments; should
the proposed IDA Credit be made, part of the proceeds would be applied to the
foreign currency component of this contract. The electrical and mechanical
equipment for Nayon is being provided by Mitsubishi under a supplier credit.
4.14      The program also includes 22 MW of diesel plant of which 4 MW were
purchased in 1969 with suppliers' credits and are nlow being installed in the
existing diesel station in the north of Quito. In order to meet the 1971
demand. international tenders for 9 SW of the remaining 18 MW were invited
in 1970; the award was made to General Motors of the U.S. in January 1971
with IDA approval. The balance of 9 MW will be procured this year to meet
the 1972 demand. A new diesel station is now under construction in the
nerth of Quito to accommodate the additional 18 MW in diesel capacity.
4.15      A significant amoLut of distribution investment is being planned
to strengthen, rehabilitate and extend the existing networks including some
village electrification; a considerable improvement in Quito's street
lighting is also included in the program. A large part of the distribution
cost, except for the street lighting and village electrification, will be
covered by the Mitsubishi supplier credit for the Nay6n equipment.
4.16      Jointly with the Emapresa de Agua Potable, EQ expects to complete
in early 1972 the 4.5 MW rasachoa hydro project for which most of the
expenditure has already been made.
4.17      EEQ's program also tentatively includes the construction of the
La Mica hydro-electric davelopmaent, situated on the Amazon side of the Andes,
which would divert water to the San Pedro River.  In addition to its proposed
installed capacity uf 16 MMW, the scheme would increase the capability of the
existing plants by somo 12 MW during the dry season.  if INECEL actually starts
construction of the Pucara hydro project this year (see paragraph 3.07), La
Mica should be postponed for at least three years.

5. THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
5.01      The third power project consists of about 85% of EEQ's 1971-75
program and would comprise:
(i)  The 30 MW Nay6n hydro plant (see Map 2).  This plant, with
two 15 MW Kaplan units, will be the third power station in
cascade, using waters of the San Pedro River (together with
Guangopolo and Cumbaya). It will be essentially a run of
the river plant operating under a head of about 97 m and
connected to the Cumrbaya tailrace by means of a tunnel
about 2.5 km long. The geological and hydrological conditions
are similar to those of the existing plants. On average,
Nayon will generate about 115 GWh annually.  Firm power
(i.e. minimum dependable capability during sustained extreme
dry conditions) will be about 6.7 MW. To ensure continued
operation when Cumbaya is shut down, a by-pass tunnel
about 1.7 km long will be constructed for the Cumbaya plant.
This would also increase Nay6n's average annual energy
capability by about 6%;
(ii) Construction of a new diesel power station, with 18 MW of
diesel-electric plant;
(iii) Transmission lines and substations to complete the 46 kV
ring system for Quito to improve and extend the supply to
the city, including conversion of some lines from 22 kV to
46 kV;
(iv)  Equipment, including transformers and street lighting
components, to renovate, strengthen and expand the dis-
tribution system for Quito;
(v) Electrification of a number of small villages in the north-
west part of Canton Quito. This part of the project will be
carried out in conjunction with study over a period of time of the
social costs and benellts attributable to electrification, to act as
a guide to judging future village electrification schemes; and
(vi) Engineering and construction supervision of the Nay6n hydro
plant, studies for EEQ's next step in generation, a network study;
and consultant assistance to EEQ for management and administration,
and for tariffs.
Cost of the Project
5.02      The estimated cost of the Project is about S/A72 million (US$18.7
million), as shown in the following table. A more detailed breakdown is
shown in Annex 4.

2  Does not include SA18,535,000 (US$741,400) spent prior to 1971.
No price contingency is shown for the foreign exchange because most
major contracts have already been placed (see paragraph 5.03).
5.03      The cost estimates were prepared by EEQ in conjunction with its
consultants, Electric Power Develolment Co. Ltd., (EPDC) of Japan.  The
estimates are largely based on contracts already placed for civil works
and electro-mechanical equipment for the Nay6n planlt (Mitsui and Mitsubishi
of Japan); for 9 MW of the diesel plant (General Motors of USA); and for
the supply of transmission and distribution equipment (Mitsubishi). To
cover increases in cost due to any difficulties which might arise during
the construction of the Project, and unforeseen extras, a physical con-
tingency allowance of 9% has been included in the estimate. An additional
allowance of 18% in local construction cost of the various works has been
included to cover price escalation of 8% - 9% per year expected during the
four-year construction period.
5.04      The total cost of the Nay6n hydro plant, including expenditures
already made, but excluding interest during construction, would be about
S/227 million (US$9.0 million)or US$300 per installed kW, which is reasonable.
Allocation of the Credit
5.05      The proposed IDA Credit of US$6.8 million equivalent would finance
the foreign exchange component of the following items of the Project:
(i)  Civil works of the Nay6n plant, and all works for the Cumbaya
by-pass - US$1.5 million;
(ii)  Equipment and services for the 18 MW diesel power station -
US$2.9 million;



- 11 -
(iii)  Transmission and distribution equipment totaling US$1.680
million comprising: line-switching and substation equipment,
including transformers - US$230 thousand, some distribution
line equipment comprising cement, steel and racks for con-
crete poles, and equipment for the 1972-1973 streetlighting
development program - US$1.0 million, distribution equipment,
including transformers, for village electrification -
US$450 thousand; and
(iv)  Consulting costs totaling US$720 thousand comprising:
engineering of the Nay6n Project - US$170 thousand; drilling
and surveying for the final feasibility study of La Mica -
US$100 thousand, and a study of a thermal alternative
Us$50 thousand; a network study - US$70 thousand; a village
electrification social cost and benefit study - US$50 thousand;
management assistance - US$230 thousand; and a tariff study -
US$50 thousand.
Procurement and Disbursement
5.06      All contracts for the works to be financed from the proposed
Credit (except consultant services) have been or will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding. Forpurposes of evaluating
bids on some locally produced goods preference to local bidders will be
given up to the amount of any taxes on the importation of such goods or
15%, whichever shall be lower. EEQ is exempt from the payment of arn
import duties on imported goods not produced in Ecuador.
5.07      Disbursements will be for the foreign currency cost of equipment
and services only. For orders on locally produced goods placed with
Ecuadorian suppliers, the Association would reimburse EEQ for 40C of the
contract cost, this percentage being the average estimated foreign exchange
component. Retroactive financing amounting to about US$1.4 million is pro-
posed for those items which are of utmost urgency, and for which contracts
have already been let, i.e., the 9 MW of diesel plant required by fall 1971
and the civil works part of the construction of the Nay6n plant. Annex 5
shows the estimated quarterly disbursements for the proposed Credit. The
Project is expected to be completed in 1974; the closing date would be
December 31, 1974. Should the foreign exchange cost to complete the Project
be less than the estimate, any undisbursed amount of the proposed Credit
would be canceled.
Engineering and Construction
5.o8      Engineering design and the supervision of construction for the
Nay6n plant, the Cumbaya by-pass, and associated transmission lines would
be carried out by EPDC, which would continue to be engaged under its
contract with EEQ. EEQ will continue to employ consultants acceptable to
the Association and to the extent considered necessary by the Association
for supervising the execution of the Project. The transmission, distribution
and diesel plant would be designed andsupervisedby EEQ, which is competent to
do so.



- 12 -
Project Supervision
5.09      EEQ's management and financial control has been weak in the past
but with the use of management and engineering consultants it should improve
over the next few years. Supervision visits by IDA staff would be made to
Ecuador at about six-monthly intervals.
Ecology
5.10      The Nay6n plant is the third step in the development of the power
potential of the San Pedro River. The earlier plants were constructed in
1937 and 1961. This area, which lies on a plateau with little vegetation,
is only sparsely inhabited. No ecological problems were encountered in the
past and none ,are expected from Nayon.



- 13 -
6. JUSTIFICATION
Load Forecast
6.01      During the twenty-four years 1947 through 1970 sales in Quito
increased at an average annual rate of about 9.3%, from 28 GWh to 211 GWh,
while system maximum demand increased from 8.7 MW to 57.7 MW. However,
during 1969 and 1970, demand was suppressed. After making adjustments for
higher potential sales and maximum demand in these two years, growth rates
for the years 1965-1970 would have been about 11.3% for sales and 10.9%
for maximum demand.
6.02      The recent suppression of demand, the tariff increase of 35%, and
the August 1970 devaluation of the sucre make forecasting of sales and
demand over the next five years difficult. The forecast adopted in this
report (see Annex 6) follows the basic approach used by EEQ and INECEL,
modified during the appraisal and accepted by EEQ and INECEL for the tariff
adjustment calculations. Sales are projected to increase annually by 10.5%,
in 1971 and 1972, rising to 11.5% in 1973 and to 12% annually by 1974. The
lower growth rates during the first two years reflect the possible effects
of the recent tariff increase, and also the voltage reduction which will
continue until overloaded substation transformers have been replaced.
Transmission, distribution and other system losses are expected to account
for 18-20% of total generation during the years 1971 through 1975. On
this basis gross generation and maximum demand are forecast to increase
11.2% annually during the next five years reaching 440 GWh and 98 MW
respectively in 1975. The forecast appears reasonable in view of the
expected improvement of Ecuador's economy (see paragraph 2.04) which would
result in increased electricity sales.
6.03      Annex 3 shows the forecast of EEQ's sales, gross generation and
maximum demand, together with the required capacity, available capacity,
and capacity additions, as well as a generation schedule.
Project Justification
6.04      EEQ's decision in 1968 to construct the Nay6n station was taken
after its consultants had made a cost comparison with alternative thermal
plant which showed Nay6n to be the least cost means of expansion for discount
rates up to at least 20%. The comparison was based on the then current
price of US$4.96 per barrel for Bunker "C" oil, which did not include taxes.
A revised calculation by the Bank using US$2.20 per barrel (which appears to
be a reasonable price for oil from the new pipeline) shows that Nayon would
still be preferred to thermal plant for discount rates up to 15% (see Annex 6).
6.05      Because the construction of Nay6n was delayed, EEQ is now forced
into an expensive "crash" program of diesel generating capacity in order to
meet requirements prior to commissioning of Nay6n. Gas turbines are not an
economic alternative because they would operate at only 50-60% of normal



- 14 -
(sea level) output at Quito's 2,800 m altitude. Load shedding, as an
alternative to installing diesel plant, would be unacceptable because it
would be even more costly to the economy in terms of lost industrial
production. EEQ has estimated that in 1970 about 4 GWh could not be
supplied to industry which had to curtail production by an estimated 7%.
Lost production would be at least double this amount in 1971 and 1972 in
the event no generating additions are made and would have serious
secondary effect on the economy.
6.06      The internal financial rate of return on EEQ's 1971-1976 expansion
program is about 8% (see Annex 6). This low return is not surprising be-
cause: (a) EEQ has to install high cost diesel plant (although the capital
cost is modest, the operating costs are extremely high due to the present
fuel price, which EEQ will have to pay during this period, of US$6.12 per
barrel or about US$1.10 per million Btu, excluding taxes); and (b) the
present program is burdened with the additional investment required to
restore adequate service quality. The calculation does not take into
account, as a benefit attributable to the diesel plant, the avoidance of
industrial production losses since from the data available in Ecuador,
"value added to the economy" cannot be quantified.
6.07      The small program of village electrification included in the
Project (see para. 5.01 (v)) does not appear to be justified on normal
financial grounds. The basis for the inclusion of the program within the
Project is that it is a pilot program, so far as the Association is con-
cerned, for which the social costs and benefits would be carfully monitored
over time. The social benefits are expected to include such items as the
development of small industries, discouragement of population drift towards
the towns, general improvement in living conditions, etc. EEQ has agreed
to cooperate with the Association in carrying out such a long-term study
and will appoint consultants for this study, on terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA.



- 15 -
7. FINANCE
7.01      Since the Association first appraised the Nay6n Project in 1969,
EEQ's finances have deteriorated, mainly due to the unwillingness of the
former Mayor of Quito and EEQ's former General Manager to permit needed
tariff increases. With the appointment of a new General Manager in August
1970, and a change of the Board of Directors following the election of
a new Mayor of Quito last year, it is expected that substantial improve-
ments will be seen in EEQ in the next few years, particularly in its
financial planning. The Government has allowed EEQ to raise its tariffs
by an average of 35% effective May 1, 1971.
Past Record and Present Position
7.02      Balance Sheets and Income Accounts for 1967-70 are shown in
Annexes 8 and 9. In 1967 the ratio of operating expenses (excluding
depreciation) to revenue collected was 46%; by 1970 it had risen to 56%.
During the last four years, operating costs have risen by about 18% per
annum compared with a 10% annual increase in klns sold: one of the main
increases being in wages. If wage rates continue to increase at the same
pace further tariff increases will be needed to avoid renewed deterior-
ation in EEQ's finances.
7.03      EEQ does not credit revenue with the actual amount billed to
customers, but holds it in suspense as a deferred credit until a customer
has paid his account. It is then taken into revenue. As of December 31,
1970, receivables from customers, other than IMQ and the Government, in-
cluded about S/2.1 million, which have been outstanding since before 1970.
EEQ has made a provision in its accounts of an amount equal to these old
outstandinR receivables.
7.04      IMQ has also been in arrears with EEQ for some years.  The reason
given was that IMQ is a stockholder in EEQ and has received little or no
return on its capital. Notwithstanding IMQ's refusal to permit timely
tariff adjustments in the past, IMQ felt that it should receive some
recompense and so did not settle its accounts with EEQ. As at December 31,
1970, IMQ owed EEQ S/23.0 million ($0.9 million)  (see paragraph 7.11).
7.05      Prior to 1968, the Government also did not pay its accounts with
EEQ, mainly because EEQ owed the Government some S/45 million on account of
debt service paid on EEQts behalf. However, in 1967 and 1968, there was a
settlement in which various debts were offset and assigned with the result
that as at December 31, 1970, the Government owed EEQ only S/3.0 million.
IMQ and the Government together account for about 8% of billed revenue.
7.06      Financial planning and control in EEQ is at a minimum: the
Chief Accountant confines himself to the preparation of historical accounts,
which are produced promptly. Any financial forecasting which may from time
to time be required, is done by the Engineer in charge of Operations.



- i6 -
7.07      Until FY1970, EEQ did not employ an independent professional
firm as external auditors, but instead relied on the services of two
"Comisarios" to audit its accounts. These auditors were employees of
such institutions as the Bank of Pichincha, a commercial bank, and the
Social Security Institute and did not normally have the supporting staff,
time or knowledge to carry out a professional audit. The international
firm of Price, Waterhouse and Company has recently completed the audit
of EEQ's accounts. During negotiations EEQ agreed to continue to have
its accounts audited by external auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
to send the Bank a copy of the annual accounts and auditors' report
within four months of the end of the fiscal year.
7.08      The past record of EEQ clearly leaves much room for improve-
ment, and the present Board of Directors and senior management are fully
aware of this. To this end, EEQ has negotiated a contract (the foreign
currency of which would be financed under the proposed IDA Credit), with
Price, Waterhouse and Company for the study and implementation of improved
management techniques, which will necessitate the appointment of a
Financial Director (see paragraph 4.0h).
7.09      Annex 8 shows EEQ's Balance Sheet as at December 31, 1970, and
can be sumnarized as follows:

Debt service on existing loans over the five years 1971-1975 averages about
S/27 million per annum, which is covered 1.6 times by the 1970 cash genera-
tion (prior to dividends, which would be paid by issuing stock, see paragraph
7.12).
7.11      Since 1956, developers of new urban and other areas have been
required to meet the capital cost of distribution networks necessary for
such developments. These networks, which are used by EEQ, are not included
in the assets in the books of EEQ. The Municipality has passed legislation
claiming ownership of these networks and has recently transferred them to
EEQ for S/28,088,000 (US$1.12 million), which is the estimated undepreciated
original cost of the networks from 1956 to the end of 1970. EEQ would pay
for this by offsetting IMQ's debt of S/23.0 million and issuing stock to
IMQ for the balance of S/5.1 million. The networks will now be depreciated
in EEQ's books by s/6.0 million, which is the estimated depreciation from
1956 through 1970. Effective January 1, 1971, IMQ will rent to EEQ all such
networks completed after that date at a rental of 5-6% of cost; the networks
would be maintained by EEQ.  The execution of a satisfactory agreement on
these lines is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit.
7.12      As of December 31, 1970, S/44 million is included in current
liabilities as unpaid dividends. This outstanding amount has now been
settled by the issue of stock.
7.13      EEQ's fixed assets are undervalued as a result of the devaluation
of the sucre in August 1970 from S/18 to US$1.00 to S/25 to US$1.00. At the
time of the devaluation, a law was passed precluding entities from revaluing
their assets except to the extent that their external debt was revalued; EEQ
revalued its assets at that time to that extent. During negotiations EEQ
agreed to a further revaluation of its assets in 197-, which is the
earliest date allowed by this 1970 law. This valuation would then take
into account the full effect of the 1970 devaluation of the sucre, and it is
estimated that it will increase the gross value of fixed assets in operation
by a further S/70 million.

7.15      The cornerstone of the proposed financing plan is an increase in
tariffs of approximately 35% to enable EEQ to earn a reasonable rate of
return on its properly valued net fixed assets in operation and to generate
a reasonable amount of cash towards its construction program. A tariff
increase of this magnitude, effective May 1, 1971, has been approved by the
Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, and, during negotiations, the
Government agreed not to reduce tariffs before June 30, 1974.
7.16      It is proposed that the Association make a Credit of US$6.8 million
equivalent available to the Government which would lend the amount to EEQ
at an interest rate of 7-1/b% per annum for approximately 24 years including
a grace period of h years. The total anount to be repaid (US$8.0 million),
would include interest on the Government loan during construction of about
US$1.2 million equivalent and would be repaid in equal semi-annual annuities
commencing July 1, 1975. During negotiations the Government and EEQ agreed
to send to IDA for its approval, prior to presentation of this Credit to
IDA's Board of Directors, a draft loan agreement, re-lending the proceeds
of the Credit. This loan agreement will be signed at the same time as the
proposed Credit.
7.17      Other loans recently negotiated, are:
(a) Suppliers' Credits:
(i)  US$850,000 from Mitsui for some local currency expenditures
of the civil works of Nayon. Interest will be at 11% per
annum, payable i n  cas h .  Am ortization  would start
in September 1973 and would be in 16 semi-annual equal
installments plus interest on the outstanding balance;
(ii) S/122.5 million from Mitsubishi for plant and equipment
for Nay6n and distribution. Interest during construction
at 6.5% per annum on the amounts drawn down will be paid
in one sum after 16 months. Amortization would commence in
December 1972 and would be in twenty semi-annual annuity
payments; and
(iii)  An additional loan of S/41.9 million from Mitsubishi with
interest at 6.75%; amortization would commence in February
1972 and would be in eight semi-annual annuity payments.
All three loans will be guaranteed by the Ecuadorian Government. During
negotiations, EEQ agreed to submit draft loan agreements to IDA for its
approval, prior to the presentation of the Credit to IDA's Board of
Directors.
(b)  A local loan of S/65 million hab been made by Corporacion
Financiera Nacional (CFN), with interest at 12% per annum and
a commitment charge of 1% per annum on the undisbursed balance.
EEQ has undertaken to submit to IDA a draft loan agreement prior
to presentation of the Credit to IDA's Board.



- 20 -
(c) A future foreign loan would be necessary to finance the foreign
exchange cost of La Mica or its alternative.  No action is necessary
on this loan at this stage, and its amount will depend on the
studies to be carried out for La Mica and future generation
expansion by EEQ.
Term of the loans in (a) and (b) above include the requirement that EEQ
mortgage some of its assets as security. In order that the Bank may not
be placed in an inferior position regarding loans 137-EC and 177-EC, it
was agreed during negotiatiors that EEQ, as a coindition of effectiveness
of the proposed Credit, will create a mortgage in favor of the Bank on so
much of the property of EEQ as shall be necessary to secure the principal
and interest outstanding on these two loans as of the date of the creation
of the mortgage. The execution of the agreements referred to in (a) and
(b) above are conditions of effectiveness for the proposed Credit.
7.18      During the period 1971-1975 equity will be provided as follows:
Industrial consumers              S/26 million
IMQ-cash                            50
INECEL                               8
S3/84 million
The industrial consumer's equity investment is the result of a recent decree
which requires industrial consumers to pay an additional 10% of their monthly
bill to EEQ as equity. The IMQ cash investment reflects a declaration by the
Government to make payments of S/44 million to IMQ in connection with Quito's
sesquecentennial celebrations for the purpose of EEQ's expansion program.
IMQ will contribute this government grant to EEQ as equity.  Additionally,
IMQ has undertaken to provide SA/,500,000 annually for four years as its
contribution towards EEQ's village electrification program. INECEL is also
proposing to convert into equity the debt of S/8 million due from EEQ.
7.19      During negotiations, the Government agreed to provide EEQ, on
terms satisfactory to the Association, any additional funds necessary to
complete the Project.
Financial Forecasts
7.20      As mentioned in p _:<.raph 7.15, the forecast income accounts
(Annex 11) are based on the 1971 tariff increase of approximately 35k.
Income is also based on the expectation that IMQ will include provision
in its future budgets for electricity consumed and services obtained from
EEQ, (other than street lighting), and that IMQ will promptly pay its accounts.
This has not been the case in the past, but an undertaking to this effect has
been given by IMQ to EEQ. Regarding street lighting, an amount to cover the
cost of street lighting will probably be included in customers' bills; and as
a condition of effectiveness, but in any case no later than January 1, 1972,
EEQ has undertaken to submit arrangements, satisfactory to IDA, for the
collection of its street lighting charges.



- 21 -
7.21      Estimated Balance Sheets for 1971-75 are shown in Annex 10.  During
the period 1971-75, the return on net fixed assets in operation will rise from
an estimated 7.6% in 1971 to an estimated 9.2% in 1975 (Annex 13). In 1972,
the estimated return on average net fixed assets would be 10.8% on unrevalued
assets (see paragraph 7.13) and about 9.5% on revalued assets.  The tariff
increase of 35% should be sufficient through 1975, but circumstances could
make a further tariff increase necessary. In order to assure that EEQ rakes
a reasonable contribution to its expansion program from internal sources,
EEQ should earn a minimum of 8% on its net fixed assets in operation. There-
fore, during negotiations EEQ agreed to apply for an adjustment to its tariffs,
whenever necessary, to enable it to earn a minimum of 8% on its average net
fixed assets in operation, including distribution networks operated by EEQ,
such assets valued in accordance with methods of valuation or revaluation
acceptable to IDA. The Government also agreed to authorize such necessary
increases promptly.
7.22      EEQ feels that it should pay modest dividends to its shareholders
and has included in its financial forecasts dividends amounting to 1% of
its net revenue, equivalent to less than 0.5% of paid-in capital. EEQ
agreed during negotiations, to limit its cash dividends to this 1% of the
annual net revenue, unless the Association should otherwise agree.
7.23      Over the five years, net fixed assets in operation will increase
by 133% - i.e. from S/402.3 million to S/936.0 million (US$16.1 million to
US$37.4 million), although about S/64.2 million (US$2.7 million) would be
due to the 1973 revaluation (Annex 10). In 1974 and 1975, when interest on
the relent proceeds of the Credit would no longer be financed, interest would
be covered by net operating income 2.5 and 2.8 times, respectively, and debt
service will be covered about 1.6 times by internal cash generation (Annex 13).
At the end of the construction period, it is estimated that the debt/equity
ratio will be 41/59. All of these financial ratios are satisfactory. To
ensure that this improved financial position is maintained EEQ agreed during
negotiations not to borrow without prior approval of the Association unless
its net revenue for the fiscal year next preceding such incurrence or for a
later twelve-month period prior to such incurrence, whichever is the greater,
shall be not less than 1.5 times the maximum debt service requirement for
any succeeding fiscal year on all debt, including the debt to be incurred.

(b)  the Ecuadorian Government will:
(i)  provide, on terms acceptable to the Association, any funds
necessary to complete the Project (paragraph 7.19); and,



- 23 -
(ii) authorize EEQ to adjust its tariffs to enable it to earn
the agreed rate of return (paragraph 7.21); and not reduce
tariffs before June 30, 1974 (paragraph 7.15).
8.02      At the time of signing the proposed Credit, the subsidiary loan
agreement between EEQ and the Government should also be signed (paragraph
7.16).
8.03      Conditions of effectiveness of the Credit will be:
(a) the appointment of consultants for a tariff study (paragraph 4.07)
and management studies (paragraph 4.04);
(b)  the ratification of the subsidiary  Loan  Agreement
(paragraph 7.16);
(c) the amendment of EEQ's charter to reflect current law and
conditions (paragraph 4.05);
(d) the registration of a mortgage in favor of the Bank, on assets to
an extent and on terms satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 7.17);
(e) the execution of contractual arrangements between IMQ and EEQ
for the use of IMQ's distribution networks after December 31,
1970 (paragraph 7.11);
(f) the provision for payment for street lighting provided to IMQ
(paragraph 7.20); and
(g) the execution of parallel financing for EEQ's investment program
(paragraph 7.17).
8.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA Credit
of US$6.8 million on the usual terms.

1.        INECEL has preliminarily definel/ a development program for
generation and transmission to meet main power requirements in the country
through 1990, taking into account hydro potentials which have been sufficiently
investigated to be considered as alternatives. This program comprises
the following works:
(a)  Construction of the first stage Pucara power plant (64.5 MW)
of the Pisayambo hydro project, to be completed in 1975.
This project, which presently is being appraised by the
Inter-American Development Bank,would also include 137 km of
138 kV line and 10 km of 69 kV line for supply to Quito and
Ambato and intermediate towns in the northern half of the
country. Total cost would be about US$30 million (US$465/kW).
(b) Construction of the first stage Pulpito dam and Molino power
plant (100 MW) of the Paute hydro project, to be completed
in 1977, followed by an extension of 50 MW in 1979 and 50 MW
in 1981. The project includes 160 km of 345 kV lines and
507 km of 138 kV lines for supply to Guayaquil and the main
towns in southern Ecuador. Total cost would be about US$98
million (US$490/kW).
(c) Construction of the first stage (54 MW) of the Toachi hydro
project, to be completed by 1979. The plant would be
connected to the Pisayambo system. The transmission system
would be extended with 155 km of 138 kV lines and 40 km of
69 kV lines. Total cost would be about US$30 million (US$555/kW).
(d) Construction of the second stage (San Miguelito plant 83.4 NW
downstream from the Pucara plant) of the Pisayambo hydro project,
to be completed by 1982. Total cost would be about US$32 million
(US$384/kW).
(e)  Construction of the second stage (54 MW) of the Toachi hydro
project, to be completed by 1985. Total cost would be about
US$10 million (US$185/kW).
(f) Integration of the country would take place between 1985 and
1990, for which the Molino power station would be extended

by 200 MW (second stage) followed by the raising of the
FiJpito dam and the addition of 375 MW in capacity (third
stage). The fourth stage would comprise two additional
dams in the Paute river, further additions (225 MW) to
the Molino power plant which would reach its maximum
capacity of 1,000 MW, and the construction of one upstream and one
downstream  hydro plant  aggregating 260 MW. A 345 kV line
would interconnect, the northern and southern system.
2.        With the discovery of oil in the eastern part of Ecuador,
the above program may have to be modified if it can be. shown that the
construction of steam-electric plant in the northern part of the country
near the oil pipe line (Which will pass somewhat south of Quito) would
be justified. EEQ's consultants will study the location and justification
of such plant in close cooperation with INECEL. Funds for this study
have been included in the proposed credit for EEQ's Nayon project.

APPRAISAL CF THE THIRD POWER PROJECT
EMPRESA ELECTRICA "QUITO" S.A.
ECUADOR
Justification of the Proposed Project
Forecast of Sales and Demand
1.        EEQ's consultants, in their 1967 Nayon feasibility study, fore-
casted EEQ's sales and demand on the basis of statistical information
since 1945 for the various consumer categories, considering development
trends in Quito which would reflect on the rate of growth of these cate-
gories, i.e. population trends, urbanization, industrial development
program. They assumed an average growth rate in sales of 9.1% and in
maximum demand of 9%.  Actual sales and maximum demand, however, averag-
ed about 3% and 5% respectively above the consultants forecast for the
period 1967 through 1970, irrespective of suppressed sales in 1969 (about
1.5%) and in 1970 (about 3.2%); total potential sales and demand were
substantially higher than forecast.
2.        Three factors - which all appear as yet uncertain as to their
possible effects - could have significant influence on the electricity
demand to be met by EEQ:
(i) the rate increase of 35%,
(ii) the Andean pact between several South hnerican countries,
including Ecuador, which assigned development of specific
industries to each country (for which, however, no program
is available from which the relevant demand could be
estimated),
(iii)  the impact on the economy of oil discoveries in the eastern
part of the country and the construction of the oil pipe line
to Esmeraldas.
3.        EEQ, together with INECEL, prior to the appraisal, prepared
a forecast which showed a consistent 12% growth in demand and sales.
This forecast was modified during the appraisal, in close consultation
with EEQ and INECEL, to reflect:
(i) the possibility that the 35% rate increase may cause some drop
in load growth, particularly for residential and commercial
consumers, and



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 6 pages
(ii) that the overloading of EEQ's facilities will continue well
into 1971, and voltage regulation will cause some suppression
of demand.
4.        In comparing actual growth rate curves with fitted trend lines
none of the past tariff adjustments, currency devaluations and periods of
suppressed demand, appear to have had any significant effect on growth
rates, except possibly suppressed industrial demand during 1955 - 1960
and in 1969/1970 (to meet the evening peak, supply to industry is severe-
ly restricted during the daytime to fill the reservoirs, which have daily
pondage only). It was therefore assumed that the effect of the recent
rate increase would be relatively modest.
5.        Sales are expected to increase by about 10.5% in 1971 and 1972,
reaching a growth rate of 12% in 1974. The characteristics of EEQ's
market in 1975 compared with 1970 would be the following:
Category                                   1970                    1975

Residential                           92.8       43.9        157.2        43.6
Commercial                            28.4       13.4         46.6        12.9
Government and Municipality           12.3         5.8        19.0         5.3
Industrial                            54.8        26.0       121.8        33.8
Pumping                               13.5         6.4          2.0        0.5
Street Lighting                        9.5         4.5        14.1         3.9
Total                            211.3      100.0        360.7       100.0
No significant changes are expected, except a sharp drop in sales for pump-
ing (wells in and around Quito are expected to be replaced by a new potable
water supply system by 1973)which is offset by a rise in industrial sales,
which would increase its share of EEQ's market from 26% to 34%.
6.        Losses, which presently are about 20% of generation, are not
expected to exceed 18% by 1974. Further action by EEQ (which reduced losses
from about 25% in 1964 to about 18% in 1969; the 1970 higher losses are
partly due to the suppression of voltage) can be expected to reduce losses
well below 18%.



ANNEX 6

7.        Maximum demand was calculated on the basis of the assumed sales
and losses, taking into account a load factor decreasing from 51.5% in
1971 to 50.5% in 1973 to reflect the improved voltage during peak hours,
and increase to 51.5% by 1975 to take into account the increased share of
industrial sales in EEQ's market.
8.        Historical and forecast data for sales, generation, demand,
required and system capacity, and the generation schedule are shown in
Annex 3.
Comparison of Alternative Development Programs
9.        At the time of the first appraisal of Naydn, none of the possible
hydro alternatives for this plant, i.e. INECEL's Pisayambo and Toachi
projects, or EEQ's La Mica project, could be considered since they could
not be completed in time. For this reason thermal plant only was assumed
as an alternative. Since neither of the INECEL projects or La Mica can be
completed before the end of 1974, this consideration is still valid.
10.       Comparison (in 1967 and 1969) of the Nayon plant with either a
steam-electric or diesel-electric alternative showed it to be the least
cost alternative for discount rates up to at least 20% due to the high
cost of fuel oil (US$6.12/barrel)l/ and Bunker"C"-oil (US$4.96/barrel)!/
excluding taxes. (Gasturbine plant cannot be considered as an alternative
in view of the severe derating of 40%-50% required for operation at an
altitude of about 280i m.) A revised calculation was made of the equaliz-
ing discount rate under present circumstances, i.e. (a) on the basis of
present cost estimates for Nayon and alternative thermal plant, (b) includ-
ing the Cumbaya bypass in the plant cost, (c) assuming a fuel price of
US$2.20/barrel (which appears to beareasonable price for oil from the new
pipe line). This calculation shows that Nayon would still be prefered to
thermal plant for discount rates up to 15%.
11.       To meet forecast demand in 1971, no other plant than packaged
diesel units can be installed in time and EEQ has already ordered 9 MW
of such plant. These package units will be used for standby and emergency
purposes after completion of Nayon. To meet 1972 demand, EEQ intends to
install an additional 9 MW of stationary diesel units of larger capacity
(they are more reliable than packaged units) which, together with exist-
ing plant, will mainly operate after completion of Nayon to meet dry season
demand.  Through 1975 - 1976, when new hydro plant after Nayon is expected
to be commissioned (either INECEL's Pisayambo plant or EEQ's La Mica plant)
diesel plant will supply an average of about 20% of the required generation.

Internal Financial Rate of Return
12.       The internal financial rate of return of a project is defined
as the equalizing discount rate of internal costs and revenues attributable
to the project. Since, in the present case, the project covers a large
part of EEQ's overall development program for the next six years, the internal
financial rate of return was calculated on the 1971 through 1976 time slice
of the program (in 1976 La Mica would be commissioned), assuming a discount
period of 25 years, on the following basis:
(i) Price levels from 1976 onward were kept at the 1975 level for
the remaining discount period.
(ii) Capital expenditures were taken as the expected investments during
1971-1976, including the La Mica hydro plant which would commence
operation in early 1976.
(iii)  Fuel costs, excluding taxes, attributable to the 1971-1976 program
were based on present price since any variation in price would be
chargeable directly to the consumers under the present tariff
regulations and therefore affect revenues accordingly.
(iv) Salaries per employee, including overheads and social and other
benefits, were calculated assuming a rise of 10% in 1971 and 1972,
8% in 1973, 6% in 1974 and 4% in 1975, to reflect the decreasing
effects of the 1970 currency devaluation. Incremental personnel
costs for each year were obtained by multiplying the required
number of additional employees, attributable to the program by
these salaries per employee. From 1976 onward these costs were
assumed to increase annually by 3% over the 1975 cost level to
reflect the aging of the facilities, requiring more personnel
for maintenance.
(v) Regression analysis shows an approximate linear relation between
other operational cost and generated electrical energy. A
1971 increase of 20% was assumed to reflect the effects of the
currency devaluation, resulting in 9.7 centavos/generated kWh.
From 1979 onward, when all facilities in the program are assumed
fully loaded, the costs are assumed to increase 3% annually to
reflect increased maintenance due to aging.
(vi) Incremental sales attributable to the program were calculated
on the basis of the energy generated by the new diesel plant,
the Nay6n plant, and the La Mica plant and applying forecast
losses. Incremental revenue was then obtained by multiplying
sales in kWh by the forecast average annual revenue per kWh.
13.       On the basis of the above assumptions, the internal financial
rate of return on the 1971-1976 program is about 8%.



ANNEX 6
Page 5 of 6 pages
14.       This low internal financial rate of return is not surprising.
Due to the lack of adequate rate increases EEQ has not been able to make
necessary investments for some 5 years and the present program is in part
an expensive crash program, burdened with:
(i) the additional backlog of construction needed to restore adequate
service quality, and
(ii)  the high operating cost of diesel plant needed to make up for
the delays in completing the hayon plant.
15.       The calculation does not take into account as a benefit attributable
to the diesel plant that by installing diesel plant high industrial production
losses will be avoided because from the data available in Ecuador the value
added to the economy cannot be quantified. However,a rough indication of
the effects of the curtailments on industry can be given. EEQ has estimated
that in 1970 about 4 GWh (equivalent to about S/h.9 million in revenue) could
not be supplied to industry which has to be curtailed severely daring the
daytime in order that the reservoirs be filled to meet the evening peak with
as little curtailment as possible. As a consequence lost production in
1970 may have been as high as 7%.
16.       The internal financial rate of return is not very sensitive to
a variation in operational cost (a 20% decrease in operational cost would
increase the internal rate of return by about 25% i.e. to about 10%); but
it is highly sensitive to a change in revenue (a rate increase in 1975 of
25% would cause the internal rate of return to increase by about 50%, i.e.
to 12%).
Village Electrification
17.       IDA's assistance in financing the electrification of about 15
villages in the Nono-Gulea-Pacto and the San Jose de Minas areas in the
northwest and north of the Canton Quito, does not appear justified on normal
financial grounds. However, about 10 of the villages are rapidly developing
economically. Electrification should give further incentive to economic
growth, especially in the establishment and development of small industries.
There should also be secondary benefits such as the discouragement of
population drift to the towns, improvement in living conditions, etc. The
remaining 5 villages are higher up in the Andes. At present there are no
visible incentives to improve social conditions but electrification would
be one of the actions proposed by the Mhnicipality of Quito, to improve
social conditions.
18.       The Bank Group is presently preparing a program of research to
quantify the total social costs and benefits of village electrification.
To develop the necessary techniques economic and social data is to be
collected over a time series in selected countries both from electrified
villages and "control" villages, which are similar in as many respects as
possible to the selected electrified villages, except that they have not
been electrified. The villages in the areas of Cant6n Quito mentioned
above appear well suited for a study of this nature. For this reason the
Association agrees to finance, as a pilot program, the electrification of



ANNEX 6
Page 6 of 6 pages
the above villages for which the social coats and benefits would be carefully
monitored overtime. EEQ and also the Municipality of Quito, which has
jurisdiction over these villages, are to cooperate with the Association
in carrying out such a long term study, the foreign exchange cost of launching
which will be financed from the Credit.

Electric Power Rates
1.        Since June 1970 tariffs are regul.ated by the "Reglamento Para
La Fijacion de Tarifas de Servicios Electsoricosl", and since August 1970
INECEL has been designated as the regulating agency under the Ministry
of Natural Resources and Tourism. These regulations use the following
concepts for assessing the rates:
(i) average net fixed asaets are defined to include: (a) replacement
value of all physical assets including interest during
construction, (b) replacement value of all intangible assets
comprising cost of studies, organization and financing of the
company with an upper limit of 10% of the value of the physical
assets, (c) working capital amounting to 3 times the monthly
average of revenue from the supply of electric energy; net of,
(d) the replacement value of all physical assets paid for by
consumers but administrated by the company, and (e) the
corresponding depreciation reserve of the company's assets.
(ii) the present regulations require a rate of return on the average
net fixed assets of 10.5%, but this requirement is expected to
be amended shortly to allow a range of 9-12%.
(iii)  operational cost includes direct cost of operation, administration,
overhead and maintenance, depreciation,and taxes; but does not
include interest and other charges on debt.
(iv) the company may automatically adjust its monthly bills to its
customers to reflect variation of cost compared with the basis
used in the most recent tariff approval, for the following items:
(a) cost per man-hour (including social benefits) in excess of
plus or minus 10%, (b) cost of purchased power per kWh in excess
of plus or minus 10%, (e) cost of fuel in excess of plus or minus 5%.
2.        By decree the Government prohibited, after the devaluation of the
Sucre in August 1970, the revaluation of assets for the period 1970 through
1972 except insofar as it was necessary to revalue foreign loans, and the
INECEL/EEQ calculations for the recent tariff adjustment have been based
on this requirement, allowing a 8,5% rate of return oa  average net fixed
assets revalued from 1973 onward=
3.        EEQ's tariff stri)ctnre has not been revised for many years.
The pattern of tariffs is similar to that used throughout most of the
smaller Latin American countries and the basic groupinlg appears satisfactory.
Some shortcomings of the tariffs are the following:



ANNE 7
Page 2 of 2 pages
(i}  the tariff adjustments 1961, 1964 and 1971 may have caubed
some imbalances in the equitable sharing of cost between
consumer classes (for instance demand charges appear too low),
(ii) there are no voltage related tariffs, and
(iii)  the number of block rates is too large and the consiterncy in
the spread could be improved.
4.o       Although the tariffs are adequate to reach the requirad l'vel
of revenues 1EQ is aware of the fact that improvements can be- marL axid for
this reason wishes to engage consultants to study its tariffs The.- neces-ary
funds for this study has been included in the proposed Crodis.

21 The revenue for 1968 was inflated by S/ 10,979,000 due to the offsetting of some debts due from
the Government and from the Municipality of Quito. The average price per kwh has been adjusted
to eliminate this extraordinary income. The net operating income and net revenue figures are
consequently inflated by a like amount.
2/ Difference is due to employees bonus being adjusted for previous years.
