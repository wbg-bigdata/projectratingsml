INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF ECUADOR FOR A
THIRD POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Ecuador for the equivalent of US$6.8 million
for a third power project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The Bank made two loans in 1956 and 1957 (137-EC and 177-EC,
respectively), totalling $10 million, to assist Empresa Electrica "Quito"
S.A. (EEQ) in financing the first stage of the Cumbaya hydroelectric
project. These works were completed by the end of 1961 and have been
operating satisfactorily. A deterioration of EEQ's finances in the early
1960's, mainly due to delays in increasing tarif's, made it necessary for
the government to meet debt service payments for more than two years on
the two Bank loans. EEQ's financial condition imp-oved after a tariff
increase was finally allowed in January 1964, which permitted the company
to resume service of its debt and to finance the second stage of the
Cumbaya project mainly from its own resources.
3.        In 1967, EEQ approached the Bank Group for assistance in financing
further power development. The mission Twhich appraised the Nayon project
for the first time in early 1969 found the company's financial position
weak, and recommended a tariff increase. The company felt the government
was not prepared then to follow this recommendation, ho-wever, and IDA
decided not to consider financing the project at that time. EEQ's new
management, appointed in August 1970, approached the Bank Group again
later that year. Realizing the need to improve EEQ's finances, the new
management pressed for an average 35 percent tariff increase, which was
finally approved by the government in April 1971, and the Bank was then
informed that the full 35 percent increase would go into effect beginning
May 1971. The appraisal was completed and negotiations were conducted
on this basis. In actual fact, however, although the new rates were
charged in May, EEQ and the government subsequently reversed the increase
and agreed instead on a phased implementation of the new rates, to be
completed by December 1971. EEQ has confirmed that the billing in
January 1972 includes the full 35 percent rate increase. Before the credit
agreement is signed, however, EEQ will be required to submit its new
schedule of rates. EEQ agreed during negotiations to apply for any



-2-
necessary further adjustments in its tariffs (and the government agreed
to grant such adjustments) to enable EEQ to earn a minimum return of 8
percent on its net fixed assets in operation. This should enable EEQ
to make a reasonable contribution to its capital expansion program from
its own funds.
4.        The Third Power Project was reappraised in January/February 1971,
and negotiations were held in Washington from June 30 to July 13, 1971.
Ecuador was represented by Mr. Orlando Gabela, Minister-Counselor at the
Embassy of Ecuador, Mr. Raul Sagasti, Deputy Director of Public Credit in
the Ministry of Finance, and Mr. Jaime Durango, Commercial Attache at the
Embassy of Ecuador. EEQ was represented by Mr. Sixto Duran-Ballen,
President (also Mayor of Quito), Mr. Juan Sevilla, General Manager,
Mr. Gustavo Castro, Technical Director, and Mr. Ivan Gallegos, Legal
Counsel. It was agreed during negotiations that EEQ would complete credit
arrangements with suppliers before submission of the proposed credit to
IDA's Executive Directors. Two of these agreements (with Mitsubishi and
Mitsui of Japan) have now been signed. The third, a supplier's credit for
cement, had to be renegotiated when the original proposal was withdrawn.
The signing of the third supplier's credit agreement will be a condition
of credit effectiveness.
5.        The proposed credit would bring the total of Bank/IDA lending
to Ecuador to US$102.7 million (net of cancellations). A summary statement
of nine Bank loans and four IDA credits made to Ecuador as of December 31,
1971, is attached as Annex I. About 50 percent of the lending ($51.6
million) has been in the transportation sector, a major part ($38.0 million)
of it devoted to the improvement of Ecuador's roads network wqhere we have
acted in concert with the Inter-American Development Bank and the United
States Agency for International Development. As a consequence, the main
roads network in the country has been substantially expanded. We have
also been active in the development of agriculture (including livestock
and fisheries), industry, power and education, and plan in the future
(paragraphs 19 and 20 below) to substantially enlarge our involvement in
agriculture and industry. In our continuing effort to assist the development
of industrial and social infrastructure, the proposed credit would be the
third Bank/IDA operation in Ecuador's powqer sector.
6.        Of the thirteen previous operations, five made prior to 1964,
comprising the two earlier loans to EEQ and three loans in the transportation
sector, have been completely disbursed. Most funds under the first two
livestock development operations (Loan 501-EC and Credit 173-EC) are
committed and disbursements should be completed shortly. The Third Livestock
Development Credit (222-EC), signed in December 1970, became effective on
September 30, 1971; the number of participating banks (three thus far,
and two more which have expressed interest), and the number of credit
requests on hand (nearly 80 as of the end of November) point to a
rapid disbursement of this credit. The Development Finance Companies Loan
(721-EC), signed in February 1971, became effective on October 15, 1971.
Sub-loan requests totalling about US$3.9 million have been received as of



- 3 -
December 1971, and the two participating finance companies expect the loan
to be fully committed before the end of 1972 and disbursed prior to the
closing date of June 1974.
7.        Disbursements of the remaining loans and credits lag behind the
rate forecast. The Second Highway Project (Loan 379-EC/Credit 51-EC),
financed jointly by the Bank, IDA, the Inter-American Development Bank,
and the United States Agency for International Development is approaching
completion. While all road construction is nearly finished, the maintenance
program has moved at a sloTwer pace; on account of this, the closing date
had to be extended by four months to April 30, 1972. On the basis of
revised cost figures, a saving of about $0.6 million in the credit is expected.
The government wishes to utilize this balance for the purchase of additional
maintenance equipment. This proposal, which entails a modification in the
scope of the project, is currently under review. If approved, a further
extension in the closing date will be necessary.
8.        After some initial difficulties, the Education Project (Credit
124-EC) made progress in the latter part of 1970 and early 1971; lack of
sucre funds, however, became a constraint to project implementation
thereafter.  Effective steps to correct the situation were recently taken
by the government and school construction has now been resumed.   As a
result of past difficulties, the credit is not likely to be fully disbursed
by the current closing date of December 1972, which date may consequently
need to be postponed.
9.        Disbursements on the Fisheries Loan (555-EC), also behind the
rate forecast, are expected to pick up momentum following the award to
a Mexican shipyard of a contract for the construction of the first four
vessels under the project. The consultants for the fishing ports study,
included in the project, have also been selected and contract negotiations
are underway. The training component of the project has not made much
headway yet, but details for its quick implementation were worked out with
the local authorities by a supervision mission which visited Ecuador in
early December 1971. The above delays may require postponement of the
present closing date of October 1974.
10.       Fiscal difficulties affecting the ready availability of comple-
mentary local financing and weaknesses in the administrative machinery
have been largely responsible for delays in the implementation of some of
the above projects. However, improvements in the government's revenue
prospects from petroleum exploitation (paragraphs 12 - 19 below), and
in the instruments of fiscal management recently introduced, should help
to overcome delays in future lending operations. The government has also
taken steps to centralize control over public credit, the major economic
ministries have been reorganized on more rational lines, and a special
trust funds mechanism has been set up in the Central Bank for the
separate administration of certain types of development funds, including
external loans and credits.

11.      IFC's total commitments through December 31, 1971, amounted to
$2.2 million, consisting of a combined investment and loan of $2 million
for a textile company and an investment of $0.2 million in a private
development fLnance company. IFC's present holdings amount to $1.1 mil-
lion.
PART II - THE EC(NOMY
12.       An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of Ecuador" (WH-208a) dated September 22, 1971, was distributed
to the Executive Directors on October 15, 1971. The report observed that
government revenues and the balance of payments will benefit greatly from
the petroleum sector which will start operations in mid-1972. Based on
these expectations, the report concluded that prospects for achieving a
satisfactory growth rate over the medium term are favorable.
13.       The opportunities that petroleum development offers for the
country's growth are substantial. These opportunities would be further
enlarged if the present intensified exploration for additional oil
resources proves fruitful. However, the increased capacity to import
resulting from petroleum exports poses new kinds of issues for Ecuador's
development strategy. There is a danger that petroleum development might
weaken fiscal discipline and encourage rising government expenditures.
The income effect of oil exports is likely to put pressures on costs and
prices within the country; while strengthening the balance of payments,
oil exports may mask unfavorable developments in the price-cost relation-
ship and competitive position of Ecuador's basic export crops. Also, as
the demand for food grows in the face of increasing population and income,
there may be a tendency for Ecuador to neglect agriculture and become a
large-scale importer of foodstuffs. Finally, once the construction period
is over,the petroleum industry would offer only limited direct employment.
To increase employment and to overcome basic limitations of the economy
it is necessary that activities other than oil development be improved and
expanded and the economy diversified.
14.       Largely due to an enterprising private sector, Ecuador has
maintained a rate of growth averaging 6.7 percent over the period 1966-70.
Manufacturing, at 8 percent per year, has contributed substantially to
this growth, with agricultural production registering increases of less
than 3 percent a year through 1969, although making a strong recovery in
1970. The aforementioned economic report observed that, taking into con-
sideration the irapact of petroleum development, an 8 percent growth rate
for GDP (excluding the petroleum sector) can be achieved over the period
1971-76. To achieve this rate of growth it would be necessary to increase
investment, and to reverse the downward trend of domestic saving by limiting
the growth of public sector current expenditures to no more than 8 percent
per annum, and assuring conditions conducive to private saving. Over the
period 1971-76, national saving could thus finance about 62 percent of
domestic investment compared with 49 percent in 1968-70. Net capital inflow
would finance around 38 percent of total investment over 1971-76. The GDP



growth projection would call for' the implementation of a sound public
investment program aimed at economic diversification and building up of
infrastructure in support of private sector development. Yearly increases
of 15 percent in public sector investment are feasible; it is expected
that public investment expenditures would rise from 4.0 percent of GDP at
present to 5.4 percent in 1976. The two sectors where a major effort will
need to be concentrated are agriculture for the domestic market, and
resource-based industries producing for the domestic market as well as
for export to the Andean Group countries. The prospects of growth of
traditional exports - 85 percent of Ecuador's earnings are presently
derived from bananas, coffee and cacao - are not favorable. At the same
time, a rapid growth of population and higher income levels resulting from
petroleum development will generate increases in the demand for food
greater than those in the past. Unless production for the domestic market
is therefore encouraged, the country will become increasingly dependent
on food imports. Ecuador has the necessary resource-base; positive action
is, however, needed to relieve constraints on domestic agricultural pro-
duction. The manufacturing sector, despite its rap-d growth recently,
is of limited scope at present. It is concentrated mostly in the production
of consumer goods for the domestic market, mainly food products, beverages
and textiles. Although steps have recently been taken to modernize and
expand the factory sector, handicrafts still account for about 37 percent
of manufacturing output and 70 percent of manufacturing employment. Any
future development of this sector will have to take account of the oppor-
tunities offered by the Andean Market, in addition to domestic requirements.
The government has already set up an Institute of Fbreign Trade and Inte-
gration to coordinate its integration activities under the Andean Pact,
and to develop and execute export promotion policies.
15.       It is clear from the foregoing that the Ecuadorian economy
continues to suffer from substantial structural deficiencies. These
deficiencies would have a greater effect after oil revenues stabilize in
the mid-1970's, as is now expected. The urgent need, therefore, is to
expand the economic and social infrastructure and diversity the economy,
with emphasis on agriculLure and industry, and to develop non-traditional
exports. This need will remain even if the oil boom continues beyond
1976 and must be met over the next five or six years.
16.       Developments in the economy as a whole have been somewhat mixed
since the last Bank economic mission visited the country in early 1971.
Agricultural output has maintained its growth in 1971, exports have reached
record levels, and investment expenditures by oil companies have made a
significant impact on income and employment. Fiscal disequilibrium has,
however, reasserted itself in the last 6-8 months, and has largely eroded
the salutary effects of the devaluation of the sucre in mid-1970 and the
accompanying fiscal measures. Despite a satisfactory growth of government
revenues, a rapid increase in current expenditures mainly in the form of
wages and salaries, resulted in a substantial fiscal deficit. Central
Bank financing of the deficit-produced excess liquidity spilled over into
the balance of payments and has led to a heavy loss of foreign exchange.



- 6 -
17.       The government is now attempting to correct the fiscal imbalance
and to rectify the reserve position through the adoption of several measures.
It has recently instituted a budgetary reform aimed at simplifying the
procedures for earmarking taxes, which had in the past made fiscal manage-
ment exceedingly difficult and contributed to the endemic fiscal deficits
of the central government. The new system provides the government with
more effective control over the revenues it collects. While no additional
tax measures have been taken, the temporary suspension of the issuance of
Tax Credit Certificates, the inordinate growth of which in the last several
months resulted in substantial revenue losses, should afford the central
goverrment some relief.  The government has been also negotiating a loan
from U.S. commercial banks to cover part of the fiscal deficit.
18.       To protect the balance of payments, monetary authorities re-
established in November 1971 a dual exchange rate system, which had been
abolished as part of the stabilization program accompanying the devaluation
of the sucre in 1970. The dual exchange rate system will comprise an
official market based on the par value (US$1 = S/25) for purchases and
sales of foreign exchange related to merchandise trade and government and
other specified transactions, and a free market with fluctuating exchange
rates (US$1, =3/27.50 at end-December, 1971) for all other transactions.
The authorities have also reinstituted advance import deposits on essential
commodities, which comprise about two-thirds of total imports, and raised
existing import deposits on nonessential and luxury items. The imposition
of advance import deposits has in the past succeeded in quickly arresting
loss of reserves and may do so again.  It is, however, too early to assess
the impact of the new measures. Nevertheless, viewed in the context of
the country's favorable medium term prospects, the present situation should
not materially affect Ecuador's creditworthiness as evaluated in the Bank's
latest economic report. Ecuador's low per capita income and relatively
high fiscal burden which limited the scope for a rapid and substantial
increase in public savings, have justified some lending from IDA. The
prospective level of oil revenues changes this situation and after the
credit now proposed, no further IDA lending is contemplated at this time.
PART III - FUTURE DIRECTION OF BANK GROUP LENDING
19.       In accordance with the requirements of the Fcuadorian economy
discussed in paragraphs 14 and 15 above, future Bank Group lending will
emphasize agriculture and industry. Our activities in the agricultural
sector will aim at assisting the government to promote crop diversifica-
tion, sustain agricultural employment, and increase production as well as
productivity from agricultural land to avoid increasing dependency on food
imports. An agricultural sector review has lately been completed by an
IERD/FAO Cooperative Program mission, and another Cooperative Program
mission has been assisting the government in preparing an agricultural
credit operation for Bank financing. Further assistance in fisheries and
forestry development to promote export diversification is also expected.



- 7 -
The United Nations Development Programme will finance a feasibility study,
with the Bank as executing agency, for a forestry development project in
the Northwest. In order to improve Ecuador's absorptive capacity in the
agricultural sector, the government has recently asked the Bank to
participate with other international lending agencies in helping to
formulate a four-year investment program for the sector.
20.       On the industrial side, IFC has discussed the possibilities of
investing in a cement plant, and may have further opportunities for financing
some of the rapid industrial development expected in the coming years. A
Bank mission has been reviewing the requirements for industrial financing
in preparation for further loans to development finance companies. An
economic mission, planned for February 1972, will include specialists in
petrochemicals, electric power and industry to fur'ther help define the
Bank's role in the future growth of these sectors in the light of petroleum
development and its impact on the economy. The Bank would also expect to
play a continuing role in the transportation and education fields, and
support in some measure the necessary further expansion of the electric
energy sector which is to be assisted by the credit now proposed.
PART IV - THF POIWER SECTOR
21.       The poTwer sector in the country is highly fragmented and
facilities in general are overloaded and badly maintained. Statistics
for some sixty companies with plants larger than 100 kw (there is also
an undetermined number of companies owning smaller plants) show a total
installed capacity at the end of 1969 of 170 NW. Based on these statistics,
Ecuador's per capita generation at the end of 1969 was only 142 KWh,
compared with Latin America's average of about 450 KWh. The two largest
power companies, Empresa Electrica del Ecuador (EMELEC), a subsidiary of
Boise-Cascade of the U.S.A., and EEQ, serve the areas of Guayaquil and
Quito, respectively.
22.       Electricity consumption throughout the country has been in-
creasing at about 10 percent a year and installation of additional
generating capacity has not been keeping pace. In the coming years, oil
development is expected to stimulate a rapid growth of industry, causing
the demand for power to increase at a faster rate. In recognition of
this development and the crucial importance of power in industrial
infrastructure, the government has earmarked 50 percent of royalties from
oil production (royalties are expected to average $18 million per year)
during 1972-75, and 35 percent thereafter, for a national electrification
fund. The major part of this fund will be channelled through the Instituto
Ecuatoriano de Electrificacion (INECEL), the state power company and
regulatory agency. INECEL is expected to finance, construct and operate
from 1975-76 onward practically all new generating and transmission
facilities in the country, at the same time progressively integrating the
many existing utilities. It will thus become in due course Ecuador's
national power company. INECEL has preliminarily defined a development
program for generation and transmission to meet main power requirements in the



_- a -
country through 1975-89. Its first major project is the 65 MW Pucara
hydro plant of the Pisayambo development. The Inter-American Development
Bank approved in November 1971, a $27.7 million loan from its Fund for
Special Operations to assist in financing this project, which is expected
to be completed in 1975 and would interconnect and supply electric energy
to the main towns in the central region of Ecuador, including Quito.
PART V - THE FROJECT
23.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Third Power Project, Ebpresa
Electrica Quito S.A. Ecuador" (PU-73a) dated January 20, 1972 is bieing
circulated separately. The proposed credit would assist in financing part
of the foreign currency costs of EEQ's 1971-75 expansion program intended
to provide adequate generation and distribution capacity until 1975, when
INECEL hopes to complete the first stage of its Pisayambo development
(paragraph 22). The proposed credit would be made to the Republic of
Ecuador on standard IDA terms. Ecuador would lend the proceeds to EEQ
for twenty-four years including four years of grace, with interest at 7¼
percent. The government would bear the exchange risk.
24.       EEQ, established in 1955, is responsible for the generation and
distribution of electricity in Quito and its surroundings. At the end of
1970, the company's shareholders were the Municipality of Quito and the
Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS) which, respectively, held
44 percent and 56 percent of the subscribed capital of 221 million sucres.
Starting January 1971, private investors are also becoming EEQ's share-
holders as a consequence of a government decree requiring industrial con-
sumers to subscribe, for a period of ten years, to shares of EEQ in amounts
equal to 10 percent of their monthly bills. EEQ's five-member Board of
Directors is elected by the shareholders. Two members each are appointed
by the Municipality of Quito and by IESS, who in turn elect the fifth
member. The President of EEQ, elected by its Board, is the present Mayor
of Quito. The Board controls broad policy and appoints the General
Manager, the Auditor, the Technical Director and the Financial Director.
The company employs about 850 regular staff, giving a ratio of about one
employee per ninety customers.
25.       EEQ's managerial and administrative capacity has been weak in
the past. Its financial planning has been particularly deficient, and
for some years the company has had no Financial Director. Over the years
distortions have also been introduced into EEQ's tariff structure. Addition-
ally, the company's charter, dating from 1955, does not reflect present
conditions and current law on such matters as tariffs and rate of return.
To help correct its institutional shortcomings, EEQ will engage the services
of consultants, to be financed by the proposed credit, to review and
improve the company's organization and methods, and to study its tariff
structure. EEQ is now in the process of updating its charter; it has also
agreed to fill the post of Financial Director, in consultation with IDA,
within six months from credit signing, and to consult with IDA on future
appointments to the posts of General Manager, Technical Director and
Financial Director.



- 9 -
26.       EEQ operates four hydroelectric plants totalling 52 MW, and
diesel plants totalling 23 NW (including 13 NW recently installed); its
transmission lines consist of about 20 km of 46 kV lines and about 50 km
of 22 kV lines. Because of past financing problems and consequent delays
in undertaking the required expansion works, EEQ's facilities are in-
adequate to meet demand, and from time to time demand has to be reduced
by lowering voltage to prevent overloading transformers during peak hours.
In 1970, maximum demand (about 58 MW) almost reached the installed system
capacity (63.1 MW). As a result of the expected acceleration of growth
of Ecuador's economy in the coming years on account of petroleum develop-
ment, maximum deaand for electric power in the Quito area is forecast to
increase at a rate of 11.2 percent annually during the years 1971-75,
compared with the average annual increase of about 9.3 percent experienced
during the period 1947-7C.  Thus, maximum demand in 1975 should reach
about 98 MW as against 58 MW in 1970.
27.       The proposed project comprises about 85 percent of EBE's 1971-75
expansion program. The major item to be financed is the 30 MW hydroelectric
station at Nayon on the San Pedro River. The Nayon plant was originally
scheduled for operation in 1972, but when IDA was unable to consider lending
in 1969 (paragraph 3) construction had to be delayed. Upon agreement on
the rates issue and revival of IDA interest in the project, the main civil
works contract for Nayon was awarded at the end of 1970 after international
competitive bidding. The project also includes the construction of a new
diesel power station with 18 MW of diesel-electric plant, and the con-
struction of transmission and distribution facilities to renovate, strengthen
and expand the distribution system, including street lighting in the city
of Quito and village electrification in the Northwest part of Canton Quito.
In addition, the project would provide technical assistance to EEQ for
(i) improving management and administration; (ii) review of its tariff
structure; (iii) a study of EEQ's next step in power generation; (iv) a
network and local dispatch center study; and (v) a study of the social
costs and benefits attributable to electrification, based upon the rural
electrification component of the present project. The latter study is
expected to provide guidance for evaluating future village electrification
schemes.
28.       The Nayon plant would represent the fourth step in the develop-
ment of the power potential of the San Pedro River in an area which lies
on a plateau of little vegetation and is only sparsely inhabited. No
ocological problems have been encountered in the past development of this
area and none are expected from Nayon.
29.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $18.7 million
equivalent, and is not likely to be materially affected by the current
international realignment of currencies. The total foreign exchange
component would be approximately $12.7 million equivalent or about 68 per-
cent of total project cost. The proposed IDA credit would finance $6.8
million of the foreign costs (36 percent of total project cost), and
suppliers' credits would finance $5.4 million. The balance of EEB's foreign
and domestic financing requirements would be met by a loan of up to $2.6
million equivalent (65 million sucres) from Cmision de Valores/Corporacion



- 10 -
Financiera Nacional (CFN), a governr.ent-owned development finance company,
a loan of $0.85 million equivalent from a Japanese contractor, and $3.05
million equivalent of equity contributions and internal cash generation.
30.          Procurement would follow international competitive bidding,
except for consultant services. Local bidders woulld have the protection
of the duties on imports or 15 percent, whichever is less. For locally
produced goods, IDA would disburse 40 percent of the total expenditure
incurred, representing the average estimated foreign exchange component.
In the second half of 1970, the urgency to proceed with the expansion
program compelled EEQ, with the approval of IDA, to request bids for the
civil works of the Nayon plant and for 9 MW of the diesel power station,
and contracts were awarded to Mitsui of Japan and General Motors of the
U.S., respectively. Financing retroactive to March 15, 1971, not
exceeding $1.4 million to cover the foreign exchange component of the
diesel units ($1.2 million), and some civil works ($0.2 million) is
therefore proposed.
31.          Before deciding upon Nayon, EEQ's consultants examined
steam-electric and diesel-electric plants as possible alternatives;
they concluded that Nayon offered the least cost means of power supply
expansion. Two hydro alternatives, Pisayambo and La Mica, were not
considered because they would not be completed in time to meet demand.
The intsrnal financial rate of return on EQ's expansion program is
about S percent.
32.          Mainly due to failure to bring about tariff increases, EEQ's
financial position deteriorated in the last few years. As noted in
paragraph 3 above, the appraisal was completed on the assumption that
tariffs would be raised by an average of 35 percent as of May 1971.
The delay in implementing the increase resulted in cash generation by
EEQ falling below the appraisal estimate by about 12 million sucres.
The effect on EEQ's cash position was, in the event, minimized because
there were also delays in EEQ's construction program. Similarly, the
rate of return on net fixed assets in operation in 1971 was about
5 percent compared to the 7.6 percent estimated at time of appraisal.
In 1972, however, with the full increase in tariffs of 35 percent now
in effect, the rate of return should be over 10 percent. EEQ has agreed
not to reduce present tariffs until 1974 and take such other steps as
shall be required to provide revenues sufficient to produce not less
than 8 percent on EEQ's average net fixed assets in operation; the
government on its part has agreed to take all steps necessary to enable
EEQ to maintain such rates. EEQ's fixed assets are presently under-
valued because, when the sucre was devalued in August 1970, the law
precluded entities from revaluing their assets prior to 1973, except
to the extent that their external debt was revalued. EEQ has agreed
to make a further and full revaluation of its assets in 1973. It is
estimated that such further revaluation will increase the gross value
of fixed assets in operation by about 70 million sucres.

33.          EEQ's financial structure is expected to improve further
during the period 1971-75 on account of equity contributions from
industrial consumers (paragraph 24), estimated to total about
26 million sucres, and from the Municipality of Quito which has under-
taken to contribute 50 million sucres to EEQ, of which 44 million
sucres represent part of a grant which the Municipality will receive
from the government. The Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrification
(INECEL) is also proposing to convert into equity a debt of 8 million
sucres due from EEQ which was originally owed to the government but
assigned to INECEL in 1966 for repayment during 1971-75. In addition,
EEQ has issued stock to cover unpaid dividends as of December 31,
1970 and has agreed to limit future cash dividends or stock redemptions
to 1 percent of its annual net revenue. Finally, EEQ has undertaken
not to incur any medium- or long-term debt which might increase total
annual debt service over 1.5 times EEQ's net revenue.
34.          Based on current law, the Municipality of Quito claims
ownership of distribution networks originally built by developers in
new urban areas and used by EEQ. Networks built prior to January 1,
1971 were sold to EEQ by the Municipality earlier this year. EEQ and
the Municipality are discussing the terms and conditions for the
transfer to EEQ of networks built after January 1, 1971. The credit
will not become effective until these arrangements have been agreed.
Street lighting charges were previously billed by EEQ to the
Municipality. The Municipality has had difficulty in paying these
bills and it has also been unable to pass on the charges to the general
public as a municipal tax. Under an arrangement recently concluded
between the Municipality and EEQ, the latter will now include such
charges in consumer's bills starting January 1, 1972.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
35.          The draft Development Credit Agreement between the
Republic of Ecuador and the Association, the draft Project Agreement
between the Association and EEQ, the recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d), of the Articles of Agreement
of IDA, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are
being distributed to the Etcecutive Directors separately.
36.          The draft agreements contain covenants normally included
for power projects. In addition to other undertakings of the Republic
of Ecuador and EEQ already mentioned in this report, attention is drawn
to the following provisions:
(a)  the amendment, suspension or abrogation of the
government's decree providing for industrial consumers
to contribute to EEQ's equity would be an additional
event of default (Sections 7.02 (f) and 7.03 (b) of the
draft Development Credat Agreement).



- 12 -
(b) as the loan being secured by EEQ from Corporacion
Financiera Nacional will be secured by a lien on
EEQ's assets, EEQ would create, prior to the effect-
iveness of the Development Credit Agreement, a mortgage
in favor of the Bank to secure the outstanding balance
of previous loans to EEQ (Section 8.01 (f) of the
draft Development Credit Agreement and Section 4.04
of the draft Project Agreement).
37.          I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VII - RECCMNDATION
38.          I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed credit.
