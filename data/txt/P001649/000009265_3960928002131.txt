SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR CREDIT
Credit and Project Summarv
Borrower:          Republic of Malawi
Beneficiaries:    Ministry of Education and Culture
Amount:            SDR 29.5 million (US$ 36.9 million)
Terms:             Standard, with 40 years maturity
Prolect Objectives:
The proposed Credit has four main objectives:
(a) to improve the quality of education at all levels;
(b) to expand access to primary and secondary education;
(c) to strengthen sector management, budgeting and planning; and
(d) to improve resource mobilization and allocation policies by
reversing the decline in the sector's budget share in accordance
with stated Government policy
Project Description:
The Credit would help the Government complete its funding
requirements for the Second phase of its Ten-Year Education
Investment Plan (1986-1995) which has been agreed with IDA. The
Credit will support the following: (1) quality improvement through
(a) curriculum reform and development, (b) improvements in the
preparation, production, and distrioution of textbooks and other
instructional materials, (c) development and introduction of new
methods for more effective use of radio in primary schools, (d)
improvement of the distance education system used at the secondary
level; (e) development and introduction of low cost approaches for
improving science instruction and the library system at the secondary
level; (f) improvement of teacher training; (g) expansion of the
number of qualified primary teachers, (h) reforms in the examination
system, and (i) strengthening the school inspection system; (2)
access improvements through (a) facilitating community self-help
upgrading of school facilities by providing roofing sheets antD
limited amounts of school furniture, and (b) planning and
implementing reforms in grade promotion criteria, and more intensive
utilization of facilities (double-shifts at secondary; and admission
of day students at the university) and (c) expansion of the
university's capacity to produce accountants - a skill in extremely
short supply; (3) strengthening management, budgeting, and planning
through (a) various institutional and capacity building measures in
the Ministry of Education and the Malawi Institute of Education, and
(b) a decentralization program for the Ministry; and (4) improved
resource mobilization and allocation through (a) reforms in fee



- {it-                                               I
structures at all levels, (b) changes in reporting requirements for
recurrent and investment expenditure plans, and (c) increares in the
share of the national budget allocated to Education.
Benefits and Risks:
The Credit will continue and further IDA support for policy re"orm in
education and will finance innovative programs to improve quality,
access, cost effectiveness, internal and external efficiency and
equity at all levels. Quality: the Credit will support the
introduction of more relevant curricula, more effective examination
systems and better learning materials in primary and secondary
schools. The frequency and quality of school supervision will
improve. Access and Equitys the Credit will promote greater access
at (a) the primary level directly benefitting rural children who have
dropped out of school because of pove=ty; and (b) secondary level
through introduction of double shift system and provision of
additional MCDE centers. Efficiency: in the medium and long term,
the Credit will improve internal efficiency by reducing repetition
and dropouts, thus lowering the cost per graduate. Management: the
planning, budgeting and management capabilities of the Ministry will
be strengthened.
The main risk is that Government would allocate insufficient
funds to the education sector over the next five years, leading to
delays in implementation of the reform program, the investment plan,
and the project. This risk has been minimized by requiring that a
commitment to adequate funding, supported uy Treasury and approval by
EP&D of budget projections, is in place before the project
implementation begins and that this be reaffirmed at regular
prescribed intervals during project implementation. A second risk is
that the limited managerial and administrative capability of the MOEC
to implement and effectively monitor the policy changes might be
overstretched by the project. The project is addressing this risk by
including measures to reinforce the planning function with more local
staff positions, support and technical assistance, and fellowships. A
third risk is that the large number of trainee teachers to be
recruited into the new three year in-service training program will
not all perform satisfactorily in the training program. This risk is
being addressed through a condition of credit effectiveness that
requires MOEC to develop criteria against which to evaluate their
academic and practical performance and to release from service those
who are unsatisfactory.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR CREDIT
REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     In 1985, the Government of Malawi (GOM), recognizing the crises it
faced in the education sector and in the macroeconomic situation, embarked on
a bold program of education reform and improvement, within the context of the
economic adjustment and recovery effort already underway. Through its
"Statement of Development Policies" (Devpol) for 1987-1996, together with the
Second Education Plan (1985/86-1994195) and associated ten year investment
program, and with IDA assistance under the First Education Sector Credit
(effective June 15, 1987), the GOM articulated and committed itself to a
comprehensive strategy for a decade of educational change, aware that it would
require a decade or more to complete.
1.02     The proposed Second Education Sector Credit would assist the GOM to
proceed with the second phase of this long-term plan, building upon and
extending the encouraging progress achieved in the first phase, while also
strengthening and intensifying the reform process where needed.
1.03     Through extensive consultations, reviews, and analysis undertaken to
guide its design and preparation, the project has taken into account that:
-  the economic environment and adjfistment program framework, while
still demanding strict austerity, is favorable for continuing the
education reform effort (Sec. A of Chapter I,
-  the Government objectives for the sector are sound, providing a

the policy content and coverage of a time-slice of a ten-year
investment program (Chapter VI, and the Sector Policy Letter and
Matrix in Annex A).
The rest of this Introduction, focusing on the economic and policy
environment, and on Government strategy in education, outlines the context for
the more detailed look at the sector in subsequent chapters.
A. The Economic and Policy Environment
1.04     During the past decade, Malawi has had to contend with a series of
external shocks: falling world prices for exports; rapid escalation in import
prices, particularly fuel and intermediate and capital goods; an escalation
in regional political tensions which has disrupted external transport routes
and led to large rises in transport costs and caused a large and continuing
flow of Mozambican refugees to Malawi; poor weather and an infestation of the
cassava crop which have undermined food security. Severe foreign exchange
shortages have led to a build up of arrears on import payments, stringent
rationing of foreign exchange and import bottlenecks. The balance of payments
has come under severe strain, the Government budget deficit rose to
unsustainable levels and inflationary pressures have been strong.
1.05     The Government has responded with adjustment measures aimed at
restoring macro-economic stability and growth. These include: price
adjustments and decontrol; improved public sector resource management and
strict control of Government expenditures; exchange rate adjustments; export
promotion and diversification programs; strengthening of public sector policy
and planning capacity; and parastatal reform. Since 1981 these efforts have
been supported by three Structural Adjustment Loans, successive IMF stand-by
operations, an IMF extended facility and in 1988, a large Industrial and Trade
Policy Adjustment Credit and an IMF enhanced structural adjustment facility.
Despite periodic setbacks, Malawi has made good progress in implementing the
Government's adjustment program. Real GDP contracted by 6 percent in 1980-
1981, recovered to grow at an annual average rate of 3.1 percent through 1986,
but deciined by about 1.5 percent in 1987. Growth in 1988 at 3.6 percent
exceeded expectations, and growth is projected to accelerate to between 4 and
5 percent in the short-term making possible a gradual recovery in real per
capita incomes.
1.06     Macroeconomic adjustment exerts its most direct impact on the
education sector through Government budgetary allocations. The large and
increasing external debt burden has been crowding out public expenditure and
restraining the growth in budgetary allocations for new investments and
iecurrent expenditures. Interest payments have claimed an average of more



-3 -
than 17 percent of total Government expenditures each year from 1982 to
1988. 1/ Interest payments are projected to remain at their 1988/89 level
(in Kwacha terms) through 1991/92, implying that they will claim a deezeasing
share of total expenditure, leaving room for some recovery in sectoral
expenditure shares.
1.07     The education sector has a major role to play in achieving the three
key economic and social objectives outlined in Devpol: (i) the reduction of
poverty, ignorance and disea4e by achieving rapid and sustained economic
growth; (ii) an improvement in income distribution; and (iii) stabilization of
economic growth. Devpol explicitly states that "education is seen as the most
fundamental long-term investment in economic progress and social as well as
political cohesion". Government's ability to achieve the quality improvements
and expansion in access to education required to fulfill its objectives will
be greatly affected by the availability of external financing and of domestic
resources.
B. Government Strate&v in Education
1.08     Since independence in 1964, the development of education has been an
integral part of a wider national policy. The broad policy objective for the
sector as contained ia Devpol is to develop an efficient and high quality
system of education of a type and size appropriate to available resources and
to the political, social and economic aspirations of the nation. Three
central concerns are :  (a) ensuring access to educational opportunities; (b)
proper balance in the allocation of resources to the different subsectors of
the system; and (c) improving the quality and efficiency of the system.
1.09     During the First Education Plan period (originally 1973-1980 and then
extended to 1984), there was considerable expansion at all levels. The
primary level gross enrollment target of 50 percent was substantially
exceeded. This was a consequence of greater demand for primary education
(and, hence enrollment) than anticipated, and was not matched by increases in
inputs such as trained teachers, instructional materials, textbooks and
physical facilities. As a result, there was considerable deterioration in
quality. The secondary gross enrollment rate rose from 3 to 5 percent - much
below the original target of 15 percent, but commensurate with the manpower
needs of the modern economy.
1.10     Government has explicitly considered the manpower needs of the
economy in deciding on the pace and pattern of post-primary expansion. The
high rates of unemployment and underemployment of secondary school and
University graduates typical of many other African countries have been
avoided, although this problem is beginning to emerge. Taking account of
present economic conditions and prospects, particularly the expected slow
growth in wage employment, the Government sees a need to shift the emphasis
towards preparing students for self-employment and entrepreneurship rather
than for conventional employment.

No. 7281-MAI, 1989.



1.11     The Government's Second Educational Plan (1985/86 - 1994/95) is more
comprehensive and detailed than the first. 2/ Progress has been made during
the first three years of the Second Education Plan in initiating curricula
reform at the primary level, in provision of textbooks and teach<'s guides,
and in expanding access and in teacher education. Total enrollment at the
primary level increased from 899,459 in 1984185 to 1,022,765 in 1986/87 (a
growth rate of 4.4 percent per annum). Secondary school enrollment increased
from 24,343 in 1984/85 to 26,183 in 1986/87 (2.5 percent per year).
Enrollment at the university has increased slightly from 1964 to 2177 (3.5
percent per year), and technical/vocational college enrollment increased from
500 to 717 (15.8 percent per year). Primary teacher training enrollment fell
from 1,920 to 1,802 as a result of unusually high dropouts, no-shows and late
selection.

Organizations
2.02      The information, observations, and conclusions presented in this
chapter are based on (a) review and analysis of the extensive assessments and
other literature that exist now on education in Malawi, (b) new data
collection and evaluation undertaken for this project, and (c) thorough
consultations between Government and IDA staff. The literature includes staff
appraisal reports, project completion reports and other documentation of the
preceding six IDA investments in the sector, and sector reviews (see Annex J).
Working from this knowledge base, the project preparation effort arrived at
the list of issues discussed here after first reviewing a larger list of
potential problem areas, covering every aspect of education from primary
through post-second_,.ry and, in somewhat less detail, the formal and informal
training system. The issues discussed in Sections B through F below, after
the background description of the Section A, are recognized by the Government
as the principal areas where it needs to concentrate its efforts in the next
ten years.
A. Basic Characteristics of the Sector
2.03      The Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) is responsible for all
formal education and training in Malawi. This includes primary, secondary,
technical and post-secondary institutions such as the Primary Teacher Training
Colleges and the Malawi College of Accountancy (MCA). It is also responsible
for the non-formal system of secondary education (Malawi College of Distance
Education, MCDE). In addition, MOEC has formal responsibility for the
University of Malawi, Malawi Institute of Education (MIE), and the Malawi
National Examination Board (MANEB), although in practice this responsibility
is exercised through its membership in the Management Boards of such bodies.
2.04      The education system is divided into four major levels:  primary
(standards 1-8) with a final Primary School Leaving Certificate (PSLC)
examination at the end of the eight years; junior secondary (Forms I-II)
leading to a Junior Certificate (JC); senior secondary (Forms III-IV) at the
end of which the students sit the Malawi Certificate of Education examination



- 7 -
(MCE); and tertiary including 4-5 years of university education and two years
of teacher training (Chart 1). At the primary level, local communities are
largely responsible for the physical facilities, while at the secondary level,
church-affiliated NGOs play an important role. Schooling is not compulsory
nor is there an age attendance limit. Private schooling accounts for about 6
percent of primary school enrollment and 16 percent of secondary school
enrollment. In 1987 MCDE enrolled about 17,000 students in its 105 study
centers, about 2000 in its 17 night secondary schools and a further 5000
studying at home. The Government has a functional literacy program supported
by LriICEF aimed at making 2 million adults literate by 1995.
2.05      The MOEC is divided into four administrative units under the general
supervision of the Principal Secretary assisted by a Deputy Secretary. These
are: Planning, the Education Inspectorate, Education Administration, and the
Accounts and Personnel Department (Chart 2). The Inspectorate is responsible
for secondary school inspection while Education Administration is responsible
for inspecting and administering primary schools, primary teacher training,
technical schools and distance education. Partial decentralization has
resulted in the creation of three "Regional Education Offices (REO) and 28
District Education Offices (DEO). Field supervision of primary schools is
carried out by regional and district level staff using guidelines provided by
headquarters. Secondary school administration and field level supervision,
primary teacher training, technical/vocational training and distance education
are all centralized at headquarters. The responsibility of the planning
department includes identification, preparation, supervision and evaluation of
education projects, policy studies and preparation of education statistics.
2.06      The MOEC also provides technical and vocational education through
the technical colleges and Polytechnic Board of Governors courses. These
courses are administered jointly with the Ministry of Labor which is primarily
responsible for meeting private sector formal training needs. At present all
major ministries have training units. Most operating ministries provide
vocational training for their own skilled workers -- notably, agricultural and
veterinarian assistants in the Ministry of Agriculture and health and nursing
assistants in the Ministry of Health. Public administration courses are
provided by institutions under the Department of Personnel Management and
Training (DPMT).
2.07      Enrollment in the five secondary and post-secondary vocational and
technical education institutions increased from 500 to 777 between 1984/85 and
1986/87. Enrollment levels are determined by the Ministry of Labour on the
basis of perceived market demand, and have been limited to far below capacity
because of very slow industrial growth. Even so, some trainees have
difficulty finding jobs after graduation. The planned transfer of the Board
of Governors technician training program from the Polytechnic to the technical
schools should improve utilization levels. Trainees acquire some practical
experience during the in-plant segment of the program. However, inadequate
supervision in some work places makes it important for colleges to provide
hands-on experience as well. Inadequate supplies of materials prevents this.
2.08      The education system has made enormous progress since independence
in educating and training Malawians to fill posts in the civil service and to
provide the skilled and educated labor force needed by the growing modern
economy. Replacement of expatriates has been considerable, and most of those



- 8 -
who remain have skills and expertise that would be expensive or difficult to
provide in-country. The present capacity of the training system is adequate
for the present and projected future demand for educated and skilled manpower,
except in some specialized fields where shortages persist -- notably
accountants and physicians.
B. Financing Issues
2.09      The Need to Increase Public Expenditure on Education.  Government
spending on education is exceptionally low, even in comparison with other
African countries.  Total Government expenditure on education is around 3
percent of national income in Malawi, compared to over 5 percent in Kenya and
Zambia, nearly 7 percent in Zimbabwe, and more than 8 percent in Botswana.
Real per capita spending on education has fallen steadily from K14 in 1983/84
to K10 in 1988/89 (in 1987 constant prices). Rapid population growth (3.5
percent between 1977 and 1987) has created enormous pressure on educational
facilities, and considerable additional resources will be necessary to
maintain preseat (low) enrollment levels, let alone to satisfy some of the
unmet demand for education. The school age population has been growing at 4.8
percent each year during the past decade, and will continue to grow at least
at this rate for the neat decade.

2.10      The education share of Government expenditure is below 12 percent,
much less than most sub-Saharan countries (the median African country
allocated 18.5 percent of its budget to education in 1980, and 15.3 percent in
1983). 2/ Table 2.1 shows that the education share of total Government
expenditure fell steadily from 12.9 percent in 1983 to 10.1 percent in 1986,
and recovered only some of the loss to reach 10.4 percent in 1987 and 11.1
percent in 1988. Planned investments in the sector have been repeatedly
delayed and recurrent expenditures have been chronically and seriously
underfunded. The underfunding of education recurrent expenditures has
worsened in real terms: despite expansion of the sector, the recurrent budget
allocation to education rose by an average of less than 1 percent per year
between 1982/83 and 1985/86, and the substantial rise in 1986/87 was reversed
in subsequent years.
2.11      The Government development policy historically has given the
directly productive sectors priority over the social sectors. During the
difficult fiscal time since 1982, education has fared worse than other sectors
in terms of real expenditure. Table 2.2 shows the annual change in real
Government expenditure allocated to education compared with other selected
sectors. Between 1982 and 1986, the education allocation grew less, or fell
more in real terms than that of the other social sectors (health and community
services). The same is true comparing education with the other (economic)
sectors and agriculture in particular, except in certain of the earlier years.
In 1987/88 the education real budgetary allocation fell slightly less than
that of the other sectors, barring agriculture.

2.12      However, the policy framework for the coming decade as set out in
Devpol affirms the Government commitment to giving more priority to education,
and gradually increasing education budget share to 15 percent. To reverse the
decline of the recent past and increase education expenditure to at least a
minimally adequate level to meet the basic needs of a rapidly growing
population is of vital importance to (i) Malawi's economic development
generally; (ii) to consolidating the gains of the past in quality and
enrollments; and (iii) financing other essential improvement measures.
Furthermore, the other improvement measures that need to be undertaken will
come to little, disabled by lack of resources.
2.13      There is strong economic and social justification for increasing the
resources devoted to education. Estimated social rates of return to
educational outlays (using 1981 data) are 14 percent for primary, 15-20
percent for secondary, and 11 percent for the University (Annex Table 1).
Other things being equal, more educated women tend to have better nourished
and better educated children and lower fertility levels. This effect is
compounded by the positive relationship between education and earnings. A
large body of research in developing and developed countries consistently
shows a strong relationship between education and worker productivity. The
more educated farmers in Malawi have been found to have higher maize yields
(in large part because they have much more contact with the extansion service)
and to grow a greater diversity of crops, suggesting that education has a
positive impact on agricultural development. 3/  A more educated, literate
population is easier and cheaper to reach through mass media and other public
information campaigns, tend to adopt improved practices in health and
agriculture (for example) more readily and are better able to learn new skills
and to take advantage of new opportunities for generating income.
2.14      Resource Allocation Within the Education Budtet: Priorities for the
1990s. Even if the educatioai share of total Government expenditures rises as
envisaged in Devpol, resource availability will remain very highly
constrained. This increases the importance of careful allocative decisions,
both across and within different levels of the education system. The
allocation of the recurrent budget to different levels reflects the increasing
priority being placed on primary education, whose 1988189 share (47.5 percent)
is higher than ever before. The University share has been reduced from nearly
one-quarter of the budget, to 18.5 percent. The allocation to the secondary
level has fallen from around 17 percent to between 15 and 16 percent over the
past ten years, and within the secondary level there has been a small (but
inadequate) growth in allocations to MCDE.
2.15      Budgetary allocations should take account of the relative cost-
effectiveness in terms of educational outcome of various expenditures. For
example, evidence from Africa and other developing countries suggests that the
impact on learning per dollar spent on textbooks is higher than on most other
inputs. There may be strong interdependencies among expenditure categories.
For example, large outlays on teacher training and wages may fail to have the
expected impact on educational quality if there are inadequate teaching

materials and textbooks. Realistic and careful planning and forward budgeting
could prevent such non-wage items being squeezed out between rising wage bills
and constrained budgetary growth.
2.16      Consistency between Planned Investment and the Recurrent Budget.
The Government budgetary restraint has had a greater impact on the development
budget than on the recurrent budget (see Table 2.3). In real terms, the
recurrent budget increased by a very small 3 percent overall from 1,82/83 to
1984185, rose 13 percent in 1986J87 and then fell back by 1988189 to the
1982/83 - 1985/86 real level. The real value of the development budget fell a
massive 24 percent between 1982/83 and 1984/85, increased by a small 2 percent
in the following year, and fell by 27 and 18 percent in the subsequent two
years. The allocation for 1988/89 restores the real level by 18 percent, but
this is little more than half the real level in 1982/83. These trends have
resulted in a more sustainable balance between recurrent and development
expenditures. However, this adjustment was less deliberate than it was a
reflection of the much greater ease of postponing investments than of cutting
recurrent expenditures.

2.17      Investments in additional capacity which are not sustained by
adequate levels of recurrent financing do not generate their full potential
benefits, and may therefore show a low return. At present, the development
budget tends to emerge as the sum of investments which various donors have
agreed to finance, without MOEC first deciding on an investment plan in
accordance with clearly defined development priorities. It is vital that the
Ministry formulate medium- and long-term investment plans and rolling five-
year annual development and expenditure budgets. The planning and budgeting
process must explicitly consider the recurrent cost implications of
investments and include these as a criterion in choosing among proposed
investments. This should result in a development plan that reflects the
Ministry's educational priorities and is sustainable given resource
limitations.
2.18      Cost Recovery throuzh Fees: The Next Phase.  Fees and other income
reflected in the 1988/89 education budget covered only 1.7 percent of
recurrent expenditure   When primary school fees and University fees (which
are not shown in the budget) are added in, cost recovery rises to 8.6 percent.
Parents also bear non-fee costs such as uniforms, pencils and exercise books.
An estimated MK 4.08 million was collected by primary schools in 1988/89.
Although modest in relation to the total recurrent budget, this added nearly
11 percent to the primary level allocation.  Secondary school tuition fees
have remained at only 30 kwacha per year for some time, less than 8 percent of
the 1988/89 unit cost of day schools, and far below fees charged by private
schools. Secondary school boarding charges (recently increased to 14K 150 per
year) cover only 30 percent of the unit cost differential between boarding and
day schools. Fees at MCDE cover 27 percent of total recurrent costs. Except
for students (mainly females) pursuing the commercial and secretarial courses,
technical/vocational college students pay no fees at all.  University students
make no contribution to the costs of their board and lodging, and the net
tuition fee of MK200 per student instituted in 1989 represents only 3 percent
of unit costs.
2.19      Primary fees were last raised in 1982183.  Inability to pay primary
school fees is believed to keep many children from enrolling at school, to
contribute to the high dropout rate, and to cause interruptions in children's
schooling which often result in their repeating standards. The Government
intends to reduce or abolish fees at the lower primary standards. This
decision is consistent with the recommendations of the World Bank Policy Study
Education in Sub-Saharan Africa. The impact on enrollment, dropout and
repetition needs to be carefully monitored. On the other hand, there is
considerable unmet demand for post-primary places, even within the high cost
private secondary education subsector. MCDE students and their parents have
shown their willingness to pay for lower quality secondary education than is
provided in formal secondary schools. There are reportedly seven applicants
for each available place in the University. Unmet demand and high private
benefit/cost ratios for secondary and post-secondary educatior. suggest
considerable scope for increased student or parental contributions at these
levels. A first step has been taken by stopping University student allowances
and instituting a MK200 net tuition payment, and introducing a loan scheme for
indigent students. However, cost recovery is still inadequate.

2.20      Resource Mobilization through Community Self-Help and Other Non-
Governmental Sources: Opportunities and Challenges. In the past, Government
has left the responsibility for primary school construction, furnishing and
equipping to local communities. However, many schools have remainod
incomplete because communities could not afford imported materials such as
roofing sheets. Government has recently begun assisting community self-help
efforts by providing imported materials paid for with bilateral aid (USAID,
Canada) and multilateral financing (AfDE and financial IDA Third Education
Project (Credit 910-MAI) and the First Education Sector Credit (Credit 1767-
MAI)). Community response has been much better than anticipated, and
available funding is insufficient to meet the requests for assistance.
Government would like to meet the communities' requests for imported materials
to finish primary classrooms already begun. Since Habitat for Humanity has
now developed suitable cheap roofing tiles in the country, Government should
encourage communities to use this cheap roofing material instead of imported
corrugated iron sheets (Annex G).
2.21      Malawi has a tradition of mission or church supported secondary
schools. These schools enjoy grant-aided status. Government can do more to
encourage churches and communities to build secondary schools. At present,
community participation has not been fully exploited and is limited to
provision of boarding facilities.  Given the high demand for secondary school
places, Government can, as in other African countries, encourage self-help
construction of secondary schools by offering to supply teachers and equipment
to communities with completed classrooms and teachers' houses.
2.22      Financial Manatement and Planning: Inadequate Capabilities and
Procedures. There are only about 25 registered qualified Malawian
accountants; the large number of expatriates in this profession do not fully
meet the shortage. The public sector is particularly affected as it is unable
to compete against the high salaries and large fringe benefits offered in the
private sector. This results in understaffed accounting and financial control
departments and staff without the training necessary to ensure high standards
of financiai management and control. The MOEC has coped well, and has good
financial information systems. However, the management culture of the
Ministry and the staffing problem have resulted in excessive centralisation.
Routine and trivial matters overload the small Ministry headquarters
accounting office, creating unnecessary paperwork and delays, and leaving less
time for financial planning and management activities (see also para 2.44).
C.  Qualitv Issues
2.23      Curriculum Reform: Vitally Needed and a Difficult. Long-Term
Undertaking.  The curricula at the primary school level are overly
theoreti4al, emphasize memorization at the expense of understanding concepts,
and depend only on textbooks instead of using a range of teaching and learning
aids.  The curricula are also heavily overloaded and needlessly
compartmentalized into an excessive number of subjects.  Ten or more of the
timetabled subjects receive perfunctory treatment in the one hour allotted to
them per week.  Because of the overlap system, the lower primary classes
receive as little as 15 hours of instruction a week. Curriculum revision has
been confined almost exclusively to production of teachers guides based on
existing texts. A detailed examination of the content of approved texts and



- 14 -
their adaptation to the realities of Malawi is long overdue. MOEC has now
begun a careful review and revision of the curriculum. A compilation of
objectives, and scope and sequence chart for each subject area have been
completed. By September 1989, the teaching syllabi for each subject area for
all standards will be completed. At the secondary school level, there are
also too many subjects. At both the JC and MCE levels, students are required
to take eight prescribed core subjects and up to three out of seven optional
subjects (Annex Table 2). In practice, the number of subjects offered in any
school is determined by staff and physical resources. The number of subjects
needs to be reduced. Curricula require updating especially in mathematics,
science and agriculture.
2.24      Instructional Materials (Textbooks, etc.): Too Few and Outdated.
Textbooks and exercise books are in chronically short supply at all levels.
Pupil/book ratios, especially at the primary level are worse than in
neighboring countries (4:1 compared to 2:1 in Botswana). Many primary school
children receive only half an exercise book a year. Some textbooks were
revised and availability increased with IDA assistance. However, the
substantial increase in school enrollment and lack of budgetary resources for
replacement has again left many students without textbooks.  Government has
agreed to an earmarked budgetary allocation of K2 per prima-y school child for
textbooks. The parental contribution of Kl per pupil annually for textbooks
replacement and their supplementary fee contributions for stationery are
totally inadequate for these needs. Stationery is severely limited or
unavailable especially in the early years of primary education. At the
secondary level, textbook shortages are compounded by lack of equipment and
supplies, particularly for science courses. Libraries are not well stocked
and student use of the libraries is not integrated into the curriculum.
2.25      Textbooks are all published by Dzuka, a small publishing subsidiary
of Blantyre Printing and Packaging, which has a monopoly of local textbook
printing. During the last ten years, Dzuka has originated less thaz, one title
a year and their main activity has been controlling the very substantial
reprint program of MOEC. MIE publishing activity is limited by their printing
capacity, which can cope with a run of only 3,000. Printing and publishing
involving longer print runs are passed to Dzuka. Arrangements have been ad
hoc, with the production manager typically receiving instructions from
individual subject specialists. Equally there has been no pricing policy and
little negotiation with outside suppliers. It is essential to institute a
workable publishing system at MIE. Textbook distribution is carried out by
Malawi Book Service (MBS), a parastatal body established in 1964 to service,
assist and promote the education system by acting as central suppliers of
educational supplies to schools and other educational establishments in
Malawi, as well as to retail traders. At present, their textbook distribution
service consists mainly in delivering reprints from Blantyre Print and
Packaging to the three Regional Education offices (REOs). For this service,
MBS has obtained a discount of 20 percent on a net price charged by Dzuka.
MOEC orders the books via MBS, and pays the full net price to MBS on
production of the endorsed delivery note.
2.26      The current situation whereby MBS delivers to the three REOs is
inadequate and unsatisfactory. First, the REOs do not have adequate storage
facilities, and deliveries cause space problems in offices and corridors,
whereas MBS has its own warehouse in each of the three regional centers, which



- 15 -
would constitute a far more suitable base for regional distribution. Second,
the REOs lack distribution expertise and resources, and books typically
languish in these offices for a month while waiting for transport. Thiro, MBS
already makes deliveries of consumables directly to the District Education
Offices and is willfng and able to deliver the textbooks as well. This
service would save time and reduce costs.
2.27      Teachers: Deficiencies in their Numbers and Training.  Teacher
availability at the primary level has not kept pace with enrollment expansion.
In 1986187 the pupil:teacher ratio in primary schools was 63:1 compared with
60:1 in 1984/85. The uneven distribution of teazhers causes this ratio to
vary widely from 48:1 in Mzuzu city to 128:1 in Mchinji and 119:1 in Dowa.
Urban areas are at a decided advantage.  To attain the target teacher:pupil
ratio of 55:1 at the current enrollment level would require an additional
20,500 teachers.  The ratio of pupils to qualified teachers improved from 87:1
to 76:1 between 1984/85 and 1986/87, but an estimated 17 percent of primary
teachers are still untrained. The Government estimates that permanent houses
are only available to about 8,000 of the 13,405 qualified teachers in the
country. Most rural schools lack decent housing and therefore have difficulty
in attracting qualified teachers. It is Government policy to require
communities to construct teachers' houses through self-help but this is not a
priority for many communities. Government needs to devise an incentive system
to get communities to provide houses, so as to be able to attract competent
and well qualified teachers to disadvantaged rural areas. The quality of
teacher training needs improving in some areas (para 3.25).
2.28      The training of primary school teachers has deficiencies in numerous
areas: (a) relevance of the curriculum especially in regard to (i) the primary
education syllabus, (ii) adequate balance between professional/ pedagogical
F         and academic/subject content, and (iii) preparation to teach standard one; (b)
training sufficient numbers of teachers in a cost effective way; (c) adequacy
of the design of the ongoing one year teacher upgrading program and parity of
qualifications with the two year program; (e) systematic evaluation of teacher
education programs; and (f) internal efficiency. Despite achievement in these
areas, some issues remain unresolved. Curriculum: it would be advisable to
raise the academic standard required of entrants, rather than trying to make
up for student academic deficiencies by increasing the subject content of
training. The curriculum neglects aspects of professional training such as
met-hods for teaching very large classes, remedial and multigrade teaching.
Teaching realities and new policies will increasingly require an understanding
of these concepts. Supply: The estimated future annual trained teacher
output of 1,700 is not sufficient to meet present and projected demand.
Demand will be substantially increased by growing primary school enrollment
and the Government's intention to phase out untrained primary school staff and
ito reduce the pupil:teacher ratio from 67:1 to 55:1. It is estimated that by
1990 there will be a gap of over 4,000 trained teachers. In order to close
the gap MOEC has two options: (a) establish new colleges at high capital and
recurrent costs and with the risk of excess capacity in future; or (b) provide
less expensive in-service training which, given adequate inputs, can achieve
results comparable with pre-service training. One year in-service
training/upzrading program: UNICEF has recently provided funds for upgrading a
small number of untrained teachers in this program. MOEC has recently
evaluated and revised the program stru'sure. The pcor examination performance
might well be because the one-year program emphasized teaching methodology



- 16 -
rather than academic content and because trainees in the upgrading program
tend to be academically weaker than their counterparts in the regular program.
Internal efficiency: The trainee selection procedures need improvement to
ensure thas all colleges are filled within two weeks of the commencement of
the academic year, thus improving internal efficiency.
2.29      At the secondary level, the issues in teacher training are quite
different. The secondary student teacher ratio is 21:1, but there is a
shortage of science and mathematics teachers. Many teachers are required to
teach subjects for which they are unqualified. The required teaching
qualification is a university degree or diploma. The degree program
essentially prepares teachers to teach only one subject which restricts their
use outside their specialty. As a result, many teachers are underutilised,
with an average weekly teaching load of 25-26 periods out of the 45 timetabled
periods (para 3.29). The university has recently restructured the training
program to improve quality and began to implement an in-service mathematics
and science teacher upgrading program in September 1988. Producing enough
science and math teachers is constrained by lack of suitable candidates from
the secondary school system.
2.30      Examinations:  Movina in the Ritht Direction But Slowly.  School
examinations in Malavs  serve two functionst  (a) tsney certify that students
have successfully completed schooling at the various levels; and (b) they
select students for higher levels of the education system. Three shortcomings
of the examinations are: (a) they tend to reflect the rote learning approach
evident in the school system, (b) there is inadequate feedback to schools on
student performance; and (c) delays In examination results cause late
selection of students for higher levels of education. Preparation,
administration and marking of examinations are undertaken by the Malawi
National Examination Board (MANEB). MANEB is constrained by a lack of
printing facilities and staff. It has to make ad hoc use of teachers and
inspectors, and has had to preempt the printing facilities of MCDE for 6
months of the year (preventing MCDE from meeting its own printing
requirements).   Multiple choice questions could be used for a significant
proportion of the examinations to increase reliability, reduce costs, and
shorten marking time. It is recognised that developing multiple choice test
questions is not easy and needs to be undertaken with great care.
2.31      Selection to Formi I is based on the PSLC examination, which may not
ensure that the best students are selected. The examination emphasizes rote
learning, fails to test higher cognitive skills, and gives an advantage to
standard eight repeaters who have two or more years to memorize enough
information to gain high scores. Although the quality of secondary education
is generally high, in 1987 only 30 percent of Form IV students taking the MSCE
scored high enough marks to qualify for entrance to the University.
Performance was particularly poor in mathematics and science, where (1986)
pass rates were only 9.6 percent and 16.9 percent respectively.
2.32      School Supervision/Inspection and Manaaementt A Lon  Wary To Go.
Primary school teachers do not get adequate supervision and guidance. There
are only 55 inspectors - one per 300 teachers - and 47 home economics
organizers for a system with over 16,000 teachers. This is far short of the
Ministry's goal of one inspector per 150-200 teachers. There is a general
need to improve the understanding among inspectors and school headmasters of



- 17 -
how to supervise and advise teachers. The inspectorate lacks (a) funds for
subsistence payments, and (b) transport, and is preoccupied with other duties,
such as examinations and curriculum development, which limits field time to
only six months during the year, and does not allow regular visits to all
schools. It is not unusual for a teacher to be without a single class visit
by an inspector for two years. A curriculum is only as good as the teachers
who implement it and any curriculum reform process must include an in-service
teacher training component. The extent of training should be determined by
the qualification of teachers and the extent to which they are expected to
modify their teaching practices. Regular school supervision and school-based
teacher training are critical to the success of the curriculum reform process.
Although MIE has an upgrading program for headmasters, this training is
limited. Some training in school management and planning is offered to
headmasters, but this is totally inadequate. With the establishment of the
Malawi Institute of Management (MIM), MOEC hopes to organize systematic
training for headmasters on school planning and management.
2.33      Distance Education: Quality is Improving but More Can and Should be
Done. Distance education is well-established in Malawi, through the Malawi
College of Distance Education. However, the quality of education offered at
the MCDE is in need of substantial improvement. MCDE uses a three way
teaching system: it combines printed and audio self-instructional materials
with some face to face teaching. The printed materials are the main aid to
learning. Unfortunately, however, many of the students do not receive all the
correspondence course materials and many cannot listen to the radio programs
because the radios are not functioning. Furthermore, the quality of the
courses and the programs are variable. Students working at home receive very
little help while those studying in the night secondary schools have only two
hours of teaching per day and even this is of doubtful quality. Students in
study centers are taught in overcrowded classrooms by teachers without subject
expertise. MCDE, under-resourced and regarded by many as inferior education,
tries to reach too many target groups through too many modes of instruction.
With ODA assistance, MCDE has recently developed a three-year plan for
management and quality improvement. MCDE should concentrate its efforts and
resources where it is most successful -- that is, JC courses offered at study
centers, which are an effective alternati e to formal secondary schools. The
night secondary schools are not functioning well and students at home have
very low examination pass rates.
2.34      The Learning Environment:  School Buildings. Furniture and Equipment
are Grossly Inadequate. Adequate facilities are required if the quality of
education is to be improved. There is only one classroom per 70 students on
average and the situation is worse in urban areas where the norm is 100 pupils
per classroom. To achieve the desired ratio of 1 classroom per 50 pupils at
the present enrollment level would require 5,900 new permanent classrooms to
meet the present shortfall, and 1,000 - 1300 additional new classrooms each
year to accommodate a 5 percent increase in enrollment - a total of nearly
13,000 new classrooms during the remaining 6 years of the Second Educational
Plan (see para 3.28). Primary schools lack furniture - there is only one
chair per 15 pupils and one desk per 12 pupils - and are deficient in learning
and teaching materials. These conditions militate against effective learning.

D.   Access and Eouitv Issues
2.35      Enrollment Levels:  Low and Prevented from Expanding Faster -- Due
to the Severe Constraints in Resources (Classrooms. Teachers. etc.).
Enrollments are still very low, even in comyparison with other countries in the
region. At the primary level, the gross enrollment ratio was 55 percent in
1986187, and net enrollment was 43 percent. The Government hopes to raise the
net enrollment ratio to 85 percent by 1995. For many, the constraint on
access at the primary level is lack of a schcol nearby; for some, it is the
cost of school attendance. Behtind that problem lies another -- the resource
constraints that limit the numbers of schools that can be built and
maintained, and the number of teachers that can be afforded.
2.36      At the secondary level, Malawi like other countries in the region,
has kept the number of places small, while historically it gave more emphasis
to building up primary enrollment. Gross enrollment for the secondary level
age group is about 4.5 percent. The only facilities are: (a) 32 Government or
Government-aided day schools (most of which, with or without Government help,
have developed board.   facilities); (b) 27 Government or Government-aided
boarding schools; (c) .o unassisted schools; and (d) about 105 distance
education centers and night secondary schools. There are insufficient
secondary school places for qualified students: only 11 percent of the 66,000
students who passed the PSLC Examination in 1987 obtained places in secondary
Form I, and a further 14 percent enrolled in MCDE centers. The selection
procedure for the upper secondary cycle (Forms 3-4) puts iCDE pupils at a
disadvantage. Formal secondary school students who pass JC are given
priority, and only the few residual places are open to MCDE students.
2.37      Female Participation: Improving But More Progress Needed.
Enrollments of girls have improved considerably at primary and secondary
levels in the past decade, as shown in the table below:
Table 2.4

Source:  Government of Malawi:  Education Statistics, 1980, 1984, 1987.
However dropout rates for girls are considerably higher than for boys, and
there remains room for improvement in enrollment at post-primary levels. The
most acute shortfall in enrollment is among girls of primary school age in
rural areas, where girls account for only 20 percent of total enrollment. The
long history of low female enrollment is reflected in much higher illiteracy
rates among women than men - 83 percent compared to 56 percent according to
1977 census data for persons of 15 years and older. Improvements during the
past decades in the participation of women in primary education are reflected
in slightly lower illiteracy in the age group of 15 to 24 years.



- 19 -
2.48      Distributional Disparitiess Some Groups And Districts Still Better
Serviced Than Others. Access to education is unevenly distributed among the
regions.  Two-thirds of primary school age children in the northern and
central regions are enrolled, compared to only one third in the southern
region.  Within regions, there are marked differences between urban and rural
areas. Net enrollment in urban Lilongwe is 138 percent but only 39 percent in
rural Lilongwe. Net enrollment is 98 percent in urban Blantyre compared with
43 percent in the surrounding rural area.
E.  Efficiency Issues
2.39      Primary Repetition and Dropout Rates are Too High. The Internal
efficiency of the education system is low, particularly at the primary level.
Only 23 percent of the children who enter standard one complete eight years
and it takes an average of sixteen years to produce a standard eight graduate,
which doubles the cost of producing a primary school graduate. Dropout
averages 13 percent for all grades during the year and is especially high in
standard one. Overall, the retention rate between standard one and three is
only 48 percent. The 1987/88 repetition rate was 20 percent; it is also
particularly high in standard one (24 percent) and in standard eight (48
percent). Higher zepetition rates in standard one are associated with
excessively large classes, lack of teaching materials and teachers who are not
trained to deal with very large classes. An estimated 10-15 percent of
children dropout after the first term when fees are due, which adds to the
repetition rate when some of these children reenter the system. Students
repeat the eighth grade (sometimes 7-8 times) trying to improve their PSLC
scores enough to gain entry to secondary school. It is essential that MOEC
implement policies that will reduce repetition and dropout rates (para 3.33).
2.40      Pupil/Teacher Ratios: Too High in Primary and Too Low in Secondary
and Post-Secondary. The extremely high primary pupil:teacher ratio of 63:1
(para 2.27) compares very unfavorably with a median for sub-Sahran Africa of
39:1. 4/ Most classrooms are not designed for more than 50 pupils, and severe
overcrowding detracts from learning. As noted in para 2.27, Government would
like to reduce this ratio to 55sl. On the other hand, there is scope for
increasing student:teacher ratios in secondary schools and the University,
where they are only 21:1 and 10:1 respectively, low by African standards.
Modest increases in these ratios would not compromise quality, but would allow
increases in enrollments without large investments in new facilities.
2.41      Teacher Under-utilization in Secondary and Post-Secondary.  The
qualification required of secondary school teachers is a University Degree or
Diploma. These programs prepare them to teach one subject and this restricts
their use in fields outside their specialization. Consequently, many teachers
are under-employed with an average teaching load of 25-26 periods a week out
of 45 time-tabled periods. Although students at both JC and MCE levels are
required to take eight prescribed core subjects and up to three optional
subjects out of 15, in practice the number of subjects offered in any school
is determined by available staff and physical resources. In a majority of
cases, school facilities tend to be unused beyond mid-afternoon. The lower
4/ IBRD, Education in sub-Saharan Africa, p.40.



- 20 -
enrollment ratio at this level end the need to reduce the number of subjects
offered suggest that schools could be better utilized through double shifting
(paras 3.29 and 3.34).
2.42      Unit Costs Need to be Contained throuah Efficiency Improvements.
Costs per graduating student depend on unit costs and on internal efficiency,
measured by dropout and repetition rates. Containment of these costs will
depend largely on improvements in quality and internal efficiency which reduce
the number of student years per graduate, and at post-primary levels, on
raising student: teacher ratios. At the primary level, Government plans to
lower this ratio from its present undesirably high level of 63t1 will place
upward pressure on unit costs. There is a need to counteract this by
efficiency gains and to complement it with quality improvements. Salary
levels are obviously an important determinant of unit costs. (Wage costs are
about 50 percent of total primary and secondary level recurrent costs and
ebout 40 percent of teacher training and University costs.) Teachers' salary
scales were increased by an average of 40 percent in 1986. This did not fully
compensate for the erosion of real wages by the high rates of 'nflation, which
have persisted, and salary scales were again adjusted in early 1989. Unit
costs (excluding annualized capital costs) and enrollments for various levels
of the education system are shown in Annex Table 3.
2.43      Access to University is Low: University Reforms have Responded to
Labor Market Needs. Access to university education is very limited. In 1987,
there were places for only 600 of the 3,500 students who passed the MCE
examination. In 1989 there were even fewer such places because of a reduced
number of dropouts. A small expansion in numbers was achieved by admitting
the first set of day students. Given the cost burden of board and lodging,
further expansion must be through increasing the number of non-residential
students. In response to recommendations by the Bank and in other reports
including a 1987-88 UNESCO review of Higher Education in Malawi, the
iaiversity has made considerable improvements in efficiency, organization, and
management, and has adjusted the numbers admitted to different courses in
response to the demand for graduates. Since 1983/84, enrollment in the
sciences has almost doubled and in the humanities has been reduced by almost
half (para 3.25). Specialized courses in agriculture and engineering have
been introduced in response to employer requirements.
F. Management. Planning. Research. Evaluation. Institutional and
Organizational Issues
2.44      The Ministry of Education: Decentralization Would Improve MOEC
Management. Although the Ministry of Education employs 33 percent of civil
servants and manages about 11 percent of the national budget, it is not
equipped to use these resources effectively. In April 1988, the Education
Service Review (ESR) was completed. Of all the subjects covered by the ESR,
the Ministmry's organization and management style receives the most exhaustive
and detailed attention. The ESR finds several key problem areas: (a)
excessive centralization and concentration of decision making - even for
routine operational matters at high Ministry levels in Lilongwe: (b) poor1y-
defined work objectives, authority and responsibility at all levels; (c)
excessive hierarchial layers; (d) a need to strengthen all aspects of career
development. The ESR recommendations follow "modern management theory": (a)



- 21 -
decentralize geographically and rationalize decision-making so that high
levels of authority can concentrate on policy; (b) define iork objectives and
base performance reviews on achievement; (c) restructure the organization; (d)
imp3ament a series of actions to enhance career development. The ESR observes
that many of the recommendations would change the Ministry's management
culture and might therefore encounter resistance. While the Ministry accepts
the ESR recommendations in principle, doubt remains as to whether It will put
them into effect (Annex D).
2.45      Planning System Needs StrengtheninR.  Planning weaknesses have a
particularly serious impact on the sector and its future, and stem from
understaffing of the planning department, separation of the planning and
administrative functions, and insufficient planning guidelines. Effective
management and planning have been made even more difficult by budgetary
uncertainties. While the decision to involve district levels in the planning
process should be commended, a mechanism for consolidating district plans and
giving them operational effect should be established at both regional and
headquarters levels. While MOEC has prepared a Ten Year Plan (to 1994195), it
suffers from a number of deficiencies, the most important of which are (a) a
lack of prioritization of objectives, (b) the lack of year-by-year targets,
and consequently, of the means to monitor performance or adjust targets, (c)
the scarcity of quantitative targets, whether in terms of people or in terms
of costs, and (d) little focus on the m2eans of implementation. The planning
process at MOEC, in fact, appears largely a derivative of funds availability:
from Treasury for recurrent costs, from donors for development. To improve
this process, MOEC at the urging of the Bank is preparing a year-by-year (to
1991/92) demand-driven (i.e. what the Ministry proposes) itemization of
quantitative targets (e.g. numbers of students, teachers and classrooms),
prioritization of policy changes, and estimates of recurrent costs for all
aspects of education (the University would prepare its own plan, to accompany
the MOEC Plan (para 3.35)).
2.46      Stevs Have Been Taken to Improve Research and Evaluation.  Supported
by the First Education Sector Credit (Credit 1767-MAI), the research and
evaluation unit of the MOEC was expanded. The arrangement under which the
Unit is located in the Ministry has proved unsatisfactory because of staffing
constraints, competing claims on tbe time of the research staff and unwieldy
bureaucratic procedures. After much discussion, MOEC has taken steps to
improve the situation and a decision was made to move the unit to the
University, as this is a more appropriate research environment. The Center
for Education Research at the University would have a strong policy
orientation and much of the research undertaken would be in response to
proposals from MOEC (paras 3.35 and 4.16).
G. Bank Group Experience and Lessons Learned
2.47      The Bank has been active in the education and training sector since
1963 as reflected in six education projects (two of which are ongoing) and in
sector work -- particularly the study on Financing and Efficiency of
Education, (Report No. 4894-MAI) and policy discussions which resulted in the
preparation of the Second Education Plan. The Bank has also undertaken a
Human Resource Development Study which takes a longer term perspective, and
financed a management review of the MOEC.



- 22 -
2.48      Bank lending in the sector has focused on reinforcement of general
education at the primary and secondary levels. The four completed projects
supported expansion of and quality improvements at the primary and secondary
levels including cechnical education. The First Education Project (Credit
102-MAI, signed in 1967) provided US$6.3 million equivalent to expand
secondary education to meet manpower needs, to introduce technical subjects in
secondary schools, and to establish a new primary teacher training college in
Lilongwe. A Project Performance Audit Report (No. 2914) was completed in
March, 1980. The Second Education Project (Credit 590-MAI, signed in 1975)
provided US$11.6 million equivalent to establish a new primary teacher
training college in Mzuzu, to expand secondary education, principally through
provision of additional places for girls, and to establish 23 model primary
schools which would also serve as rural adult education centers. A project
completion report dated September 21, 1982 has been distributed. The project
was not formally audited. The Third Education Project (Credit 910-MAI and EEC
Credit 12-MAI, signed in 1979 and totalling US$22.0 million) expanded and
broadened the Bank Group's involvement in educational development. It was
designed to improve (a) primary education through self-help construction of
1000 primary school classrooms and provision of textbooks to primary school
children; (b) educational management, through establishment of the Malawi
Institute of Education (MIE), provision of vehicles for the school
inspectorate, and support for various educational studies and evaluation; and
(c) training of essential middle level manpower, through expansion of the MCDE
(then known as Malawi Correspondence College) and the Chancellor College
secondary teacher training program, as well as through modest expansion of
agricultural, commercial, and general secondary education. The Credit Account
was closed on December 31st, 1985. A Project Completion Report dated August,
1988 has been distributed. The Fourth Education Project (Credit 1123-MAI,
signed May, 1981 for US$41.0 million equivalent) provided for 3,960 new
secondary student places and for further expansion of Chancellor College's
secondary teacher training program. The project also included pre-investment
studies for a new Institute of Public Administration and a new primary teacher
training college, as well as funds to prepare a National Educational Plan.
The Credit Account was closed December 31st, 1986 and a Project Completion
Report dated August, 1988 has been distributed.
2.49      Evaluation of these four completed projects indicates inter alia
good success in assisting the Government to increase access to primary
education and to improve the quality of primary school teachers. At the
secondary level, implementation of the four projects has resulted in
enrollment increases as planned and the secondary schools are well managed..
Both the Third and Fourth Education projects assisted in increasing the number
of qualified secondary school teachers. The introduction of technical
subjects, especially wood and metal work, into secondary schools has not been
fully satisfactory because of high recurrent costs, lack of specialized
teachers and lack of interest. Because of these problems, the MOEC is no
longer introducing technical subjects into general secondary schools.
Experience with the self-help primary school scheme under the Third Project
was unsatisfactory because of management and organizational problems. An
important lesson learned is that communities are overburdened with self-help
schemes in every sector, and consequently considerable lead time for
implementation of self-help schemes may be required.  Therefore, the self-help
component must be limited to items that are easily available, such as bricks,
and should not include additional community labor inputs.



- 23 -
2.50      The Fifth Education Pro1ect (Credit 1330-MAI signed May 5, 1983, to
provide SDR 30.9 million) was designed to improve primary education, expand
the output of secondary level educational institutions, increase the number of
trained accountants and accounting technicians and to strengthen the education
management and auditing systems. Apart from a slight delay in providing
counterpart funds, overall implementation of the project is satisfactory. The
project will close September 30, 1990.
2.51      The First Education Sector Credit (Credit 1767-MAI signed May 7,
1987 and totalling US$27.0 million) is designed as a sector credit and its
objectives are to assist in carrying out the first phase of the Second Ten-
Year Education Plan (1984/5 - 199415) and restructuring the sector to improve
quality, equity and efficiency and management, all in accordance with a Policy
Action Program which is part of the legal agreemezt.  Subject to modifications
upon which the Borrower and the Association may agree from time to time to
achieve the objectives, the Credit finances (a) construction, furnishing and
equipping about 1,500 primary classrooms, 750 primary teacher houses, two
secondary boarding schools and one secondary day school, (b) expansion and
upgrading of three MCDE centers, and the Fational Examination Center, (c)
provision of about two million basic student textbooks, (d) improvement of in-
service training for primary school teachers, primary school supervision, MCDE
organization and operation and MOEC's management, (e) implementation of cost
recovery measures at secondary schools and university, (f) establishment of a
loan scheme for university students, and (g) studies. The policies are being
implemented and the overall implementation is satisfactory (see Annex H for
the status of implementation), although budget cuts have ca :sed delays. The
Project is expected to be completed by the original Closing Date. The
proposed Second Education Sector Credit furthers the objectives of this
project.
H.  Role of Other International Asencies and Non-Government Ortanizations
2.52      Although the Bank Group has been the major source of external
financing in the sector, a number of other sources of assistance have made
vital contributions of various kinds. USAID through the Human Resources
Institutional Development (HRID) project is assisting the Government in
graduate level training. USAID has also assisted in the development of the
Polytechnic. ODA has provided (a) fellowships for specialized training in the
United Kingdom, (b) a limited number of English, Math, and Science teachers at
the secondary level; (c) assistance with the development of technical schools
and (d) managerial assistance for the MCDE. UNICEF has assisted with
upgrading of untrained primary school teachers. UNDP as well as CIDA have
financed equipment and technical assistance for curriculum development at MIE.
UNDP has recently reached an understanding with MOEC to provide technical
assistance and fellowships for the planning function of MOEC. African
Development Bank has funded two education projects which support construction
of (a) primary schools in the urban areas, (b) secondary schools and (c)
offices for REOs. NGOs: Malawi has a tradition of missionary involvement in
secondary education. Most grant-aided schools are church affiliated schools.

III. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY AND ACTION PLAN
3.01      To address the issues discussed in Chapter II and work toward
Its objectives for education as outlined in Chapter I, the Government has
developed and committed itself to a strategy and action plan involving (a)
an updating of its public expenditure plan for the remainder of the
1985186-1994/95 planning period and (b) an associated policy reform
program. A brief overview of the key features of the reform program and
public expenditure plan Is presented in Sections A and B, and then further
details are outlined, issue by issue, in subsequent sections. The strategy
and action plan embodied in the public expenditure and reform packages are
the foundation for the proposed Credit described in Chapter IV.
A. Key Features of the Reform Protram and
Updated Public Expenditure Plan
3.02      The reform program was developed through an iterative,
consultative process, taking into account (a) the Government objectives in
the sector, (b) the requirements of the sector, (c) resource constraints,
{d) implementation constraints, and (e) the feasibility of possible
changes, considering consensus-building and political economy issues. The
reform program agenda is summarised in a detailed list and timetable of
agreed actions to i,e taken, as set forth in a Letter of Education
Development Policy with an attached Policy Action Program in the form of a
matrix of specific objectives and measures. This letter, signed by the
Minister of Finance on behalf of the Government and in consultation with
the MOEC, is included as Annex A, with the matrix attached (para 6.01).
3.03      The reform package constitutes a serious attempt by the
Government to address the principal problems and issues in the sector, as
outlined in Chapter II. It represents a continuation of the changes
initiated in conjunction with the First Education Sector Credit. The
Government has used the forum of the National Advisory Council on Education
to discuss the most controversial aspects of the policies in order to build
a consensus. As part of the First Education Sector Credit, the Government
has also set up a monitoring and evaluation committee to ensure that the
program of reform is implemented. To date, several significant measures
have been carried out (Annex A, Attachment 1).
3.04      The reform package as a whole, when fully implemented, is
expected to improve:
(a) quality, by improving facilities, deploying more trained
teachers and providing more and better textbooks;
(b) access and equity, by providing more primary schools and
reducing fees in the first four years of primary school and
increasing the number of secondary school places;



- 25 -
(c) efficiency, by reducing primary dropout and repetition rates,
and by making more use intensive use of facilities and teachers
at the secondary levell
(d) resource allocation and mobilization, by incre:sing the share of
education resources devoted to the primary level and adjusting
relative cost recovery at different levels;
(e) education management, through decentralization of education
services and improvements in the planning process.
3.05      The updated expenditure plan consists of approved targets for
investments and recurrent spending by the central Government for the
education sector for the remainder of the ten-year period from 1985/86
through 1994195, after which time a follow-on ten-year plan will be phased
in. The investment portion of the Plan is summarized in Table 3.1 and the
recurrent portion in Table 3.2. As with the reform progra&z, these
expenditure plans were developed and agreed to through an iterative,
consultative process that took into account (a) the requirements of the
sector, (b) the resource constraints, (c) the reform process, past and
future, and its expected effects on both th* requirements and the
constraints, (d) the findings and implications of the Public Expenditure
Review covering the entire Government budget, (e) the planning done
previously on education expenditures (especially in the 1985 - 1987 period,
when the FiLst Education Sector Credit was being prepared) and the lessons
of experience from those efforts, in the light of later evidence on how
well the plans were achieved, and (f) the prospects for the overall
economic and budgetary picture in the next five to seven years.  The
expenditure plan and the reform program are, by design and of necessity,
closely inter.inked. The expenditure plan supports and facilitates the
reforms, and v.ce versa.  Each depends for its success on the satisfactory
progress of the other.
B. Financina
3.06      The Level of Total Public Expenditure on Education.  To develop
the expenditure plan summarized in Tables 3.1 and 3.2, a review and
assessment were done of alternative programs and investment options, in
relation to the agreed objectives for the sector, and what could feasibly
be done in the remaiLder of the 1985/86 - 1994/95 period to move closer
toward those objectives. Building upon work carried out initially for the
Public Expenditure Review, estimates were prepared for different scenarios.
3.07      These calculations, as in all projections for future events,
required decisions and assumptions about how certain crucial policy choices
will be resolved and how other factors beyond Government control will
evolve. The principal assumptions underlying the final expenditure plan
that has been adopted relate to:
-    the growth in enrollment rates
-    the progress of quality improvement initiatives, particularly in
regard to (a) teachers (numbers, compensation levels, and length



- 26 -
and type of training) and (b) instructional materials
(pupil/textbook ratio, etc.)
-    the success of measures to reduce costs. improve efficiency, and
adjust cost recovery
-    the development of physical facilities (school maintenance, and
standards for classrooms size, furnishings, and quality of
construction)
-    the prospects for raising the level of public expenditure on
education (which depends on what happens to (a) the total budget
and (b) education's share of it)
-    the prospects for mobilizing additional resources from other
sources (community self-help, fees, donor assistance).
The stance taken on each of these dimensions, and reasons involved, are
discussed in the "issues" sections following. In each case, tradeoffs had
to be made betweenw .t would be desirable considering the needs and what
is possible considering the resource constraints.

3.08      The expenditure plan from the First Educativn Sector Credit
provided a convenient benchmark to start from. A revised plan reflecting
the new circumstances was arrived at more easily and effectively because
the consultative process was able to focus on where the earlier plan needed
updating and refining.
3.09      When the expenditure plan was first formulated, it seemed fully
fundable and consistent with the then-expected budgetary picture. It
envisaged that: primary school enrollment would grow at 5.8 percent per
annum; annual enrollment growth at the university would be limited to 4
percent; and all other plan targets would be met. The total investment
package for the ten year pe-iod was estimated at MK349.2 in current prices,
63.3 percent of the original proposal in the Education Plan. The savings
were achieved by relying on community self-help for primary school
construction, by building day secondary schools without expensive boarding



- 27 -
facilities and by reducing the university growth target. The Appraisal
Report recommended that if further cuts were imposed by resource
limitations, these should not be directed at primary education, but at post
primary levels, particularly the university and technical/vocational
training.
3.10      There have been two primary developments that make a further
revision of that plan necessary. First, the preliminary results of the
1987 census show a much larger population than had been projected on the
basis of the 1977 census. The population appears to have grown at an
annual rate of 3.5 percent between 1977 and 1987. This means that progress
towards meeting the enrollment rate targets by 1994/95 will require much
greater expansion of the school system than planned. Second, considerable
deterioration of the economic situation in 1986 necessitated severe cuts in
Government expenditure in 1987/88 and in the budgets for subsequent years.
Instead of the MK146 million (current prices) anticipated for education
sector investments for the three year period 1987/88-1989/90, MK 74 was
made available - only 51 percent. Higher cost escalation than anticipated
has further retarded realization of the investment plan.
3.11      Lower cost options have to be adopted if the targets for primary
school enrollment and the pupil$teacher ratio are to be met. Even the
primary schools being built under the First Education Sector Credit (whose
capital costs are half those of the schools being built under the ongoing
AfDB project) are unaffordable given present budget constraints and the
very large number of new classrooms needed (paras 2.34 and 3.28). With
communities providing bricks and the project financing providing other
building materials and construction by small local contractors, costs are
MK23,000 per rural classroom and MK56,000 per urban classroom. Government
has little option but to rely more heavily on community contributions and
construction. A major problem with past self-help construction has been
the inability of communities to buy roofing sheets, the most expensive
component. Through the proposed Credit, Government will supply roofing
sheets for 228 unroofed classrooms and 406 teachers' houses (par& 4.12).
3.12      New primary teacher traiaing colleges would have a capital cost
of approximately MK30,000 per traitse place, and an annual recurrent cost
per trainee of MK1,165 (1988/89) or MK2,330 per graduate (Annex Table 3).
An in-service training course using distance teaching methods could be
developed at a cost of MK4.42 million, with total recurrent costs per
graduate of as little as MK830 (exclusive of trainee salaries) (Annex B and
para 4.12). This would provide a flexible, low cost training option which
could be of comparable quality to the present pre-service full-time teacher
training. It would not entail high-cost investment in new capacity which
might no longer be needed onco enough new teachers had been trained to
lower the pupil:teachex ratio to the desired level.
3.13      Achieving the expected educational gains from investments in
facilities, training and other inputs depends on the strength of
management, administration and planning of the education sector. In
recognition of this, the development budget makes provision for investments
to strengthen and Improve these functions.



-      -
3.14      The new (i.e., updated) Plan for the remainder of the 1985186 -
1994/95 period has been structured with the above points in mind.
3.15      The investment budget, as Table 3.1 indicates, will be allocated
in the 1990/91 - 1994/95 period as follows: 37 percent on expanding access
and improving quality at the primary level, 24 percent for secondary
education (including MCDE), 18 percent for primary school teachers'
training, 4 percent for tertiary education, and 17 percent for improvements
in the inspectorate, the examinations system, and Ministry planning,
management and administration. This will not entirely meet the expansion
goals in the Ten-Year Education Plan: there is no provision for the 30 new
secondary schools included in the Education Plan, and only 10 new MCDE
centers are included. The MOEC has decided on priority investments which
could be added to the Investment Plan if additional financing becomes
available in later years of the Plan. During negotiation, agreement was
reached with the Government that IDA's concurrence would te sought for any
changes in the investment program (para 6.06 (a)).
3.16      The Education Share of the Government Budget.  The education
sector recurrent expenditure requirements increasingly have been
underfunded as new investments have expanded the educational system. 71  In
order for the potential returns on educational investments to be realized,
adequate financial resources must be available to the sector to support the
quantitative and qualitative improvements planned. Projections of the
recurrent expenditures required to support the planned (and ongoing)
investments in the education system have been estimated to the end of the
Plan period, comparing a hypothetical scenario without reforms under which
many of the Plan targets remain unattainable, and a scenario "with
reforms'. These projections are then compared with estimates of the
resources likely to be available to the education sector. Table 3.2 shows
the increase in net expenditures required to achieve the revised plan
targets (detailed assumptions and projection data are given in Annex Table
4). The updated recurrent expenditure plan provides for an increase in
education's share that is consistent with the Government objectives and
commitment as set forth in Devpol, and with the conclusions of the Public
Expenditure Review. In this, it represents a major step forward, in accord
with national policy and in keeping with overall positions on resource
utilization. Education's share would rise significantly from its 11.1X
level in 1988189. The increase to the 15 percent target in Devpol by
1994/95 is essential if the reform program is to be implemented
successfully and the Plan targets achieved. Even the scenario without
reforms, which falls far short of achieving the Plan goals for expansion
and quality improvements, would require an increase in education's share of
the total Government revenue budget to 13.4 percent by 1994/95. Moreover,
the projections make the conservative assumption that wages and salaries of
MOEC employees maintain their 1988/89 real levels, unlike the projection of
total Government expenditure which builds in a gradual restoration of
7Z, See World Bank, August 1988, Report No. 7281-MAI, Malawi: Public
Ex2enditure Review, Volume II, para 107.



- 29 -
public sector wages to their 1987/88 real level. 8/ Very high inflation in
1987 and 1988 has eroded the gains of the 1986 salary revision,  and
periodic wage increases may be necessary to attract and retain high quality
personnel in the teaching force. Without a sizeable increase in resource
allocation to education, access to basic education will be denied to
thousands of Malawian children and the quality of the Malawian educational
system will be seriously jeopardized.

Note:
e/ Low cost recovery assumptions are that university fees remain at K200 per student,
secondary boarding and tuition fees at K150 and K30 respectively, and that the fee
income from technical/vocational students remains constant at its nominal level per
student full-time equivalent (FTE). High cost recovery assumptions are that university
fees increase to K300 in 1991/92 and K400 in 1992193; that secondary tuition fees double
and boarding fees increase to K200 in 1991/92, and technicallvocational level income
retains it real level per FTE. (See Annex Table 3 for further details.)
_I Enrollment projection based on 1987188 preliminary estimate and recent trend.
3.17      Table 3.3 explores the implications of different assumptions about
resource availability. For the purpose of this exp-sition, it is assumed that
the impact of a resource shortfall is on the size (but not quality) of the
primary level. It is more realistic to expect that both quality and expansion
will be affected to some extent. Without any increase in its share of
Government recurrent expenditure, the education budget grows at 3.7 percent in
real terms, which would barely allow the system to keep pace with the growth
of the school-age population. If post-pzimary budgetary levels were not cut
and the plenned quality improvements were implemented at the primary level,
then the budget for primary schools and teacher training would not be adequate
to support even the present total enrollment, and the gross enrollment rate
would fall substantially. A modest increase in the education share to 13
percent would allow a very small gain in the gross enrollment rate, from 55
percent to 58, or to 59 if the additional revenues from increased fee levels
at post-primary levels were allocated to the primary level sub-budget.



- 31 -
3.18      Allocations Within the Education Budget.  The updated plan will
result in a gradual reallocation of public expenditure on education in
directions consistent with the Government's policies. Primary education will
receive enhanced emphasis, fulfilling aims identified long ago. The
reallocation will affect both the investment and the recurrent budgets.
3.19      The recurrent budget (Table 3.2) will change considerably, resulting
by 1994/95 in a substantially larger proportion for primary education than has
been the pattern until now. The share for primary will increase from 52
percent in 1988189 to 62 percent in 1994/95.
3.20      An increased resource allocation allows primary enrollments to grow
to 1.73 million, the pupil:teacher ratio to fall to 55:1, and other quality-
enhancing measures to be taken, notably increased provision for textbooks.
The proposed special in-service teachers' training course would allow a much
lower cost, more rapid expansion in the number of trained teachers than would
be feasible relying on full-time pre-service residential courses. At the
secondary level, the planned increase in the pupil:teacher ratio from 21 to 25
and introduction of double shifts will allow 27 percent more formal secondary
school places to be provided than without these changes, without a
commensurate increase in recurrent costs.  Average recurrent expenditure per
student is projected to fall, although this will be contingent in part on
nominal fee increases that at least maintain the real level of cost reccvery
at this level. At the university, continued efficiency improvements and
increasing numbers of day students will result in modest recurrent unit cost
reductions. The reduction in real per capita expenditures for
technical/vocational education is the result of anticipated efficiency
improvements. An overall real annual growth of recurrent expenaiture of 8.8
percent is required, with expenditures for the primary school and teacher
training subsectors growing faster, and expenditures for post-secondary
education and the MCDE growing more modestly.
3.21      Cost Recovery and Other Sour-:es of Financing.  In deciding on
appropriate fees at each level of the system, unmet demand and the possible
additional number of places that could be financed out of additional revenues
must be weighed against people's ability to pay and the likely impact of fee
changes on attendance and access for those from low income families. Cost
recovery levels are very low at post-primary levels (except for MCDE). The
long waiting lists for places in the few much higher cost private secondary
schools suggests that at least some parents are both willing and able to pay
considerably higher fees than presently charged. Moreover, the high inflation
rates of recent years have greatly eroded the real level of school fees. The
proposed increase in secondary tuition fees to K60 in 1992/93 will restore
them to only their 1986/87 real level (para 6.05(b)). University students
have begun to pay a net tuition fee equal to only 3 percent of costs.
3.22      The Government budget currently provides over 90 percent of all
education recurrent financing. The key determinants of resource availability
for the education sector are the growth rates of GDP and of the overall
Government revenue budget, and the share of the revenue budget that is
allocated to education. Fees and other income generated within the education
sector are an important supplementary source of revenue for recurrent
expenditures. The most recent projection of real GDP growth is 3.7 percent



- 32 -
for 1989190, accelerating gradually to 5 percent in 1993/94 and 1994/95.
Total Government expenditure (comprising interest, the development and revenue
budgets and extrabudgetary expenditures) is expected to grow in real terms at
3.9 percent, and the overall Government revenue budget to grow at a slightly
lower rate of 3.4 percent to reach MK1108.5 million in 1994/95 (1988
prices) 91, compared to a (revised) estimate for 1988/89 of MK907.0 million.
3.23      The proposed increases in user charges for University students would
increase cost recovery from 3 to 7 percent. The proposed increase in
secondary level fees would increase cost recovery in day schools from 8
percent to 17 percent, and in boarding schools from 20 percent to 30 percent
of 1989 costs, although inflation and other cost increases will result in a
smaller real cost recovery increase (Table 4.2 and para 6.02(i) and 6.04(c)).
These are to be complementeJ by other measures designed to reduce unit costs
such as more intensive use of physical facilities at the secondary and higher
educational levels, improved education planning and increased teacher loads at
the secondary level.
C. QualitY
3.24      To improve the quality of education and consequent student
achievement, Government's strategy calls for: (a) an increased number of
qualified teachers at both primary and secondary levels; (b) increased school
inputs including textbooks and Improved secondary level library resources;
(c) curriculum revision and development including preparation of supporting
instructional materials at all levels; (d) expanded primary school
inspectorate system; and (e) a revised test and measurement system to reflect
the curriculum chAnges.
3.25      Teachers.  The Government intends to increase the supply of
qualified primary teachers by expanding existing teacher training colleges and
by building additional colleges. The present teacher training colleges will
enable an estimated 1,700 new teachers to graduate each year. Allowing for an
attrition rate of 1 percent, the present training capacity would result in
about 24,500 primary school teachers by 1994/95. This would be adequate to
teach 1.641 million pupils with a pupiltteacher ratio of 67:1, or 1.347
million with a lower ratio of 55:1. Meeting target enrollment and
pupilsteacher ratios will require an increase in the supply of trained
teachers beyond the present PTTC capacity. Investment in new teacher training
facilities would be difficult given the current fiscal situation. Other
programs designed to improve the quality of the teaching force include an in-
service training program for unqualified teachers supported by UNICEF,
completion of the review of the curriculum of teacher training colleges, and
upgrading courses for qualified teachers and headmasters. Quantitative and
qualitative Improvements in school supervision and in primary teacher
education are also planned. There is a shortage of secondary school science
teachers. To makA up for the thortfall in the number of nationals qualified
to teach science subjects, the Government has been relying on technical

- 33 -
assistance. The Plan envisages a substantial increase in the number of
student places available for those majoring in science. Since 1983184,
enrollment in the sciences at the university has almost doubled (para 2.43).
In addition, the Government has revised and consolidated the primary
curriculum and intends to strengthen the broadcasting system including
developing effective new programs (para 2.23).
3.26      Textbooks.  The Government plans to revise most textbooks.  Most of
the revised instructional materials will be developed by a small group of
writers to be drawn from subject committees. During each writers workshop,
the writers will receive training on how to prepare a pupil's book and
teacher's guide. Much of the work will be completed at the workshop. In some
cases, the writing will extend beyond the workshop. The process of developing
the instructional materials will include careful review of the documents at
each stage. Outside consultants providid by UNDP and IDA will assist with
this review. An important part of the process of developing the material is
fcrmative evaluation, an evaluation process that seeks to improve the
materials as they are being created. As the instructional materials are being
developed, they will be tested in selected schools near MIE. A much broader
but less intensive formative evaluation will be carried out during the second
year for each standard. Feedback will be obtained mostly through
questionnaires.
D. Access to Educational O* ortunitiea
3.27      The targets for expansion of educat'.onal facilities formulated five
years ago for the Education Plan now seem unattainable in the light of
resource constraints and the new population census data. Although these
targets have not been formally revised, MOEC recognizes that they will take
longer to accomplish than originally expected.
3.28      Primary level.  The Government's objective is to ensure that by the
end of the Plan period 85 percent of the age group (6-13) are enrolled in
school. This target is based on population projections using the 1977 census
data, which suggest that a net enrollment rate of 85 percent in 1994/95 would
imply a total enrollment of 1.4 million. Revised projections using the newly
available 1987 data indicate that there will be 2.356 million 6-13 year olds
in 1994/95, 85 percent of which would be 2.003 million. In 1986/87, 1.022
million children were enrolled. An enrollment of 2.003 million in 1994195 at
the present pupilsclassroom ratio of 70:1 would require an additional 14,013
classrooms to be constructed. Lowering this ratio to the desired 55:1 would
mean an additional 21,818 classrooms, equivalent to constructing about 3,600
new classrooms each remaining year of the Plan period. On-going IDA and AFDB
projects will add about 2,500 classrooms, an average of 417 classrooms a year.
The investment cost of the additional 3,183 classrooms each year would be
about MK89 million - about three times the current annual development budget
of the Ministry. Given the recent implementation difficulties and the
scarcity of funds, the Government has scaled down its plan considerably and
intends to implement an expanded self-help primary school school construction
program (para 3.11).



- 34 -
3.29      *econdary level.  In 1986/87, there were 26,000 formal secondary
school places, 8,000 short of the planned quantitative target of 34,000 which
would provide places for 3.7 percent of the 14-17 year old cohort in 1994/95.
Achieving the desired enrollment rate of 5 percent would require 46,000 places
or 20,000 additional places.  On-going IDA and AFDB projects will provide
6,900 additional neu- places. The Government intends meeting its target by
making more intentive use of existing facilities: (a) increasing the
pupil$teacher ratio from its current level of 21:1 to 25:1 uthich would
increase enrollment by 5,580 in 1994/95; (b) by double shifts in urban schools
(Annex E); and (c) by making more intensive use of staff through increasing
teaching hours. The Government has completed a secondary school mapping plan
which indicates that day secondary schools are a feasible alternative to the
current system of boarding. Therefore, substantial investment in new
secondary schools, especially day schools, is planned. Furthermore, MOEC will
encourage private secondary schools development and self-help community
construction of secondary schools. To ensure equal access to senior secondary
school, MOEC will revert to a merit based selection policy for Form III and
maintain accurate statistics to enable the policy to be monitored.
Additionally, Government plans to construct about 30 new day secondary schools
with a total enrollment of 7,200. The new policies of a second shift and
increasing the proportion of day students entail a slight change in admission
criteria so that boarding facilities will be reserved for students whose homes
are not in the immediate vicinity of the school (para 2.41). The Plan
anticipates that MCDE would enroll about 44,000 students by 1994/95. On the
assumption that each study center serves about 200 students, this would
require the construction of an additional 100 centers by the end of the Plan
period. It also implies an annual enrollment increase of 10 percent.
Historically, MCDE enrollment has been growing at 2.8 percent per annum. It
therefore seems unlikely that it would reach 44,000 by 1994/95.
3.30      Primary Teacher Trainina ColleRes.  The Government plans to fully
utilize existing facilities and introduce changes in selection procedures to
ensure that colleges are filled within two weeks of commencement of the
academic year. Furthermore, the Government plans to train about 4,500
teachers in a special training program (Annex B).
3.31      Technical/Vocational Education.  Government's plan is to provide a
total of 440 technician level places, 980 staff training places, 400
commercial and business study places and 380 places for assistant craftsmen
and specialist courses. However, the capacity expansion originally included
in the Plan and in Devpol is not justified while capacity utilization remains
low and growth of formal sector employment sluggish.
3.32      Tertiary  Education.  The Plan for the university provides for
enrollment to double to 4,000 full time student equivalents by 1995, including
500 students in an external studies department and 200 in the proposed Faculty
of Medicine. In recognition of the budgetary implications of a new medical
school, the Government has revised the phasing of the development of a full
scale medical school and is now planning to begin with one year of clinical
training in country while continuing to train medical students abroad.
Although the Education Plan originally envisaged considerable new investment
in the university, it has been agreed that this be postponed, since some
increase in student numbers can be achieved without new investments, and the



- 35 -
present growth in employment opportunities does not warrant a large general
increase. The university intends to expand the policy begun in 1988 to admit
day students and complete the feasibility study on a distance education
facility at the university.
S. Efficiency
3.33      The proposed reform package constitutes a serious attempt by the
Government to tackle the quality and efficiency issues at the primary level
(paras 2.39-2.40). Multiple repetition of grades, especially standard eight,
is not unusual. Placing a limit on the number of times a child repeats a
grade has been politically difficult for the Government. The new strategy
will (a) discourage repetition especially in standard eight by reserving 75
percent of all Form I places for those who pass the PSLC examination on the
first attempt and registering all primary school students to prevent pupils
transferring to new schools undetected; (b) reduce repetition in the lower
grades through developing new teaching techniques, including making effective
use of school radio broadcasting; (c) reduce the number of dropouts by
abolishing school fees at standards 1 through 4 and substantially increasing
school inputs at this level.
3.34      The studentsteacher ratio at the secondary level is to be increased
to 25:1, through increased workloads for teachers who will be required to
teach an average of 33 periods weekly with a minimum of 27 contact hours
(paras 2.40 and 2.41). As part of its agreement with IDA under the First
Sector Credit (Credit 1767-MAI) the Government is phasing out construction of
boarding facilities and has increased boarding fees in secondary schools. As
part of the agreement for the proposed new Credit, assurance will be received
that boarding and tuition fees will be increased further (para 6.02 (i)). In
order fully to utilize existing technical/vocational facilities, the
Government is transferring the Board of Governors' assistant technician
training courses from the Polytechnic to the technical colleges. The
university has taken steps to improve efficiency, management and organization
(para 2.43). It has adjusted the numbers admitted to various courses in
response to market demand, reduced its administrative costs substantially and
eliminated the allowances paid to students. It charges a net tuition fee of
MK200 and has in place a loan scheme for indigent students. The university at
present only recovers about 3 percent of its running costs compared to 15
percent at the secondary level (including MCDE). The Government needs to
increase further the user charges at the university, and plans to raise
university fees to MK300 in the 1992/93 academic year and MK400 in 1993/94
(Attachment 1 of Annex A).
F. Manatement. Plannint and Research
3.35      Required actions include: strengthen the inspectorate; reconstitute
the National Advisory Council to include parents and non-educators; strengthen
the planning function within MOEC, regional and district planning, and MIE;



- 36 -
10/ complete and formulate a five-year rolling Education Plans decentralize
the activities of the MOEC Headquarters; prepare a human resource development
strategy; institutionalize the monitoring and evaluation procedure; grant
autonomy to MCDE in regard to financing and staffing; review the sa,ary
structure of accounting and specialized course instructors as a means of
retaining such persons and strengthen the education research and evaluation
capacity of the university (paras 2.45-2.46).
G. Impacts and Viability/Sustainability of the Protram
3.36      Educational Impact.  The policy reforms described above will have
positive impacts on the quality of educational services, enrollments at all
levels, and on the efficiency with which education resources are used. The
gross primary enrollment rate is expected to increase from 58 to 73 percent by
1994/95 compared to a negligible improvement under the status quo (see Table
3.4). The most dramatic increase is in the gross enrollment ratio for girls
which is expected to increase from 50 to 70 percent by 1994/95 compared with
54 percent without reform (Annex Table 5). The reforms will result in
increases in the numbers who enter standard 1 and in the number of students
who remain in school. New intakes into standard 1 are expected to grow by 5.6
percent per annum compared to 3.9 percent without reform. Significant
improvements in etudent flows in all primary standards are expected. Dropout
and repetition rates are expected to drop considerably (Charts 4 and 5). The
number of graduates per 1,000 entrants is expected to increase from 364 in
1986187 to 749 in 1994/95 for boys and 296 in 1986/87 to 730 for girls in
1994/95. The number of students completing primary education within only 8
years is expected to increase ten times. The reduction in dropout and
repetition rates will lower by almost 50 percent the average number of years
it takes to produce a graduate (Annex Table 6). The most significant
improvement is expected in standard 8 where repetition is expected to drop
considerably from 48 percent to about 10 percent as a result of improvements
in the examination system, the new registration policy, the new selection
procedure to Form I and expanded secondary access. Enrollment in formal
secondary schools is expected to grow at 4.8 percent per annum, while
enrollment at MCDE and at the university is expected to grow at about 4
percent per annum.
10/    Details of actions to be taken are in Annex 1.

3.37     The enrollment targets presented in para 3.36 have been set within
the context of the physical and human resources available or likely to be
available during the remainder of the planned period. Although enrollment
targets especially at the primary level are expected to be met, improvements
in the classroom:pupil ratio would require considerable success by Government
in mobilizing self-help efforts to construct classrooms especially in the
urban areas where overcrowding is severe. Improving the teacher:pupil ratio
will come through the expanded teacher training program which the proposed
Credit will support.  The success of these policy measures will be
periodically assessed by the Monitoring and Evaluation Committee established
under the First Education Sector Credit which supported the first phase of the
reform process (para 4.29). During this second phase of the reform process
new pedagogical practices would be introduced and improvements in education
flows and use of resources would be made.

3.38       Financial Impact.  Budgetary requirements under the current trends
and with policy changes have been estimated through detailed cost projections
using constant 1988 prices and the 1988/89 budget as the base (Table 3.5).
The projected total recurrent costs in 1994/95 are MK 132.4 million compared
with MK 120.0 without the reform. Most of the increase is required for
quality improvements and additional expansion at the primary level, including
the salary costs of the extra teachers needed to reduce the pupil:teacher
ratio to 55sl. The formal secondary level allocation increase to accommodate
a larger expansion is offset to some extent by the fall in secondary unit
costs due to raising the pupil:teacher ratio and the lower unit costs of a
double shift. The increased student:staff ratio at the university and the
expected increase in fees allow a smaller budgetary allocation. The moderate
expansion expected in technical/vocational education can also be achieved more
cost effectively as a result of efficiency improvements.

3.39        The Education Plan intended that the recurrent budget be
reallocated across the different levels of the system to increase the share
for primary and technical/vocational education, offsetting this by decreases
in the secondary and university shares. Table 3.6 shows the actual
allocations in 1980/81, 1984/85 and 1987/88, the 1988/89 budgeted shares, the
Plan target allocation for 1994/95, and the projected shares given the reform
program. The changes since the beginning of the Plan period are well on trend
towards the 1994/95 goals. Indeed, the planned reallocation in favor of
primary education has already been exceeded. Further overshooting of this
target and of the target share reduction for tertiary education indicated by

the recurrent budget projections under the reform program are consistent with
the educational needs of Malawi and MOEC priorities.

3.40        Cost Effectiveness.  The reform program and investment plan are
expected to improve the cost effectiveness of the system. The expected impact
on unit recurrent costs has been shown in Table 3.2. Although annual unit
costs for primary school pupils rise by 28.6 percent over the period, the
expected reductions in repetition and dropout rates will significantly lower
the cost per primary school graduate, which is a more appropriate measure of
the cost-effectiveness of the system.   The cost per graduate will fall by 27
percent from MK590 to MK430 (in constant prices) as a result of the dramatic
fall in pupil-years per graduate from 16.9 to 9.6.
3.41        Rates of Return.  Estimates of the social rates of return to each
level of education in Malawi using the "short-form" method of analysis 11/
(see Annex Table 1) suggest that investments are indeed justified by the
benefits measured by expected differences in income streams. This conclusion
is strengthened by consideration of the additional benefits which are not
captured by the analysis - improved quality of life, the association between
womens' educational levels and fertility and the nutritional status and health
of their children.

IV. THE PROPOSED PJ
A. Obiectives. Rationle-. and Summary Description
4.01      The proposed project would support the Government's efforts to
(1) Implement the strategy and action plan embodied in the public
expenditure and policy reform programs for the sector as outlined in
Chapter II, and thereby (ii) address the issues discussed in Chapter I.
Specifically, the project would contribute to (1) improving the quality of
education at all levels; (2) expanding access and increasing efficiency,
focussing on the primary and secondary levels; (3) strengthening sector
management, budgeting, and planning; and (4) improving resource
mobilization and allocation policies, through increasing cost recovery at
post-primary levels and reversing the decline in the sector's budget share
in accordance with the recommendations of the recent public expenditure
review and with Government's stated policy.
4.02      As noted earlier, the project would assist the Government to
proceed with the second pbase of its long-term educational improvement
plan, building upon and extending the progress achieved in the first phase,
while also strengthening and intensifying the reform process in selected
areas where needed. It would accordingly be the successor to the First
Education Sector Credit that was anticipated when the latter was proposed
in the mid-1980s, and as a continuation of it, would be broadly similar in
structure, rationale, objectives, and type of lending support. The second
project would also be one of the Governmentts principal instruments for
working toward the Devpol aims for education, which are reflected in the
revised Ten-Year Education Plan for 1985186 - 1994/95.
4.03      The project would provide financial assistance for specific
investments constituting a time slice of a ten-year expenditure plan for
the sector. These funds would be released as successive steps of the
reform process are achieved. There would be no fast-disbursing element --
no Credit funds would be disbursed against an import list or otherwise
unrelated to specific expenditure within the sector. Thus, the Credit
would be a sector investment project, rooted in specified components, with
a strongly policy-based orientation and content, but no untied financing of
general imports.
4.04      The relationship of this project to the broader expenditure plan
in summarized in Table 4.1, for the time slice covered by the proposed
project period, 1990-95. The total investment required for this period
under the revised plan adopted by Government in consultation with IDA is
MK223.06 million (US$84.17 million in current prices). This requirement
would be met from the sources shown in the table. Financing commitments
for the period total NK112.16 million, or 50.3 percent. To complete the
program, an additional MK110.90 million is required. To close the gap, an
IDA credit of MK97.78 million (about US$36.9 million) is proposed. The
Government would provide an additional US$13.12 million out of national
budgetary resources.

4.05     The policy reform content of the project is summarized in the
Letter of Education Development Policy and associated policy matrix in
Annex A. In order to ensure effective and expeditious implementation of
the reform package, the investments to be supported with IDA financing have
been divided into three distinct sub-projects. Key elements of the reform
have been designated as conditions for release of funds (paras 6.02-6.05)
for expenditures associated with each sub-project, as indicated in Table
4.2. Release of specified funds would take account of progress on other
elements of the reform. In addition, the Government would provide from its
own resources an increase in the annual education recurrent budget in real
terms to the levels mutually agreed by the Government and the Association,
so that the education share of the national budget would reach at least 15
percent by the end of the Plan period.
4.06     IDA and the Governrment would jointly monitor the program at
specific intervals: for Credit effectiveness; one year after Credit
effectiveness and again 30 months after Credit effectiveness. These
reviews would have the following objectives: to monitor the implementation
of the program; and to ensure adherence to the program objectives, fund
release conditions and performance targets (paras 6.04, 6.C5 and 6.06).

Items in sub-project A are (a) those of highest priority, such as effecting
quality improvements at the primary level, (b) those which are
prerequisites for activities to be undertaken in the later years of the
Credit; and (c) investments which would require five years to complete.
Most of the civil works, which are the most visible investments have been
placed in sub-project C, as an additional incentive to carrying out
important difficult reforms. The interconnections between the investment
sub-projects and the policy reform conditions for release of funds have
been designed so that once a particular investment activity is begun it can
always be completed. Thus, for example, when a construction sub-component
is initiated after one set of policy conditions have been met, that work
would be fully funded and able to be completed even if some subsequent
policy reforms, pertaining to some other sub-components, were delayed for
any reason. Also, the project has been designed so that substantial
funding would be available from the moment of project effectiveness, so as
to facilitate rapid progress toward implementation of the entire program.
4.08     The formulation and preparation of the project, including the
interlinked investment sub-projects and policy conditions, have been under
the active leadership of the MOEC in consultation with all relevant other
parts of Government. Extensive discussions have been held over much of the
period of the First Sector Credit, and there is strong backing for the
project design. Over the more than two years that the Government with the
advice and help of IDA staff has been developing the project, several
special events have been held to widen and deepen the dialogue --
including, most recently, a major workshop in February 1989 for all
Malawian institutions with leading roles in education.
4.09     The format for the project -- specific investments within the
context of a ten-year expenditure plan and a policy reform program (blt no
fast-disbursing element) -- was chosen because it suited the circumstances
particularly well. A policy focus was clearly needed in view of the issues
and needs the sector faced, as have been outlined previously. Specific
investment requirements, set within the framework of a sound, sustainable
long-term expenditure plan, also were clearly a priority. Disbursement
against general imports, on the other hand, was not appropriate at this
juncture, either from a macro perspective (because the IDA lending program
clearly had a sufficient share of fast disbursing funds in the pipeline),
or from a sector perspective (because the additional complexities connected
with assuring the funds disbursed to the Treasury for general imports would
redound to the benefit of education were not needed to achieve the results
required).
4.10     A summary description of the project components follows: (1)
quality improvement (37.32 of the total project cost) through (a) curricula
reform and development; (b) improvements in the preparation, production,
and distribution of textbooks and other instructional materials; (c)
development and introduction of new methods for more effective use of radio
in primary schools; (d) improvement of the distance education system used
at the secondary level; (e) development and introduction of low cost
approaches for improving science instruction and the library system at the
secondary level; (f) improvement of teacher training; (g) expansion of the
number of qualified primary teachers; (h) reforms in the examination

system; and (') strengthening the school inspection system; (2) access
imp:ovements (25.3Z) through (a) facilitating community self-help upgrading
of school facilities by providing roofing sheets and limited amounts of
school furniture; and (b) planning and Implementing reforms in promotion
criteria and facilities utilization (double-shifts at the secondary level
and day students at the university); and (c) expansion of the university's
capacity to produce acccuntants, a skill in& extremely short supply; (3)
manasement. budgeting, and planning (30.42) through (a) various
institutional strengthening and capacity building measures focused on the
Ministry of Education and the Malawi Institute of Education; and (b) a
decentralization program for the Ministry; and (4) Improved resource
mobilization and allocation (7.0Z) through (a) reforms in fee structures at
all levels; (b) changes in i:eporting requirements for recurrent and
investment expenditure plans; and (c) increases in the sector's budget
share.
B. Detailed Description
4.11     Paragraphs 4.12 to 4.16 provide a more detailed description of the
project by level (i.e. primary, secondary, post-secondary, education
management and research).
4.12     Primary Leve... (a) Curriculum Revision. Material Development and
In-Service Training: The Credit would strengthen the MIE through technical
assistance for specialists in reading (2 staff years) and evaluation (2
staff years), and with additional local staff (3 positions), provision of 6
low cost staff houses and two vehicles.  (b) Teaching/Learning Materials:
The Credit would support the development, production and distribution of a
new series of teachers guides and textbooks for the first four standards of
the primary school system in English, Chichewa and Arithmetic and General
Studies for standards 2-4. This would be achieved through the enhancement
of existing publishing facilities at the MIE by appointing for 4 years each
a Publishing Manager to oversee the entire process and an editor with
Desktop Publishing (DTP) expertise. Additional equipment would Include 2
PC's plus one AT computer equipped with DTP facilities. The Credit would
also fund 3,000 sets of low-cost locally-made simple teaching sids for use
in standard 1 classes. (c) Teacher Trainings The Credit would fund the
in-service training of approximately 4,500 teachers using the special
teacher training program being developed under Credit 1767-MAI. The Credit
would provide one staff year of expert assistance in educational technology
and two staff years of short-term fellowships for college tutors, and would
fund the running costs of the program including the salary of the project
Director. The Credit would fund all of the costs of the salaries for the
trainees in the first year, and thereafter a part of trainee salaries with
the MOEC absorbing trainee salaries on a sliding scale (para 3.12). MOEC
will assess performance of the trainees carefully, and retain in the
teaching force only those who perform satisfactorily. In addition, Credit
funds would be used to expand an existing teacher training college
(Montfort College) to increase capacity by 360 student places. (d)
Improving the School Broadcasting Systems The Credit would provide funds
to improve the radio system and use it as a tool for improving the quality
of primary education. New programs would be developed which would not be
just supplementary as at present but would be an integral part of teaching
the new curriculum. The Credit would fund the cost of a modest expansion



- 45 -
in broadcasting facilities at Malawi Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), 5,000
solar powered radios, approximately 12 staff years of technical assistance
to develop the eystem and train Malawian counterparts, and the running
costs of the program with Government absorbing the cost on a sliding scale
(Annex K for details). This component would be evaluated yearly.
Conditions of disbursement would be that: (i) the contractor should be
acceptable to IDA; (ii) a pilot phase should demonstrate clearly the
effectiveness of the programs being developed; and (iii) a satisfactory
maintenance and replacement system for the radios and equipment be put in
place. (e) Improvement in the Measurement of Achievement at the Primary
Levels the Credit would fund a testing and measurement specialist for two
years to assiet in developing a national assessment test and to train
Malawian counterparts and would provide funds for upgrading the computer
system and for the administration of the assessment test. During
negotiation, assurance was received that local staff would be available to
work with the consultant (para 6.06 (b)). (f) Primary School Supervision:
The Credit would support the inspectorate by providing the recurrent costs
of 30 additional inspectors and by providing 60 motorcycles. The
Government would take over the funding of the salaries of the inspectors
gradually beginning in the third year. In addition, the Government would
arrange for servicing of the vehicles to be undertaken by the District
vehicle maintenance depots. (g) Roofing Sheets: The Credit would provide
roofing sheets for 228 unroofed classroom blocks and 406 teachers' houses
in rural areas (para 2.20 and Annex G); and (h) Furniture and Eauipment:
Low cost chairs and desks would be provided for 1,000 standard 5-8
classrooms and 2,000 standard 1-4 classrooms (para 2.34 and Annex F). MOEC
would use local craftsmen managed by the Small Enterprise Development
Organization (SEDOM) to produce these chairs and desks, which would
contribute to the development of small scale industry in Malawi.
4.13     Secondary Level:  (a)  The Credit would support expanded access to
secondary education through provision of 10 new double stream Malawi
College of Distance Education centers. During negotiation, agreement was
reached on the granting of financial autonomy to MCDE (para 6.02 (b)). (b)
Curriculum Revision and Instructional Materials Provision: The Credit
would support workshops for the revision of the secondary school curriculum
by MANEB; the development, production and distribution of low-cost science
equipment and kits suitable for the Malawian environment including 3 months
of training within Africa for 5 technicians (1.25 staff years of
fellowships); and the restocking of school libraries and a training program
for school librarians. (c) Supervisions Secondary schools are not
adequately supervised because of lack of transport, therefore the Credit
vould fund 6 additional vehicles to be located in the regional education
offices for use in school supervision and by the Faculty of Education when
supervising trainees during teaching practice.
4.14     Post-Secondary Education.  Credit funds would be used to provide
the Faculty of Commerce at the University with 12 staff years of technical
assistance, 15 staff years of overseas fellowships under a twinning plan
with an overseas university, and provision of business computers, software
and peripheral equipment.
4.15     Inetitutional Development.  (a) Strengthening Education
Managements The. Credit would cover the operational costs of workshops to



- 46 -
assist in decentralizing some of the accounting activities of the
Ministry, and would fund in-service training of headmasters and principals
in school management techniques. The Credit would also fund 28 modest
staff houses in rural areas for district scho-1 inspectors and the three
regional coordinators of the special primary teacher training program and
salaries of 21 accounting and staff development personnel for the regional
offices. (b) Strengthening Education Plannings In order to assist in the
implementation of the major recommendations of the Education Services
Review with respect to planning, the Credit would include financing for a
series of short term consultancies (two staff years in all) to assist in
locally organized workshops aimed at improving the quality of the planning
process at the national, district and regional levels and would fund the
salaries for five years of 4 education planners within the Planning section
of the Ministry, including one at a senior level and one who would be
responsible for monitoring and evaluation, in order to bring this function
up to establishment strength. To assist the Statistical Unit within the
Planning section to keep proper statistics and undertake analyses so
important in any planning, the Credit would fund an additional position of
a statistician. Provision would be made for in-service training to diploma
level (3 years) for 10 additional statistical assistants at the University
(30 staff years in all). (c) Strengthening the Project Implementation
Unit: To strengthen the PIU and assist in localization of the PIU
professional staff, the Credit would fund 4 staff years of technical
assistance of an architect and 4 staff years of a quantity surveyor as well
as 10 staff years of fellowships - 5 for external training in architecture
and 5 in quantity surveying (both tenable only in an African university).
Operational expenditures for project administration excluding local
salaries would be included under the proposed Credit. In addition, the
Credit would provide funds for the support of the school maintenance unit
of the PIU. In order to ensure that funds are disbursed rapidly, the
Credit would support the recruitment for 2 years of a well qualified
financial analyst to be based in the Project Implementation Unit to take
care of forward planning of the Ministry as well as all procurement issues.
4.16     Support to the Center for Educational Research (CER). The Credit
would support the work of the new CER by providing 3 staff years of
technical assistance for a full time researcher and 6 staff months of short
term research consultancies and the operating costs of the CER for 3 years.
The Credit would specifically fund the ongoing multi-year research on
primary school quality as well as tracer studies of secondary school
students and new studies on gender differences in school achievement and on
the factors affecting absenteeism with particular attention to the timing
of the school year (para 2.46).
4.17     Summary of Technical Assistance and Fellowships.  Overall, the
Credit provides for 54.5 staff years of technical assistance (Annex Table
8). A large part of this is required for the radio component and for
Accountancy lecturers -- skills that are unavailable or scarce in Malawi.
Malawians will be recruited for the other technical assistance positions
where possible. In addition, the Credit would finance 58.25 staff years of
fellowships of which 30 staff years would be in-country training and 13.25
in Africa. In addition, the 3 workshops planned during the life of the
Credit would provide training for more than 900 education staff. During
negotiation, assurance was received from Government that contracts for



- 47 -
experts would be executed on time and selection of recipients for
fellowships and for staff positions would be carried out expeditiously
(para 6.02 (f)).
C. Prolect Cost
4.18          Summary of Project Costs.  The total cost of the proposed project,
including Government's contribution, is estimated at about US$42.3 million
equivalent in.luding customs duties And taxes equivalent to US$1.35
million. The estimated costs and local and foreign exchange shares are
given by component and category of expenditure in Tables 4.3 and 4.4 and

of recently awarded contracts for similar facilities being built under on-
going IDA projects. Furniture costs for new facilities are based on
existing priced furniture lists and amount to 5 percent of the cost of new
construction. Furniture for existing primary schools, which is to be
purchased from local craftsmen, has been costed on the basis of material,
labor and a management mark-up cost for SEDOM (see Annex F). The cost of
low-cost locally-made roofing for unfinished primary schools and teachers'
houses has been estimated on the basis of information obtained in-country
by the project architect. Equipment and vehicle costs have been calculated
on the basis of existing equipment lists and recent procurements under on-
going projects. Technical assistance costs -- US$80,000 per staffyear of
specialist assistance and US$20,000 for external training -- have been
estimated on the basis of recent prices for comparable technical assistance
in Credit 1767-MAl. Technical assistance costs include housing, travel,
relocation costs, subsistence, office services, fees and recruitment costs.
Overheads are separately costed. The cost of MNK8,000 per student-year for
training at the University of Malawi is based on recurrent unit costs.
Base cost estimates reflect prices as projected for the time of
negotiation.
4.20       Customs Duties and Taxes.  In line with Malawian policies and
practices, items imported especially for the proposed invostment program
would be exempted from customs duties and taxes. Certain items are
expected to be purchased locally on the open market and reimbursement
percentages have been calculated to exclude duties and taxes estimated at
US$1.35 million equivalent on such items as imported building materials
under construction contracts and local purchase of furniture and textbooks.

4.21     Contineencv Allowances.  Physical contingencies of 10 percent have
been added to the base costs of civil works and 5 percent to the base costs
of furniture and equipment. Price contingencies were calculated based on
Bank staff estimates of international and domestic inflation; and have been
applied in accordance with the implementation schedule (Annex Table 13) on
the assumption of the following annual rates of increases
1989    1990    1991    1992    1993    1994      1995
Foreign         5.3      1.3    2.0     2.0     2.0      2.0      2.0

4.22     Foreign Exchanze Component:  The foreign exchange component,
estimated at US$20.0 million equivalent or 53 percent of the total project
investment cost net of taxes, has been calculated as follows: (a) civil
works and project administration, 65 percent; (b) project administration
and professional services, 60 percent; (c) furniture made by local
craftsmen4 30 percent, and other furniture, 50 percent; (d) locally
produced roofing tiles, 25 percent; (e) equipment and vehicles, 100
percent; (f) textbooks, 75 percent; (g) technical assistance and overseas
fellowships, 100 per_ent; and (h) local training and workshops, 25 percent.
The foreign exchange estimates take into account that the bulk of the
equipment and a considerable part of the building materials would be
imported.
4.23     Recurrent Costs.  Under the proposed project additional recurrent
costs would be generated by (a) recruitment of additional instructors for
the new MCDE centers and the expanded teacher training college, (b)
additional posts in the planning department, inspectorate and regional and
district offices, (c) appointment of 4,500 trainee teachers, (d) the
additional work required during vacations of the staff of the primary
teacher training colleges, (e) operation and maintenance of new buildings,
vehicles and equipment, and (f) incremental budget for the Center for
Educational Research. The total additional recurrent costs generated by
these items would be US$11.9 million over the project life. Consistent
with the Bank's strategy for Malawi as discussed in the Public Expenditure
Review (Report 7281-MAI), the project would finance a substantial portion
of these costs (80 percent). Local salaries, including salaries of trainee
teachers, would be financed on a sliding scale, with the project paying all
of the increment initially, and the Government absorbing these gradually
over three years. At project completion, the additional annual recurrent
costs would amount to 10 percent Lf the 1990/91 MOEC recurrent budget,
however, 80 percent of this is for salaries of the additional 4,500
teachers to be deployed. The long-term recurrent cost implications of the
project are minimized by (a) the very limited capacity expansion through
construction of new faciliti-s and (b) the agreed efficiency enhancing
measures, which would reduce the cost per graduate substantially especially
at the primary level teacher training institutes and at the secondary
level.

D.  Financing Plan
4.24     The IDA Credit of US$36.9 million would finance 90 percent of the
total project cost net of taxes, or 100 percent of the foreign exchange
component and 78.6 percent of local recurrent costs net of taxes.
Government would finance 10 percent of project costs.  UNDP is parallel
financing technical assistance complementary to that provided under the
Credit.  No other donors have made commitments.  The financing plan is
summarized in Table 4.5.

- 52 -
(i) Civil works valued at US$ 4.7 million would be procured
through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines. Civil works valued
at $3.2 million would be procured through Local Competitive
Bidding (LCB) since these would consist of a large number of
small value contracts which are scattered all over the
country and are spread over time. The local tendering
procedures for Malawi are generally acceptable. The average
value of each contract is about US$150,000.
(ii)  Goods required for the project include equipment,
vehicles, furniture, roofing sheets and textbooks.
(a)   Equipment and vehicles valued at US$3.3 million would
be procured through ICB in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines. Materials such as paper, pencils and
other instructional material required in small lots
and quantities during the lifetime of the project
valued at US$2.0 million would be most appropriately
procured through prudent shopping with quotations from
a minimum of three bidders. The average value of each
of these lots is expected to be lower than US$5,000.
(b) Furniture valued at US$1.8 million would be procured
through LCB since these are simple items locally
available. SEDOM would coordinate this. Where LCB is
not practical SEDOM would subcontract the requirement
to small village joiners and carpenters at one center
in each district.  The total value of procurement in
this category is not expected to exceed US$50,000.
(c) Roofing tiles valued at US$1.1 million would be
procured through LCB. It is expected that the various
community production centers assisted by UNDP Habitat
and Housing for Humanity and other organisations
(Annex G) would participate.
(d)   Textbooks valued at US$5.5 million would be procured
through ICB in accordance with the Bank guidelines for
procurement (1985).
(iii) Servicess     Technical assistance valued at US$5.2 million
would be recruited under the Bank Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants, 1981. Architectural firms for civil works
would be selected in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
All fellowships and training workshops financed by the
project would be carried out under terms and conditions
acceptable to IDA.
(iv)  Recurrent costs consisting of local salaries (US$8.3
million) and operating costs (US$3.7 million) would follow
regular Government procedures and would be reimbursed on the
basis of actual expenditures. The operating costs include



- 53 -
fuel, maintenance of vehicles and equipment including data
processing facilities.
4.26     The threshold for prior review by IDA would be US$100,000.  More
than 70 percent of procurement contracts would be subjected to prior
review. The first LCB document would be reviewed by IDA before its release
for bidding.
P. Disbursement
4.27     Credit proceeds would be released in 3 phases. As stated in para
4.05, the project consists of 3 sub-projects. Sub-project A will disburse
over 60 months, sub-project B over 48 months, and sub-project C over 30
months. Disbursement from the Special Account would be against agreed
expenditures.  Disbursement would be on the basis of:
(a)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local
expenditures for civil works and professional services;
(b)   100 percent of foreign and local expenditures on roofing
materials, furniture, equipment, vehicles and transportation
of furniture and equipment to school sites;
(c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local
expenditures on textbooks;
(d)   100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local
expenditures for technical assistance, fellowships and
training;
(e)   100 percent of salaries of local staff (excluding staff of
the Project Implementation Unit) for FY90/91, 91192 and
92/93 and thereafter 70 percent; and
(f)   80 percent of operational expenditures for project
administration.
Simplified disbursement procedures on the basis of statements of
expenditures would be allowed for the following items: (i) civil works
contracts of less than US$100,000 equivalent and other contracts of less
than US$50,000 equivalent; and (ii) in-service training costs and
operational expenditures of the PIU and the Planning Section of the
Ministry.
4.28     Special Account.  A special account of the equivalent of the
amount US$2.0 million covering 6 months expenditures would be kept in a
commercial bank account on terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, to meet
eligible expenditures for goods and services. Replenishment would be made
up to the amount released on satisfaction of the conditions set out in
paras 6.06(c). Replenishment applications would be accompanied by monthly
statements from the commercial bank, suitably cross referenced by the PIU
to the related application. Amounts to be replenished would take into
account the limits imposed on each package (see paras 6.03, 6.04 and 6.05).



- 54.-
G. Imilementation
4.29     The implementation of the reform program is to be carried out by
the Planning Section of MOEC through the Committee on Monitoring and
Evaluation set up under Credit 1767-MAI. This Committee which is chaired
by the Principal Secretary, MOEC, would be responsible for ensuring that
the objectives of the program are met. The Committee is to provide support
to the Planning Section in the following areas: (a) coordination among
various sections of MOEC; (b) preparation of the relevant reports for the
annual review of progress with the Bank Group; and (c) monitoring and
reporting on progress made in implementing various policies. In addition,
the Committee would supervise the MOEC's budget requests (development and
recurrent budgets) for consistency with programmed activities, staff and
policy action objectives. The performance indicators (Annex Table 7) were
agreed upon during negotiation (para 6.02 (h)). In order to help ensure
that the reform program is implemented smoothly and on schedule, the
Government is currently taking steps to strengthen the planning function of
the Ministry so that it would be in a position to implement the reform. In
addition, the responsibility for the reform would be directly with the
Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Education. In order to ensure that
funds are disbursed rapidly, the Credit is supporting the recruitment of a
well qualified financial analyst to be based in the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) to take care of forward budget of the Ministry as well as all
procurement issues. The PIU will be responsible for the physical
implementation of the project. The PIU is also being strengthened with two
expatriate architects and a quantity surveyor. The Statistical Unit of the
Ministry would be strengthened with equipment and personnel. A senior
Education Planner would be recruited to assist the MOEC in its education
planning. In addition, the Government assured IDA during negotiation that
adequate funds would be made to the MOEC to carry out the investment
program and that no changes would be made to the agreed five-year program
without reference to IDA (paras 6.02(g), 6.03(a), 6.04(b) and 6.05(d)).
4.30     Project implementation is expected to take five years beginning
April 1990. The Project would be completed by December 31, 1995 and will
close by June 30, 1996. The implewentation schedule is given in Annex
Table 13 (for physical implementation) and Annex I for policy programs.
The implementation of the items in sub-project A will be phased over the
five-year life of the project, those in sub-project B over the last four
years of the project, and those in sub-project C over the final two-and-a-
half years of the project.
4.31     Status of Credit Preparation.  An identification mission took
place in March 1988 and a preparation mission in October 1988 at which time
the different elements of the reform package were discussed and agreed upon
with the Government. A workshop on education reform was held in February
1989 to build consensus and ensure MOEC's sense of ownership of the reform
program. An appraisal mission in February/March 1989 reached final
agreement with Government on the reforms and Credit components. Work has
started on a census of all unfinished primary schools, on preparing the
implementation plan for decentralization of the functions of the Ministry
of Education and on estimating the required development and recurrent
budgets for Education for the rest of the Plan period. Low cost furniture
for schools has been designed and costed. In addition, the PIU has



- 55 -
detailed architectural drawing of all the buildings to be financed under
the Credit.
4.32     Impact on the Environment.  The Credit finances school Inputs
primarily and has no impact on the environment.
4.33     Impact on Female Education.  The Government has a policy of open
access to primary education. The policy reforms which are integral to this
project would have substantial positive impact on female enrollment at the
primary level. The gross enrollment rate for girls at this level is
expected to increase from 54 percent in 1986/87 to 70 percent by 1994195
(para 3.36). Since a third of all teacher training places are reserved for
girls, the planned increase in the number of primary school teachers would
provide employment to about 2,000 female teachers.
H. Reportint and Monitorinx
4.34     Auditinz. Monitoring and Reporting.  All project accounts
including the special account would be audited annually by an independent
auditor satisfactory to IDA. The audit statement would include a separate
paragraph with an opinion with respect to amounts withdrawn on the basis of
statements of expenditure. Continuous monitoring of the progress of the
reforms would be the responsibility of the strengthened planning section of
the MOEC while day to day responsibility for ensuring that available Credit
funds are disbursed in time would be the responsibility of the PIU. At
each designated review period, there would be a review of the achievement
of the reform objectives by the Government and IDA, in order to ensure that
conditions for funds release are met. At the same time, the MOEC forward
budgets would be reviewed. The Government would submit to IDA semi-annual
progress reports and within six months of Credit closing, it would submit a
report on project implementation and achievements.



- 56 -
V. BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01      Benefits.  By supporting the Government program for educational
reform, the Credit would have short and long term benefits contributing to
higher quality education, greater efficiency and equity, and a more cost
effective system. In the short run, primary school pupils would have
improved access to textbooks. The proportion and absolute number of
trained teachers in primary schools would increase significantly and the
frequency and quality of school supervision would improve. More relevant
curricula, a more effective examination system and better learnirg
materials in primary and secondary schools would be introduced. There
would be expanded access (a) at the primary level, directly benefitting
children who would otherwise receive little or no education, and (b) at the
secondary level through the introduction of the shift system. The
additionai MCDE centers would increase the chances of getting a secondary
education. These improvements in access would be especially beneficial for
rural areas and poor families. In the medium and long run the Credit would
improve internal efficiency by reducing repetition and dropouts thus
lowering the cost per graduate. By making the system more cost effective,
the program would free resources for quality improvements at this level.
The quality of instruction in mathematics and English would be improved in
the lower primary levels through innovative use of radio instruction. The
program would assist Government in meeting the demand for middle and high
level managers by strengthening post-secondary commerce and business
programs. Cost recovery at post primary levels would increase, freeing
resources for further expanding and improving the system. The wide ranging
reforms require strong and efficient sector management and a major benefit
accruing from this operation would be the expansion and strengthening of:
(i) the planning function including its data gathering and analytic
capacity, and (ii) educational research capabilities. The PIU would be
improved. Improved methods of assessing children's achievement would be
introduced. Local craftsmen would benefit considerably as the suppliers of
roofing and school furniture.
5.02 Risks. There are several potential risks involved in successfully
implementing this Credit and the policy reforms on which it is based.
First, Malawi's present difficult fiscal situation constrains Government
expenditure, and poses the risk that education's development and recurrent
budget allocations may not increase enough to allow timely implementation
of the investment plan and adequate funding of the expanded system, and
that cost savings and increased cost recovery from the education system,
instead of being recycled to improve educational quality, might be diverted
to other activities of the Government. This risk is minimised by
Government's commitment (stated in Devpol) to increasing education's
budgetary share, and by the requirement that the Ministry of Education
submit its forward budget estimates for the phase of the education plan
that is supported by the Credit for approval by the Finance Ministry before
Credit effectiveness.  Second, there is a risk that the radios to be
provided under the Credit might not be properly maintained.  This risk is
minimised by the requirement that the Government simultaneously put in
place a maintenance system which can be continued even after the Credit
Account has been closed. Third, unless skillfully presented to the public,
there might be strong opposition to increased cost recovery at post primary



- 57 -
levels even though a loan scheme is already in place at the tertiary level.
This risk is mitigated by the fact that Bank staff and Government officials
have spent a considerable amount of time discussing in detail all the
activities to be undertaken during this period in order to build a
consensus. A high level of Bank supervision is planned and the regular
public expenditure and project reviews will also help to ensure that the
objectives of the Credit are met. Fourth, the ability and willingness of
communities to build new classrooms might not keep pace with the expansion
in primary enrollment. This risk is reduced by the provision of roofing
sheets under the Credit to assist communities, and by close liaison between
MOEC and local development committees (who coordinate self-help efforts).
Furthermore, school building is an obviously suitable activity for the
public works (with in-kind payments) that are being considered by
Government (with IDA assistance through the work on food security). Fifth,
the large number of trainee teachers to be recruited into the new three
year in-service training program may not all perform satisfactorily. This
risk is being addressed through conditionality that requires MOEC to
develop criteria against which to evaluate their academic and practical
performance and to release from service those who are unsatisfactory.



- 58 -
VI. ASSURANCES  AND
6.01      During negotiations, the Government reconfirmed its commitment to
implement the actions outlined in the Letter of Education Development Policy
dated August 28, 1989, and the associated Policy Action Program (Annex A and
the attached policy matrix). In line with the schedule agreed with the Bank,
the principal actions to be carried out include: curricula reform at the
primary, teacher training and secondary levels; restructuring of the Ministry;
revieion of the content and format of the primary school leaving examination,
strengthening of the planning function and the inspectorate, and reduction in
the level of subsidy at the post-primary level.
6.02      Within the context of carrying out this program, the Government has

Mr. Edward V.K. Jaycox,
Vice President,
The World Bank,
1818H Street, N.W.,
Washington D.C. 20433,
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Jaycox,
LETTER OF EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT POLICY
I am writing to you in connection with the proposed Second
Education Sector Credit to inform the International Development
Association of the steps the Government has already taken or is
planning to take to improve the educatlonal system in Malawi.
Through a process of restructuring, reforming and expanding the
education system, the Malawi Government aims at developing a more
effective system with increased access at all levels that is
sustainable,  given  available  resources.       The  Government's
development objectives are elaborated in the Ten Year Education
Plan 1985/86 to 1994/95 and were communicated to IDA. The
recently published Statement of Development Policy reaffirms our
policies and goals.
As you are aware, the Government commissioned the firm of
Price Waterbouse to carry out a thorough review of our Education
services.   The report has now been received and  its major
recommendations accepted. The Government is fully aware that the
long term economic and social development of Malavi is heavily
dependent on the educational level of its population, and it is
also conscious of the fact that the social sectors, particularly



- 61 -
ANNEX A
Page 2 of 6
education,  have been underfunded  in the past.   The serious
economic constraint which Malawi now faces makes it essential to
use available resources in the most efficient and effective way
possible, and to supplement the Government budget with additional
resources.
Achievements in Education
Despite the severe resource constraint, the Government has
continued to expand access to primary and secondary education and
to improve efficiency and quality. The most important measures
taken are as follows:-
(a)   Primary Level:  (i) the primary school curriculum is
being revised so as to make it consistent with our
socio-cultural environment; (ii) steps bave been taken
to greatly reduce the incidence of repetition; and
(iii) a multi-year research project on factors
affecting the quality of primary education has just
been completed.  Report is being finalized.  Initial
results have assisted in our policy formulation.
(b)   Secondary  Level:  (i)  boarding  fees  at  secondary
schools now cover food costs;  (ii) MCDE tuition fees
now cover 30S of recurrent cost.   A link bas been
establihebd  between  the  International  Extension
College of the UK and MCDE to strengthen management
and Improve quality.  Steps are underway to make MCD';
a  self-accounting  institution  with  a  measure  of
autonomy.
(c)   Teachint Training   the one yetz upgrading programe
for untrained teacbers is in place.   This programme
has recently been evaluated and steps have been taken
to remedy the deficiencies.

(d)   University of Malawi: allowance to University students
have been abolished; as of Academic year 1988/89,
students pay net tuition fees of K200. A loan scheme
is in place to assist poorer students.
(e)   Examinations:  the two examination systems have been
merged   to   form   a  National   Examination   Board
responsible for preparation and administration of all
examinations.
Proposed Reform 1989 - 1995
Over the period 1989/90 - 1994/1995, the Government is
planning to institute a major reform of the education system.
The objectives and timetable are set out in the attached policy
matrix. The major elements are as follows:-
1.    Primary Level:   Adjustments will be made within the
education  budget  to  ensure  that  the  available
resources are used to improve the quality of education
and expand access especially at the primary level.
(i) Registration of all primary school pupils will
begin in October, 1989. By July 1990 registration of
all primary school pupils will be completed.   The
system will facilitate the monitoring of pupils'
progress and help us control repetition.   (ii) A new
pupils' assessment procedure will be initiated to
minimize the incidence of repetition at the lower
levels.     (iii)  Revision  of  the  primary  school
curriculum  will  be  completed.       (iv)  A  complete
revision of primary level text books to bring them in
line with the new curriculum will be undertaken. (v)
In order to increase access, Government will consider
to abolish tuition fees for standards 1 to 4. Parents
of all primary school pupils will continue purchasing



- 63 -
ANNEX A
Page 4 of 6
some writing materials. The Government will assist in
the provision of school facilities by providing
roofing sheets. (vi) A revision of the PSLE will be
completed  by  July,   1990.       (viii)     We  will
substantially improve our schools broadcasting system
by developing new programmes which will be fully
intergrated with the new curriculum.  Radios will be
distributed to all schools when a maintenance system
has been established.
2.    Secondary Level:   Parts of the curriculum will be
revised and the examinations adjusted.  We intend to
produce low-cost teaching aids for secondary schools
using locally available materials. All students will
have access to the required textbooks.   The current
book deposit has been converted to a non-refundable
book rental fee to be retained by each school in a
revolving fund and used to replace worn out textbooks.
Scholarships will continue being offered to students
who are unable to pay school fees.  Local Education
Authorities will be urged to meet the cost of these
scholarships. We are continuing efforts to make more
efficient use of staff and facilities, by converting
some urban schools to double-shifts and by increasing
the student/teacher ratio from 20:1 to 25:1. We will
continue to encourage the establishment to private
schools.   We will also require more accountability
from those schools in terms of maintaining adequate
standards.
3.    Higher Education: Conscious of the financial burden of
education on the national budget, we intend to move
towards   privatizing   the   catering   and   lodging
facilities at the University.  Given the difficulty we
have had in retaining tutors at MCA and the Faculty of
Commerce, we intend to introduce measures to enable



- 64 -
ANNEX A
Page 5 of 6
staff to earn extra income teaching self funding
courses, to reduce substantially the gap between their
earnings and private sector wages for accountants.
MCA fees will be increased to minimize the Government
subvention.   The University will develop a plan to
increase access to several courses using distance
education. The plan will provide detailed costs and a
time schedule.
4.    Teacher Training:   We will  complete out  one year
programme  designed  to upgrade  all  our unqualified
teachers. In addition, we will initiate a once-only
programme to train about 4, 500 new teachers. (JC and
MCE) leavers will be eligible for this special three
year programme which will combine summer residential
coutae in TTCs witb distance education, seminars in
the field and school-based supervision.
5.    Restructuring of the Education Services:  In line with
the recommendations of the Price Waterhouse report,
the Government intends to streamline the Ministry of
Education and Culture by abolishing redundant posts
and decentralizing many of the functions now carried
out at headquarters. This will involve strengthening
the regional offices and devolving many of the school
administrative and personnel matters to the regions.
In order to carry out this major decentralization, a
functional review of the Ministry has been carried out
by the Management Services Unit of DPMT. We have now
in place a plan for implementing the new structure.
Financial implications are being worked out. We will
reorganize and strengthen the planning function within
the Ministry by appointing additional planners to
improve planning within the primary and secondary
sections, culture, higher education and parastatals.
We have prepared a year by year demand driven plan



- 65 -
ANNEX A
Page 6 of 6
which itemize quantitative targets, prioritizes policy
changes,  and  estimates  both  the  recurrent  and
development costs of all aspects of education.   The
Development Plan for 1989-1995 is attached, and will
be subject to annual review, evaluation and updating.
I hope that these details will help to clarify the main
directions of our education effort.   We will, of course, be
willing to provide you with any further information you may
require.
Yours Sincerely,
L.J.Cbimango, M.P.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR CREDIT
REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
A PROPOSED SPECIAL PRIMARY TEACHERS'
TRAINING PROGRAMHE FOR MALAWI
PROBLEM
The growing social demand for primary education, reflected by
the substantial increase (14 percent) in enrolment between 1984185 and
1986/87 together with the Government objectives of phasing out untrained
primary school teachers and reducing the pupilsteacher ratio from 63:1 in
1986/87 to 50:1 by 1994/95 will substantially increase the demand for
trained teachers. Primary school enrolment growth rates have increased
from an average three percent between 1979/80 and 1984/85 to about six
percent between 1985/86 and 1987/88. There is potential for enrolment
growth rates to increase more because: (a) less tian 40 percent of the
primary school age cohort (6-13 years) is enrolled in primary schools, (b)
the Government plans to abolish school fees for Grades 1-4, (c) new
policies are being implemented to reduce dropout rates, and (d) the
Government will maintain its policy of open primary education. It is
likely that by 1993 over 1.4 million pupils will be enrolled in primary
schools and there will be a shortfall of over 7,000 trained teachers. If
the Government modifies its projected pupil:teacher ratio from 50sl to
60:1, there will still be a shortfall of about 4,000 trained teachers.
In order to increase the supply of trained teachers, the
Government may either (i) build new colleges at a cost of approximately
MK 30,000 per student place and an average annual recurrent cost per
trainee of about MK 1,800 or (ii) introduce a program based principally on
distance teacher-training which is less costly and which, given adequate
inputs, can achieve results comparable to those of the two-year pre-service
training program. Given the severe financial constraints and the pressure
on Government to restrict public spending, the latter seems more practical.
PROPOSED ORGANIZATION FOR A SPECIAL PRIMARY TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAMME
Objective: To increase, by about 4,500, the supply of appropriately
qualified primary school teachers in a teacher training scheme.
The proposal is for a three-year primary teacher training
program which combines short-residential courses in the teachers' training
colleges with distance education, seminars in the field and school-based
supervision. The total programme would approximate to the 1,700 hours of
training now provided in the two-year pre-service teacher training
programme. The teacher training syllabi would be revised to bring them in
line with the revised primary school curriculum and accordingly, the scope
and the sequence of the programme would be prepared. All teachers'
colleges would administer the revised syllabi.
For this special teacher training program, learning modules
would be prepared on the basis of revised syllabi. Each module would: (i)
have clearly defined specific objectives; (ii) comprise content and
exercises and (iii) be supported by handouts and taped lectures. Micro
teaching techniques would be utilized during the residential courses and,



-77-                             ANNEX B
Page 2 of 15
where possible, in district-based seminars. Trainees would be required to
purchase their own textbooks. During the training period, each trainee
would prepare at least one main assignment in each core subject area and
two projects per academic year - one comprising action research on a
classroom problem and one comprising subject-oriented research. It is
expected that the teacher training method would be activity oriented and
that trainees would be encouraged to utilize the school environment, to the
extent possible, as a source of materials for preparing teaching aids. Ten
percent of the overall final grade for trainees will be allocated to
performance in this aspect.
Trainee Selection and Certification
Entry requirement for the special training programme would be
similar to the pre-service programme. However, priority would be given to
candidates who hold the MSCE certificate and those who have failed the
examination but have completed Form IV. On successful completion of the
teacher training programme, trainees would be awarded the T2 or T3
certificate similar to their counterpa_ts in the pre-service programme.
Orfanization of the Programme
The special training programme would offer about 1,700 hours of
training - 840 hours of residential training, 144 hours of non-residential
workshops and the equivalent of 716 hou::s of assignments and supervised
teaching (Table 1.1). At the teachers' colleges, trainees would receive
formal lectures. The college tutors or other suitably qualified persons
would conduct the training programme and subsequently would be responsible
for preparing and marking trainee assignments during the term. Trainees
would be given eight weeks of orientation intended to give them some
pedagogical skills before they are assigned to schools. In the schools,
trainees would be supervised by inspectors and head teachers. During the
school year, about ten days of training workshops would be held by school
inspectors at district level. These workshops would focus on strengthening
common weaknesses identified among trainees in a district and allow for the
exchange of classroom experiences among them. In addition, the teaching of
such areas as art and craft physical education and music would be
undertaken in these workshops in order to ensure that they are related to
the local environment.
M14natement and Administration of the ProEramme
In order to gain experience in the preparation and
implemettation of the programme, a team of about five members drawn from
MOEC, MIE, Faculty of Education and TTCs should undertake a study tour of
two countries which have implemented similar teacher training schemes.
The Programme would be managed by a Coordinating and Monitoring
Committee comprising representatives from the inspectorate, teachers'
training colleges, Teacher Training Unit, registrar (MOE primary section)
Malawi Institute of Education, Faculty of Education, MANEB and regional
education offices (Appendix 1). A coordinator, under the direction of the
Committee, would be responsible for the day-to-day management and
administration of the Programme. He/she would be assisted by three
regional trainang officers (one for each region) and a small support staff.
The coordinator would be secretary to the Committee (Figure 1.1).

All trainees would be registered as external students of specific colleges.
Trainees would be employed as temporary teachers and be remunerated
accordingly. In order to avoid problems of staff housing, efforts would be
made to assign trainees to schools in proximity to their homes. However,
if housing is available elsewhere, trainees placement away from home would
be at the discretion of the district officer.

At the end of the training programmes, those principals and
inspectors who performed outstandingly well in their districts would be
given awards comprising medals and current books on school administration
and supervision.
Approximately twelve months would be required for planning and
preparing the programme and for training 3,008 personnel who, to various
extents, would be involved in its administration and management. The
categories of persons to be trained would comprise district inspectors of
schools (DISs) including the home economics officers (102), district
education officers (DEOs) (56), college tutors (200) and headteachers
(2,650). Eight technicians would be trained to maintain the audio-visual
equipment in the teachers' colleges. Script-writers would also be trained
to undertake the preparation of the training modules.
MOE will enter into a formal contractual arrangement with MIE to
undertake the training of all DEOs and DISs. Subsequent to the development
of the programme, MIE would be expected to:
(i) provide detailed training syllabi, training plan and budget

COST AND FINANCING
The total initial investment cost comprising equipment and
development of training modules is estimated at about MK 4.42 mllion.
Approximately MK 1.7 million would be financed under the First Sector
Credit and the remaining MK 2.7 million would be provided from the proposed
Credit. The total ogeratint cost over the five-year implementation period
would be about MK 16.9 million. Salary payment to trainees would comprise
about 80 per cent (NK 13.2 million) of the total recurrent cost.  The per
trainee cost excluding salary payments, is approximately MK 830 compared
with MK 3,600 in the pre-service programme, and about MK 3,755 if salaries
are included. See Appendix 4 for detailed costs and assumptions.
Conclusion
The success of the programme will rest mainly on the:
i)     quality and quantity of course materials;
-i)    experience and commitment of the programme co-ordinator;
iii)   adequacy of pre-planning;
iv)    academic level of the trainee in-take;
v)     adequacy of supervision provided by headmasters and
inspectors; and
vi)    provision of incentives for colleges staff to undertake
the assignment.
Although this training programme is supposed to be undertaken only once,
the training package, once prepared, would be available if needed in
ieture. Among the other benefits of the programme are the following:
(a) The supply of trained teachers will increase without incurring
extensive capital investment.
(b) There will be improved collaboration between the inspectorate
and the TTCs in the training of primary school teachers.
(c)  'rue trained teachers should be better able than their pre-
service counterparts to cope with the realities of the primary
school classroom.
(d)  The teacher training materials prepared for the special teaching
programme can be utilized in the pre-service programme.
(e)  leadteachers would have received training in classroom
supervision.
(f)  School inspectors would be better prepared to advise teachers on
appropriate pedagogical techniques.

PLANS FOR CURRICULUM REVISION
Introduction
It has been nearly twenty years since the curriculum in
Malawi has been revised. The MOEC is now in the midst of a
thorough revision of the curriculum and is approaching the
process with seriousness and care. Through a series of
workshops, the MOEC will have completed by the end of April,
1989, the following:
o    a list of national objectives for education,
o    a list of objectives for each subject area in each
standard,
o    a scope and sequence chart for each subject area, and
o    a teaching syllabus for every subject in each standard.
Timetable
The MOEC plans to revise the curriculum according to *the
following schedule:
W - Write materials and carry out intensive formative evaluation
in a few schools
T - Test completed materials in larger samples of schools in all
regions
P - Print and distribute materials to all schools
I - Implement the materials on a national basis

Materials
For each standard, pupil's books, teacher's guides, and any
other instructional materials will be developed simultaneously.
The instructional materials, including at least teacher's guides
and pupil's books, will be prepared in the following areas.
Subject        Class         1 2  3  4  5  6  7  8
Mathematics                  x  x  x  x  x  x  x  x

Home Economics                           x  x  x  x
For English, Chichewa, Mathematics and General Studies
(Standards 1-4), teacher's guides will be printed for every
teacher and pupil's books will be printed for every two students.
Svecial Areas of the Curriculum
Reading is so important that additional resources will be
devoted to strengthening reading skills in all subject areas.
The organization of the curriculum is based on academic
subject areas; within each subject the curriculum documents focus
on the content to be taught.  In order to give the development of
academic skills more prominent attention, the matrix for each
teaching syllabus should be expanded to include skills.  This
will provide the curriculum developers guidance on how to
syst2matically develop skills in the pupil's books and teacher's
guides. More direct attention should also be given to the
formation of attitudes.
Another important area deserving special attention is the
development of appropriate assessment instruments.  Teachers need
diagnostic tests and other means of assessment to help them
determine how each student is progressing and where remedial
attention is needed. In addition, reliable and valid year-end
tests will help teachers make decisions about promotions. Such
tests could also be used at the beginning of the year for helping
teachers develop a teaching plan and to identify individual
students in need of remediation.
As the MOEC encourages teachers not to hold back students,
there will be an even greater need for good diagnostic tests.
Furthermore, teachers may need additional materials, particularly



93 -
ANNEX C
3 of 13
for remediation, to help them cope with a wider range of student
abilities in their classes.
Finally, MIE will give attention to developing teaching aids
based on locally available materials. The curriculum developers
will help to identify where such materials could be used
effectively by teachers. MIE will study what teaching aids can
be prepared from local materials and how to enable and encourage
teachers to develop these aids. Possibly some low cost
instructicnal materials such as charts, for example, coulA be
produced and distributed to teachers as well.
Developing the Materials
Most of the instructional materials will be developed by
small groups of writers to be drawn from the subject committees.
During each writers' workshop the writers will receive training
on how to prepare pupil's books and teacher's guides. Each group
will then allocate different topics to each writer. Much of the
work will be completed at the workshop; in some cases the writing
will extend beyond the workshop. The MIE professional officers
will be responsible for pulling together the various components
and preparing the materials for further review.
The curriculum developers will work with'the radio Producers
to help ensure that the new radio programmes to be produced will
support the new curriculum as effectively as possible.
The process of developing the materials will include a
careful review of the documents at each stage; outside
consultants provided by the UNDP and IDA will assist with this
review.
Between April and September, 1989, the revision of the
materials (course objectives, scope and sequence, and teaching
syllabuses) will begin. The consultants will work with the
subject committees in suggesting revisions. This process will be
completed and revisions made for each standard before writing
begins on the pupil's books and teacher's guides.
Subject to the proviso above, writing will begin on the
Standard 1 subjects in October, 1989, following an orientation
workshop for writers in September.
As the instructional materials are being prepared,
interchange will continue between the writers and consultants.
Another important part of the process of developing the
materials is formative evaluation, an evaluation process that
seeks to improve the materials as they are being created. As the
instructional materials are being developed, they will be tested



94 -                  ANNEX C
4 of 13
in selected schools near MIE. The writers and evaluators will
develop an evaluation program that involves regular visits to the
schocls, periodic testing of student achievement, and interviews
with teachers. The purposes of this evaluation are to (a) revise
the materials being tried out and (b) to help guide or modify the
development of the remaining topics of the syllabus.
A much broader, but less intensive, formative evaluation
will be carried out during year 2 for each standard (the year for
"testing" the materials). A representative sample of schools
will be selected from all three regions of the country. Feedback
will be obtained mostly through questionnaires to be completed by
the teachers.
B.   Resources to be Provided
In order to carry out the curriculum development process
including the special features described above, the Second
Education Sector Credit will provide the following:
1.   Technical assistance (4 staff years)
For terms of reference, see attached sheets.
a.   Reading Specialist (2 staff years)
b.   Evaluator (2 staff years)
2.   Additional MIE staff
Additional MIE staff are needed to develop all instructional
materials simultaneously, to conduct formative evaluations, and
to prepare two years of materials starting in 1991. IDA will
provide funding for three addicional professional officers at MIE
to be drawn from the areas of subject matter specialists,
evaluation, and instructional materials design.
3.   Staff houses
IDA will f"nd the construction of six low-cost staff houses
at MIE.
4.   Vehicles
2 four-wheel drive vehicles
5.   Computer
1 IBM PS/2 Model 30 with a 30 mb disk and Epson LX1000
printer to support the evaluation activities

MALAWI INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION
Reading Specialist
Terms of Reference
A main objective of the educational reform programme is to
raise the level of literacy among the Malavian population.
Despite the large  investment already made in  upgrading primary
education, howover, achievement in literacy has been frustrated
by poor teaching methodology, sparcity of teaching/learning
materials and high dropout rates in the lower standards of
primary schools. Hence there is dire need to focus attention on
the teaching of reading in Standards I to 4. It is expected that
the average child, who completes Standard  4 should be, at least,
functionally literate.
The reading spectalist  will work in collaboration  vith the
subjoct panels to;
(a) Review teaching syllabuses for Standards 1 to 4 in ordor
to determine the appropriateness of the methodologies suggested
for the teaching of reading skills, -
(b)-Identify, through research, the reading skilis which can
be taught effectively in Standards 1 to 4,
(c) Identify exercisea and instructional materials vhich
will  reinforce    learning  of reading  skills   in  the  lover
standards,
(d) Prepare prototypes of low-cost reading materials,
(e) Propare training materials and hold training vorkshops
for college tutors and M.I.E professional staff (in all subject
areas) to broaden their experiences in the teaching of reading
throu,n  various   subjoct  areas  and  in   identifying reading
difficulties and appropriate romediat on techniques,
(f) Prepare reading readiness programme for Standard 1,
(g) Through resoarch, prepare a graded reading test for
Standards I to 8 to be administered by teachers, enabling them to
monitor the progres of their pupils,
(h) Establish an experimental reading group and monitor the
reading progres of pupils over onc academic year, and
(i) Prepare an evaluation report on the teaching of reading
in the revised currieu!bm.

REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR CREDIT
Implementation of the Textbook Component of the 2nd EducAtion Sector Credit
General
The component builds on the existing publishing and production capability
at Malawi Institute of Education. Additions aro to be made in a) staffing
and b) equipment.
Staffing
A Publishing Manager will be appointed to provide the overall management of
the publication of the new Primary Schools' textbooks.
A Desktop Publishing Editor (DTP) will be appointed to provide quality
control and to operate the Desktop Publishing technology.
Equipment
Two Personal Computers will be supplied for the generation of 'electronic
manuscripts' i.e. typing materials onto disk for the editor.
A Desktop Publishing System including an AT Computer, A4 screen, seanner,
software and 24 pin Dot Matrix (draft) printer.
Procedure
The subject panels will supply final manuscript to the publishing unit.
The text will be keyed and disks supplied to the DTP editor. The DTP editor
with the assistance of his Design colleagues will do the page layout on
screen and submit the draft print-out for approval by the subject panel.
The agreed final version is then sent to the computer-typesetters (Blantyre
P & P or Montfort Press) with the draft print-out marked up with the
illustrations keyed in. Camera Ready Copy (CRC) is prepared. The CRC is
then sent to the printers who should be selected through International
Competitive Bidding. The final print-run should be agreed with the MOEC
authorities. The finished books will be collected by Malawi Book Service;
MIE pay the printers and MBS pay MIS on the basis of publijhed price less
10X. MBS will then deliver books direct to the DEOs; the distribution of
books will be on a pro rata basis according to student enrolment - figures
supplied to MBS by MIEC. The DEOs distribute books on a strict pro rata
basis using the best means at their disposal.  Haewi Institute of
Education retain copyright and complete control of primary educational
publishing in hslawi and employ their surpluses for the further development
of materials across the curriculum.

SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR CREDIT
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE (MOEC)
MANAGEMENT ISSUES
1.   The March 1988 Education Service Review (ESP) focusses on
three somewhat interrelated management issues at MOEC: planning;
management structures and methods; and staff development. This
paper (i} summarizes the issues and the ESR's proposals for
dealing with them and (ii) makes recommendations for addressing
them.
Planning
2.   MOEC's principal planning document, the Ten Year Plan
(through 1995) demonstrates the weakness of the planning process
at the Ministry. First, the plan itself is flawed. Key targets
- enrollment, pupil/teacher ratios, repeaters - are excluded.
Goals are not prioritized, which makes implementation difficult
in a period of limited resources.
3.   More importantly, the Ten Year Plan appears to have been an
end in itself and is not part of the planning-programming-
monitoring-adjustment process that characterizes responsive
management. In 'fact,'the ESR concludes that there is little or
no monitoring, that the plan is not being addres-ed
operationally, and that, given the lack of interim targets, there
would be great difficulty in establishing reasonable monitoring.
4.   Initial assistance to MOEC's planning division will be
provided by a UNDP-funded UNESCO-executed project (number
MLW/88/042/A/01/13, entitled Strengthening Educational Planning
and Management) which will inter alia develop the division's
capabilities to carry out its policy analysis, planning,
budgeting, monitoring and evaluation responsibilities. The
project will also assist the division in designing and
implementing decentralization (please see para. 10-13)
and establish a computerized management information system.
D.   To change planning *rom a once-in-ten-years separate project
to a continuous process requires both more experienced personnel
and a change in management style. Annual five-year plans, or
rolling plans, should be produced. In line with the
decentralization effort, (please see para. 10-13), planning
personnel should be installed-at the regional level as well ag at
MOEC headquarters. To make the plan more responsive, the
National Advisory Council (NAC) should be reconstituted to
include a broader representation, i.e. non-educators and parents.
1



- 105-
AM=t D
Page 2 of 6
6.   To address the needs of education planning over the longer
term, the following schedule of implementation dates is proposed:
a)   by January 1990:
i)   re-constitution of NAC to include non-educators
and parents and to meet quarterly;
ii) establishment of 16 posts: 12 planning officers in
the regions and four planning officers at
headquarters.
iii) completion and subrission to IDA of the first
five-year education plan;
b)   by July 1990:
filling the 16 ptsts defined in para. 6 (a) (ii);
c)   By January 1991:
completion and submission to IDA of the second five-
year plan;
d)   by July 1991:
completion of in-service training of the 16 posts and
of the regional education officers on education
planning and management;
e)   by each subsequent January:
completion and submission to IDA of a revised five-year
education plan.
Because the personnel filling the 16 new planning positions would
not be fully trained until July 1991, it is recognized that the
first two five-year plans will lack the depth gnd thoroughness
which subsequeiAt versions would include. Nevertheless, it is
vital to start the process as soon as possible so that Ministry
personnel can acquire experience with the planning process.
Management Structure and Methods
7.   One of the more serious impediments to progress in meeting
the country's educational needs is the management of MOEC.
8.   The ESR describes the situation in formalized terms as one
of over-centralization, inappropriate structure, and unclear
definitions. Over-centralisation is characterized by the
practice of high-level MOEC officials occupying themselves with
routine and trivial issues, which leaves them, no time to address
policy or other matters of conseguence. This is reflected in:
the Ministry's organization, which has many one-over-one



- 106 -
ANNEX D
Page 3 of 6
relationships, too many layers, and other anomalies; and the lack
of reporting, blurred relationship, and other anomalies; there is
a lack of definition of authority and responsibility fand hence,
performance criteria) of individuals and of objectives of
subgroups within the Ministry.
9.   More important than its formalized analysis, the ESR
recognizes that the organization and structure reflect the
culture of the Ministry, and that effective change can be made
only by changing the culture.
10. The ESR proposes an organization for the Ministry
substantially different from the present one, the principal
feature of which is decentralization: greatly enhanced authority
and responsibility of the three regional offices; and
concentration of headquarters personnel on policy, overall
planning, curriculum development, superv-ision of regional
activities, and research and evaluation. The Government's
Department of Personnel, Management and Training (DPMT) has
drafted an alternative organization which accomplishes
decentralization in the same manner and is satisfactory; this is
attachment I to this paper.
11. While the Government has accepted the ESR recommendations,
it has not yet accepted DPMT's proposed reorganization of MOEC,
nor have definitions of authority and responsibility for any of
MOEC's organizational elements been drafted or approved. While
DPMT may meet its schedule of getting approval of the
organization by March 1989, preparing a plan to implement the
reorganization and defining objectives, authority and
responsibility certainly will not be done by then. As
implementaAion of the project depends on a vastly improved
Ministry management, completion of the reorganization plan,
implementation schedule, and definition of authority and
responsibility of each organizational element within the
Ministry, all acceptable to IDA and approved by all necessary
governmental levels, should be accomplished before negotiations
on the proposed credit begin.
12. While MOEC nominally supports decentralization and has
already transferred some responsibilities to the regional
offices, the ESR suggests that this has largely been lip service;
hence, the urgency of the above conditions for negotiations.
Areas that have not been addressed'on a regional basis are
accounting, administration and personnel/staff development.
While the argument can be (and, indeed, will be) made that these
functions should remain at headquarters because of the
requirement for centralized control, the need for effective
decentralization at the Ministry outweighs the advantages of
centralized control, and effective decentralization requires
devolutio.n of responsibility for finance, administration, and
staff matters to the regional offices. To accomplish this; the
following implementation datep for key support positions are
proposed:
3



- 107 -
AMNEX D
Page 4 of 6
a)  by July 1990, the establishment of the following positions for
the regional offices: twelve accountants, nine staff
development officers, nine administrative officers;
b) By December 199o, filling the above posts.
13. The principal risk of all the elements of reorganization is
that MOEC's culture will not change, in which case the expanded
regional offices will represent an additional (and expensive)
bureaucratic barrier for routine decisions to hurdle on their way
to the top. While cognizance of the risk is necessary, the
alternative to embarking on the reorganization course, viz
pretending that unsatisfactory MOEC management is somehow
improving, would undermine the project's objectives. Putting the
reorganization into effect will create the mechanism and, one
hopes, start the momentum for genuine improvement in the Ministry's
management.
Staff Development
14. The ESR observes aa almost total lack of staff development,
including training, within YOEC, which has a single Training
officer working alone, and n%. other capability in such related
areas as manpower development, skills appraisal, career management
or policy development. This assessment probably is similarly
applicable to most other Ministries, as DPMT has only has only
recently begun to address this area of its responsibility.
15. In the immediate future, the UNDP-UNESCO project (para 4) will
develop MOEC's capability to design and implement an in-service
training program for about 300 staff members in planning and
management.
16. In the intermediate future, a number of DPMT activities which
apply to the entire Government would benefit MOEC. Already
underway, is a USAID-funded project to permit DPMT to upgrade its
personnel-management role, which is now characterized as 70%
effective. This project would put into place a personnel-
management information system for the entire civil service by the
end of cy 1990, with interim goals of survey completion and systems
installation by the end of cy 89. This MIS would permit each
Ministry to undertake a skills assessment to determine the training
needs of its staff. A second activity already underway is an ODA-
funded project to update the schemes of service for Government
employees.
17. Completion of these two elements would enable the recently-



108 -
ANNEX D
Page 5 of 6
established Malawi Institute of Management (MIM) to undertake
training needs assessments of personnel of various Ministries.
Thereafter, it would also offer training to MOW' management and
identify the training needs of the teaching staff to the Malawi
Institute of Education (MIE).
18. To ensure that MOEC's staff development needs are addressed
expeditiously, the Ministry should agree to, in conjunction with
DPMT, develop it own human-resource strategy by July 1991. This
strategy would identify (a) the number of managers, staff and
teachers required over the five-year plan period; (b) the type of
skills required for each job; (c) phasing of staff-development
requirements to meet the personnel targets in (a), taking into
account personnel turnover. This strategy should be updated each
subsequent July.
Summary
19. In addition to establishing a condition of negotiations
(para. 11) and proposing schedules for completion of key steps
(paras 6, 12, and 18), IDA can assist the strengthening of MOEC
management by providing funding for the additional personnel
which are hard to find, i.e. excluding the administrative
officers. Specifically, the proposed credit should provide
funding for four years of service of the following positions:
a)   16 planning officers (para 6);
b)   Twelve accountants (para 12); and
c)   Nine staff-development officers (para 12).
This totals 37 staff or 148 staff-years.

REPUBLIC OF MUAAWI
SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR CRED!T
INTRODUCTION OF THE SHIFT SYSTEM IN SIX
&ALAVIAN URbAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS
The gross enrolment ratio at the secondary level is only 4.5
per cent of the age-group. Existing socondary schools, organized
as they are on a single shift basis, have provided access for
only  26,000  students.   Because  of this  constraint  in school
places, in 1987, only 11 per cent of tho 66,000 students who
passed the PSLE obtained places in Form I of secondary schools.
Considering that GON accords high priority to equity in the
education system, it is proposed that a sample of urban schools
be organized on a shift basis in order to help meet the demand
for secondary school places in the urban centres.
The shift system would be introduced, on a phased basis,
first, in two schools in LilongSwe,and later in four additional
schools in other urban centres. A total of 200 students would be
accepted in Forms I and III in the first year of implementation.
Form I students would be selected according their performance on
the PSLE and for Form III, students would be select6d from among
NCDE  students  on the  basis of    their performance  on  the JC
exmination. The solection of students for each shift would be
left primarily to the headteachers, while MOEC would provide
broad operational guidelines within which such decisions would be
made.
Equity Consideration
Measures would be taken- by HOEC to ensure that  students on
both shifts are provided similar learning environments with
respect   to   staff   qualification   and   tho   provision   of
teaching/learning  materials.   It may  not be possible to  offer
all subjects on both shifts but this matter will be left to the
discretion of the headteacher.
Staffing
According to the models shown in Appendix 1, about seven
additional, teachers would be required, for each of the six
schools, in the first year of implementing the shift system. The
number of additional teachers. assigned to each school, however,
would be decided on the bsis of full utilization of the existing
staff. Under the shift system, there would be little or no time
for informal interaction between students and their teachers;
hence one period per week would be allocated for Form counselling
and a guidance counsellor's post would be established In each



-Ill -
ANNEX E
Page 2 of 8
school.
Additional support staff woold be provided for each school so
that the staff numbers would follow the general pattern shown in
Appendix 2.
School Administration
Two deputy principals wvald be required - one for each shift.
In a co-educational school, one deputy principal would be a
female. The hoadteacher would work across shifts.
Extra - curricula Activities
Students would naot be deprived of their extra - curricula
activities.    Teachers   on  one  shift  would   supervise  such
activities during the other shift.
Length of the School Day
The school day would begin at 7:00 a.m. and end at 6:30 p.m.
Each shift would last for 5.5 hours, the first starting at 7:00
a.m and the scond at 1:00 p.m.
Physical Requirements
The physical facilities to be provided in each school would
be determined on the basis of individual assessment of the
utilization of tho existing plant. However, there are additional
facilities  such as  staffrooms,  offices, storerooms,  'holding'
areas, teachors houses and student toilets, which schools would
need to various extents (Appendix 3). Additional textbooks,
science materials and equipment and other teaching materials
would be provided.
School Maintenance
The increased pressure on the utilization of the school
facilities will result in rapid deterioration of the school plant
unless an appropriate school maintenance programe is  in place.
HOEC w%uld   employ one  handyman per school  to undertake  minor
maintenance  and, each  school  would  be  given    an   annual
maintenance  grant of about  of  MK15.000  for *"h  purcth-.  c.'
materials needed for the maintenance work. Classroom sanitation
would continue to be the responsibility of students while toilets
would be maintained by the groundsmen.

Staff Requirements for a School
Operating a Shift System
Teaching Staff
The additional teaching staff needs should be determined
on the  basis of  a 25:1  student to  staff ratio.   The  average
teaching load would be thirty 40-minute periods per week.
Support Staff
The support staff for a school on the shift system would
comprise:
1 Executive Officer
3 Clerical Officers
3 Typists
3 Messengers
3 Typists
4 Groundsmen/watchmen
2 Laboratory Technicians

Appendix 3
Basic Physical Requirements for Upgrading
Schools on Shift
Generally, schools to be organized on a shift basis would be
provlded with following facilities:
X. A multi-purpose holding area of 240m2, roofed, open sided and
a minimum height of three metres, to be utilized an waiting area
for students at the beginning and end of each shift, particularly
during the long rainy season, and for extra-curricula activities,
2. Additional library accommodation of approximately 115m2,
3. Two new standard #ilet blocks of 60m2 for boys and girls,
4. Three T.3 staff houses,
5. Two 12m12 offices for deputy principals,
6.   Increased staffroom accommidation  to allow 3.5m2  per staff
member (also additional shelves and cupboards),
7. Repairs to existing classrooms, laboratories and workshops so
that all teaching areas are functional,
8.    Additional furniture  - .150  double  desks, 15  tables, 100
laborato,y stools, 50 library chairs and 200 stacking chairs,
9.   Additional  school  textbooks,  particularly science  books,
about 1,000 library books and some additional teaching materials.
10. A very high level of janitorial services would be required
because the school plant would be subjected to a much higher use
factor and a speedy cleaning job would be needed between shifts.
Contract cleaning services may be advantageous for schools on a
shift system.
A detailed investigation should be made of the existing
facilities at each school as the extent of the upgrading and the
need for  added facilities will vary  at each school. . The basic
items 1 to 6 above would be added to nearly all existing schools,
in  order   to  ensure   a  satisfactory   environment  for   the
introduction of the shift system.
Some Individual School Requirements
The mission visited five of the six schools to be organized
on a shift basis. On the basis of this preliminary visit, the
following primary needs were identified in the schools:



- 117 -                    ANNEX E
Page 8 of 8
The   Chichiri   Secondary    School   requires    extensive
rehabilitation of the lighting and water systems. The roof of
the administrative block needs to be replaced. The existing
classrooms  and   specialist  areas,   with  minor   repairs  and
furnishing can accommodate the second shift adequately. The other
basic amenities, however, would be needed.
At the Blantyre Secondary School the physical facilities
were in generally  good condition.   The addition of the  primary
facilitiea would be sufficient for the introduction of a shift
system.
The site of the library at the HII Secondary School is
adequate for a double shift school however the furniture and
library stocks are insufficient, even for a tenth of the present
enrolment.
The sewerage system at the Bwaila Secondary School is a
health hazard and  the shift system  should not be introduced  in
this school before an effective sewerage system is in place.
The  Lilongwe  Girls Secondary  School  will require  all the
suggested primary  facilities for a  shift system to  be operated
effectively.

FURNITURE FOR PRIMARY SCHIOOLS
The P.I.U. is presently concluding arrangements with Small
Enterprise Development Organization (SEDOM) for the suppiv of
school furniture.   Design drawings have been prepared for "all
wood" desks and benches.   SEDOM is a parastatal agency partly
funded by donor agencies to develop and finance small manufacturers
and craftsmen.
It is intended that a contract will be entered into with SEDOM
to supply the furniture who will in turn subcontract with small
village joiners and carpenters to produce the furniture at one
centre in each district. SEDOM will have overall responsibility
for quality and delivery to the schools. Tndependent manufacturers
will also be invited to tender for some of the furniture to ensure
competitive pricing during the program. Malawi now has an absundant
supply of. good quality pine and the designers will utilize this
material instead of the more expensive laminated timber in current
use.
By establishing this market we anticipate an enthusiastic
response from the Malawi craftsman to this economic opportunity.

ROOFING FOR PRIMARY SCHOOLS
The roofing material will be the concrete roofing tiles which
are presently made in Malawi. UNDP studies and the mission's own enquiries
have confirmed the suitability of these tiles for roofing the classrooms
and staff house. The concrete roofing tiles are cooler, and have a price
advantage on galvanized sheets. The use of concrete tiles will improve
employment opportunities for local craftsmen and assist in developing a
roofing component which can be expanded in the future to all types of
building construction in Malawi. The technology for the production of
these roofing tiles is quite simple and the techniques of production have
been taught to a number of male and female groups in Malawi. The
constituent materials are sand and cement vibrated on locally made hand-
operated steel vibrating table. The product is therefore entirely locally
=anufactured, with only the cement being Imported and is most appropriate
in view of country's present shortage of foreign exchange. The reservation
expressed is the ability of the local groups to meet the production
targets, to mitigate against this possibility it is recommended that notice
of the quantities required and location of the schools should be given to
the suppliers as early as possible.

PLAN FOR STRNZGTUREING PRIMRY SCUOOL EDUCATION
THROUGH THE USE OF RADIO PROGRAUS
Introduction
The HOEC is committed to using radio programmes t.o strengthen the
quality of education in primary schools. There is over twenty years of
experience in Malawi in the use of schools broadcasting; however, the present
programs are not playing an effective role in the schools for many reasons
including too few broadcasts, an insufficient number of trained staff, lack of
radios in the schools, lack of an appropriate and affordable power supply for
the radios, lack of a maintenance system for the radios, a broadcast schedule
that doesn't fit well the school timetable, and lack of support materials for
the teachers.
With the development of the new primary school curriculum, however,
there is an opportunity to design radio programs that will support the new
instructional objectives. There will be close collaboration between the radio
producers and curriculum developers to ensure that the new radio programs are
integrated into the total instructional package. Further, the Schools
Broadcasting Unit has recommended that the total hours of programming for
primary schools be increased from under three hours per week to fifteen hours.
Within this context, special attention would be given to Standards 1-4
(approximately nine hours) and to the core subject areas.
Note that to make allowance for this amount of broadcast time for
primary schools, the programs for secondary schools and teacher training would
not be broadcast, but would be made available on cassettes.
New Protrs_
The programs to support the new curriculum will build upon the schools
broadcasting experience in Malawi and the existing programs as appropriate.
In addition, the MOEC will examine a variety of approaches to assess which
ones show promise for being effective in Malawi schools.
The proposed radio project will consist of two phases, the second phase
to be dependent on the success of the first phase.
Phase I (1990-91) - Thas would be a pilot phase for one year in which
the capacity to produce the new lessons is developed, and the general approach
or style of the lessons would be worked out. It is recommended that Phase I
focus on one subject in Standard 1 and that a sufficient number of programs be
produced, probably enough for half a year, so that it will be possible to
measure the effectiveness of the lessons.

Poge 2 of 7
An important component of this phase is a summative evaluation1 to
assess the effectiveness of the lessona.   Continuation of the project to
Phase II will depend on evidence that the new programs are indeed effective,
that is, that there are significant gains in achievement as compared to
classes that are not using radio. In addition the MOEC would need to be
satisfied that the lessons are of a type that are appropriate for Malawian
schools and that the long-term recurrent costs of the lessons in terms of
support materials and teacher training are affordable. The MOEC in
collaboration with IDA will make the decision on continuing the project.
Another component of Phase £ is a number of studies that will determine
the selection of the radios, an effective and affordable power supply for the
radios, and a system for maintaining the radios.
Phase II (1991-95) - This phase is for the full implementation of the
project. Staffing, office space, recording studio time, etc. will be needed
to produce seaveral lessons a week in each of approximately three different
subjects. The following schedule is proposed:
July '91 - June '92
Std. 1      produce programs and carry out formative evaluation2
Std. 2      design programs
Test out radios and power supplies
July '92 - June '93
Std.  1     carry out summative evaluation and revise as necessary
Std. 2      produce programs and carry out formative evaluation
Std. 3      design progr-ms
Provide training for inspectors
Continue testing of radio and power supplies
Complete plans for implementing a maintenance system for radios
1 The summative evaluation will measure the impact of the completed
series of radio p'-ogrammes on the learning gains of the children. The
evaluation will compare the achievement gains of children in classes that use
uhe radio programmes (experimental group) with children in classes without the
radio lessons (control group). In this sense, it is a summary' evaluation.
2 In a formative evaluation, the materials are evaluated as they are
being developed. The purpose of the evaluation, which typically includes
regular observations of classes and occasional testing of the children, is to
improve the lessons. The data provide a basis for revising the materials that
have been tried out in the schools, but also for modifying lessons that have
not yet been completed. In this sense, the evaluation helps to 'form' the
curriculum as it is being developed.

proposals on an international basis. The proposals will include a technical
proposal and a budget.
Technical Proposal
The technical proposal (30 pages maximum) will describe the offerers
understanding of the project and how the offerer plans to fulfill the project
objectives. In particular, the proposal should includ, the following:
1.    A statement of the offerers understanding of the project.
2.    A description of the types of radio programs to be used including the
style of the lessons, how the programs will support the teachers in teaching
the new curriculum, the number of lessons per week, and the length of each
programme. The proposal should ocate why the particular approach is expected
to be effective given the circumstances in Malawi and based on the experience
sud research on similar approaches in other countries. Suggestions for site
visits should be included.
3.    A description of the process by which the lessons will be produced and
tested.
4.    A description of how the effectiveness of the lessons in Phase I will be
measured, including a plan for a summative evaluation and the criteria to be
used to judge the impact of the programs. Plans for yearly summative
evaluations should be included.
5.    An estimate of the Malawi personnel (number, qualifications and
responsibilities) needed to carry out the activities and how the training of
the personnel will be done.

Assumptions regarding capital costs (which are high) affect some of the
qualitative conclusions from rate of return analysis. Their inclusion affects
the upper levels, much more than primary, reflecting much higher building
costs at post-primary levels. The fall in rate of return estimates for Malawi
between 1981 and 1987 is caused by a combination of rising recurrent costs of
education and falling wage differentials especially between primary leavers
and the uneducated. Except for upper secondary (MCE), additional education
apparently no longer confers as substantial a wage-labor market advantage as
before.

ASSUMPTIONS FOR EDUCATION MINISTRY RECURRENT BUDGET PROJECTIONS
1. Projections are in real terms, in 1988 prices.
2.   Salaries and wages are assumed to remain at their 1988189 real
levels. Note that the projection of overall government recurrent
expenditure allows for a gradual recovery of civil service vages to their
1987/88 real level - real wage increases of 9 2 in 1989/90, 8 2 in 1990191
and 7 Z in 1991/92 are built in. If consistent assumptions about real wage
increases had been adopted, education's required share of the total would
have been larger. Additional projections will be done to quantify this
after further discussions during appraisal.
3.   Attrition of the teaching force is assumed to be 4 percent per year,
on the basis of a *best guess' by MOEC staff. This will receive more
attention (and possible amendation) during appraisal. The wage bill
increases by an average of 2.5Z each year due to wage drift - progression
up the salary scales with longer service.
4.   Capital formation (allowances for repairs and maintenance) is assumed
to remain constant in real terms. A small real increase should be built in
to allow for better maintenance. more repairs as facilities age, and
repairs to the. expanding stock of facilities.
5.   Administration:  The capital transfers component, the subventions to
MANEB and the MIE, are assumed to grow at 22 in real terms, reflecting the
added burdens on these bodies as primary enrollment grows. Personal
Emoluments (PE) grow 102 in real terms in 1989/90 reflecting increased
staffing, and remain constant in real terms thPreafter.
6.   Primary: Includes K2 per pupii earmarked bookfund (as agreed under
Credit 1767-MAl) from 1989/90. Other goods and services (G&S) provision
remains constant in real terms. However. this should be supplemented to
compensate for the loss of fee revenues to schools once school fees in the
lower standards are reduced.
7.   In the non-reform scenario, enrollments are assumed to grow at 3.92
per year, and the teaching force growth is determined by the output of the
PTTCs, given their present capacity (and new capacity which will come on-
stream during the period as existing projects are implemented). In the
reform scenario, enrollments grow at 7.9 2. The number of teachers
additional to the present output of the PTTCs, required to bring the
pupil:teacher ratio down to 55 is computed. It is assumed that in 1989/90
these will be recruited from trained teachers who are not presently
teaching, at a wage which is just above the teaching force average. The
proposed special in-service teacher training program is assumed to provide
the bulk of the additional teachers required in subsequent years. The
total costs of salaries are added into the budget projections, but not the
costs of training. The proposed credit will bear all training costs for
1989190 - 1993/94 and all salary costs until 1993/94, when the MOEC will
begin to share these costs.
8.   Secondary:  The reform scenario tliows anJollnent to grow by anr
additional amount compared to the new places being built under existing
projects, by assuming that an extra 4 pupils enroll per teacher after 1990.
Also, 6 urban schools are assumed to take a second shift of 400 pupils each

from 1991192, and to receive a recurrent cost budget increase estimated at
balf the unit cost per pupil.
9. Primary Teacher Training: The reform scenario allows a 22 reduction
per year in unit costs by reallocating staff so as to increase
studenttstaff ratios, and adde 300 new places in 1994195 (provided under
the proposed credit).
10. Universitt Without reforms, the university budget grows at 6.72
annually in real terms. The reform scenario suts this by 32 from 1990/91.
11. Techincal/Vocational: The reform scenario assumes better capacity
utilization will allow a real unit cost reduction by 12 per year from
1990/91.
