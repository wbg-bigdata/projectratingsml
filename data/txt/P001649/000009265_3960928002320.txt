MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED SECOND EDUCATION SECTOR CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to Malawi for SDR 29.5 million (US$ 36.9 million equivalent) 1i
submitted for approval. The credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40
years maturity. It would help finance a second education sector project.
2.      Background.  Confronted with severe economic problems and
debilitating external shocks, Malawi has been undertaking a comprehensive
program of structural adjustment since 1981. Within this context, the
Government is strongly committed to improving education, as indicated in its
"Statement of Development Policies" for the 1987 - 1996 period.
3.      The principal issues in the sector at this stage in its development
reflect the constraints and problems facing the country as a whole and African
education generally. The aualitv of instruction is still very poor, due to
inalequacies in textbook supplies, curricula, facilities and teacher quality
and numbers (the primary pupil:meacher ratio is 63:1 on average and over 100sl
in many urban schools, which ar, high figures even among African countries).
Access, as reflected by the number of school places in relation to the school
age population, is low: net primary enrolment is only 432, and the transition
rate to secondary schools is only 112. Management. budgetin% and ilanning
continue to need major additional upgradlsg. Also, further steps are needed
in resource mobilization and allocation policies, especially (a) restructuring
of fees for secondary schools and the university to increase cost recovery,
and (b) implementing Government's stated policy of reversing the erosion of
education's share of the budget, which has fallen from 132 in the early 80's
to 112, well below the median of 15S for Africa. Government's priorities in
the sector are appropriate and well articulated.
4.      Recognizing the extent and urgency of the challenges it faces,
Government launched in 1985 an education sector reform program, with
assistance from IDA through a First Education Sector Credit. The reform
program addresses the issues indicated above through a broad set of measures
in curriculum reform, instructional materials (textbooks, teachers' guides,
and teaching aids), improved and expanded use of distance education (radio)
to enhance classroom instruction, expansion of the number of primary school
teachers, strengthening of teacher training, improvement in the examinations
system, construction and rehabilitation of schools utilizing community self-
help for primary schools, changes in pol'cies on promotion and repetition,
more efficient use of facilities (e.g., double shifting), and upgrading of the
management and planning capabilities in the Ministry of Education and other
institutions with leadership roles in the sector. In addition, the reform
program has a major emphasis on resource issues, including adjustment in fee
structures, introduction of multi-year investment plans (to limit spending to
only the highest priority needs), ane increases in budget allocations to
education.
5.      Progress thus far under the reform program has been encouraging.  A
comprehensive assessment of performance undertaken in October 1989 found that
implementation was generally proceeding in accordance with expectations. In
areas where faster or more effective action was found to be needed, Government



accepted without reservation the recommendations for corrective steps, and
committed ltself to ecting upon them tauediately.
6.      Despite the achievements to date, much more remains to be done.  The
reforms were, from the outset, anticipated to require ten years or more to
complete, given the depth and breadth of the needs and deficiencies. Also,
there is the further fact that the gains achieved since the reform program was
initiated have been partly offset by (i) the very high rate of population
growth, and attendant large Increases in the school age population, and (ii)
the worse-than-expected development of the economy in the last few years, the
budgetary implications of which have resulted in very severe limitations in
the resources available to the sector.
7.      The currently proposed project is needed to assist Government in (i)
reinforcing and completing the measures already begun, (ii) extending and
intensifying the reforms In areas not thus far affected, in accordance with
the original plan and the conclusions of the recent assossment, and (iii)
coping with the pressures from the difficult resource situation and from high
population growth, which otherwise would undermine or slow down the reform
process before it can attain its full potential.
8.      Six Bank education projects in Malawi (including the ongoing sector
credit) have provided valuable experience and lessons. Increases in primary
and secondary enrollments and teacher training capacity have been effectively
implemented, and have resulted in substantial achievements despite the impact
of rapid population growth and constrained resources. Implementation of the
self-help construction was hampered initially by expecting local communities
to contribute more than they were capable of, but better schemes have since
been devised. Text-book components have been well implemented and have had a
positive impact on learning. The introduction of technical subjects into
secondary schools has not been satisfactory because of high costs, lack of
specialist teachers and lack of interest. Weaknesses In managerial and
planning capacity have pointed to the need for strengthening, and for
decentralization of routine administrative and other decisions. These lessons
from past project experience have been incorporated into the design of the
currently proposed project.
9.           Project Oblectives.  The proposed project has four main
objectives: (1) to improve the quality of education at all levels; (2) to
expand access, focussing on the primary and secondary levels; (3) to
strengthen sector management, budgeting, and planning; and (4) to improve
resource mobilization and allocation policies, through increasing cost
recovery at post-primary levels and reversing the decline in the sector's
budget share in accordance with the recommendations of the recent public
expenditure review and with Government's stated policy.
10.          Proiect Description.  The project will support: (1) qualitv
improvement through (a) curricula reform and development, (b) improvements in
the preparation, production, and distribution of textbooks and other
instructional materials, (c) development and introductior of new methods for
more effective use of radio in primary schools, (d) improvement of the
distance education system used at the secondary level; (e) development and
introduction of low cost approaches for improving science instruction and the
library system at the secondary level; (f) improvement of teacher training;
(g) expansion of the number of qualified primary teachers, (h) reforms in the
examination system, and (i) strengthening the school inspection system; (2)



-3-
access improvements through (a) facilitating community self-help upgrading of
school facilities by providing roofing sheets and limited amounts of school
furnitiare, and (b) planning and implementing reforms in promotion criteria and
facilities utilization and (c) expansion of the university's capacity to
produce accountants - a skill in axtremely short supply; (3) management.
budRetinR, and planninz strengthening through (a) various institutional and
capacity building measures in the Ministry of Education and the Malawi
Institute of Education, and (b) a decentralization program for the Ministry;
and (4) improved resource mobilization and allocation through (a) reforms in
fee structures at all levels, (b) changes in reporting requirements for
recurrent and investment expenditure plans, and (c) increases in the sector's
budget share.
11.          A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A.  Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group Operations in Malawi are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 7734-MAI, dated November 10, 1989 is also attached.
12.          Rationale for IDA Involvements  IDA involvement is needed
because (i) the new initiatives to be launched under this project involve
complex issues on which the Government has limited experience and capacity,
and thus requires technical and other assistance; (ii) six loans for education
in Malawi have given IDA considerable experience in the sector; (iii) IDA has
a comparative advantage in these areas including considerable experience from
other countries; (iv) other development assistance agencies are not able to
fill this role for various reasons (e.g., they are giving priority to other
sectors or other countries; or they are already committed); and (v) the
government and international agencies are relying on IDA to take the principal
role in the sector.
13.          The proposed project would complemelt the other development
assistance activities ongoing in the sector, which include the following.
USAID is assisting the Government in graduate level training through the Human
Resources Institutional Development project and has also assisted in the
development of the Polytechnic. ODA has provided (a) fellowships for
specialized training in the United Kingdom, (b) a limited number of English,
Math, and Science teachers at the secondary level; (c) assistance with the
development of technical schools and (d) managerial assistance for the MCDE.
UNICEF has assisted with upgrading of untrained primary school teachers. UNDP
as well as CIDA have financed equipment and technical assistance for
curriculum development. UNDP has recently reached an understanding with the
Ministry of Education to provide technical assistance and fellowships to
improve planning skills. The African Development Bank has funded two
education projects which support construction of (a) primary schools in urban
areas, (b) secondary schools, and (c) offices for regional education
administrators. NGOs, especially churches, play an important role in the
secondary education and manage many grant-aided schools.
14.          Agreed Actions.  Government has agreed to implement the actions
outlined in its Letter of Education Development Policy of August 28 1989,
which includes specific measures in each of the areas described above (paras
4 and 10). In line with that commitment, Government has agreed to the
following as conditions of disbursement. By Credit effectiveness (and for



- 4 -
release of funds for the items listed as sub-project A In Schedule attached)i
agreement with IDA on projected education expenditures for the remaining years
of the education plan, and on an acceptable plan for evaluating progress of
teachers in the new in-service training program, and criteria and procedures
for dismissing poor performers. By July 1991 (for release of funds for sub-
project 3): implementation of the first phase of the restructuring of the
Ministry and of new rules for repetition and for admission of pupP  to
standard one; and agreentnt with 1DA on (i) a reduced number of sat aects in
the secondary school curriculum, and (ii) level of the Development Budget; and
increases in secondary school tuition fees to MK45 per year and university
fees to NK280 per year. (3) By Januarv 1993 (for release of funds for sub-
project C)s Implementation of the agreed second phase of the Education
Services Review including the staff development program; inrease In secondary
tuition fees to MK60, and boarding fees to MK200, and university fees to
WK360; discontinuation of free provision of exercise books to secondary school
students; and agreement with IDA on the level of the Development kdget.
15.     Benefits and Risks.  The credit would continue and further IDA's
support for policy reform in education, and would finance innovative programs
to Improve quality, cost-effectiveness, internal and external efficiency,
equity and access at all levels. It will strengthen the planning, budgeting
and management capabilities of the Ministry. These improvements in access
vould be especially beneficial for women, r.al areas, and poor families. The
main risk is that Government would allocate Insufficient funds to the
education sector over the next five years, leading to delays In Implementation
of the reform program, the investment plan, and the project. This risk has
been minimized by requiring that a commtment to adequate funding, supported
by approval by Treasury and EP&D of budget projections, Is in place before the
project begins and Is reaffirmed at regular prescribed intervals during the
life of the project. A second risk is that the limited managerial and
administrative capability of the MOEC to Implement and effectively monitor the
policy changes might be overstretched by the project. The credit is
addressing this risk by strengthening the planning function with technical
assistance, more local staff positions, and fellowships. A third risk is that
the large number of trainee teachers to be recruited into the new three year
in-service training program will not all perform eatisfactorily. This risk is
being addressed through conditionality that requires MOEC to develop criteria
against which to evaliate their academic and practical performance and to
release from service those who are unsatisfactory.
16.          Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
