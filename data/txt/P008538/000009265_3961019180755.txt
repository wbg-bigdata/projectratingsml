CHAPTER I
BACKGROUND
A. INTRODUCTION
1.1          Lithuania is the largest of the Baltic republics, with a territory of 65,200 sq km and a
population of nearly 3.7 million people. During the Soviet era, Lithuania enjoyed a higher standard of
living than many other republics of the Former Soviet Union (FSU). While Lithuania does not have
abundant natural resources, it has inherited a highly skilled work force and a relatively well-developed
infrastructure.
1.2          Agriculture is the second largest sector in the Lithuanian economy and has been one of
the country's main sources of income, employment, and foreign exchange earnings'. By the end of 1994,
agriculture accounted for nearly 23 % of the GDP, employed about 25 % of the labor force, and produced
24% of all exports. Traditionally the sector produced a surplus, mostly in livestock products which
accounted for 67% of total agricultural output. Crop production, the bulk of which has been grain for
the livestock industry, has averaged 30% of total agricultural output for most of the past decade.
1.3          By 1994 agricultural production declined by more than 35% when compared to 1987-89
average levels, while exports had declined even more, by roughly 50%. The livestock industry was
particularly hard hit. Crop production had also declined; over 20% of arable land was left idle because
of lack of inputs and working capital, uncertainty over property rights, and inadequate marketing support
services. It is generally believed that the required reduction in agricultural production has been achieved
as witnessed by the stabilized agricultural production levels of 1995.
1.4          Despite these recent problems, Lithuanian agriculture has the potential to become a
reliable source of income and employment for the rural population. This will require structural
adjustments in the sector induced through continuous policy reforms and rational investment strategies.
Future production levels and patterns will have to be determined by market conditions and based on
comparative advantages. Already, Lithuania has been quite successful in redirecting its agricultural
exports to non-former Soviet Union (FSU) markets. There are also signs that investments are being made
in the sector as farmers, with improving agricultural terms of trade, start to regain confidence.
1.5          The proposed Private Agriculture Development Project (PADP) would be the first Bank
Group supported investment project for the agricultural sector in Lithuania. The PADP has been
designed to promote the sector's transformation to a market-based system by removing some of the main
constraints.  In addition to investment credit, the project would provide technical assistance for
strengthening rural financial intermediaries, and institutional and human skills conducive to the
development of a private agricultural sector. Chapter I gives the general background information that
is pertinent to the project, Chapter II evaluates the rural banking sector and the present constraints,
Chapter III describes the project in detail, Chapter IV outlines implementation and management
arrangements for the project, Chapter V analyzes benefits and risks of the project, and finally, Chapter
VI summarizes agreements reached during negotiations and conditions for loan effectiveness.
I     For more information about the sector, please refer to Uthuanian Agriculture and Food Sector Review (report no.
13111-LT), issued on April 14, 1995, by the World Bank, Washington, DC.

B. AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE AND POLICY REFORMS
1.6          Macro stabilization. Since regaining independence in 1991, Lithuania has embarked on
a reform program aimed at reorienting its economy away from a centrally planned system toward a
market-based one. In that context, the Government of Lithuania (GOL) has made substantial progress
in economic stabilization and structural reforms. Inflation declined from over 1,000% in 1992 to 410%
in 1993. In 1994 the macro situation stabilized to the extent that inflation was down to 45%. The
estimated inflation for 1995 is even lower, at around 30%. Since 1993 the country has had a fully
convertible and stable currency, the Litas (LTL), which is pegged to the US dollar. Prices have been
liberalized, a new trade regime is being developed, and the country has made progress in reorienting its
trade. The share of non-FSU exports to total exports increased from 28% in 1992 to over 50% in 1994.
Moreover, there has been significant progress in the privatization of banking institutions, small
businesses, and agricultural land.
1.7          Agricultural Reforms to Date. The GOL is also committed to the transformation of the
agricultural sector to compete in a market economy - a transition that includes agricultural policy reform,
land reform, and privatization. The GOL's initial response during the post-Soviet era was to protect
farmers; however such protectionist policies are now being progressively removed. To date the GOL has
made considerable progress in a number of areas: (a) land restitution is at an advanced stage; (b)
privatization of small-scale processing enterprises has been significant; (c) the GOL does not sets
procurement quotas (except for a strategic food reserve) or controls consumer prices; (d) retail margin
controls on foodstuffs were removed in early 1995; (e) import tariffs on foodstuffs, with few exceptions,
were reduced to more moderate levels under the agreed Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program with the
IMF; (f) bankruptcy laws have been enacted; and (g) competition laws and fair practice supervisory roles
have been strengthened.
1.8          Reversal of Policy Reforms. In recent months, the Government of Lithuania has been
subject to tremendous political pressure to take into greater account the social impact of the transition in
the agricultural sector as well as the protectionism of the Western developed economies vis-a-vis imported
agricultural goods. Due to increasing economic and social hardship, particularly for farmers and others
in the rural sector, the Government has re-introduced minimum price supports for selected commodities
and has slowed the elimination of subsidized credit. These recent moves are clearly a reversal of the
previous liberal policy reforms achieved by the Government. Nevertheless, the new supports are limited
in scope, and while they would delay the liberalization of the sector, they would not be able to reverse
the structural reforms already being taking place in the sector. The minimum marginal price support
scheme covers only a small number of products (milk, beef, pork, rapeseed, buckwheat and flax), and
the LTL 137 million allocated for this in the 1995 budget was equivalent to less than 4% of the total Gross
Value of Agricultural Output in that year. Furthermore, the recent trend in the market has led to market
prices often exceeding the set minimum prices for most of the products, hence rendering the price support
scheme ineffective and harmless. Additionally, contrary to the Government's announcement of gradual
reduction, the budgetary allocation for subsidized credit has declined by more than 50% from LTL 110
million in 1994 to LTL 50 million in 1995.
1.9          Furthermore, in discussions with the Bank during the initial sector work and subsequent
project preparation, the Government has re-iterated its commitment to policy reforms that would promote
the growth of a market oriented and competitive agricultural sector. As an initial step toward meeting



Background                                                                                3
that goal, the Government has started more direct support to farmers (e.g. providing incentives to
improve the quality of their beef and milk through the provision of high quality breeding stocks, etc.).
The Government has also stated in the Development Policy Letter (see Attachment 1 of this report) that
it plans to phase out minimum price support and subsidized credit over a four year period ending in 1999.
In addition, during project implementation, the Government has agreed to reduce the total agricultural
subsidies each year by no less than 4% in real terms from the previous fiscal year's level. With the
policy reforms achieved so far, and the continuous commitment by the Government, the distortions of
the incentive systems in the sector are limited enough to justify Bank support.
C. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY FOR RURAL DEVELOPMENT
1.10         Government's Objectives. The Government has declared that agriculture is a national
priority because of the position it holds in social, cultural, and environmental affairs. Current opinion
in the country suggests that Lithuania should support the most important agricultural products and
exports; that natural resources and land should be protected and improved; that organic agriculture should
be introduced; and that an optimal size structure of farms should be established based on market signals.
1.11         Surveys of farmers and Agricultural Companies (ACs), and the rural population2 have
indicated that, in addition to declines in revenues from agricultural production, there are limited income
earning opportunities for laid-off farmers and agricultural workers. The Government is keen to obtain
technical assistance in the areas of retraining redundant workers and the re-engineering of existing
production facilities. In particular, the Government is interested in: (a) stimulating the establishmnent of
new rural businesses and group initiatives which create jobs; (b) stimulating the development of new rural
income generating activities for families on small farms; (c) ensuring that the female population of rural
areas benefits fromr the restructuring and development of the rural economies; (d) developing Lithuanian
skills for long-term implementation of these goals; and (e) having support for the sector focus on
development of the entire food delivery chain - from primary production, to processing, and to marketing
and distribution.
1.12         New Roles of Government. The main development challenge facing Lithuania is the need
to maintain a stable economy while accelerating and deepening the structural reform process to elicit a
strong supply response in the private sector. Accordingly, the Government has recognized that during the
transition, its role should change from the direct provision of goods and services towards indirect
government guidance of the economy through legal, regulatory, and policy measures. Although
imperfect, the legal and regulatory capacity is reasonable to foster private activities, and the Government
continues to improve its supervisory capacity through various technical assistance and training program
for civil servants. These changes would allow greater incentives and the opportunity to take advantage
of the efficiency of the private sector, while reducing total government expenditure and easing overall
fiscal pressures. Consistent with the general trend, Government expenditures on agriculture have fallen
each year since 1991, primarily through a reduction in subsidies, and this trend is expected to continue.
2  The Survey was carried out by the Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics in Autumn 1994 for the Social Program for
Rural Development.

D. COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGES AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE
1.13         Comparative Advantages of the Agriculture Sector. The agriculture sector has good
economic potential primarily because of its relatively favorable agro-climatic conditions, well established
agricultural traditions, and a trained pool of farmers and technicians. The conditions are particularly well
suited for production of grains, root crops, and livestock, and they are also suitable for the production
of some fruits and vegetables. While the country traditionally has been a net exporter of livestock
commodities to the rest of the FSU, crop and livestock yield potentials have not been realized, and there
is much room for productivity gains. The food processing industry, once equipped with modem
technology and more diversified product lines, can compete in international markets. With additional
investment, the current high level of losses throughout the food production system from limited storage,
handling, and transportation facilities can be significantly reduced. There is substantial potential to
increase raw product yields and processing and distribution efficiency, which could increase the
competitiveness of Lithuanian agriculture.
1.14         Efforts are now under way to improve economic conditions in rural areas by identifying
and supporting alternative income and employment generating activities. Taking advantage of the
relatively clean air and water in certain rural areas, small scale business opportunities such as eco-
tourism, hunting, etc. are being explored. Handicrafts, especially textiles, woodworking, and log home
building are being promoted as low-tech, natural resource based rural income earners.  Regional
governments are eager to receive technical assistance in identifying alternative employment possibilities
and training in the skills necessary to pursue these opportunities. A pilot program, the Rural Employment
Generation component devised under the proposed project, would support the selected districts by
identifying alternative employment possibilities and providing training for new careers and business
opportunities. The pilot program would be expanded to wider areas and be sustainable long after project
funding has ceased (see paras. 3.2 and 3.23).
1.15         Challenges Ahead. Challenges remain during the transition period to restructure and
revitalize the agriculture sector while removing the remaining constraints. The main challenges to address
are: (a) the emergence of large numbers of newly created private farmers without productive assets and
capital, the full range of inputs, or modern farming skills; (b) difficulty in creating and enforcing legal
collateral; (c) the almost complete absence of medium- or long-term rural credit to the sector; (d) rural
employment problems caused by the down-sizing of processing industries; (e) inefficient and under-
utilized agro-industries with outdated technology and equipment; (e) slow privatization of large-scale agro-
processing and service industries; and (f) the insufficient support services, including extension, research,
marketing, and distribution.
1.16         To meet these challenges, the process of policy reform must continue to provide a
nurturing environment for much-needed investment to revitalize the sector. This will facilitate the
restructuring and rehabilitating of the sector based on market signals. Future lending for agriculture
should be based on commercial and financial viability. Additionally, the reform program in agriculture
should be consistent, and properly sequenced, with the macroeconomic reform framework and programs.
A proposed Structural Adjustment Loan for Lithuania includes, among other things, a comprehensive
agricultural policy reform package which would be coordinated and synchronized with other related
intersectoral and macro-economic policy reform. In the interim, the proposed project would address
some of these key constraints through its financial and technical assistance.



CHAPTER II
THE RURAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. THE BANKING SYSTEM
2.1          As is the case with most transitional economies, the financial sector in Lithuania is still
weak. Since independence, three state-owned banks, 25 commercial banks, a development bank, and one
representative office of a foreign bank have been established. The three state-owned banks, the
Agricultural Bank, the State Savings Bank, and the State Commercial Bank, account for nearly 50% of
total asset market share, however International Accounting Standards (IAS) audits of all three State Banks
concluded that they all have inadequate capital structures and lack institutional capacity. Of the 25 private
commercial banks created since independence, only about 15 were still functioning by mid-1995. While
a significant informal financial sector had also developed post-independence, based mostly on local
trading companies in search of profitable outlets for excess liquidity; their importance has recently
declined sharply.
2.2           The Private Commercial Banks. Although about 15 commercial banks are still operating,
this number is likely to be reduced in the coming years through consolidation, mergers, and liquidation.
Most of the commercial banks had started out as the treasury arm of their state-owned enterprise
founders. However, progress in enterprise privatization, and successful attempts at raising new capital
have weakened those ties considerably. Some of the more active banks have already succeeded in
acquiring credit lines from foreign sources. A few of the banks have participated in two EU-PHARE
funded credit lines, each of which amounts to ECU 3 million and finances investments by small and
medium-sized enterprises. Three of the more active banks have already been judged eligible to participate
in the Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project (EFSAP), recently approved by the Bank.'
2.3          During the last three years the larger private banks have been expanding their network
of branches and many now have branch offices in the major towns of the country. Funding comes mainly
from new private sector enterprises, and a large portion is denominated in foreign currency. While
initially most of these banks limited their activities to short-term foreign currency loans and accounts in
foreign correspondent banks, more recently banks have been expanding their lending activities to lending
in domestic and foreign currency, mostly for short-term trading. International audits and portfolio
reviews, coupled with the introduction by BOL of a loan classification and provisioning rule which
became effective on April 1, 1994, indicate that most of the banks will have to raise additional capital
and build up their loan loss provisions. Banks have started to respond to this challenge by cutting their
dividend pay-outs and by increasing their efforts to increase their equity.
B. FINANCING OF THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Limited Credit to the Agricultural Sector
2.4          Due to lack of information, experience, and expertise in lending to agricultural activities,
Lithuanian commercial banks are not extending credit to farmers and small-scale rural enterprises. High
transaction costs of servicing small size farm loans, uncertainties surrounding collateral, titles, and a
I     Lithuania Enterprise and Financial Assistance Project, (Ln #8536 ) approved by the Board on April 13. 1995.



6                                                                               Chapter 2
general perception that farm lending has relatively high risk, all serve to aggravate the situation. Banks
are predominantly engaged in the financing of highly profitable short-term trading activities and there is
very little long-term credit in the banking system as a whole, much less for lending to the agriculture
sector. The current banking system has failed to respond to the phasing out of subsidized credit by the
Government and the opportunities being opened up by newly emerging private farmers and private rural
entrepreneurs. Yet, with more than 25% of the country's income being generated from agriculture, the
sector presents a good choice for banks to diversify their lending and other banking activities. A program
of targeted support which provides initial long-term credit to agriculture, accompanied by carefully
designed technical assistance to beneficiaries, would act as a catalyst to overcome the above obstacles,
and thus "open" the market potential of lending to previously excluded groups such as small-scale rural
entrepreneurs and private farmers. Such directed support would demonstrate that agricultural lending can
be profitable for banks if they are willing to acquire the necessary skills, and operate in the rural areas
with an established client base. The project is designed to fill the gap by providing a catalytic force to
develop a sound rural financing system.
2.5          Limited Support to Private Farmers. Official statistics show that the number of registered
individual farm holdings exceeded 134,000 by the end of 1995, of which at least 30,000 are operating
private farms and the remainder are leasing out their landholding to other farmers or ACs. Because of
uneven and arbitrary granting of credits, the number of private farmers and ACs benefiting from the
special short-term credits provided by the Government has been small. Furthermore, most of these
private farmers and ACs have not had access to long-term conunercial credit.
2.6          With a near absence of long-term investment credit and pent-up demand on the part of
newly established private farmers, demand for credit, particularly for long-term investment credit, is
likely to be substantial. Agriculture traditionally has been an important contributor to the national
economy and with a continuously increasing number of registered private farms, there would be an
adequate client basis for the proposed US $30 million credit line. With estimated average loan sizes of
LTL 20,000 for working capital and around LTL 200,000 to LTL 400,000 for long-term investment, the
maximum number of clients to be served under the proposed project would be around 2,000 to 2,500.
The Farm Survey (see para 3.31 and Annex 3) has also confirmed that the emerging private farmers
have almost no access to investment credit to purchase appropriate equipment and fixed assets and to
finance the start-up and development of their farming enterprise.
2.7          Subsidized Credit. By the end of 1994, total institutional credit to agriculture, almost
entirely in the form of short-term credit, was about LTL 500 million. Of this, about 25 % was channeled
from Government sources through the ABL at highly concessionary terms (at annual interest rates of 5 %
and 8%). The source of this subsidized credit was the Agriculture Support Fund (ASF) which was
created in February 1994 by the Government. A part of the ASF was also allocated to various subsidy
programs for producers and processors, including subsidies for bread bakeries. By August 1, 1995, the
total outstanding balance of loans financed from the ASF amounted to about LTL 122 million. Due to
its relatively small size which is declining even more, the actual impact of subsidized credit has been
relatively small and limited.
2.8          Furthermore, the Government has recognized that subsidized credit cannot be sustained
and is too costly to the econorny. Accordingly, the GOL has: (a) proposed and obtained the necessary
Parliamentary approval for diverting LTL 70 million from the ASF for recapitalization of the ABL; (b)
reduced the budgetary allocation for subsidized credit from LTL 110 million in 1994 to LTL 50 million

in 1995; and (c) is committed to gradually phasing out the entire subsidized credit program by the end
of 1999. As a project conditionality, an agreement with the Government was reached during negotiations
on the gradual reduction of overall agricultural subsidies. This agreement provides that during Project
implementation, the total amount of subsidies, including credit subsidies, to the agricultural sector
would be reduced annually by no less than 4% in real terms from the previous fiscal year's level.
The Agricultural Bank of Lithuania
2.9          The Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL) has been the sole source of agricultural credit
in Lithuania. ABL specializes in providing banking services to the agricultural sector although it is a
universal bank authorized to serve all other sectors of the economy. In October, 1993, the bank formally
became a joint stock company with a capital of LTL 20 million and 49% private ownership (with about
10% of the share capital held by a large number of ABL employees). The ABL has a network of 46
branches throughout the country, with a total staff of approximately 2,300 that serves about 215,000
clients. At the end of 1993, a portfolio review and audit in accordance with IAS revealed that, taking
into account required provisions for its non-performing loans, the bank was insolvent as of December 31,
1993. The audit also pointed to deficiencies and weaknesses in the bank's credit policies, procedures,
accounting, and internal control systems.
2.10         Positive Developments within ABL. Since its first IAS audit of 1993, the situation of the
ABL has improved substantially. First, the senior management of ABL was changed during 1994. The
new management is receptive to outside support and welcomes the restructuring and commercialization
of the ABL with the ultimate goal of privatization. The IAS Audit for 1994 showed that ABL's capital
position had improved considerably, and it had a net income of over LTL 68 million after taxes. The
ABL had extended LTL 827 million (US $207 million) in loans, of which about 60% was for the
agricultural sector, and approximately one third of this (LTL 158 million, or US $40 million equivalent)
was to farmers. Its liabilities consisted of deposits, partly from its client borrowers - ACs, agro-
processing enterprises, and private farmers.  Bank of Lithuania (BOL) refinancing and special
Government funding formed an important source of the ABL's loanable funds. Annex 4 provides
additional information on the Agricultural Bank together with its audited financial statements for 1994.
2.11         The Government Commitment to ABL Restructuring. Further positive developments have
occurred in ABL during 1995. The Government recognized that the ABL, with its extensive branch
network and staff, was likely to be the main channel for rural credit and initiated measures to strengthen
the ABL both financially and operationally: (a) the GOL has declared its commitment to discontinue the
channeling of political loans through the ABL, thus separating the previous fiscal agency role from the
ABL's commercial lending activities. In the interim, when acting as a fiscal agent for GOL, the ABL
shall not bear the lending risk; (b) the GOL has agreed to take over bad loans which were the result of
politically directed lending from the ABL's portfolio and to assist the ABL in its financial restructuring
effort; and (c) the GOL has committed to inject new share capital which would allow ABL to fully restore
its capital base and move towards becoming a viable commercial bank. The Government's proposal to
recapitalize the ABL by diverting funds from the main source of subsidies, the Agricultural Support Fund,
has been approved by Parliament. This would increase the ABL capital without additional budgetary
pressures and at the same time reduce direct subsidies for agriculture.

2.12         In addition to recapitalization and restructuring, the Government has stated that although
it will be the majority shareholder of the ABL immediately following recapitalization, it will be a
temporary step in the process towards full privatization of the ABL. In the interim, the Government
would ensure full autonomy for the ABL in loan approval. The Government, in collaboration with the
Council and Board of the ABL, will prepare a detailed privatization plan with a definite time-schedule
during the first phase of the ABL twinning project. It is expected that by December 1997, such a detailed
privatization plan would be in place.
2.13         Institutional Development Support for ABL. In order for the ABL to function as a
commercial bank, it will require substantial institutional strengthening to improve both its management
and operations. The proposed project would provide an opportunity to discontinue the past non-
commercial practices of the ABL and transform it into a true commercial bank through comprehensive
institutional development support along with a commercial credit line. An overall Institutional
Development Program (IDP) through a two year twinning arrangement with an experienced foreign bank
is being prepared. TA activities, supported by a team of long-term consultants and financed by EU-
PHARE, for strengthening and improving credit management in ABL and other PFIs, have already been
in place since fall 1995, and the new operational guidelines relating to credit operations would become
effective before starting disbursements of the proposed Loan. The management of ABL is fully
committed to implementing a wide-ranging institutional development program, with the assistance of
foreign experts. TA modules with quarterly schedules, Terms of Reference (TOR), and indicators to
monitor progress of the Institutional Development Program were prepared by the Bank and agreed with
ABL and the Government (see para. 3.15 and Annex 5 for full details).
C. STRENGTHENING RURAL FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION
2.14         In order to identify potential financial intermediaries to address rural credit needs,
particularly the needs of small-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs and to determine which financial
institutions would be most able to absorb the necessary TA for eventual financial intermediation under
the proposed PADP, a survey of banks was carried out. The survey canvassed 11 banks, eight leading
commercial banks and three State banks. The results showed:
(a) All the private commercial banks expressed interest in participating in projects lending to agro-
processing and agro-services enterprises; however commercial banks had reservations in regard
to lending to the farming community, private individual farmers, and ACs. Only one commercial
bank showed an interest in lending directly to farmers, and then only if they were linked to
processing enterprises.
(b) All three state banks, and the ABL in particular, expressed interest in lending to farmers,
processors, and service enterprises. The results of the 1993 audit of the three state banks showed
that they would require financial restructuring and major institutional improvements and
strengthening before they could qualify to participate in Bank operations.
2.15         The PADP would mitigate the perceived risks in agricultural lending by providing
necessary technical and financial assistance to a small number of major commercial banks willing to serve
the agricultural sector. TA to improve the collateral basis through intensification of land titling, training
of loan officers specifically in lending to agriculture, and strengthening institutional capabilities of banks



The Rural Financial System                                                            9
for improved efficiency and risk management would be provided. In addition, TA to strengthen extension
and marketing services and other related activities would enhance productivities and profitability of
agricultural investment. Consequently, it is expected that an increasing number of commercial banks
would gradually become interested in lending to agriculture as their skills in this area improve, their
understanding of sector dynamics grows, and as they are given access to external long-term financing.
2.16         Already one of the major private commercial banks which has satisfied the eligibility
criteria for participation in the proposed PADP (para. 3.13), has expressed a strong interest in
diversifying its lending operations to farmers, as well as processors, through participation in the PADP.
Increased interest in lending to farmers illustrates that quick and large returns from financing short-term
trading is declining and that banks seeking to stabilize their loan portfolio must diversify their lending.
2.17         It is recognized that the PADP cannot rely solely on one eligible bank. Other banks
which satisfy the eligibility criteria would be encouraged to participate both in the credit line and the
institutional strengthening program to improve their credit management system. The support for the
ABL, mentioned in the previous section, would also provide a wide ranging institutional development
program to transform the ABL into an efficiently operating commercial bank with full autonomy. The
current status of the ABL's compliance with the eligibility criteria is summarized in Annex 4. The ABL
is expected to become an eligible bank within a short time of loan effectiveness if the Government's stated
support program is fully implemented. An agreement was reached at negotiations that the GOL will
complete the recapitalization of the ABL within six months from loan effectiveness. It is expected that
compliance with a condition of effectiveness--conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with at least
one PFI--would be met soon after signing of Loan documents.



CHAPTER HI
THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND COMPONENTS
3.1              The main objectives of the project are to assist the Government with the development of a viable,
private agriculture sector and to foster economic growth in rural areas by providing a combination of financial
and technical assistance. These objectives would be achieved by addressing some of the key policy and
institutional constraints through the continuation of ongoing policy dialogue and a comprehensive institutional and
human resource development program. The main outcomes of the project would be a strengthened rural financial
intermediation system and the establishment of commercial lending in the agricultural sector. In addition,
Lithuanian capacities in environmentally sound approaches to agriculture would be strengthened through
improvement in agricultural extension services, provision of advisory services to agro-processing industries, and
the training of personnel from PFIs in environmental review methods. Another important objective of the project

The Project                                                                                  11
is to alleviate poverty and social difficulties in rural areas due to increasing unemployment. This would be
achieved through a pilot program at the grassroots level which would provide assistance to the local government
in identification of alternative employment opportunities, training for the rural labor force in newly required
skills, and provide direct assistance in preparation of business plans to realize new business opportunities.
Technical Assistance (TA) for accelerating land reform and improving marketing, extension services, and business
management skills would enhance the development of private economic activities. Within these broad objectives,
the main goals of the proposed Private Agriculture Development Project (PADP) are outlined in Box 3.1.
3.2          The project would complement a Bank financed Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Loan
which is designed to address more broadly-based financial and enterprise sector issues and more likely to service
non-farming and large scale enterprises. Consequently, the focus of the proposed project is to assist newly
emerged private farmers and small scale rural enterprises. Through a pilot program the Project would also
provide financial and technical assistance, help at grassroots level in identification of alternative employment
opportunities and training the rural labor force in newly required skills, hence alleviating severe financial and
social difficulties in rural populations due to increasing unemployment and poverty. Technical assistance for land
reform, market information, strengthening of extension services, and business management skills would enhance
the development of the private sector in Lithuanian agriculture.
3.3          The Droiect has two main components: a Rural Credit Component (RCC) to be supported by the
Bank through participating financial intermediaries; and an Institutional and Human Resources Development
Component (IHDC) to be supported by parallel grant cofinancing by donors.
3.4          The main beneficiaries of the PADP would be: private farmers, agricultural companies, processing
enterprises, and other rural enterprises involved in marketing, input supply, machinery services, and any other
rural business closely linked to agriculture. In addition, the IHDC would benefit Governmental and non-
governmental agencies and participating financial institutions.
3.5          Program of Targeted Poverty Interventions.  The proportion of the poor among project
beneficiaries is significantly larger than the national average. The average agricultural wage has declined from
97% of the national average in 1990 to less than 50% in 1994. The project would support unemployed or
underemployed in rural areas by training them in alternative skills and market and product information.
B. THE RURAL CREDIT COMPONENT
3.6          The Rural Credit Component (RCC) would provide a US $30 million line of credit to
Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) for the financing of eligible subprojects. PFIs would be fully
autonomous in selection of borrowers, approval of subprojects, and determination of lending terms. Anticipated
subprojects would include, among others:
(a)  on-farm investment for development of agricultural production, including the provision of seasonal credit
or initial working capital as appropriate;
(b)  investment (including permanent working-capital) for development of processing, storage, packing,
marketing, and other related agricultural service sectors; and
(c)  investment in small-scale rural employment and income generating activities.



12                                                                                       Chapter 3
3.7          It is expected that roughly half of all lending would go to small farmers and small-scale rural
entrepreneurs. The monitoring and reporting systems established under the project would provide the necessary
data for annual reviews of subloan size and use. Agreement has been reached on annual reviews of the loan
portfolios. A mid-term review would be furnished to the Bank not later than March 31, 1998. All reviews wiU
focus on the distribution of the subloan beneficiaries and subloan size to verify that they are consistent with
project lending objectives and expectations. Adjustments would be made to reflect any imbalances.
3.8          Demand for credit. Demand for credit in Lithuania, particularly for medium- to long-term credit
is likely to remain high. The aforementioned Farm Survey, and the Agricultural Sector Review, have both
confirmed that: (a) the agricultural sector has not received, either from public or private sources, any long-term
investment credits for some time; (b) most of the subsidized credit in the sector has been for short-term credit
covering about 25% of total credit extended to the sector; and (c) as farms go through structural and ownership
changes, the requirements of farm restructuring and recapitalization, with the appropriate equipment and fixed
assets, are considerable. A preliminary estimate taken from the Farm Survey shows that present investment
requirements in the agricultural sector could be as much as US $200 million at current market rates. Two PFIs
have expressed their commitment to participate in the proposed project and submitted written commitments with
estimated disbursement by each PFI under the PADP. It was agreed at negotiatons that if by June 30, 1998,
at least 50% of the credit line was not committed, the Bank, in consultation with the Borrower, will review
whether the uncommitted portion of the credit line should be reduced or canceled.
3.9          Collateral. Although still evolving, a reasonable collateral system exists, based on moveable
assets. Moveable assets such as equipment, livestock, crops, and fixed assets such as housing, and other real
estate, are being used as collateral once they are properly registered with local authorities. PFIs, including the
ABL, would take into account all possible options of securing subloans; this will be a core component in the new
lending guidelines and training of loan officers for participating PFIs. Similarly, although imperfect due to the
lengthy procedures involved, the current legal framework provides adequate legal protection for using the above
collateral, and allows for repossession in case of defaults. A land reform TA component of the proposed project
would complement the already on-going support provided by several donors, including Swedish TA on the legal
aspects of land reform.
3.10         Eligibility Criteria of Subproiects. Subprojects for on-farm development would need to satisfy
the following eligibility criteria:
(a) beneficiaries of the RCC must be private investors with a minimum of 51 % private ownership, and
subprojects must meet eligibility criteria for subprojects; and
(b) projects must demonstrate a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 over the life of the subloan,
calculated on the basis of the entity's total debts.
The line of credit would not finance the purchase or lease of land, dwelling construction or improvement, or
the refinancing of existing debts.
3.11         Investment subprojects in agro-processing, agro-service or supply, and rural enterprises would
have to satisfy the eligibility criteria outlined in points (a) and (b) above and would in addition be expected to
be completed within 18 months from the date of the signature of the subloan agreement.



The Project                                                                                  13
3.12         Sub-borrowers would be required to make the following contributions towards subproject costs:
no less than 15 % in cash or in-kind for individual farmers; and no less than 20% in cash or in-kind for all others.
For new investment by enterprises, the self-contribution in cash or in-kind, would be at least 30%. At
negotiations an agreement was reached that maximum subloan size (and cumulative subloans to one single
borrower for the PADP) would be less than US $250, 000. Furthermnore it was agreed that above mentioned
eligibility criteria for subprojects (paras. 3.10 to 3.12) would be applied during the lifetime of the project.
3.13         Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Intermediaries. A set of eligibility criteria shall be
used to determine the suitability of Lithuanian banks for participation in the RCC. To qualify, a PFI must:
(a)  have an acceptable audit report which covers one full year of operations, incorporates a portfolio review,
and is prepared by an internationally recognized audit firm in accordance with International Accounting
Standards (IAS);
(b)  have been in existence and have produced operating results for a minimum of two years;
(c)  agree to engage in an institutional development program designed in conjunction with the World Bank
to address any identified deficiencies, and to be implemented with the assistance of an internationally
experienced bank or other acceptable experts;
(d)  provide a Certificate of Compliance from the BOL stating that: (i) it has a valid banking license together
with the type and date of license; (ii) the BOL is not aware of any criminal proceedings ongoing against
the bank or any of its shareholders holding voting rights in excess of 10%; and (iii) the bank is in general
compliance with all relevant banking laws and regulations;
(e)  have minimum assets, as defined under IAS, equivalent to US $25 million;
(f)  have minimum equity capital (net worth) assets minus liabilities, as defined under IAS, in an amount
equivalent to US $2 million and would increase its capital as necessary to comply with future increases
required by BOL;
(g)  have a minimum BIS' risk weighted capital (as defined under IAS) adequacy ratio of 5 % by year-end
1995, 6% by year-end 1996, 7% by year-end 1997 and 8% by year-end 1998;
(h)  have an exposure to one borrower as a percent of its IAS equity capital of no more than 40 % by year-end
1995, 35% by year-end 1996, 30% by year-end 1997 and 25% by year end 1998;
(i)  have aggregate exposure to insiders (defined as council members, members of the Management Board,
employees in a management position and shareholders with voting rights in excess of 10%) of no more
than 90% of IAS equity capital by year-end 1995, 80% by year-end 1996, 70% by year-end 1997 and
60% by year-end 1998; and
(j) have independent Board composition and functions acceptable to the Bank.
Bank for International Settlement.

Institutional Development Program for the Agriculfure Bank of Lithuania (IDP)
3.14         Although the IDP has been designed specifically for the ABL, it has also been designed to have
sufficient breadth to benefit any other eligible banks wishing to participate in the PADP. Training would be
available for interested PFIs and new lending manuals, guidelines, and training materials would be made available
as reference materials for other lending institutions as well.
3.15         The Institutional Development Program for the ABL has two parts as follows:
(a)    Rural Credit Management would introduce improved rural credit lending guidelines and
procedures, prepare new lending manuals, and train loan officers. Appropriate training would
be provided to loan officers in environmental screening as well. This work has already begun
and the first set of activities is expected to be completed by early Spring 1996. It is expected that
the new lending guidelines would be applied to the entire ABL lending and not restricted to the
Bank credit line. At negotiations, an agreement was reached that completion of the new rural
credit manual acceptable to the Bank and the first round of staff training would be a condition
for the ABL 's participation as a PFI and that the new lending guidelines would be adopted for
the ABL's entire lending operations.
(b)    Comprehensive Institutional Development Program includes twelve key banking areas to be
supported as follows:
*     Strategic Planning
*     Planning, Budgeting and Performance Measurement Process
*     Organizational Restructuring and Strengthening of Corporate Governance
*     Human Resource Management
*     Marketing
*     Credit Management
*     Branch Management
*     Asset and Liability Management
*     Accounting
*     Management Information System
*     Information Technology
*     Internal Audit
The above comprehensive IDP program, which has already begun, is planned to be implemented over two years.
The IDP is being co-financed by EU-PHARE, which would manage the contracting and selection of a twinning
partner. The twinning arrangement is scheduled to begin in early 1996. The Government's commitment to restore
full autonomy in the ABL is a pre-condition for EU-PHARE's institutional support for the ABL, and support to
strengthen the management capacity and the corporate govemance structure would be included in the IDP
program. At completion of the first two year program, if additional TA is necessary, additional donor financing
would be sought at that time. To assess the progress and impact of the IDP, a set of indicators for each key area
of IDP has been developed and would be supervised closely during implementation. The indicators are
categorized as: (a) financial indicators; (b) governance indicators; (c) management indicators; and (d) process
indicators.



The Project                                                                                15
3.16         Prior to and as conditions for negotiations, (a) the Government has prepared and conveyed to
the Bank the plan and timetable for repairing ABL capital; (b) the Government and the ABL have prepared
a new lending 'Statement of Policies" which clearly delineates the ABL 's lending principles and criteria, and
submitted it to the Bank; (c) the ABL prepared and submitted to the Bank TA modules and TOR for the overall
institutional development program and a clear set of indicators for monitoring the progress of the institutional
strengthening, including improvement in management.
3.17         The ABL represents a special case in the use of the Bank financed credit line. Currently the ABL
is undergoing recapitalization and is in the process of major restructuring, including comprehensive institution
building, prior to privatization. It is expected that once ABL's capitalization plan has been implemented, it would
become eligible to intermediate the Bank financed credit line. As part of the capitalization plan, the government
has obtained parliamentary approval to transfer a portion of funds in the Agricultural Support Fund (para. 2.11)
into capital. In addition, the Government has already pledged to replace the bank's bad loans with non-negotiable
government bonds, which would immediately appear as earning assets on the balance sheet. The Government
has requested that subloans be used to replace an equivalent amount of these government bonds. This process
would be governed by a Capitalization Finance Agreement between the Government and ABL. In essence, the
Bank's loan would be used to redeem the bonds for cash, which would simultaneously be used to disburse an
already approved subloan for intended beneficiaries.  In addition to achieving the recapitalization goal, this
scheme would also allow the Government to replace one expensive obligation (the bonds held by the ABL) with
a lower-cost obligation (the repayment of the Bank loan). At negotiations, an understanding was reached that
only after ABL becomes eligible to participate in the PADP, would funds disbursed under the credit line for
eligible subloans under the PADP be used by Government to replace bonds issued for the recapitalization of
the ABL.
C. THE INSTITUTIONAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
3.18         The Institutional and Human Resource Development Component (IHDC) of the PADP would
provide technical assistance (TA) to improve the efficiency of the rural institutional framework and create an
environment conducive to private sector development. The proposed project is designed to trigger necessary
structural changes and supply responses that would ultimately renew growth of the rural economy. In the short-
term, however, the structural adjustment associated with transition could result in severe difficulties for the rural
population due to increasing unemployment and poverty, particularly among women and pensioners. Likewise,
the continued process of land restitution will result in the creation of many small farms, a significant number of
which will be unable to generate sufficient income to meet household needs, and would therefore require,
alternative, off-farm, sources of income would be required. The IHDC has been designed to address these critical
issues. The key areas of TA are summarized below and detailed terms of references as agreed with the
Government and concerned donors are available in the Project file. The IHDC component would be financed
by parallel cofinancing from EU-PHARE and Finland and Sweden (and eventually Denmark and the UK).
3.19         Land Reform. Substantial TA support for land reform has been provided by several bilateral
donors. Although the land market is not yet fully in place, land transactions are already taking place based on
provisional titles. As of December 1995, more than 134,000 private farms have been registered, considerably
more than in the other Baltic republics. TA shall be undertaken to assist the development of the land cadastre
maps and the creation of a single land register which would contain all the legally guaranteed information required
for land transactions to take place. Additional support would be provided to simplify the lengthy procedures and
information requirements for full titling to expedite the development of land markets. In addition, training would
be provided for land evaluators for proper valuation of land and also for improved cost recovery by the National



16                                                                                          Chapter 3
Land Survey Department. This TA support would complement already on-going land reform support provided
by other donors.
3.20          Extension System. TA would be provided to assist the development of the whole extension system
so that extension, research, and education are directed toward farmers' actual needs. TA would also focus on
improving the flow of information from research and education organizations to the advisory service and farmers.
3.21          Marketing. TA would be provided to: (a) improve the flow of market information; (b) assist the
Agricultural Trade Agency in undertaking export promotion and the provision of trade information; (c) assist in
the development of market institutions; and (d) improve the awareness of, and training in, agricultural and food
marketing. These TA activities were designed to address several factors which hinder both the domestic and
export mnarketing of agricultural and food products such as a lack of market institutions and intermediaries, a lack
of trained marketing professionals, and poor marketing information, including the substandard quality and
packaging for Western export markets.
3.22          Business Skills Training. TA programs would be provided to develop and train private farmers
and managers of ACs in business skills. Private farmers require simple training to understand the profitability,
cash flow, and capital position of their businesses and subsequent training in the judgment of project feasibility.
The managers of ACs would be trained in methods to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their businesses
and in the skills to implement the required changes. Training would include both domestic training and overseas
study tours.
3.23          Rural EmDloyment Generation. The Rural Employment Generation Program would help develop
additional employment in the rural areas. One pilot County has been chosen2, and with the County Government
as the counterpart, specific TA would be provided as follows: (a) guide potential entrepreneurs through the
process of business idea identification; (b) assist womens' community groups to establish new enterprises; and
(c) provide business and management training to newly established enterprises. The proposed Rural Business
Development Center (see below) would assist potential investors with the preparation of business plans and loan
applications.
3.24          Rural Business Development Center (RBC). A non-governmental agency would be created to
fill the gap in local capacity to assist small- and medium-scale private entrepreneurs, including private farmers.
The Sector Review, Farm survey, and the survey of local consulting companies identified a lack of quality
upstream consulting support to assist private farmers and small-scale rural entrepreneurs in conceptualizing
business ideas and translating them into concrete business plans, is a key bottleneck facing the agriculture sector.
The RBC would provide such services. International experts would train local consultants for eventual transfer
of skills to locals experts. Likely clients of the RBC are rural entrepreneurs, processors, ACs, and commercial
farmers in the rural sector who plan to invest in agriculture-related activities. Details of the RBC's main
functions, ownership, and operational modalities are in Annex 6.
2      The Government has selected Telsiai county (comprised of three districts) as the pilot site. The local counterpart is already in
place and ready to receive the Swedish TA team. The actual work is scheduled to begin in early 1996.



The Project                                                                                        17
3.25          The RBC would, as a one stop window:
(a)  provide consulting services to farmers (in coordination with the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Services
(LAAS)) and interested clients in formulating business ideas and prepare business plans and feasibility
studies as well as facilitating and enhancing their access to credit;
(b) provide referral services/and facilitate support from other alternative consulting companies, institutes,
advisory services in the areas where potential clients are located; and solicit necessary technical expertise
from relevant agencies or experts;
(c)  maintain and regularly update a "short-list" of qualified consulting companies, etc; and identify,
coordinate and organize training of consultants;
(d)  serve as a window of contact and information on markets, technology, price data, sources of technology,
equipment, quality inputs and contact points in foreign countries, etc. of all supporting services and
maintain reference materials including trade magazines, etc.;
(e)  stimulate rural business development, including providing assistance to workers and farmers seeking
altemative employment opportunities, or exploring possibilities for income-generating activities; and
(f)  coordinate the pilot Rural Employment Generation Component (see para. 3.23 above) of the IHDC and
promote altemative employment opportunities.
An agreement was reached at negotiaton that the Borrower would maintain the RBC as a separate legal entity
with statutes, operational guidelines, and staffing acceptable to the Bank.
D. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT
3.26          As the sector redefines itself, critical questions remain: how to ease the present financial
constraints and promote private sector investment in the sector; how to expedite land titling and registration; how
to increase private sector supply of inputs and services to agriculture; and how to promote the scale of adjustment
necessary to reflect the market equilibrium. The Bank Group's lending strategy in agriculture is to assist the
government in developing a competitive agriculture sector consistent with its efforts to establish a stable macro-
economic environment conducive to the development of a market-driven private economy. Experience in other
countries in similar situations shows that Bank involvement in this project would allow for continuation of the
sector policy reforms already initiated by the Government. The proposed project is the first operation conceived
within the above-mentioned strategy to support the emerging private sector.
3.27          The Government has requested the Bank's assistance in agriculture sector reform. The proposed
project is the first investment operation in the agricultural sector in Lithuania to be supported by the Bank Group
and would support the emerging private agricultural sector.3  Market failures stemming from  imperfect
information flows, inadequate institutional and human resources, and the remaining legacy of past interventionist
policies have prevented farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs from gaining access to commercial long-term
3      An Import Rehabilitation Loan for $60 million equivalent has provided some support for importation of needed agricultural
inputs.

credit. A lack of lending skills and suitable funds has also aggravated the situation. The project would provide
interim measures to overcome these transitional constraints by providing long-term credits and comprehensive
institutional and human resource development TA support. In addition to enhancing the financial viability of
agricultural investment, the project would reduce risks in agricultural lending stemming from lack of collateral,
high transaction costs, etc. Substantial TA support for participating banks would strengthen the credit delivery
system to the sector. In addition, EU-PHARE is planning to establish a credit guarantee scheme which would
be directed at small-scale borrowers. The Bank would also have an instrumental role in coordinating external
technical assistance. The project would also help strengthen Government policy-making and implementation
capability at a critical juncture by providing opportunities for policy dialogues. This project is consistent with
the priorities of private and financial sector development strategies outlined in the Country Assistance Strategy
for Lithuania.
E. STATUS OF PREPARATION
3.28          The project was prepared by the joint efforts of the Government of Lithuania, concerned
Ministries, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and grassroots level agencies, with support from foreign
and local experts. The Bank Group has obtained a Policy and Human Resources Development Grant (PHRD)
to assist the Government in project preparation, as the PADP is the first investment project for Lithuanian
agriculture to be supported by the Bank. The Borrower, particularly the Ministry of Agriculture, had lacked
experience in project preparation. A resident international advisor with extensive World Bank project experience
was provided, and a large number of short-term consultants in various areas of expertise participated in project
preparation activities under the guidance of a Lithuanian director.
3.29          Local Participation. On the Lithuanian side, two working groups were set up by the Ministry
of Agriculture and the Agrarian Committee of the Parliarnent (Seimas) respectively and held a regular briefing
with the project preparation team to discuss the needs of the agricultural and food sectors and to disseminate
project-related information. NGOs were also regularly consulted so that the strategy as it developed was
consistent with the needs of the broad rural constituency.
3.30          Terms of Reference for the Institutional and Human Resource Development Component were
drafted on the basis of the needs identified by both public authorities and NGOs, circulated among wide audiences
for comments, discussed in Committees, and redrafted to target the needs of project beneficiaries. This process
was repeated until the final TORs were completed. In addition, comments from possible donors have been
solicited and incorporated until the final financing commitments have been obtained. Throughout the project
preparation, strong support was received from bilateral donors and the European Union which also sent staff to
participate in Bank missions. Both Sweden and Finland have conducted fact-finding missions to Lithuania and
their TA activities have already begun.4 Outlines of each TA program are presented in Annex 7 and detailed
terms of reference are available in the project files. A Project Implementations Plan prepared by the Ministry
of Agriculture and the PHRD Team, is reproduced as PART II of this SAR.
4      Sweden and Finland conducted fact-finding missions in Lithuania in October 1995 and a follow up mission by Finland took
place in November 1995. In addition, the Finnish Government has already initiated training of AC managers by taking them to Finland
for a study tour in Decenber 1995.



The Project                                                                                          19
3.31          Farm Survey. From the findings of the Bank-prepared Lithuanian Agricultural and Food Sector
Review, it was determined that a farm survey was required to identify farmers' requirements for financial and
technical assistance. The survey was undertaken by the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS), the
Association of Agricultural Companies, and the Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics, with expert advice
provided by the PHRD team. The sample included both private farms and Agricultural Companies. The results
of the survey were widely disseminated and debated, and were used by the project preparation tearn to reflect the
actual conditions and constraints of the potential beneficiaries in project designs. The Survey results are
summarized in Annex 3.
F. COST ESTIMATES
3.32          The total project cost is estimated at US $54.8 million (LTL 219.2 million). The Bank loan would
finance 55 % of estimated total project costs, which is equivalent to about 83.3 % of the projected foreign exchange
component. Donors' parallel cofinancing for about US $8.1 million equivalent would finance 14.8% of total
project costs. The project costs do not include taxes or duties. Sub-borrowers' contributions have been calculated
at the minimum levels of 15% and 20%, respectively, for farm credit and agro- and forestry industries. In the
event that taxes or duties would be levied on any goods financed under the project, the amount of taxes would
be payable by sub-borrowers, and their participation in the project cost would be increased accordingly. Cost
estimates are based on preliminary investment plans of sample sub-projects and unit prices currently prevailing
in Lithuania, and on machinery and equipment price lists from local and international sources. Estimated costs
are summarized in Table 3.1.

G. FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
3.33          The Government of Lithuania would be the Borrower of the proposed Bank loan of US $30
million. The Ministry of Finance, on behalf of the Borrower, would channel the Loan proceeds to eligible PFIs
through the Apex Unit5 (para. 4.10). At negotiations it was agreed that the loan would be a single currency
loan in US dollars at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate, repayable in twenty years,
including five years grace.
5      The Apex unit was created in the Bank of Lithuania under the Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project.

3.34         Co-Financing Arrangements. EU-PHARE, Finland, and Sweden6 would provide about US $8.1
million equivalent through parallel co-financing. Additional financing required for project implementation would
be provided by PFIs and project beneficiaries. The project financing by sources is summarized in Table 3.2.
H. PROCUREMENT
3.35         Procurement of goods and works would
be done in accordance with World Bank Guidelines:         Table 3.2: Summary of Financing Plan
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (issued                (S minion)
in January 1995). For subprojects financed under the  Sources          Total      % of total

customary for operations through financial intermediaries.  Donors      8.1         14.8
Recent Bank reviews of procurement practices (May     Fincial
1995) determined that reasonably acceptable commercial    Intermediaries
practices are applied by the private sector and that
Lithuanian companies do seek competitive prices from  Sub-Borrowers     9.5         17.3
different suppliers and different countries. Funds from the  Total     54.8        100.0
credit line would be utilized by a large number of many
small and medium-size private farmers and enterprises.
Given that the majority of subloans are expected to be small (with an average size less than US $50,000
equivalent), for a large number of individual borrowers, and the variety of goods to be procured, grouping or
orders in bid packages would not possible. Goods expected to be procured and financed under the project would
include agricultural machinery, livestock, building materials, processing equipment, seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,
and other farm inputs.
3.36         Procurement Methods. The participating financial institutions and the RBC would advise project
beneficiaries on appropriate procurement methods and ensure that all goods and works financed under the project
are procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits. Subprojects
would be financed in part by the Bank credit line and in part by local participating banks and final beneficiaries'
own funds. Therefore, subproject size will exceed subloan amount. Based on this, the procurement thresholds
as follows would apply: (a) goods and works estimated to cost the equivalent of less than US $100,000 per
contract, would be procured in accordance with nornal commercial procurement practices; and (b) goods and
works valued up to US $500,000 per contract would be procured through International Shopping (IS) on the basis
of at least three price quotations from two different countries. Although not expected to be applicable for this
project, any contract above US $500,000 would be procured under international competitive bidding (ICB)
procedures. Direct contracting' may be used for proprietary items and those available only from a single supplier
for each contract with an estimated cost under US $50,000. The use of the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents:
Procurement of Goods (January 1995) would be mandatory for all ICB procurement.
3.37         Prior review by the Bank of procurement documentation would be carried out for the first two
contracts proposed to be procured under International Shopping procedures, and submitted by each participating
financial institutions, for all contracts, if any, to be procured under ICB. The Bank conducted a procurement
seminar in Lithuania in May 1995. Soon after loan approval and before loan effectiveness, the Bank would
6     Denmark and the UK have also expressed interest in becoming co-financiers.



The Project                                                                                    21
conduct a project launch workshop which would include training sessions on procurement specifically for the staff
of the PMU, RBC, and the PFIs. The PMU would be responsible for ensuring that the PFIs and subborrowers
would adhere to Bank procurement guidelines, and this would be monitored by Bank supervision missions.
Training on Bank procurement practices would be repeated as necessary. The semi-annual progress report would
contain a summary on procurement activities.
3.38         Expected aggregate amounts for procurement of goods and services financed from the credit line
are US $15 million, using commercial procurement practices, and US $15 million, applying International
Shopping procedures indicated above. As the entire IHDC is being financed by donors, all goods and services
would be procured in accordance with the regulations and practices of each donor agency.
I. DISBURSEMENTS
3.39         Disbursements would be administered by the APEX Unit in coordination with the PMU. The
PMU would collect and compile the necessary documentation for withdrawal of the funds from the credit line
from the PFIs. The proposed Bank loan of US $30 million would be disbursed over a period of five years (1996-
2000), and the expected project closing date would be June 30, 2001. A midterm evaluation would be undertaken
by the Bank and the Borrower approximately six months after the second annual review or when the disbursement
reaches 50% of the total loan amount, whichever is earlier, to examine the pace of project implementation and
to carry out a preliminary assessment of the project's benefits and impact. A schedule of the estimated
disbursements of the proposed Bank loan is shown at Annex 11.
3.40         Retroactive Financing. An agreement was reached at negotiations that up to US $2.5 mnllion
would be financed retroactively for eligible subloans approved and disbursed by PFIs starting from October
1995, provided all lending criteria and procurement guidelines were followed. Retroactive financing would be
justified since: (a) PFIs under considerations are active in lending but lack long-term credit sources; (b) training
program for PFIs is already in place, and several potential investment proposals submitted during project
preparation are under review. Evaluation of these proposals, although not guaranteed to receive credit through
the Bank loan, would provide important hands-on training opportunities; and (c) a pilot program of rural
employment generation (para 3.23), scheduled to begin in early 1996, could generate possible subprojects which
could be eligible for financing under the proposed project.
3.41          Disbursement Ratios. Notwithstanding the disbursement percentages shown in Table 3.3, the
maximum amount to be withdrawn by the
borrower and made available to the PFIs would
be as follows: 100%  of eligible subloans
approved in the first 18 months, 85%  of                     Table 3.3: Disbursements

operations under the project, and because some already existing institutions are in the process of building up their
capital base. With the build-up of equity and with other funds becoming available during project implementation,
the intermediaries' share would gradually increase up to 25 % of subloan amounts to be approved. Disbursements
for the TA component would follow donors' own regulations (see Table 3.3).
3.42         Definition of Periods. For the purpose of applying the disbursement percentages indicated in para.
3.41, the first 18 months represent the period beginning on the dates that each of the PFIs have signed their first
subloan after the project becomes effective. The percentage calculation was based on the assumption that about
25% of subloans would be approved during the first 18 months, 30% in the successive 12 months, and 45% in
the remaining implementation period. Various indicators, including the farm survey carried out during project
preparation, show that the demand for credit is considerably higher than the proposed loan amount; therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that the proposed project could be implemented in less than five years. Agreement was
reached during negotiations that the disbursement percentages (as indicated in paras. 3.41 and 3.42) would be
stipulated in the subsidiary loan agreements to be signed between the borrower and each PFI.
3.43         Withdrawal Application. All withdrawal applications for Category I and Category II would be
made on the basis of certified Statements of Expenditures (SOEs), except for contracts above US $200,000, for
which withdrawals would be based on full documentation. All supporting documentation would be retained by
the Apex and the PFIs for at least one year after receipt by the Bank of the audit report for the year in which the
last disbursement was made. The documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and by
visiting Bank missions. The minimum application size for direct payments will be 20% of the current amount
of authorized allocation to the Special Account.
3.44         Special Account. To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special
Account in one of the major foreign commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover
the Bank's share of expenditures. The initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US $1.5
million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the level of US $4 million,
the Authorized Allocation could be increased to US $2 million (the maximum amount authorized) by submitting
the relevant Application for withdrawal. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be
submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier.
Documentation requirements for replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedures. The terms and
conditions of the establishment and operation of the Special Account were agreed upon at negotiations.



CHAPTER IV
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. PROJECT COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT
Project Management Unit
4.1          The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), through a joint World Bank and EU Project Management
Unit (PMU), would be responsible for coordinating project implementation. Through TA support for the PMU,
the proposed project would strengthen MOA's capacity for project management and coordination of donor-
financed TA activities. The PMU would be headed by a director at the level of Deputy Minister and staffed with
personnel who possess adequate technical and professional skills. In addition, a long-term resident advisor would
assist the PMU director for the duration of the project implementation. The necessary training in World Bank
procurement and disbursement procedures, monitoring, and evaluation, would be provided for PMU staff.
4.2          The main functions of the PMU would be the following:
(a) to ensure that project implementation is consistent with the stated project objectives and the eligibility
criteria for subborrowers and subprojects, and complies with the World Bank guidelines for procurement
and environmental impact;
(b) to coordinate inter-governmental activities associated with execution of the project and to liaise with the
APEX Unit (see para. 4.10) of BOL, MOF, and other relevant government and NGO agencies;
(c) to monitor PFIs and the Rural Business Development Center (RBC) to ensure that their activities are
consistent with the project objectives;
(d)  to compile necessary documentation for submission to the APEX Unit, to facilitate disbursements,
including submitting appropriate documents for replenishment of the Special Account;
(e) to coordinate, supervise, monitor, and evaluate all TA activities under the project, including finalization
of TORs; the coordination of contract tendering; and the selection of consultants;
(f) to prioritize TA requirements and to identify specific activities to be supported for the sector and program
future ones;
(g) to ensure that audits of the project account, accounts of the PFIs, and accounts of the RBC are carried
out according to agreements with the Bank;
(h) to prepare, with inputs from PFIs, the APEX Unit, and the RBC, semi-annual progress reports to be
submitted to the Bank in accordance with agreed reporting format and monitoring indicators; and
(i)  to assure that the project would be executed in conformity with policies established by the Government.
4.3          The joint Bank/EU PMU is already in place, in the Ministry of Agriculture. The joint Bank/EU
PMU would, in addition to the PADP, continue to implement the existing EU-PHARE and other donor financed

agriculture TA programs. Because effective project management is critical to the successftil outcome of the
project, PMU performance would be closely evaluated during project supervision, and any inadequacies identified
would be remedied. An agreement was reached at negotiations that the Government would maintain the PMU
for the lifetime of the PADP and take appropriate actions as may be needed from time to time based on regular
consultation with the Bank to strengthen the PMU as necessary.

Project Implementation                                                                      25
4.4          Each TA program of the Institutional and Human Resources Development Component (IHDC)
of the project would be implemented by a specific counterpart under the supervision of a relevant steering
committee (Table 4.1). The PMU would coordinate implementation and execution of the IHDC with donors and
the Bank. Under the parallel co-financing agreements, each donor (PHARE, Finland, and Sweden) would follow
its own rules and regulations regarding contracting, procurement, and disbursement. The Borrower, donors, and
the Bank would closely coordinate with each other during TOR preparation, short-listing, and selection of
consultants. Implementation of the IHDC would be jointly supervised by the Bank and co-financiers to the extent
possible, and all relevant communications, reports, etc., would be shared among all parties.
Rural Business Development Center (RBC)
4.5          The Rural Business Development Center would be established to provide support for newly
emerging rural business people and investors (see Annex 6 for details).
4.6          Ownership and Organization. Initially the RBC would be owned by non-governmental associations
(Associations of ACs and processing industries, and the Farmers Union, etc.) which would benefit from the work
of the RBC. The RBC would be guided by a governing board, consisting of members from the owners and project
beneficiaries. The RBC would be headed by a Lithuanian General Manager whose main task would be to ensure
that the RBC programn of activities and business plan, as agreed by its governing board, is implemented in a
professional manner. During the initial period of operation, the RBC would have a staff of about five to six
persons specializing in food marketing, financial analysis, and engineering. In addition, the technical assistance
program would provide long-term foreign consulting services to the unit, with focus on training the Lithuanian
staff in undertaking market and feasibility studies. EU-PHARE already has long-term advisors in place to support
the unit and would compliment these advisors with short-term consultants as specific needs arise.
4.7          Financing of Operations. The RBC would charge private investors for its services. However, full
cost recovery during the first and second year of operation is unlikely, since the RBC would also undertake
nonrevenue-generating public good activities. The Ministry of Agriculture has allocated counterpart funds from
the EU (up to LTL 800,000) during the initial years of operation to cover the gap between operating cost and
expected revenues.
4.8          Coordination of Rural Employment Generation Program. In addition to its main functions (as
in para 3.25), the RBC, in coordination with a pilot county government would assist the Swedish TA team's
effort in transforming alternative income/employment generating possibilities into concrete business plans. These
business ideas, once fully documented, would be forwarded to participating financial intermediaries (or other
banks) for possible funding. This pilot program is designed to link necessary support from the identification -
conceptualization stage to the final realization of the investment. Once the results of the first phase pilot program
are available, the scope and coverage of the program would be expanded to additional districts. Donors have
expressed interest in additional support for such an expanded program, pending the results of the pilot program.

B. CREDIT OPERATIONS'
4.9          Institutional Arrangements. The MOF, through the APEX Unit, would on-lend the credit line
funds to the ABL and other PFIs that would meet the eligibility criteria (para. 3.13). Conclusion of a Fiscal
Agency Agreement between the MOF and the BOL would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.10         The APEX Unit. The APEX Unit in the BOL, which is already in place, would manage
channeling of the credit line funds to eligible PFIs for a fee. PFIs would in turn extend subloans to ultimate
beneficiaries. The specific activities to be performed by the APEX Unit would include the following:
(a)  maintenance of the Loan Account, Special Account, and the consolidated Project Accounts;
(b)  consolidation of reimbursement applications received from the PFIs, through the PMU, submission of
withdrawal applications to the World Bank, on-lending and channelling of the Loan funds to the PFIs,
and maintenance of adequate records of all project related expenditures;
(c)  maintenance of the loan accounts for the respective share of the Loan on-lent to each PFI, and collection
of principal, interest and other charges, that are payable by the PFIs in accordance with the terms and
conditions stipulated in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements;
(d)  assurance of compliance with audit requirements in coordination with the MOF and PMU;
(e)  provision to MOF, the PMU, and the Bank of any information on the above activities according to the
agreed reporting format and requirement; and
(f)  The APEX Unit would work closely with the BOL's Bank Supervision Department in assessing the initial
and continuing compliance of participating banks with the Bank's eligibility criteria.  This
notwithstanding, final determination of bank's eligibility to enter and continue to participate in the PADP
would rest with the Bank of Lithuania Banking Supervision Department, subject to World Bank approval.
At negotiations, an agreement was reached that the Bank of Lithuania would maintain the APEX to carry out
the service arrangements described above and in accordance with the terms of the Fiscal Agency Agreement;
and that the fee payable to the APEX for its services would be 0.25% and would be reviewed semi-annually.
4.11         Subsidiary Loan Agreements. Each PFI would sign a Subsidiary Loan Agreement with the Apex
Unit on behalf of MOF, satisfactory to the Bank. This agreement would, inter alia, specify that the PFI would
do the following:
(a)  set own final on-lending rates to ultimate beneficiaries based on cost of borrowing and lending risks;
(b)  undertake lending operations in accordance with lending guidelines and procedures acceptable to the
MOF, BOL and the Bank;
Subsidiary Loan = Loan from the Ministry of Finance to a participating financial intermediary (PFI).
Subloan = Loan from PFIs to ultimate beneficiary (i.e. subborrower).



Project Implementation                                                                          27
(c)  submit to the Bank for prior review the first three subloan proposals, irrespective of the subloan size, and
any additional subloan proposal in excess of US $200,000 equivalent;
(d)  ensure that funds provided under project-financed subloans are used by the sub-borrowers for the
purposes intended and that appropriate procurement procedures are followed;
(e)  ensure and supervise compliance that sub-borrowers using project funds would comply with all laws and
regulations of Lithuania related to environmental protection;
(f)  supervise subprojects, as appropriate, and provide the APEX Unit, the PMU, and the Bank with periodic
reports on the status of subprojects and subloans, including information on loan recovery performance;
(g)  provide the APEX Unit, PMU, and the Bank with such information as they may reasonably request; and
(h)  maintain all necessary subproject and subloan documentation.
Conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the APEX unit on behalf of the MOF and at least one
PFI would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
4.12          ADpraisal Methodologv. Subloan applications for investments would be carefully evaluated based
on the submission of detailed feasibility studies. These studies would cover the following:
(a)   The technical feasibility, financial viability, and commercial soundness of the proposed investment.
Particular emphasis would be placed on assessing the marketing possibilities for the incremental
production of the subproject;
(b)  The economic justification of the proposed investment, including an assessment of the competitiveness
of the end-product compared to imports;
(c)   An evaluation of the proposed scale of the subproject, the need and adequacy of the civil works and
equipment to be procured, the location of the enterprise, its layout and design, and the estimated
investment costs in domestic and foreign currencies; and an assessment of compliance with pollution
control and other environmental protection guidelines set by the authorities; and
(d)  an evaluation of the sub-borrower's ownership structure (at least 51 % private), creditworthiness,
organization, management, and financial position, and an evaluation of the technical staff and know-how
available for implementing the subproject and its operation;
(e)  certification from the relevant local or national authorities that the proposed sub-project meets all
environmental laws and standards in force in Lithuania, and that no safety hazard or environmental
deterioration would result, directly or indirectly, from the investment sub-project to be financed under
the project.
4.13          Simplified appraisal procedures would be applied to subprojects with an estimated cost not
exceeding US $100,000 equivalent for replacement of machinery and equipment, or for modernization, expansion,
etc. These simplified procedures would include, as applicable:



28                                                                                                    Chapter 4
(a)  review and assessment of the viability and financial soundness of the enterprise and its capacity to service
the subloan; and
(b)  the technical verification that the equipment, materials, and spare parts to be purchased are appropriate
and are intended to be used in the existing production process to alleviate any existing production
bottlenecks, increase efficiency of the existing process, or contribute to improving quality and meet higher
product standards.
An agreement was reached at negotiations that PFIs would comply with the appraisal procedures as outlined
in paras. 4.12 and 4.13.
Terms and Conditions of Financing
4.14            Choice of Currency: The Borrower has decided that the Loan from the Bank would be a LIBOR-
based Single Currency Loan (SCL) in US dollars at the Bank's standard variable interest rate payable in twenty
years with five years grace.
4.15            On-lending Arrangement. The MOF, on behalf of the Borrower, would on-lend the proceeds of
the Loan to PFIs, through the APEX unit in the Bank of Lithuania (Para. 4.10), either in US or in local
currency, according to the demand for the respective currencies from the sub-borrowers, which are the ultimate
project beneficiaries. Final beneficiaries will make the repayments in the currency in which subloans were
denominated.
4.16            On-lending rates and Intermediation Spreads.  Agreed intermediation spreads are outlined in
Table 4.2 below. These spreads would be added to the Bank's variable interest rates for the different types of
single currency loans. The spread will be reviewed from time to time during project implementation. Such
reviews will take into account cost and risk considerations and the cost of borrowing.
Table 4.2: Intermediation Spreads
Transaction                          Proposed Spread (Percent)          Rationale
1. From MOF to APEX                  (a) 0.5 % for MOF                  To compensate the Government for the
(above the relevant Bank rate-para.  commitment charges and other
4.16)                              administration cost of the project
(b) 1.0 % for risk premium         To cover the risk of non-repayment by PFIs
2. From APEX to PFIs                 0.25%                              To cover the direct operational cost of the
APEX
3. From PFIs to Final Borrowers      Variable rate based on risk assessment    To maintain autonomy of PFIs to set final
and transaction cost               lending rates
4.17            The Bank has suggested to the Government that the 1 % spread (Table 4.2(1.b)) be placed by the
MOF in an escrow account similar to the one already established for the Enterprise and Financial Sector
Assistance Project (EFSAP). The escrow account would earn interest over the life of the Loan and would be used
to cover any defaults by PFIs in their repayment of principal and interest.



Project Implementation                                                                       29
4.18         Lending in Local Currency. The on-lending interest rate charged by MOF/APEX Unit to the
PFIs on subsidiary loans denominated in local currency would be variable, and would be based on GOL Treasury
Bonds rate (or other relevant reference rates to be agreed upon between the MOF and the Bank) - plus the
intermediation spreads as above. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risks on the portion of the
loan on-lent to PFIs in local currency and charge a margin adequate to cover these risks.
4.19         Terms and Conditions of Subloans to Final Beneficiaries. The PFIs would make subloans to
ultimate beneficiaries denominated and repayable in either Litas or US dollars, as determined by each sub-
borrower at the time of signing the subloan agreement with the PFI. Subborrowers would be required to repay
the subloan in the currency in which it was disbursed. The interest rates on subloans to be charged by PFIs
would be variable, and would be based on the cost of funds paid by PFIs (subject to periodic review as mentioned
above) and the spread determined by PFIs, which would be based on their risk assessment and lending costs in
each case. PFIs would have full autonomy in loan approval and would bear the lending risks. All interest rates
on subloans would be positive in real terms.
4.20         Repavment Schedules. Repayment schedules of funds on-lent (the "subsidiary loans") to the PFIs
would be based on the amortization schedule of the Bank loan. The subsidiary loans would be repaid over a
period not to exceed 15 years, including a grace period not to exceed three years. Repayment schedules of
project-financed subloans would have terms of up to 12 years, inclusive of grace periods of up to three years.
Grace and amortization periods would be based on the type of investment financed and the projected cash flow,
and would be commensurate with the repayment capacity of sub-borrowers. However, in no case would
repayment periods exceed the useful life of the investment financed. Any amount of principal repaid by sub-
borrowers to PFIs, which are not immediately needed for repayment of the subsidiary loan to the APEX Unit,
would be kept in separate rollover accounts (one account for subsidiary loans in US dollars and one for loans in
Litas) to be maintained by each PFI. Fund from this rollover account could be utilized by PFIs to finance
additional investments aimed at pursuing the objectives of the project, and which conform to the agreed terms,
conditions, and eligibility criteria for the project.
4.21         Subloan Processing and Administration. PFIs would be responsible for identifying prospective
sub-borrowers and for determining the type of subproject to be financed, and for following the eligibility criteria
for investments and subloan beneficiaries as described above. Subloan applications, farm plans, feasibility
studies, etc., would generally be prepared by subloan applicants with assistance of the PFIs' specialized
agricultural credit officers and, as appropriate, advisers of the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Services (LAAS),
in accordance with the PFIs' lending procedures and the arrangements for cooperation established between PFIs
and LAAS. For agro-processing, agro-services, and other rural enterprises, subloan applicants would prepare
subloan applications, feasibility studies, etc., with assistance by RBC as necessary, which would be appraised by
the respective PFI. In all cases, authority for subloan approval would rest solely with the PFI, which would have
full autonomy to approve or reject subloan applications.
4.22         At negotiations, agreements were reached on the termns and conditions of financing (para. 4.14-
4.21) including the choice of currencies, intermediation spreads, and on-lending terms and conditions.



30                                                                                   Chapter 4
C. ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT
4.23         The Borrower would be responsible for appropriate accounting for the funds provided by the Bank
under the project and for ensuring that audits of the project-related financial statements are carried out by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and submitted to the Bank. The APEX Unit, on behalf of the
Borrower, would establish appropriate accounting systems to provide information on the proper receipt and use
of the funds in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The accounting for all Special Account transactions and
for all other project-related accounts would be maintained in accordance with IAS. PFIs would maintain accounts
for subloans and retain all documents supporting procurement and disbursements.
4.24         Accounts of the APEX Unit relating to the PADP and accounts of each PFI would be audited for
each financial year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and audit reports would be submitted to the
Bank no later than six months after the close of each financial year. These audits would be in accordance with
IAS and would also conform with requirements of the MOF and the BOL. The audit of the APEX Unit accounts
would also include separate opinions, in accordance with Bank Guidelines, on the Special Account and Statement
of Expenditure. Audits of PFIs' accounts would include an opinion of the auditors on compliance by the PFI with
the provisions of the subsidiary loan agreement. At negotiations, assurances were obtained on compliance with
the accounting and auditing requirements in accordance with Bank guidelines.
D. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
4.25         The PMU, in cooperation with the PFIs, RBC, and the APEX Unit would be responsible for
monitoring and evaluating the impact of the project (see Annex 13). The PFIs would supervise the physical and
financial subproject implementation at the farm or enterprise level, and the economic and financial performance
of sub-borrowers through field visits and review of documents, invoices, financial statements, and key indicators
provided by sub-borrowers. The PMU would identify bottlenecks, problems, and constraints affecting project
implementation and the project's expected impact and results, and would take the remedial actions considered
necessary. The PMU would be responsible for ensuring that the PFIs and subborrowers adhere to Bank
procurement guidelines, and this would be monitored by Bank supervision missions. Training on Bank
procurement would be provided as necessary. The PMU would closely monitor the implementation of the
Institutional and Human Resource Development Component and keep the Bank informed of its findings and the
actions taken or proposed to be taken. At negotiations, an agreement was reached that the Borrower, with the
Bank, would carry out annual reviews of the PMU, APEX, RBC, and PFIs. Furthermore it was agreed that
the Borrower would bear the responsibilities for implementation and supervision of the TA activities in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank.
4.26         Based on information collected from the PFIs, RBC, and APEX Unit the PMU would prepare
semi-annual progress reports (end-June and end-December), which would be submitted to the Bank and the
Borrower within 30 days after the end of the period under review. These reports would include a copy of the
project Account, a summary statement of the financial status of the project and the Bank loan, procurement
activities, and a brief descriptive section on the physical implementation of subprojects and on the problems
encountered and remedial actions taken during implementation.
4.27         Implementation Completion Report (ICR). Soon after completion of the project, but no later than
six months after the closing date, the PMU, with collaboration of the MOF, the PFIs, RBC, and the APEX Unit



Project Implementation                                                                      31
would prepare and furnish to the Bank the required data, as would be requested and prescribed by the Bank, for
preparation of an ICR. Inter alia, the information to be submitted to the Bank would also include an assessment
of the performance of the various participating institutions and agencies in discharging their respective functions
and obligations under the project. At negotiations an agreement was reached on compliance with the reporting
requirements.
E. SUPERVISION
4.28         Due to the extensive TA in the PADP, supervision requirements are expected to be greater than
average. The proposed plan for project supervision by the Bank envisages at least three supervision missions
during each of the first two years after loan approval by the Bank, and two Bank missions in each of the
subsequent years. The skills mix of supervision staff would ensure an adequate presence of agriculturists,
agricultural economists, banking and agricultural credit specialists, financial analysts, and experts in Bank
procurement and disbursement rules and procedures. A start-up supervision and a project launch seminar is
planned immediately after signing of the loan. A midterm review would be carried out by March 31, 1998, at
which time an in-depth review of overall progress towards meeting project objectives would be made. Annex 12
describes the proposed supervision arrangements in more detail.
4.29         The Bank's supervision would focus particularly on reviewing: (a) PFIs' performance in project
implementation; (b) technical assistance activities financed by various donor agencies; (c) progress by PFIs' in
implementation of the overall institutional development program and its impact; (d) the performance of the APEX
Unit in BOL, the PMU, and the RBC; (e) the cooperation between the all PFIs and other agencies; and (f) the
coordination of project supervision according to the GOL's schedule as specified in the Project Implementation
Plan (PIP), attached as Part II of this report. Co-financiers would be invited to join the Bank supervision and
all communication included in the supervision/reporting would be exchanged between the Bank, co-financiers,
and the Borrower. In addition, Bank supervision would also review the performance of the agriculture sector
in general, GOL's progress in privatization, progress by Government in phasing out of subsidized credit, and
assess Government-supported programs for the agriculture sector and their impact on the sector and on the
project.
F. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
4.30         An environmental review was prepared for the proposed project consistent with the requirements
of Lithuanian environmental assessment legislation and the provisions of the World Bank. According to
Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment," the project has placed in environmental screening
category "B." The proposed project is expected to result in environmental benefits by supporting a series of
small-scale improvements in a wide range of agricultural practices, as recommended by the extension service,
LAAS.
4.31         The GOL has enacted the laws and regulations concerning sustainable agricultural practices,
including new guidelines on the use of pesticides. In order to respond to the increasing need for environmentally
sustainable agricultural practices, the MOA has recently established a Committee for Environmental Issues.
Among the first topics to be addressed is a comprehensive review of the implementation of the removal and
destruction of obsolete pesticides, and further review of the present list of approved pesticides. In this effort, the
MOA is following international standards including use of the World Health Organization classification.



32                                                                                       Chapter 4
4.32         The Ministry of Agriculture continues its support for farmer training and requires certification
of pesticide users, but this program is increasingly hampered by the high cost of protective clothing and the lack
of training material. Training is provided by LAAS, the Plant Protection Department, or local agricultural
schools. This year the Plant Protection Department has sent its first staff member overseas for training in
integrated pest management.
4.33          Environmental Screening and Review Procedures. Where applicable, investments financed under
the proposed project would require issuance of permits consistent with the applicable Lithuanian land use and
environmental procedures (see Annex 8). Because of the generally small size of investments to be supported
under the project, the primary responsibility for environmental monitoring for the project would rest with the
local governments. Few, if any, investments or special cases are envisaged that would require review by regional
offices. The basic procedures for screening of small-scale investments are well established and documented in
recent decrees and regulations (decree 87 of 12/17/90; regulations # 153-93 and decree 154-60 of 8/31/93). These
rules are mainly aimed at larger investments, but where applicable, the rules would be used to ascertain
consideration of proper environmental standards for preservation of the top soil, solid and liquid waste
management, and for proper management of drainage and runoff. The rules also cover assessment and
management of the impact of agricultural production-related investments (such as workshops and storage units),
on groundwater quality, trees, shrubs, and plant life, and wildlife and fish. These rules are also intended to
ascertain proper construction standards. All infrastructure investment lending under the project would require
permits.
4.34          Investments in, or near, protected areas would require special review in the regional offices of
the Ministry of Environmental Protection. Such special reviews include those made in the "intensive karst zone"
targeted by the Government for Ground Water Protection and Sustainable Agricultural Development (Birzai and
Pasvalys Districts).
4.35         The project would emphasize environmentally sound and sustainable agricultural development
through strengthening institutional capacity as follows: (a) strengthening of agricultural extension services,
including continued training of extension personnel, and subsequently farmers, in appropriate pest management
practices, including integrated pest management and proper handling of agro-chemicals; (b) providing advisory
services to the agro-processing industries that would stress the use of environmentally sound practices and
technologies; and, (c) training of personnel from PFIs in the environmental risk assessment of small-scale
investments in agriculture and agro-processing. An agreement on compliance with envronmental standards
acceptable to the Bank was reached during negotiatons.



CHAPTER V
BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION, AND RISKS
A. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATIONS
5.1          The project would contribute toward the creation of a sound rural financing system while
complementing the Bank's on-going effort in banking sector reforms. The project would, through
continuous policy dialogue and a wide range of technical assistance activities, alleviate key policy and
institutional constraints that hamper the adjustments necessary for complete transition to a market
economy.  The credit line provided under the project would finance private economic activity and
stimulate a supply response. Improved productivity and environmental management of primary and
processing enterprises are another consequence of the project, together with increased competitiveness
and enhanced marketability of Lithuanian products. Through a pilot program, the project would, at a
grass-roots level, provide support for identification of alternative income opportunities and the
corresponding training to pursue those opportunities. Such efforts would help combat the growing rural
poverty and unemployment which disproportionately affects women. After a successful pilot period, this
program would be expanded nation-wide. Other benefits include improvements in marketing capacity,
linkage between research and extension, and training in business and management skills.
B. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL EVALUATIONS
5.2          Consistency with the CAS. The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's overall
priorities for private and financial sector development strategies outlined in the CAS and as agreed with
the Lithuanian Government. Key sectoral issues and development strategies were identified during the
Bank's Agriculture and Food Sector Review', and have been incorporated in the project design.
5.3          Adeguate Polio Environment. Notwithstanding the remaining areas of required policy
reforms, the Government of Lithuania has made considerable progress both on macro-economic and
sector policy fronts (see Chapter 1 for more details) which in turn provides an adequate policy
environment to facilitate development of private activities in rural areas.
5.4          Alternative Options during the Transition Period. Perceptions of high risk in lending to
agriculture, inadequate institutional and human resources, and the remaining legacy of past interventionist
policies have prevented farmers and small-scale entrepreneurs from gaining access to commercial long-
term credit. A lack of lending skills and suitable long-term funds in Lithuanian banks has also aggravated
the situation. The project would provide interim measures to overcome these transitional constraints by
providing intensive institutional and human resource development TA support, in addition to long-term
credits and permanent working capital. Furthermore, TA for land reform efforts (the completion of
which would require many years beyond the project life) would expedite registration of land titles, help
create a mortgage system with more tangible collateral, and allow consolidation of fragmented farmland
through transactions in a land market. Therefore in addition to enhancing and demonstrating financial
viability of agricultural investment through technical and financial assistance, the project would reduce
the reluctance of commercial banks towards agricultural lending by improving collateral, and reducing

34                                                                                   Chapter 5
high transaction costs through training of loan officers and improving their risk assessment skills.
5.5           Economic Benefits. Given the nature of a line of credit operation, it is not possible, nor
desirable, to foresee the exact subprojects to be financed, therefore, it is not possible to estimate a
project-wide rate of return. According to the lending guidelines for PFIs, each loan approved would be
required to demonstrate adequate financial rates of return.
5.6           In addition to the built-in safeguards of the adequate financial viability which subprojects
must demonstrate, Lithuania is a low cost producer of most of its major agricultural products and
consequently agriculture shows good returns on investment. Each individual investment would be
evaluated for its repayment capacity and cash flows. Crop and livestock budgets have been prepared
for the most common crop and livestock production systems in Lithuania, under the assumption that
farmers would have access to credit to finance improved seeds, breeding stock, and other necessary
inputs, and farm management would improve with the help of extension services under the "with project
case. " Based on the above assumptions, "with project" per ha. net present values would increase by 10%
for rapeseed and up to 50% for potatoes. For livestock, net present value per animal would increase by
25 % for beef cattle and substantially higher, by 300 %, for dairy cows. Large incremental increases for
dairy cows and breeding sows illustrate that the potential gains are large, particularly for those farms
which currently have poor production conditions. In addition, integrated farm-models for typical farms
were developed and illustrate a substantial increase in farmers' income (by around 45% for typical
farmers and by 40% for large-scale private farmers2).
5.7           The actual economic benefit of the project would, however, considerably exceed what can
be quantified because of the systemic nature of the project, covering all aspects of the transformation to
a market economy, including the development of market institutions and policy reform. The size of this
overall economic benefit has not been quantified. However, results of the quantitative analysis of sample
subprojects and qualitative benefits stemming from the potential project, adequately justify additional
investment in the agricultural sector.
5.8           Reduction in Subsidies and Controlled Fiscal Impact. The Government, as the Borrower,
would guarantee the repayment of the investment credit line; and TA cost would be covered by donor-
financed grants. There are no other direct investments associated with the project. The project would
provide an opportunity to instill discipline, both in borrowers and financial intermediaries, and hence
enhance the financial viability of agricultural investment. This in turn, would broaden the tax basis and
increase revenues. The Government has decided that recapitalization funds for the ABL would be
diverted from the main source of subsidies, the Agricultural Support Fund, hence reducing direct
subsidies at the same time. The project would also provide an opportunity to reduce agricultural
subsidies, hence lessening a fiscal burden on the Central Government's budget.
5.9           Justified Role of the Government. Based on the current market failure which has caused
the absence of commercial investment credit to the agricultural sector, and the substantial need to
restructure both the financial and agricultural sectors, which requires a comprehensive policy reform, the
involvement of the Government is justified. The Government's involvement provides an opportunity to
reduce subsidized credit for the sector and commercialize rural financing. In addition, as the major
shareholder of the ABL, the Government's full commitment to restructuring the ABL and its endorsement
2      Based on 20 ha farm size for typical farms and 50 ha for large commercial farms.



Benefits, Justification, and Risks                                                       35
of the institutional development program for the ABL, are critical. Furthermore, the GOL's affirmation,
conveyed in a Statement of Policies, that it would ensure full autonomy of the ABL in its lending
operation and support transformation of the ABL into a commercial bank, would establish a solid
foundation for ABL privatization in the future.
5.10          Strengthening of Local Institutional Capacity. Local institutional capacity varies from one
institution to another. In general, capacity to implement and supervise the project is in place but needs
further strengthening. The project would provide substantial technical assistance for all relevant agencies
including the ABL, agricultural advisory services (extension), local consulting agencies, Land
Management Department, and agricultural colleges and applied research institutes. Comprehensive bank
strengthening support through twinning arrangements with major foreign banks would improve key
banking aspects of PFIs, including loan assessment, repayment and collection, resource mobilization and
financial planning. Lithuania has also enacted bankruptcy, collateral, and land laws. Although imperfect,
the legal and regulatory capacity is reasonably in place to foster private activities. The Government
continues to make efforts to strengthen its supervisory capacity through various technical assistance and
training activities.
5.11          Targeted Poverty Alleviation Support.  The proportion of the poor among project
beneficiaries is significantly larger than the national average. The Sector Review has revealed that the
average agricultural wage has declined from 97% of the national average in 1990 to less than 50% in
1994. Poverty is particularly prevalent in rural areas where very few income generating alternatives
exist.  The proposed project would assist the rural unemployed by helping them  identify new
opportunities, provide training in new skills for alternative income generating activities and business
planning, and by matching new business ideas with credit, where viability is demonstrated. They would
also be eligible to apply for loans under the project for starting new business.
5.12          Environmental Assessment of Subproiects. The project would enhance development of
environmentally sound and sustainable agriculture through institutional strengthening. Although the
project is rated "B" and has limited environmental impact, new lending guidelines for participating banks
would include an environmental assessment section and loan officers would be trained in environmental
review. The environmental screening procedures of the proposed project have been fully endorsed by
the Borrower and participating banks and are considered to be pragmatic approaches which are suitable
for Lithuania (Chapter 4, Section F).
C. RISKS
5.13          Since this is the first agricultural investment project supported by the Bank, MOA's
understanding of procedures and requirements of Bank financed projects is limited. Consequently, there
is a risk that project implementation may deviate from the original design and quality of project
implementation is less than expected. Close and frequent supervision by Bank missions would reduce
this risk. Another risk is the limited ability and experience of the financial institutions in Lithuania in
commercial lending, including loan evaluation and risk assessment. These risks will be mitigated by the
intensive technical assistance to be provided to the PFIs as part of the project. However, agricultural
production is inherently risky because of the nature of its production and climatic uncertainties. TA for
improving markets and technical information, as well as TA for improving farm business management,
would be designed to address these sector-specific risks.



36                                                                              Chapter S
5.14         As part of the ongoing efforts of the GOL to move to a market based, private agriculture
sector, the project obviously carries some risks; chief among them are: (a) recurrent macro-economic
instability; (b) possible political instability; (c) market and exchange rate fluctuations, particularly for
those investment subprojects with long gestation period; (d) weakness of the emerging financial sector;
(e) unfamiliarity on the part of the MOA with project implementation procedures, thus delaying the
project; and (f) financial risk inherent in new, private farming, i.e. farmers' limited capacity to repay
credit. The first two are beyond the control of the proposed project. Given a commitment by the
Government of Lithuania to continue economic reform, as evidenced by the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF) and the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), these risks would be somewhat mitigated.
The strengthening of financial intermediaries' institutional capacity to assess credit risks and market
analysis, as well as farm and business management advisory services, would counteract some market and
financial risks.
5.15         The Government is only gradually phasing out subsidized credit. There is a risk that it
would "crowd out" the Bank's credit line and other commercial credit. However, as subsidized credit
is purely for short-term working capital, and is limited in size and declining and benefitted only a small
number of beneficiaries, it is not expected to have a major impact on the proposed project. There is also
a risk that the Government could adopt policies that jeopardize its macro-economic stabilization by
increasing expenditure or decreasing taxation revenue, which would place upward pressure on the
inflation rate and jeopardize the functions of the Currency Board. Similarly, in response to rising
unemployment and the international uncompetitiveness of its exports, the Government could undertake
a devaluation of the currency or undertake protectionist trade policies that in the long run would hurt the
transformation of the agriculture sector. This could also jeopardize macro-economic stability. These issues
are addressed through the EFF criteria set by the Government in negotiation with the International
Monetary Fund and under the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan.

LITHUANIA
Private Agricultural Development Project
ANNEX 2: Land Reform and Privatization
Background
1.           The current land reform program in Lithuania has its roots in 1989 when it became
permissible for individual farmers to lease up to 50 ha of agricultural land on favorable terms. In 1991
a new land reform law was passed the prime objective of which was (a) to restore land and real property
rights to those who had owned land prior to 1940 and to their heirs; and (b) to privatize land that had
been held by collective farms. The land laws were further amended in 1993 and 1994 in the light of
experience with land restitution. A new draft law on land registration is now (1995) in preparation. A
law on mortgaging land was passed in 1992, but has not yet been implemented. A law governing physical
planning and development control has been drafted.
2.            The objective of the land reform program is to reestablish land markets and to put the
ownership of much of the land in Lithuania into private hands. Eight categories of land and property have
been recognized:
--   Public Buildings that will remain in public ownership.
-   Private buildings in urban and village areas.
-   Forest land that will remain in public ownership.
-   Farm and forest land that is subject to restitution or allocation and is mainly in plots of between
8 and 10 ha.
-   Land held in leasehold from the state.
-   Communal land around villages awaiting distribution in 2-3 ha plots.
--   Allotments owned by garden societies.
-   Garden plots with summer houses.
3.           Applications for land restitution or allocation are lodged at the local district or municipal
office. A preliminary decision on the validity of the application is made by the local subdistrict agrarian
reform board. If the application is in order, instructions are sent to field surveyors to carry out a
preliminary survey and mark out the area affected. The documents are then sent to the District Agrarian
Reform Board for approval. It may take anything from one month to a year before a decision is made.
If the application is accepted, the district land surveying board will carry out a preliminary registration,
and will enter the details in the District Office. The applicant must then arrange for a precise geodetic
survey of the property before a final certificate of ownership can be issued.
4.            The preliminary recording of title to summer houses with small gardens is expected to
be completed early in 1996 since estimates indicate that the majority have already been completed. The
conversion of these preliminary certificates of ownership into fully registered titles also depends on the
completion of geodetic surveys for which additional payment will be required. Many landowners appear
unwilling to incur this extra expenditure.

Current Status of Land Reform
5.            Land restitution and privatization have made substantial progress. As of January 1, 1995,
more than 130,000 private farm holdings have been established and together with about 2,300
Agricultural Companies, private farm ownership accounted for more than 50 % of the agricultural land
area. More than 1.2 million preliminary (or provisionary) titles have been issues, of which, about 46,683
have been registered with final titles. The status of land reform is sununarized below:

6.            Before the Second World War the average farm size was around 15 ha, with some farms
being 50 ha or more. The system of inheritance has therefore reduced the typical farm size by about half
since 1940. Whether the combination of market forces and an efficient land registration system will
necessarily lead to larger farms is not yet clear, since the formal farm land market is not yet in place.
Land cannot officially be sold until it has a final certificate of title.
7.            Approximately 400,000 families are awaiting the allocation of small area (2 to 3 ha) farms
that are essentially used for subsistence agriculture. Thirty-five thousand or about 8 percent have been
surveyed and a preliminary certificate of ownership prepared. Many of these personal cultivation areas
are at present made up of several scattered plots, which would be easier to farm and more efficiently
utilized for agricultural production if they were consolidated.
Government Objectives
8.            The Government of Lithuania wishes to speed up the issue of certificates of title to land,
to ensure that land dealings can be carried out in a timely way, and to facilitate the smooth and efficient



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                     43
operation of a land market. In order to achieve these aims, there must be focus on three areas: legislation,
management, and technical operations. There are thus three basic objectives.
9.           The first objective is to improve the legislative framework. Although much work has
already been undertaken in this regard and much is still in progress, additional technical assistance is still
needed with regard to the following:
Basic Land Law
Law on Land Registration
Law on Mortgaging
Law on Land Use Planning and Development Control
10.          The second objective is to help the National Land Survey become more financially
independent from central funds by clarifying the true costs of its products and services, identifying market
opportunities, and developing a strategy for moving toward full cost recovery.
11.          The third objective is to improve the technical operation of land registration by identifying
more precisely what data are required and how they may be effectively handled at the local level. The
emphasis will be on speeding up the handling of applications for first registration and on ensuring that
subsequent land transfers, including mortgage registration, can be undertaken speedily and efficiently.
12.          In order to assist the Government in achieving these objectives, TA program is being
designed to address the following:
(a) improve the legislation that controls the administration of rights in land and property,
(b) reduce the dependence of the National Land Survey on central government funds by increasing
its capacity for cost recovery,
(c) increase the efficiency with which applications for first registration are dealt with, and ensure that
the subsequent land market can operate effectively and speedily, and
(d) develop skills in managing cadastral data, including those derived from orthophotography.
Institutional Organization of Land Reform
13.          The administration of the land reform program is now the responsibility of the National
Land Survey, an agency formed in 1995 from the former State Land Survey Institute, the State Land
Cadastre Enterprise, and the Land Management Department of the Ministry of Agriculture. The National
Land Survey is answerable to the Minister of Agriculture. It has three main departments, one for Land
Management, one for Geodesy and Cartography, and one for the Cadastre. The Cadastre Department is
concerned with land information systems. The Land Management Department has three divisions dealing
with land management, land use, and land reform. At the local level, there are district agrarian reform
boards with subdistrict boards who do the initial processing of applications for land.



44                                                                                  Annex 2
14.          Land registration operates through 44 rural offices and 11 city offices where the bulk of
the processing of applications takes place. The system does not yet constitute a legally guaranteed registry
of land and property rights, although the basic structure could be adapted to this end.
15.          The system includes a thorough description and indexing of each parcel. It has the
capacity to incorporate ownership and other legal rights, including servitudes, and it is recognized by the
local people who have deposited their land claims there. Further legislation, however, would need to be
enacted to ensure that the accuracy of the records can be legally guaranteed, which would provide
security of title.
16.          The Ministry for Urban Development has prepared a draft law on territorial planning that
will control land use and land use rights in urban areas and on agricultural land that is just outside the
designated boundaries of the urban areas. The law has not yet been implemented.
17.          The Ministry of Justice prepared the law on mortgaging that was passed in 1992, but
which has not yet been implemented. The law was based on a much earlier law that predated the
command economy and proved inappropriate for modem financial services. A new law on mortgaging
is under consideration.
18.          The Ministry of Finance has been concerned with the development of land and property
valuation systems to support credit applications. The Ministry of Agriculture has been responsible for
developing a land registration system that could be used to guarantee credit. The creation of a Hypothec
Bank is currently under review. Draft legislation governing the valuation of real estate is being prepared
in collaboration with the Ministry of Justice.
Legal, Technical, and Management Issues in Implementing Land Reform
19.          Land reform in Lithuania was previously slowed by inadequacies in the legislative
framework, a lack of market orientation in the service provided, a lack of equipment (especially
computers) to process the applications, and burdensome administrative procedures.
20.          In order to facilitate the rapid launch of the land reform program and to restitute land
quickly, legislation was hastily brought forward in 1992. There was at the time a general lack of
experience in dealing with land law-few lawyers, for example, had been trained to deal with land
matters-and this resulted in defective and incomplete legislation. The land reformn program was seen by
officials more as an administrative exercise than as a legal framework that would support the operations
of a land market. As a result, the initial legislative framework was weak.
21.           This weakness was further aggravated by  a tendency for excessive caution. The
conversion of user rights and other preliminary certificates of ownership into fully registered titles
depends at present on the completion of geodetic surveys. These surveys are required as a result of
administrative edict, not by the Law on Land. Whereas the pursuit of excellence is understandable, this
requirement is adding significantly to the delays in issuing full title. Furthermore, it has resulted in
precise measurements being made to "correct" the size of plots that have already been set out, leaving
slivers of wasteland that are unused and unusable.



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                        45
22.           In addition, there is concern that once a title is issued, it cannot be changed through the
subsequent imposition of environmental controls. Thus, until new environmental and physical planning
regulations have been passed, great care must be taken by those in authority to ensure that the land is not
misused. While this is commendable, it tends to ignore the effects of market forces and the commercial
incentives for farmers to be more productive. Instead, it reinforces the "top-down" administration and
the emphasis on conformity with regulations.
23.           The land under preliminary title cannot be sold or mortgaged until it is accurately
surveyed means that formal land markets cannot develop, and land cannot move to its optimum use or
be reflected in its price. There is an inherent danger that informal markets will develop instead, and there
is some tentative evidence that this may be happening.
24.           The lack of unit cost data is an example of the producer-driven rather than user-driven
management techniques that operate within the National Land Survey. At present, the true overhead costs
of various activities cannot be determined. The fees to be charged for services appear to have been based
on intuition and judgment of what can be accepted and not upon any analysis of costs. There is an
understandable lack of business experience in running the organization, but if land registration is to
operate within a business environment, there must be a clearer understanding of the needs of the market
place and of the opportunities for full cost recovery.
25.           The present approach to surveying and mapping by state agencies is neither cost effective
nor market oriented. While all nations have found that the initial registration of title to land has to be
subsidized by the state, subsequent dealings can be made dependent on the user paying for the service.
Furthermore, most surveying and mapping agencies can recover significantly more of their costs from
the user community than they currently achieve, for example, through map sales and the provision of
services.
26.           The two major areas of land reform that have been causing concern are: (a) the restitution
of the standard sized (8 to 10 ha) private farms; and (b) the small area (2 to 3 ha) farms that are used
essentially for subsistence agriculture. From an economic perspective, priority in land restitution needs
to be given to the standard sized farms since registration should help increase agricultural production. A
secure title to the land together with a facility to use it as collateral should result in greater confidence
for creditors, increased investment, greater productivity and higher land values.
27.           There is, however, social pressure to speed up the restitution of the 2-3 ha farms. These
are used essentially for subsistence agriculture and allow families to become self-sufficient. In their
present form, they are unlikely to contribute to the improvement of the national economy. So far, some
35,000 or about 8 percent of these small farms have been surveyed and preliminary titles prepared. Many
are made up of several scattered plots that would need to be consolidated before they could become
economically viable. Land consolidation takes time and money and requires diplomacy, since there is a
need to obtain agreement to the new pattern of land occupation. There must also be agreement to any
charges or compensation that may be necessary to reconcile those who may be marginally better or worse
off as a result of the redistribution.
28.           On the technical side, two initiatives will speed up the process of land restitution. The
first is to improve office management techniques and procedures, especially in the district and city
offices, by increasing the computerization of the land records. These aspects are being addressed within
the PHARE LIS Project. This will also facilitate the workings of the formal land market as and when it



46                                                                              Anne 2
develops. There needs to be a clearer definition of what information is needed by the users. A proposal
for a formal study of user needs is under consideration by PHARE in Brussels. Whereas the government
has traditionally been the major user, much of the data that it has gathered in the past is no longer
needed, while new forms of data are necessary for the benefit of landowners. Thus, new cadastral plans
are now required both for indexing land parcels and for providing more detailed information about
individual plots. Computerization of the text (alpha-numeric) records is the first priority and
computerization of the cadastral maps will subsequently assist the development of the land information
system.
29.          The second initiative, whereby the issue of title could be speeded up, is in the production
of cadastral surveys. Although significant improvement would result from a more flexible legislative and
regulatory framework, there could still be avoidable delays. The EU-PHARE project is providing some
help in training field surveyors and thus expedite the preparation of detailed plot surveys. It is also
addressing the management and organization of the overall process to help identify and eliminate
bottlenecks in the methodology and ensure cost effective operation. The use of basic photogrammetric
techniques could also greatly accelerate the allocation of titles since photogrammetry is a mass-production
tool capable of achieving major economies of scale provided that reasonable standards of accuracy are
sought. In this respect, the proposed Swedish project on orthophotography should provide basic index
maps that would facilitate land allocation and recording.
Present Support for Land Reform
30.          This effort is being supported by a variety of international donors including the EU-
PHARE program, Sweden and the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
31.          The European Union (EU-PHARE program) is involved in technical assistance and
equipment procurement. Reprographic systems (photocopiers) for use in district and city offices have been
provided. Delivery of some 90 computers with associated modems, printers, plotters and software is
expected soon and tendering of modern survey equipments is now being undertaken by PHARE in
Brussels. Delivery of this equipment is expected in the first quarter of 1996. Training programs to
develop skills in information technology and to improve the national geodetic framework commenced in
March 1995. Approximately US$2 million of technical assistance will be delivered under this EU-PHARE
program, and EU-PHARE is considering the appropriateness of extending the work for another year in
order to further assist the implementation of the Private Agricultural Development Project and strengthen
the development of a land market.
32.          The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has been supporting the
Ministry of Justice in drafting a Law on Land. It has also been collaborating with the Ministry of
Agriculture in preparing a law on land registration. The work has been undertaken by a consultant (Mr.
Williamn Valletta) who has been providing expert advice.
33.          Denmark has installed some digital mapping equipment that should help with the
production of cadastral maps, and is providing ongoing training in its use. Advice on land matters has
been provided by Germany and Ireland, while the United Kingdom has supported the training of land and
property valuers. The Norwegian Government funded a pilot project to establish geodetic control and
produce cadastral maps using aerial photography in an area near Vilnius. The French company, IGN,



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                   47
have produced map extracts for cadastral use of an overlapping area using orthophotography as a
demonstration of their capability.
34.          Sweden has provided sundry inputs, including hardware, software, and ongoing technical
assistance for land administration. So far this has been worth about US$1 million. Swedesurvey has been
developing a land information system for storing and handling land-related data and has prepared the
outline for a continuation project. Support and training has also been provided for processing cadastral
survey and digital mapping data. A project to develop orthophotography in Lithuania is also being
conducted and the preliminary results are very positive.
35.          Switzerland has funded the supply of modem topographic digital mapping equipment and
training for the State Institute of Photography and Geodesy with a capital cost of around US $2.5 million.

LITHUANIA
Private Agricultural Development Project
ANNEX 3: Summary of 1994 Farm Survey
Introduction
1.           As part of the preparation activities for the Private Agricultural Development Project
(PADP), a survey of Lithuanian farms was undertaken during the summer of 1994 with the assistance
of the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS) and the Association of Agricultural Companies.
The conclusions reached on the basis of the survey results are presented in Section A below. Since the
survey was undertaken a number of changes have taken place in the agricultural and food sectors as the
market economy has continued to develop over the last twelve months. These are summarized in Section
B. A summary of the results obtained from the farm survey is presented in Section C.
A. Conclusions from the Farm Survey
2.           The survey confirmed that there were major structural problems in farm product and input
supply markets. The wholesaling-trading sector was largely nonexistent. Despite the dominance of the
old state processors, there are major opportunities for farmers and entrepreneurs to form new marketing
structures, such as auctions, wholesale markets, input supply and commodity trading cooperatives, and
small-scale processing plants. In so doing, many of the problems registered by farms can be alleviated.
This area should be a priority for any technical assistance.
3.           Some ACs were in very poor condition. Their collective-trained managers admitted to
a lack of appropriate skills and to a poor-quality work force. Technical and financial performance was
poor, and very little innovation was exhibited in marketing. Other ACs are, however, achieving better
results, even where traditional cattle and milk enterprises dominate. These ACs are generating large
cashflow surpluses. The key difference between the two groups seems to be the ability of the
management. There is a clear need for technical assistance to provide training for managers of ACs.
4.           A proportion of private farms show strong expansion and innovation characteristics.
These farmers, however, are mostly from technical backgrounds and lack financial experience and
business skills. These farms are a strong model for the industry as a whole and should be strongly
supported by direct training, where appropriate, and by advisory services with the ability to impart simple
business skills, marketing knowledge, and market information.
5.           In common with the developed rural economies of Western Europe, a large proportion
of private farms in Lithuania are operated on a part-time basis with many farm households dependent on
income from non-farm sources. It will be important that this is taken into account in the provision of
infrastructure and the delivery of extension services. There is also a clear need for further development
of non-farm employment opportunities in rural areas.
6.           The demand for long-term credit is difficult to assess accurately in a survey, but it would
seem to be a strong, given the correct conditions. There is a major lack of buildings, machinery, and



SO                                                                                 Annex 3
livestock on many private farms, and there is strong interest in processing and marketing developments.
Even if a small proportion of the investment intentions listed were to be extrapolated to all of Lithuanian
agriculture, this would suggest that the proposed $25 million to $30 million World Bank credit line should
be utilized, given the correct business environment.
7.           Most farms have little investment and bank experience. Widespread publicity and support
for the business planning and feasibility process is required. Technical assistance to achieve this would
have a beneficial impact on the success of the rural credit component of the Private Agricultural
Development Project.
8.           Almost half the land farmed by in the sample was leased on a short-term (1-5 years)
basis, often from a number of individuals. The results are short-term farming policies, a reluctance to
invest in land improvement, and widely dispersed, costly-to-operate units (even the average 3 ha plotter
had land spread over 0.9 km). Land reform developments should look first at easing land purchase and
second at the creation of a fixed-term tenancy option, which gives some security and a longer-term view
for both farmer and landlord.
B. Recent Developments
9.           The results of the farm survey were disseminated to interested parties in Lithuania,
including Ministry of Agriculture departments, the headquarters and regional offices of LAAS, the
Association of Agricultural Companies, the Institute of Agrarian economics, and the Agrarian Committee
of the Seimas. The implications of these results were further discussed in a number of working groups
and strategies for the further development of the market economy in the agricultural and food sectors
were developed.
10.          As a result of the lack of market intermediaries, two co-operative societies has been
established by individual farmers, other co-operative societies and a number of Agricultural Companies
in order to construct and operate two centers for the trading of agricultural inputs and outputs. One is
being established in the environs of the capital Vilnius and the other at Kaunas, a major town in the
center of the most productive agricultural land in Lithuania. It is expected that these markets will auction
some products whilst others will be traded by independent individuals or companies. It is also envisaged
that additional storage facilities are to facilitate will be constructed to facilitate trading activities.
11.          As detailed in Annex 7, as part of the Institutional and Human Resource Development
Component of the Project, Technical Assistance is to be provided for the development of marketing
institutions. The technical assistance will aid the establishment of auction and wholesale markets. EU-
PHARE and Finland have both indicated their willingness to support that Technical Assistance
programme.
12.          The lack of substantial change in the total number of Agricultural Companies masks two
processes that have been taking place since the summer of 1994. There has been a number of liquidations
of the least viable Agricultural Companies and while a number of others have been split into several
smaller units. These ongoing processes are leading to the restructuring of the Agricultural Company
sector and the demise of those that are least viable.



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development                                              5S
13.          A proposal for technical assistance to assist the Association of Agricultural Companies
in the training of its managers has been included in the Institutional and Human Resource Development
Component of the Project. The objective of the assistance will be to assist Agricultural Companies adjust
their operations so that they gain long-term viability in a market economy. Such changes are likely to
include adjustments in their ownership and management structures in addition to the identification of the
new opportunities that the development of the market economy will bring. Finland has indicated that it
would wish to support this important technical assistance programme.
14.          High priority has been placed on the development of alternative sources of employment
in rural areas. The Agrarian Committee of the Seimas is particularly aware of the need to reduce the
dependance of the rural population on traditional farm employment. They estimate that whereas currently
10 persons are employed per 100 hectares of agricultural land in the future the returns from farming are
only sufficient to justify 2 persons per 100 hectares. In addition, the LAAS has included the development
of advisory services for agro-tourism into its on-going plans and has advertised for a specialist in this
area. It is expected that such activities will be particularly important in the East of Lithuanian where the
conditions are less favorable for agricultural production. A Technical Assistance programme to aid the
development of alternative employment in rural areas has also been included in the Institutional and
Human Resource Development component of the PADP. This programme will be supported by the
Swedish government.
15.          Since October 1994, the LAAS has been receiving technical assistance support from a
team financed by EU-PHARE and the United Kingdom's Know-How-Fund. As part of these programmes
LAAS advisors have been receiving training on farm accountancy and farm business planning. The
advisors have as a result designed and started to implement appropriate training courses on these subjects
for farmers.
16.          Further technical assistance which would assist the LAAS develop the participatory
extension skills of its staff has been identified and included as a programme in the Institutional and
Human Resource Development Component of the PADP. In particular the programme is intended to
facilitate the two-way flow of information through the extension system. The Danish Agricultural
Advisory Center hopes to be able to provide that support.
17.          A center for the promotion of rural business is also being established by producer and
processor organizations. The main objective of this unit will be to support private investment in fann,
forestry, agro-processing and rural enterprises. As well as providing potential investors with the
assistance they require to soundly plan their investments, the unit will also play a crucial role in
promoting and stimulating individuals to actively develop their businesses. The unit will in addition
support the generation of rural employment and act as a counterpart for the technical assistance to be
provided by Sweden.
18.          In order to alleviate the constraints to the development of the land market EU-PHARE
has been providing technical assistance to the National Land Survey. The development of the Land
Information System is being undertaken together with the requisite training. The National Land Survey
is also being equipped with the survey equipment as part of this technical assistance programme. Despite
this on-going programme, it was determined that further support was required in order to assist the
development of a land market. Thus, technical assistance will be provided by Sweden to develop: the
legal framework for the trade in land; the financial independence of the National Land Survey; and to
improve the technical operation of land registration. These technical assistance will improve the

allocation of property rights and allow farmers to undertake longer term planning of their business
developments.
C. Summary of the Farm Survey
Sample Selection
19.          The sample consisted of 300 private farms and 50 Agricultural Companies (ACs).
Initially it was intended that random sampling techniques would be used to select the 300 private farms.
However, the absence of a consistent sampling frame precluded this and, consequently, LAAS advisors
attempted to use quasi-random techniques to select farmers within their regions while trying to ensure that
at least one third of respondents were not LAAS clients. The heterogeneity of the ACs and the smaller
sample size resulted in the adoption of a purposeful sampling technique for these farms, the intention
being to have broad coverage of the geographic, productive, and financial diversity of the ACs.
20.          The survey cannot therefore be regarded as fully representative of farming in Lithuania.
Indeed, the sample appears to contain a higher proportion of the larger private farms than in the
population. The survey does, however, give a strong indication of the structure and trends within
Lithuanian farming.
Agricultural Company (AC) Farm Systems
21.          ACs have certainly undergone major change since formation in 1992, losing roughly a
fifth of their land and employees (though over 70 percent lease land from private individuals ). However,
most are still managed by the old collective leadership with little change in management structure other
than a reduction in the number of specialists. The ownership of ACs is dominated by pensioners (52
percent of shares) and to a lesser extent workers (38 percent). This has contributed to overstaffing (only
8.4 hectares per employee), especially in the crop and machinery areas, despite large-scale mechanization.
22.           Given the correct incentives, there is ample room for technical improvement on ACs.
In general, ACs have adopted mixed farming systems with equal areas of crops and grass. Barley
dominates cropping and is largely consumed on-farm, though most ACs also try to grow cash crops (25
percent grow oilseed rape). Dairy cows and their progeny dominate livestock systems, and pigs are also
found on most units. However, stocking rates and crop and stock yields are roughly half of Western
European rates, and the levels of home-grown and purchased concentrate feed consumption are excessive.
Most ACs rely heavily on traditional enterprises with very few raising off-farm income. The exception
is machinery services, though this contributes little to total income.
23.           Some ACs were found to be generating very large cash surpluses. There was not,
however, a strong correlation between the size of the net cashflow with the farm enterprises pursued
although those with wheat, pig, sugar beet and unusual (e.g. fur) enterprises tended to have larger
positive cashflows. Some ACs where traditional cattle and milk enterprises dominate also had large
positive cashflows. In contrast, other ACs had large negative net trading cashflows. These ACs tended
to have high fixed costs, especially for repairs and contracting. The key determinant between those ACs
with positive and negative net trading cashflows would seem to be the managerial ability.

24.           While, the average AC balance sheet looks strong its debt is not large and is mostly low-
interest, short-term government credit. However, the large buildings and machinery inventory are
undoubtedly overvalued, and some debts may not be recoverable.
Private Farm Systems
25.           Private fanrs were analyzed as three separate groups:
(a)     "Eighty-niners" (89ers) are those farms in production since the first privatization in 1989.
(b)    "Restitution Farms" are those farms of more than 3 hectares that started production after 1989.
(c)    "Plotters" are farms of less than 3 hectares.
26.           In addition, these three groups were split into two subgroups that represent Lithuanian
Advisory Service clients and non-clients.
27.           Most private farmers, other than 89'ers, have been farming for less than three years.
Most came from technical backgrounds on collectives or related organizations, and the restitution sample
included significant numbers of pensioners (13 percent) and women (23 percent). All groups leased a
substantial proportion of their farmed area on a short-term basis (1-5 years). The vast majority (84
percent) of farmers with restituted land have obtained title to their land' although the proportion of
plotters with title is less than 50 percent.
28.           On average, private farms follow farming policies similar to those of the ACs with a
mixture of livestock and crops dominated by dairy cows, barley, and grazing pasture. However, overall
private farms claim yields well above those of ACs. Compared to ACs, private farmers tend to grow
a greater area of cash crops and tend to sell their beef calves for fattening. The latter is likely to be due
to a lack of buildings and capital. Some restitution farmers follow less intensive systems because they
lack experience, or they farm on a part-time basis. While plotters primarily farm on a subsistence basis
with crops and stock to meet the needs of the household, some are developing intensive vegetable or
poultry production.
29.           LAAS clients were found to be the farmers with the largest farms and although this could
be a result of the sample chosen, it does conform to results from other countries. In addition, it appears
that LAAS clients grow more cash crops (especially oilseed rape) and use more agro-chemicals, and claim
to achieve higher yields than non-clients of LAAS. Of course, one can only speculate as to whether it
is being LAAS clients that results in these farmers' achieving better yields. It could be the case that
better farmers, who achieve better yields, are also more aware of the need for information and hence
become LAAS clients.
' Although information from the National Land Survey would indicate that this is preliminary
title.

30.           Private farming tends to be undertaken on a family basis and few have employees. On
average, private farms also have fewer (family and hired) workers per hectare than ACs. This is despite
the small size of the private farms and is another reflection of the overstaffing of the ACs. Few farms
have staffing levels which approach the low staffing levels of Western European farms. Much of the
work force is part-time. Off-farm jobs, non-farm businesses, and contracting are common sources of
external income. A third of restitution farms obtain a quarter of farm household income from pensions.
Nevertheless, around 80 percent of income for most private farms comes from traditional enterprises.
The plotters, however, raise only 40 percent of household income from their land.
31.           A relatively high proportion of the private farm crop area receives agro-chemicals, despite
low yields, though fertilizer application rates are half those of European Union (EU) levels.2 Contract
machinery services are widely used by the smaller and newer farms. Contractor rates and fuel and repair
costs per hectare are once again about half those of West European levels. Restitution farmers are most
active in machinery purchasing to tool up their new units, while the well established 89'ers are most
active in building improvement.
32.           Private farm balance sheets look strong. Some fixed assets may be overvalued, but
liabilities are well covered by current assets and livestock values. The smaller farms tend not to carry
debt, but rely instead on family loans and private sources.
Business Environment
Prices
33.           Grain prices received by farmers are very low even compared with the border prices.
Barley at $60 per ton is around $20 less than the border price. However, milk prices are worse; they
are only approximately two thirds of the Polish prices. Although low by Western European standards,
the beef price is comparable to the Polish price.3 Only pigs and horses come within striking distance of
Western European prices. Rye and wheat prices would seem to be dropping while most others are now
stabilizing. Sugar beets and potatoes were the only bright points in 1993.
34.           Input costs are increasing, but are generally less than half EU levels with the only
exception being diesel fuel. Labor is very cheap (the average quoted by ACs is $11 per week). In order
to overcome the liquidity constraint barter is widely used. This is, however, usually only for small
quantities of seed, fertilizer, and feed.
Markets
35.           The old state processors dominate the markets for most products. ACs are most reliant
on these outlets, while private farms have been able to exploit a greater range of outlets and niche
2 It should of course be noted that the application of fertilizer within the European Union is
artificially inflated by the use of costly agricultural policies which distort the allocation of
resources both within the European farm sector and internationally.
3 Both the milk and beef prices, however, are around 25 percent of EU levels.



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development                                               55
opportunities, especially in selling pigs, cattle, milk, and potatoes. Home consumption (household and
stock feed) is important on all farms. A third of the private farm and over 60 percent of the AC grain
crop is fed on farm. There are new processor outlets appearing, especially in the meat industry, but the
wholesaling-merchantry sector is almost nonexistent. Meanwhile local village and town markets and
direct sales to consumers can only cope with small volumes. Despite the popularity of barter, the volume
of production exchanged is almost negligible.
Marketing Problems
36.          Poor prices and delays in payment from monopolistic buyers are the major problems for
almost all farmers. New farms also lack the storage buildings and transport, which are essential tools
in a market with limited outlets. Quality of product and packaging would seem to be greater problems
for ACs than for private farms.
Physical Problems
37.           Marketing problems are listed as the biggest physical constraint, including a lack of good
financial and marketing advice. Private farms have a major lack of building capacity and either a lack
of machinery or problems with the cost of machinery operation due to unreliability and unsuitability.
Many new farms have no buildings and little machinery.
38.          ACs, however, list problems which partly relate to an inability to cope with scale.
Machinery is a problem, but the poor quality of the work force, poor crop and stock performance and
inappropriate skills and knowledge are also problems. AC managers feel they are lacking in all the most
important aspects of their job.
Financial Problems
39.           Financial problems basically mirrored the problems highlighted earlier: selling prices,
input prices, and getting paid. Short-term credit is not a problem (the Government has supplied it at
subsidized rates), but the lack of long-term credit is a problem for two thirds of 89'ers, a third of
restitution farmers, and half the ACs. Most plotters are not interested in long-term debt.
Farm Development Opportunities
40.           The view of opportunities is much broader than that of problems. Private farms look to
expansion in yields, area, and new crops or livestock. ACs have a much different view looking toward
more efficient use of inputs and, in two thirds of cases, to new processing and marketing enterprises.
While this matches their marketing problems, it will require both investment and management training.
It should be noted that despite their small scale, half the 89'ers and a third of restitution farmers are also
interested in processing and marketing enterprises.

41.           The private farm and AC survey highlighted investment intentions within the sample,
given suitable conditions, of LTL 83,870,950 ($20,967,737). This is a very substantial sum, but caution
must be applied in its interpretation. Despite the fact precise instructions were given to the AC managers
and LAAS advisors undertaking the survey, farmers may have listed investments that they are unlikely
to undertake, first to show they do not lack ideas, second to collectively ensure that proposed World Bank
assistance is not discouraged, and third because they simply have not thought through the feasibility of
their proposals.
42.           Investment intentions roughly match problems with private farms wishing to acquire
buildings (including houses), machinery, and land. Processing ideas are few, but would account for large
sums of money. The ACs mainly wish to invest in equipment and existing enterprises. However, 27
percent would like to invest in processing or non-farm developments, including four large meat
processing enterprises.
43.           In relation to farm size, the average investment planned by ACs, at LTL 862,000, is
small compared with that planned by private farms (LTL 146,030).
Source of Investment Funds
44.          The majority of farmers would prefer to use their own cash reserves, closely followed
by long-term commercial loans. However, some ACs noted that private investors were a potential source
of investment funds.
Previous Borrowing Experience
45.           A large proportion (60 percent) of commercial farmers have borrowed in the past, but
this was mostly government credit. The private farmers with larger well-established farms are willing
to put up land and houses as collateral, and family guarantors could be found in over 50 percent of cases.
Infrastructure and Support
Financial Experience
46.           Private farms usually have a bank account (but it is not easy to use because of the distance
to the bank), and around half keep rudimentary financial records, but few have ever prepared a cash flow
statement. The sample on which this survey was based, probably, consists of individuals who are much
more financially aware than the average farmer.
47.           The managers of ACs keep full financial records. Twenty-nine percent have received
business plan training, but few have used it. Seventeen percent have made a commercial loan application.
Availability and Use of Support Services
48.          Most services are available in some form, though specialist advisers and the wholesale-
trading-input supply complex are deficient. Only 18 percent of private farms were members of
cooperatives.

Investment Support
49.          The technical support required by each type of farm matched what the farmers saw as
their problems and investment opportunities. The greatest need overall, however, is in the preparation
of business plans. Private farms would prefer this support in the form of advisory visits and written
material, while ACs prefer training courses after which they could prepare their own plans.

required to maintain a capital adequacy ration of 13%, based on financial statements prepared under
local accounting regulations. Based on these rules the Agricultural Bank reported a risk weighted
capital of 12.8% as of December 31, 1994. Provisions for loan losses, calculated under the local
accounting regulations amounted to LTL 110.0 million, whereas provisions at December 31, 1994, as
assessed by international auditors according to IAS, amounted to LTL 243.7 million.

LITHUANIA
Private Agriculture Development Project
ANNEX 5: Institutional Development Program for the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania
Introduction
1.           Before the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL) can function as a financial intermediary
for onlending of World Bank Private Agriculture Development Project funds to individual farmers,
agricultural companies, agro-processing, agro-services and other rural enterprises, a major institutional
strengthening needs to take place. Subloans, made under the World Bank project would finance both
investments and incremental working capital and repayment terms would be short, medium or long-term,
depending on the purpose of the loan, the projected cashflow and borrowers' repayment capacity.
2.           The main focus of the technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the consultants would
be directed towards the operation of ABL; however, all the outputs produced by the consultants
(operational guidelines, procedures, loan application and other formats, training material, etc.) would be
made available to other financial institutions (PFI) participating in project implementation. These PFIs'
agricultural credit officers and other senior staff (including branch managers) would be invited and
encouraged to participate in training courses, seminars, and similar activities that will be conducted by
the consultants.
3.           With the ABL management's firm commitment to engage in a financial restructuring and
a comprehensive institutional development program, the Institutional Development Program for the ABL
has two parts: (a) to improve rural credit operations; and (b) to strengthen the ABL's institutional
capacity in principal banking areas. The IDP is planned to be implemented over two years; EU-PHARE
would manage the contracting and selection of a twinning partner, the actual work on part (a) has already
started and part (b) is scheduled to begin early 1996 and completed in two years. At completion of the
first two year program, if additional TA is necessary, additional donor financing would be sought at that
time.
(a)    Rural Credit Operation would introduce improved rural credit lending guidelines and procedures,
prepare new lending manuals and train loan officers. This work has already begun and the first
set of activities is expected to be completed by early Spring 1996. It is expected that the new
lending guidelines would be applied to the entire ABL lending and not restricted to the Bank
credit line.
(b)    Comprehensive Institutional Development Program includes twelve key banking areas to be
supported as folloWs:
*     Planning, Budgeting and Performance
*     Measurement Process
*     Organizational Restructuring
*     Human Resource Management
*     Marketing
*     Credit Management



64                                                                               Annex 5
*     Branch Management
*     Asset and Liability Management
*     Accounting
*     Management Information System
*     Information Technology
*     Internal Audit
4.           In order to assess progress of the IDP, a set of indicators for each key area of IDP has
been developed and would be monitored closely during implementation. The indicators are categorized
as: (a) financial indicators; (b) government indicators; (c) management indicators; and (d) process
indicators.
5.           Although the technical assistance to be provided by the consultants under Para. 3 (a)
above is closely linked to the project, it is intended that the revised and improved lending and loan
servicing procedures would not remain project specific only and that ABL would apply the improved
procedures for all its lending operations.
6.           It is envisaged that lending operations under the project would start in a limited number
of branches that will be selected by ABL management, in conjunction with the consultants, and be staffed
by loan officers and their supervisors, who have already participated in the initial training activities and
have become sufficiently familiar with the revised lending guidelines and operating procedures introduced
by ABL upon recommendation of the consultants. These branches would serve as pilot branches to test
the new procedures, provide feedback on credit demand, borrowers' opinion on lending terms and
conditions, as well as on loan application and other information requirements, etc. After fine-tuning, and,
if necessary, modifying the operating procedures, and after training of additional loan officers and their
supervisors, and training of trainers, ABL management will increase the number of branches that will
participate in lending operations financed under the project.

ANNEX 6: Rural Business Development Component (RBC)
The Need
1.            The changing economic environment in Lithuania has resulted in significant changes in
rural employment structures. As larger agricultural entities privatize and increase their efficiency, excess
labor has been forced to seek new employment. Similarly, the emerging private farming system has
resulted in smaller family farms, which in some cases are too small to generate sufficient revenue to meet
family expenses. Yet there are very few alternative sources of employment in rural areas. In a more
mature economy, some of this growing rural un- and under-employment would be absorbed by emerging
entrepreneurial business opportunities in providing agricultural services and product processing to the
remaining, more efficient, agricultural producers. Other small business opportunities to take advantage
of rural craft-making abilities, and other skills in the rural population would also arise. Yet this is not
happening in Lithuania because the expertise, support systems, and business development services are not
yet in place to nurture this process.
2.            Experience shows that agencies providing business support can have great success in
fostering indigenous enterprise and nurturing new businesses through the critical first few years. The
skills required in such agencies extend far beyond the standard business consulting functions. First, such
agencies must adopt a pro-active approach - if they do not, potential business opportunities are lost either
through the inability of untrained individuals to express them clearly, or through the fear that they will
not be taken seriously. Second, the agencies must have a sound ability to recognize potentially viable
projects based upon incomplete information or conversely, to screen out business ideas that have little
or no chance of success. Staff seconded from successful businesses are crucial in order to fulfill this role.
Third, the agency must act as a facilitator, drawing together individuals with the appropriate skills to
support the development of specific business proposals. Such individuals may include those with the
skills required to judge market potential and technical feasibility, as well as those that can assist
businesses in undertaking financial analyses and preparing marketing strategies. Since different business
proposals would require different expertise, rarely would such an agency maintain all the skills in-house.
Extensive contacts are therefore vital to the operation of the agency.
3.            Because there are no organized structures in place to link up excess rural labor with
potential rural business opportunities, an attempt was made to identify possible information and assistance
sources for rural entrepreneurs and private farmers in the forn of a survey of Lithuanian agricultural and
business consulting companies and services. The survey identified the following entities with the potential
to eventually assist private farmers and rural entrepreneurs; the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service
(LAAS), the Innovation Center at the Lithuanian Agricultural Academy, 15 small companies, several
large international consulting companies, and the European Union (EU)- supported Business Centers.
A thorough analysis of the services provided by these organizations revealed that major gaps exist in the
provision of consulting services to private farmers, small-scale agricultural service and supply
organizations, and agro-processors.



78                                                                                    Annae 6
4.            While the LAAS is rapidly developing its capability in farm record keeping, financial
analysis, and feasibility study preparation, the advisors still suffer from having little or no experience in
business development (especially in food processing), and an almost total unawareness of the importance
of marketing. The academic staff of the Innovation Center are technically trained and have little business
experience, particularly in dealing with the needs of small rural entrepreneurs. In addition, the future role
of the Innovation Center under its new management is unclear. The 15 small consulting companies have
indicated that they have little or no specific interest or experience in agriculture or the food industry, and
the limit of US $250,000 on the size of loans to a single sub-borrower (a condition of the Private
Agriculture Development Project) makes their involvement in potential subprojects to be financed from
the line of credit unattractive. The larger international consulting companies remain uninterested for the
same reason. The EU Business Centers have identified their priority areas as being non-farm trade and
commerce, and they lack agricultural and food business infornation or experience.
The Rationale for a Rural Business Development Center
5.            The Rural Business Development Center (RBC) was conceived as a key link in developing
rural entrepreneurship, orienting the existing private business consulting sector towards rural business
consulting, and identifying business opportunities for the un- and under-employed rural population. The
RBC is envisioned as a catalyst in directing existing private structures, and the creation of new private
enterprises, to absorb excess rural labor, while at the same time directing that labor into providing
services needed by the rural population. The RBC would not supplant or compete with existing public
or private structures addressing rural employment opportunities, but rather complement these existing
efforts by serving as conduit to existing services so that they can better fulfill their mandates. As a nexus
for rural business development, the RBC would closely interact with public and private entities in the
following manner:
6.            Creation and Evaluation of Coherent Business Plans and Feasibility Studies. As the
Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs) of the PADP would bear full lending risks of any loans they
make, they can lend only on the basis of strict commercial criteria. Foremost among these criteria is the
expected ability of proposed investment to generate sufficient revenue for entrepreneurs to meet interest
and repayment obligations. But in order to convince the PFI loan officers and/or commnittees that
proposed investments meet these criteria, entrepreneurs would need to demonstrate that their proposals
are well conceived and based on technical feasibility, sound procurement practices, and fill a market need
in the supply of goods or services demanded by consumers. The RBC would help potential borrowers
articulate and create business plans which could meet PFI lending criteria.
7.            Identification of Additional Business Development Resources. Once a potential business
opportunity has been identified and adequate business planning and feasibility of implementation has been
assured, the RBC would assist the client in identifying public and private resources which could help the
client develop market strategies (information and research, product or service positioning) and is familiar
with the client's local market. The RBC would maintain a list of "RBC approved" business development
consulting firns which can help RBC clients at this stage. More sophisticated rural entrepreneurs or
those with adequate financial resources could also use the RBC's referral service to find private sector
assistance in maximizing their businesses' potential.
8.            Strengthening of Local Consulting Companies. The existing consulting companies in
Lithuania (about 15) are at present working primarily with the large restructuring projects linked to the



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                     79
former state enterprises; they have limited experience in dealing with small agro-industrial projects. In
addition, according to the aforementioned survey, their interest in handling relatively small projects is
low, because of the relatively small fees for these types of projects. During the early years of the project
implementation and until local consulting companies are better trained, the RBC would provide consulting
services directly to the project beneficiaries (clients). In addition the RBC would prequalify local
consulting companies according to criteria to be established by its governing body. It would train a
number of preselected consulting companies in the preparation of business plans, feasibility studies, and
market surveys; and would encourage these companies to get involved in small investment projects.
Participatory training materials are being developed, and the first training course for potential
entrepreneurs has already taken place in spring 1995. In addition, technical assistance programs would
be undertaken to train managers of ACs, as well as other entrepreneurs, in methods to evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of their businesses and in the skills to implement required changes and in the
management of investments financed under the project. The RBC would also have a clearinghouse role
as a resource reference center for information on marketing, technology, pricing data, foreign contacts,
links to other consulting groups, and public assistance for small businesses.
9.           Rural Employment Generation Component.  The Swedish TA program  for rural
employment generation would use the RBC as a conduit in helping determine the pilot district (out of ten
districts in Lithuania) for intensive entrepreneurial guidance, and the RBC would assist participants in the
pilot program with business plans and feasibility studies.
10.          Identification of Potential Rural EmDloyment or Business Opportunities Based on Local
Needs. Based on its interaction with public and private organizations concerned with rural employment
and rural entrepreneurs, the RBC would be in a unique position to identify areas in which certain services
and products are lacking - by locality and by sector. RBC could then help match existing needs in certain
localities with entrepreneurs willing to satisfy those needs.
RBC Organization and Structure
11.          While organized as a joint-stock company, the RBC would operate as a non-governmental
organization. Ownership would be in the form of share subscription. In order to ensure the accountability
of the RBC and that its services meet the needs of its clientele, the RBC would be partially owned
(roughly 20%) by the producer organizations such as the Association of Agricultural Companies, the
Farmer's Union, and milk, meat, and feed associations. The RBC operating strategy would be set by
a board of directors that would represent the ownership of the organization and the clientele. The Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) of the RBC would be responsible to the Board for the day-to-day operations of
the unit. The RBC would not be a large costly organization but rather a flexible dynamic team that could
respond to the changing needs of its client base. Consequently the RBC would initially have a small staff
of approximately five Lithuanian professionals and a maximum of two office juniors as support staff.
12.          The development of the business advisory role of the RBC would be assisted by foreign
consultants provided under donor grant-financed technical assistance. The technical assistance shall assist
the RBC develop its operational procedures and techniques; perform on the job staff training and training
by example; and assist the CEO in developing appropriate management systems.
13.          Operational Modalities. The RBC would charge private investors for its services.
However, full cost recovery during the first and second year of operation is unlikely, since the RBC



80                                                                            Annex 6
would also undertake nonrevenue-generating public good activities. Therefore, the Ministry of
Agriculture has agreed to use counterpart funds from the EU-PHARE grain sales to cover the gap in
operational expenditures.

ANNEX 7: Summary of TA for Institutional and Human Resources Development Component
TERMS OF REFERENCE
Detailed Terms of Reference for these technical assistance programs are available in the Project files.
Brief summaries of the programs are presented below.
Land Reform
1.           The Government of Lithuania is committed to the process of land reform initiated in 1991
the objectives of which are to restitute the ownership of land to those who owned it (or their heirs) prior
to 1940 and to privatize the land that had been farned by the state and collective farms.' However,
progress on land reform has been hampered by Lithuanian legislators' inexperience of land law and a lack
of equipment. Bilateral and multilateral aid is helping the Lithuanian National Land Survey to overcome
these problems. However, the development of a land market in Lithuania is still constrained by the
legislative framework, the lack of appropriate administrative procedures and experience (particularly in
risk management and cost recovery) and the need for the further development of a single land registration
system that contains all the data required to legally guarantee land transactions. The following Technical
Assistance Programs shall therefore be undertaken.
(a)    Legislative and Administrative Development: To foster the development of a land market in
Lithuania by the provision of specialist assistance for the further development of applicable
legislation and administration systems, increasing the efficiency of the system, the development
of skills in the management of cadastral data and increasing the capacity for cost recovery.
(b)    Land Information System: To continue the on-going development work on the land information
system required to legally guarantee land transactions
Extension System Development
2.           In response to the changing structure of the agricultural sector resulting from privatization
and the move to a market economy there has been a need to transform and improve the advice given to
farmers. The Ministry of Agriculture together with the Farmers Union and the Association of Agricultural
Companies jointly established the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service (LAAS) to meet this
challenge. LAAS has been receiving technical assistance from multilateral (PHARE) and bilateral donors
(notably the British Know-How-Fund and Denmark amongst others) which previously included much of
the physical infrastructure required to equip LAAS and is now providing staff training in extension
methodology and techniques. This has allowed the service to rapidly develop its activities. However, the
extension service is just one component of the extension system which includes the research and
educational organizations as well as the Ministry of Agriculture itself. A principal role of these
I     Certain of the state farms will be maintained in public ownership for research purposes.



82                                                                                 Annex 7
organizations is to pass to the extension service relevant information for dissemination to farmers. In
order that the information is relevant these organizations need to respond to farmers' needs. The
following technical assistance programs shall be undertaken to assist them achieve this.
E-01 The Further Development of the Census of Fann Businesses: To reduce the cost of
undertaking the Institute of Statistics' census of farm businesses so that it may be
undertaken on an annual basis.
E-02 The Development of a Survey of Private Farm Accounts: To implement a survey of
farm accounts that is broadly compatible with similar surveys used in market based
economnies.
E-03 Survey of Farmer Opinion. To provide information on the opinions and perceptions
of farmers and thereby aid the monitoring and evaluation of the Private Agricultural
Development Project.
E-04 Ministry of Agriculture Management Training: To facilitate the adaptation of the
Ministry of Agriculture and related institutions to their new role of fostering a
competitive market based economy.
E-5O Flexible Extension System Development: To further the development of the whole
extension system by facilitating the two-way flow of information through the system so
that it meets the need of farmers.
Marketing
3.           The development of domestic and export markets for the output of the Lithuanian
agricultural and food sectors is especially constrained by two factors. First, primary agricultural producers
(farmers and Agricultural Companies) face great difficulties in finding markets for their products. There
are a variety of reasons for this including oligopolistic agro-processing industries and the lack of
agricultural and food distribution systems based upon market institutions. Second, that executives in
agricultural and food processing companies have little experience of the need to adjust production
activities so that the output produced meets the needs and wants of consumers while achieving the
objectives of the firms. The latter constraint is one of the reasons for the large imports to Lithuania of
processed food products (although until recently this was also encouraged by the policies that limited the
size of the mark-up on domestically produced food products) and the poor export performance of
processed food producers. In order to alleviate these constraints and improve the export performance of
the industry, the following technical assistance programs have been identified.
M-01 Farm Level Marketing-The Development of Marketing Institutions: To assist the
creation of a decentralized market economy through the development of Lithuanian
experience in the establishment and operation of agricultural market institutions.
M-02 Agricultural Market Education: To assist participants in the agricultural markets
develop their experience of the determinants of market prices including the effects of
product quality and location, and the causes of price movements in the short, medium and
longer terms.



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                                        83
M-03 Food Marketing Training Courses: To improve the marketing abilities of those
involved in the production and sale of processed agricultural products.
Export Development
M-04 Trade Information Development: To assist the Agricultural Trade Agency, to be
established by the Ministry of Agriculture, create a service for the collection, processing,
storage and dissemination of trade data.
M-05 Product Workshops: To improve the export performance of the agricultural, food
and fishery sectors of the Lithuanian economy.
M-06 Export Promotion: To assist the development of Lithuanian skills in the production
of export promotional material and the undertaking of an international trade mission.
Business Skill Development
4.            The success of the credit component of the Private Agricultural Development Project
crucially depends upon: the ability of entrepreneurs to develop commercially sound subprojects that are
capable of generating sufficient income to meet the interest payment and capital repayments due; and the
ability of loan officers to realistically evaluate the likelihood of subprojects meeting this requirement while
sufficiently rewarding the entrepreneur for the risk borne. The process of business planning and the study
of the feasibility of investments is an important tool which assists entrepreneurs to carefully consider,
develop and refine their subprojects. Entrepreneurs should therefore be actively involved in the
business/investment planning process. This process also results in a document which is likely to be
required by potential lenders to assist them evaluate the likelihood of subproject success. Therefore,
technical assistance programs shall be undertaken to both encourage the provision of sound consultancy
and business planning services for the agricultural and food sectors and to encourage entrepreneurs to be
actively involved in the study of investment feasibility by providing the skills they require. In particular
the following technical assistance programs shall be undertaken:
BS-O1 Training Private Farmers in Understanding and Judging Feasibility: To assist
Lithuanian institutions develop and deliver training courses for private farmers on the
concept and techniques required to develop feasible investment projects.
BS-02 Agricultural Company Management Training: To strengthen and develop the
managerial capacity of the Agricultural Companies and thereby aid the process of their
transformation.
Rural Employment
5.            The development of the efficiency and competitiveness of the agricultural and food sectors
of Lithuania will inevitably result in increased visible unemployment as companies shed labor in order
to reduce costs and raise productivity. The process of land reform will also result in the creation of many
farms which are too small to generate sufficient income to meet the farm families' needs. Such trends
could exacerbate problems of poverty in rural areas and needs to be countered with programs to assist



84                                                                              Annex 7
the development of alternative full- and part-time employment opportunities. The stimulus for these
developments should come from the rural populations since their involvement will increase the local
ownership of the subprojects and ensure that they meet local needs. The following Technical Assistance
program shall therefore be undertaken.
RE-01 Assistance for Rural Employment Generation: To stimulate the development of
alternative rural employment opportunities by raising the awareness of the rural
population to alternative opportunities, assisting the development of demonstration
community based projects (particularly those undertaken by females), and providing
training specifically directed towards the needs of female farmers.
BS-03 The Establishment of a Rural Business Development Center: To support the
development of sound investment projects and the development of alternative employment
opportunities in rural areas by promoting excellence in the provision of rural business
advisory services.
Rural Credit Systems
6.           A major component of the project is the line of credit for private farmers, Agricultural
Companies, agricultural service and supply companies, agro-processors, and rural enterprises. While
several private commercial banks have expressed interest in participating in the Project and those that are
eligible and are willing to enter into subsidiary loan agreements with the Ministry of Finance/Bank of
Lithuania will be invited at act as PFIs these banks are unlikely to lend to smaller farm or rural enterprise
based subprojects. This is due both to their lack of experience of lending to agriculture and their limited
branch networks. Conversely, the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL) which has both experience of
lending to Lithuanian agriculture (although mainly on noncommercial terms) and has an extensive branch
network is ineligible to participate as a financial intermediary under the project. The Government is,
however, committed to repairing the capital structure of the bank through the removal of bad loans from
the portfolio of ABL and/or subscribing to new share capital. The management of ABL has also
indicated its firm commitment to reforming its lending procedures and policies. Consequently the
following two Technical Assistance programs shall be undertaken.
Rural Banking: To prepare a Rural Credit Manual for all PFIs.
Institutional Development Program for ABL: To improve the operational structure and
policies of ABL so as to be an eligible PFI under the PADP. The development of twelve
key banking areas will be supported: Planning, Budgeting and Performance;
Measurement Process; Organizational Restructuring; Human Resource Management;
marketing; Credit Management; Branch Management; Asset and Liability Management;
Accounting; Management Information Systems; Information Technology; and Internal
Audit.

SUPERVISION
7.           The Institutional and Human Resource Development technical assistance shall be
undertaken by bilateral and multilateral donor agencies under parallel cofinancing arrangements. The
hiring of consultants, procurement and disbursement shall be undertaken by the donor agencies following
their own procedures and regulations. If requested by a donor, Bank staff shall participate in the review
of bids by consultants. In accordance with parallel cofinancing agreements Bank staff shall supervise the
technical assistance under the Project. Parallel cofinancers will be invited to participate in joint
supervision missions. Supervision missions will review the monitoring sources collected by the Project
Management Unit (PMU) and evaluate the efficacy of the technical assistance. Where the provision of
technical assistance falls below acceptable standards the Bank staff shall coordinate efforts with the
borrower and the donor to rectify the situation at the earliest opportunity.

Private Agriculture Development Project
ANNEX 8: Environmental Analysis
1.           Overall, agriculture is an area where environmental improvements are and can be made
with success and at relatively low costs. The break-up of large farms, and redistribution of land will
increase the care and concern for land, and will end the monoculture and its reliance on intensive use of
agro-chemicals. The increasing interest in agro-tourism also enhances the attention for environmentally
acceptable agricultural practices.
2.           The proposed operation is expected to have positive environmental effects through the
promotion of improved land use practices, farming methods and agricultural product processing. The
proposed project has been reviewed consistent with the requirements of the Lithuanian environmental
assessment procedures (as explained in the Environmental Aspects annex of Lithuania Power
Rehabilitation Project) and the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01 'Environmental Assessment', and
placed in environmental screening category "B".
3.           Developments in agriculture. The detrimental effects of the previous command economy
are widely known, and not much different from that in other parts of the region. However, despite major
efforts in drainage and intensification of agriculture, most of the landscape, with smaller woodlots and
ponds, was left intact thereby enhancing water management. The present contraction of the agricultural
sector has actually helped to reduced environmental problems associated with intensive agriculture. The
amount of fallow land has increased (to an estimated 200,000 HA) thereby decreasing the risk of erosion
and the need for pesticides.
4.           Pesticide use has declined from 4 Kg/HA in 1989 to less than 1 Kg/HA in 1994, as most
are beyond the purchasing power of cash strapped farmers. At present mainly the richer AC's use
pesticides; most private farmers have replaced the use of herbicides with manual weeding for example.
Main crops on which pesticides are used include rape, sugarbeets and flax. Most of the previous
government incentives for pesticide use (subsidized pricing) have been terminated, except for a few
rayons where local governments have implemented small schemes to promote pesticide use. Although the
use of agricultural inputs is expected to rise, private farming, market economy, and better
extension/information are expected to lead to a more judicious use than under the command economy.
5.           Recent developments. Since 1993 the Government of Lithuania has taken measures to
strengthen environmental management practice in all sectors, including agriculture. In 1994 it upgraded
the Environmental Protection Department to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and is in the
process of preparing a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), which includes, with support by EU-
PHARE, the preparation of a new environmental law. It has also co-sponsored regional conferences on
environmental issues in agricultures in countries in economic transition (with OECD) and management
of agricultural run-off (with USEPA/World Bank). The government has developed its own laws and
regulations concerning sustainable agricultural practices, including new guidelines on the use of pesticides
by the Plant Protection Agency. Lithuania has also undertaken cooperative programs with Denmark for
the management of obsolete agricultural chemicals and pesticides, Sweden in the management of



88                                                                                  Annex 8
agricultural run-off, and the USEPA in the management of polder agriculture. It has also initiated (with
support of USEPA) a program of management of the environmentally vulnerable northern Karst zone,
where both soil erosion and groundwater contamination are a major concern, leading the Government
to recommend a limitation of agricultural activities in an area of 160,000 HA.
6.           In order to respond to the increasing need for environmentally sustainable agricultural
practices the Ministry of Agriculture has recently established a Committee for Environmental Issues.
Among the first topics to be addressed is a comprehensive review of the implementation of the removal
and destruction of obsolete pesticides (with the assistance of Denmark), and further review of the present
list of approved pesticides. In this effort it is following international standards including use of the WHO
classification.
7.            The Ministry of Agriculture continues its support for farmer training and requires
certification of pesticide users, but this program is increasingly hampered by the high cost, of protective
clothing, and the lack of training material. Training is provided through either/or LAAS, Plant
Protection, local Agricultural Schools. This year the Plant Protection Agency has sent its first staff
member overseas for training in integrated pest management (IPM).
Effect of the Proposed Project
8.            One of the major objectives of the project is to establish a sound farm credit program with
loan officers trained in all aspects of agricultural lending including (environmental) risk assessment.
Project supported investments at the farm level and in the agro-processing industries are intended to: (a)
increase the efficiency of the use of agricultural inputs (fuel, fertilizers, pesticides); (b) decrease soil
erosion by better land use practices; (c) increase energy efficiency through the introduction of new
equipment; and (d) reduce air pollution through the phasing out of coal fired heat and boiler units. The
proposed project would support the strengthening of Lithuanian capacities in environmentally sound
approaches to agriculture through support for the strengthening of agricultural extension services,
provision of advisory services to agro-processing industries and training of personnel from cooperating
financial institutions in the environmental review methods.
9.            Potential impacts associated with proposed small scale projects would be mitigated
through the adoption and active implementation of environmental screening procedures appropriate for
intermediate lending operations by cooperating financial institutions and through implementation of
applicable environmental procedures by national, regional and local entities charged with environmental
assessment. Monitoring of the environmental aspects of relatively small investment would be conducted
principally by regional offices and local offices complemented by periodic supervision by environmental
staff from the Bank's regional office.
Environmental Management
10.          An environmental review was prepared for the proposed Project consistent with the
requirements of Lithuania environmental assessment legislation and the provisions of World Bank
Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment" and placed in environmental screening category
"b". The proposed project is expected to result in environmental benefits by supporting a series of small
scale improvements in a wide range of agricultural practices as recommended by the extension service.

11.          Environmental screening and review procedures. The project would include provisions
of environmental review by Lithuanian environmental authorities of proposed investments. Where
applicable investments supported under the proposed project would require issuance of permits consistent
with the applicable Lithuanian land use and environmental procedures (these procedures are to be listed
in the new Environmental Law; till that time the decrees listed in par. 13 apply. Present environmental
regulations recognize three layers of authority that regulate and monitor environmental standards:
(a) At the ground level is the rayon or municipal government. Most small projects (e.g. local
construction etc.) need only local approval. To obtain such approval the project is reviewed by
a local committee consisting of the Environmental Affairs specialist in the rayon, the rayon
Hygienist and, if pesticides are involved, a local representative of the State Plant Protection
Agency. However, the ability of the bureaucracy to implement varies. The city of Vilnius, for
example, has created and environmental agency, but in some of the rural rayon the monitoring
and survey and done by rayon architects or others not directly trained in environmental
assessment. Progress is being made in training.
(b)  The Ministry of the Environment has ten regional offices. These offices supervise, among others,
the rayon level implementation, and specifically handle the environmental assessment of larger
regional projects and issues. Examples are especially construction investments and investments
which may create new waste water.
(c)   Environmental assessment of still larger issues and projects (large scale industrial projects,
pipelines) is handled by the relevant office in the central Ministry of the Enviromnent.
12.          The responsibility for environmental monitoring of the relatively small investments (less
than 1 million litas) made under the project will mainly be at the local (rayon) governments. Few, if any,
investments or special cases are envisaged to need review by regional offices. Local regulations require
submission of simple request which includes a one-page form dealing with the use of raw materials and
the production, storage and management of waste, and, where applicable, the description of the possible
physical and biological pollutants created by the investment and the remedial counter measures taken.
With respect to agriculture, these regulations mainly affect construction of dwelling, public building,
animal production building or facilities, greenhouses except when heated by gas generators) storage
facilities of crops as well as fuel, well drilling, animal burial sites, power lines and some others.
13.          Investments in or near protected areas will require special review in the regional offices
of the Ministry of the Environment. Such special reviews include those made in the "intensive karst zone"
targeted by the Government for Ground Water Protection and Sustainable Agricultural Development
(Birzai and Pasvalys rayon).
14.          The basic procedures for screening of small scale investments are well established and
documented in recent decrees and regulations (decree 87 of 12/17/90; regulations # 153-93 and decree
154-60 of 8131/93). These rules are aimed are mainly aimed at larger investments, but will be used to
ascertain consideration of proper environmental standards preservation of the top soil, solid and liquid
waste management, proper management of drainage and run-off, as well as of assessment and
management of the impact of agricultural production related investments such as workshops, storage etc.
on groundwater quality, on trees, shrubs and plant life, and on wildlife and fish. These rules are to
ascertain proper construction standards. All infrastructure investment lending under the project would
require permits.

15.          Although these procedures are well established, the project  will emphasize the
environmental sound and sustainable agricultural procedures, mainly through its extension effort.
Similarly, the advisory services to the processing industry will also stress the environmental aspects of
the investments in processing. In addition, the lending institutions will apply the lessons learned during
the environmental assessment training provided by the World Bank supported Enterprise and Financial
Sector Restructuring Project, which includes technical assistance support to the banking sector, and
preparation of an environmental assessment manual.
16.          Institutional Strengthening Activities. The proposed Project would support the
strengthening of Lithuanian capacities in environmentally sound approaches to agriculture through
(a) support for the strengthening of agricultural extension services; including continued training of
extension personnel and, subsequently farmers, in appropriate pest management practices
including IPM and proper handling of agro-chemicals;
(b) the provision of advisory services to the agro-processing industries that would stress the use of
environmentally sound practices and technologies; and
(c)  support the training of personnel from cooperating financial institutions in the environmental risk
assessment of small scale investments in agriculture.

Private Agricultural Development Project
ANNEX 10: Farm Models
I.           The relatively poor soils and the cool climate narrow the opportunities of farms in their
selection of product mix and farming system. The seasons are short, and limited by often wet springs and
autumns, which may complicate respectively planting and harvesting. However, there are good
opportunities for root crops, forage, and livestock production. These production systems would greatly
benefit from improvement in the availability of inputs, equipment, improvements in energy efficiency and
overall management. The marketing opportunities of quality products is, in the long term, good with
nearby urban markets such as Vilnius and Kaunas and beyond larger population centers in Kaliningrad,
Russia, Belarus, and Poland.
II.           One of the project objective is to assist farmers in the transition from , mainly, large-scale
collective farning to smaller-scale family farming or, in some cases, farming cooperatives. Apart from
the change in fanming system, it is also expected that the product mix of farms is going to change and
probably broaden from the previously mandated cereal production and intensive livestock. In this rapidly
changing sector, farm lending is likely to concentrate initially on seasonal inputs (seeds, fuel, agro-
chemicals, fertilizer and small equipment) and limited investments in equipment, buildings, livestock and
storage facilities. Larger farms may invest also in small scale processing.
III.         Crop/livestock budaets.  The attached crop and livestock budgets demonstrate the
difference in outlook of a selected number of crops under present and improved conditions. The examples
are derived from the crop budgets developed by the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service, in its effort
to assist Lithuanian farmers to make more rational decisions on crop mix and future investments. These
budgets are tentative, however, as crop prices are still volatile. Potatoes prices, for example, were high
in early 1995 due to the drought in 1994 (as such somewhat lower prices were used in the models). Pig
prices are also high, a trend common throughout the region during 1994-95. Cereal prices, on the other
hand appear to have reached a more stable level, and may better reflex future price levels. Most of the
selected crops, except flax and milk, are not subsidized and reflect real market prices.
IV.          Whole farm models Whole farm models are presented for two typical private farms, one
which represents the 89ers and one which represents restitution farms. It should, however, be noted that
major changes in farm system are likely during the course of the Project so that these farm models are
merely indicative. For instance, the management of grassland is likely to substantially improve through
the adoption of improved temporary leys using improved seed and the adoption of silage based forage
systems. The increased efficiency of grassland use will allow improved management of livestock
increasing the quality of output and stocking densities. In addition, good opportunities exist for some
private farmers to produce vegetables for urban markets which would generate high margins.
V.           Example Cashflows for a family farm and an agricultural company (Bendrove) were
derived from the World Bank supported Farm Survey Report and somewhat modified. They demonstrate
the present weakness, especially of the agricultural company, where high overhead costs severely depress
cash flow. Improvement in management and in agronomic practices, to be stimulated through LAAS



94                                                                                  Annex 10
advice, as well as investments in better inputs, and more efficient production (for example through more
energy efficient equipment use) may help these farms to improve their performance. The cash flow of
private farmers appear somewhat better, but here also, major improvements are possible through better
product choices and greater efficiency.
VI.           Storage. Apart from investments on the production side, major improvements are
expected to be made through investment in better storage, transport, and marketing. The impact of
improved storage is difficult to determine but is probably significant through: (a) reduction in losses in
the field as well as in storage; (b) increased farm flexibility during harvest time (less weather dependent);
and (c) increased flexibility in marketing. Table 4 makes an effort to estimate some of the benefits of
better storage, concentrating on reduced losses, and higher quality. Estimates of the reduction in these
losses are made, on a per ton basis. These improvements are then aggregated for a total benefit for an
average farm. A simple rate of return is calculated. The latter are somewhat low, as the chosen farm size
is rather small. There is a scale element in these investments, and the benefits are likely to be higher in
larger farms (the alternative of renting out storage space is well possible, but was not considered in this
simple models).

Notes:               (a) Improvements resulting from dhe project are based upon (i) increased efficiency, (ii) increased yields, and (iii) improved quality.
(b) There is likely to be an incresd use of temporary leys as part of the cropping rotation as the project goes on. This would allow stocking densities to be increased.
(c) There is likely to be an increased use of silage (probably stored covered on concrete slabs or in a pit ather than being wrapped as bails) as the project goes on.
(d) Grazing and Hay budgets have been included to show the basis of cost estimates included in livestock budgets.

Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                 107
GOVERNMENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
To Mr. Wilfried Thalwitz
Vice-president
World Bank
Vilniust 29 May 1995
Dear Mr. Thalwitz,
After regaining its independence, Lithuania started
a comprohensive agricultural reform  programme aiming at
transforming agriculture into an efficient system based
an   the   market  principles   and   private  ownership.
Agricultural sector is of an exceptional economic and
social importance for Lithuania. In the preteform period
the agricultural sector generataed income for one third of
the population. The first stage of the aqgarian reform
was carried out rapidly: in two years the former economic
structures  and  administrative-commanding  r'gulation  oQ
economic and social relations were eliminate4.
During the reform the agricultural inpur prices grew
4-5 times quicker than farm-gate prices. Fa;mers faced a
rather ditficult situation, because almost all types of
agricultural production became unprofitable.   Decline in
production   was   catastrophic.   For   in*tance,   the
procurement of livestock and poultry in 1994 declined by
4.6 and of milk 2.5 times if compared to the 1989 level.
Production of meat per capita during the corresponding
p-riod- decreased by 58%, milk - 42%, eggs - 47%. The
majority of agricultural producers found themselves in
worse conditions because of the lack of i'vestment. Due
to the aforementioned reasons, income of a laxge group of
rural population diminished and unemployment increased.
GOL In pursuit of creating conditions for the development
of a more efficient agriculture and integration into tLo
international market must at the same time soften the
social  impact  of  transition  to  the  ma.rkat  oriented
economy.
Following  WS  recommendations,  GOL  "ontinues  to
implement the reform. For example, since %pril 1 1995
retail margin control for domestically pxcoduced food
products has been eliminated by GOL. it also should be



108                                                           Attachment I
mentioned that after the matter-of-fact discussions with
WE authorities, the size of the subsidy per 1- liter of
milk has been reduced  from 0.07 Lt to 0.03 Lt (almoSt
60%). At present the amourit of subt;idies if *:ompared with
other countries is very smiall (8t of the total income
from sales). The subsidias are applied only to some types
of  products.  The  Government  r*duced  budgetary  funds
allocated for subsidized credit from 108 mi. lion Litas in
1994 to 50 million Litas in 1995 (more than cwice).
GOL is committed to continue reforms, because in the
long run it will be bGneficial for the courtry. However,
it  is  the Governmont'6 duty    to relieve  an much  an
possible the rural population from the hardships it is
facing today.
In  order  to  prevent  the  economic- and  social
situation   of   the   rural   population   form   rapid
deterioration and ensure at least the minlimal farmers '
income, the Law on State R4gulation of Economic Relations
in Agriculture was passed in December 1994. Some of the
measures  foreseen  in  this  Law  should  be  viewed  an
temporary ones applied to the transition to the market
economy.
Znacting the  Law, the  Government should  set  the
minim=m marginal procurement prices f or agricultural
products. However, until now mininum marginal prices in
Lithuania were set by authorized repre-entatives of
producers  and  processors   (unions  and  associations)
without   the   Government's   intervention,   and   were
foma.lized by mutual agreements. The Govermn.ent does not
take   any   administrational   actions   restarding   such
agreements,   because   tho   minimum   macrinal   prices
determined in these agreements are only tentative and
much lower than in EU countries. These prices also apply
to   tho  products  of  particular  social  importance.
Nevertheless,   the   Government   recognizes   that   such
mechanism of regulating relations between producers and
processors of agricultural goods ia not perfect, and,
therefore, considers it to be a temporary measure.
At the present stage the Government ia not in a
position to eliminate the minimum marginal prices fullY.
However, as it acknowledges a possible negatLve Impact of
such a policy on the economy, the Government is prepared
to take further steps:
* to support by  applying  minimum  marginal prices
only to the highest quallty beef and milk. Tnat would be
an additional stimuluS for farmers to improve the
quality of their production;
* to eliminate the support for milk and beef
producers gradually  by the  end of 1999. This aid  for
farmsrs . will  be  replaced  by  the  system  of  direct
assistance.



Lithuania Private Agriculture Development Project                 109
The subsidized credits to agjvicultural entities is a
partial  compensation  for growing  bank  intarest  rates
because of inflation and unfavourabla situa ion in credit
markets, which impedes the implementation of agricultural
transformation projects. Cturrently Lithuania faces many
limitations which hamper the developinent of the system of
commercial lending for agriculture. First, farmers lack
collateralt partially  because of malfunctioning of land
market.  Second,  relatively  high  costs  o0f small loan
administration. Third, low profitability of farming.
For that reason the 'Government had to continue to
fill the gap as long as the obstacles are eLiminated. The
Government recognizes that the subsidized credit in the
long  run  is  not  an efficient moasure  ard,  therefore,
foresees to substitute it gradually by other means of
direct support in the future.
We ensure you that the current Amount of subsidized
credit for 1995 will not be increased. The Government
tends to. continue to reduce budgetary funds allocated f6r
oubsidized credit, however, we would like to emphasize
that this reduction depends to a great extent on the
opportunity to use alternative resources of credits
including WS credit line. The sooner WS loan is available
for Lithuania, the sooner the Government will be able to
reduce and gradually eliminate subsidized credit.
In addition to the above mentioned measures, to
.strengthen   and   accelerate   the   transiormation   cf
a ricalture to the market based system, the Government
will undertake the following stops:
*  GOL  will  expedite  the  restitutlon   of  land
ownership and will aim to proces3 all the restitution
claims  by  the  end  of 1999, and issue  tLtles  to the
already restituted land. GOL will initiate an amendment
to  the  existing  legislation  and  grant  the  right of
selling land to Lithuanian and foreign legal persons and
foreign citizens;
* GOL plans to sell the majority of Government
shares in processing and agricultural service companies
to agricultural producers in order to create favourable
preconditions for innovation and competition,
We believe that WB comprehends the difficulties of
the agricultural sector reform in Lithualia and the
importance to preserve general and social stability. We
hope that WE will take into consideration the complexity
and  the  dynamic  nature  of  changes  of  the  curret.t
situat$on. It will take some time to correct the past
distortions *. We are firmly detezmined to continue the
refof= and transf ormations at the paLce which would not
increase social risks.
On  behalf  of  the Government  of  the  tepublic of
Lithuania we would like to assure you once 4gain that we

are f irmly determined to continua the transition to the
Market economy and extend otur gratitude to the World Barzk

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
I. THE PROJECT
A. Introduction
1.           This Project Implementation Plan was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture with the
support of the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Team during appraisal and will be
agreed upon in accordance with the procedures set out in the OP/BP/GB 10.00. The complete design is
presented as an overview in Chart 1 below.
B. Project Scope and Objectives
2.           The Private Agricultural Development Project (The Project) would increase the
availability of commercial credit to private farmers, privatised state or collective farms (known as
Agricultural Companies), agricultural and food processors, agro-service companies and rural
enterprises, and support the market orientation of the agricultural, food, and rural sectors with
appropriate Technical Assistance in accordance with the following objectives:
*        to strengthen and restructure rural credit delivery systems;
*        to increase the availability of finance for the upgrading of technology and
production facilities;
*        to foster the development of private farms and promote the emergence of private
small and medium enterprises in rural areas;
*        to provide seed money, retraining, and advice for the development of opportunities
for income and employment generation in rural areas and the diversification of
farm businesses;
*        to help establish land markets and tradeable private land ownership rights and
increase access to credit by establishing legally binding collateral;
*        to improve the efficiency with which markets indicate consumers wants and needs
through improving the institutional framework of markets (including improved
price dissemination);
*        to improve the business management skills and marketing ability of farmers and
entrepreneurs so that they can identify, evaluate, and pursue business development
opportunities which improve productivity and the competativeness of Lithuanian
products in domestic and export markets; and thereby reduce poverty.

C. Project Description
3.            Both multilateral and bilateral donors have supported the development of the Lithuanian
agricultural and food sector which is the second largest in the Lithuanian economy. This support has
assisted Lithuania in its transformation of the agricultural and food economies to a system where
resources are allocated by markets according to the prices that are the result of consumers' purchasing
behaviour.  However, to date much of the Technical Assistance has been directed towards the
investment in physical capital which was required to promote land reform, establish an extension
organisation, and provide agricultural machinery and vehicles. The Agricultural and Food Sector
Review indicated that despite this assistance there still exist some important constraints to the
development of a competitive market based food distribution chain to the detriment of farmers and
consumers alike.
4.            A competitive market economy requires a large number of buyers and sellers, the wide
availability of information (especially market information), and access to capital.  Since these
conditions are not currently satisfied in Lithuania the proposed Project will be implemented as an
Investment Project the main components of which will be:
Long term credit for on- and off-farm investments, seasonal credits for farm
inputs and initial working capital for processors;
Institutional and human resource development through Technical Assistance to
improve the capacity of those involved in the agricultural and food sectors to
respond to market signals through the development of agricultural market and
technical information sources, and business and technical skills as well as for
the development of the land market in Lithuania.
5.            Credit Component. The lack of available credit is hindering the establishment of new
firms or the development of existing firms undertaking agricultural input and service supply (including
machinery service contractors), small and medium sized agro processing, and market intermediaries
such as wholesalers, traders and distributors. This is limiting competition particularly in the agro-
processing sector which is highly oligopolistic. This is an important reason for the poor prices that
farmers receive and the substantial delays before they are paid. The lack of credit is also hindering the
development of the large number of new private farmers and the Agricultural Companies which were
created from the privatised non-land assets of the former State and Collective farms. Consequently, the
primary agricultural producers are having difficulty developing their production and competing with the
quality of imported products. The results of the farm survey conducted by the Lithuanian Agricultural
Advisory Service, the Association of Agricultural Companies and the Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian
Economics with the assistance of the PHRD Team, confirmed that both private farmers and
Agricultural Companies (the privatised former state and collective farms) have a large demand for long
term credit. The farm survey also indicated that currently they lack such credit. Additionally there is a
need to develop alternative employment opportunities in rural areas which will help to alleviate both the



Project Implementation Plan                                                               113
rising unemployment that results from farm and enterprise restructuring as well as the low incomes
generated by the large number of small farms.
6.            Consequently, in order to increase the availability of long term credit to private farms,
Agricultural Companies, farm service companies, small and medium sized agro-processors, and rural
enterprises a $30 million Line-of-Credit will be extended to Lithuania. The World Bank will provide
the loan to the Government of Lithuania (GOL) in the form of a Single Currency Loan at the Banks'
standard variable interest rate which is adjusted every six months. The loan will be repaid according to
terms and conditions agreed at negotiations.
7.            The credit will be channelled to sub-borrowers through participating financial
intermediaries (PFIs) which will draw upon the Line-of-Credit with the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) acting
as an APEX agency on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. For each eligible sub-loan that they make,
PFIs will be able to draw upon the Line-of-Credit in either US$ or Litas dependant upon the currency
within which the sub-loan is denominated. Where PFIs draw upon the Line-of-Credit in US$ the BOL
shall add to the interest rate changed by the World Bank , a margin to cover administration costs and
repayment risks. Where the PFIs draw upon the Line-of-Credit in Litas, BOL shall on lend at a
variable market determined interest rate which shall be set in relation to the BOL's refinancing or
rediscount rate.
8.            It is expected that the PFIs shall be private commercial banks' which satisfy World
Bank eligibility criteria and the Agricultural Bank of Lithuanian (ABL) once it meets the eligibility
criteria applied by the World Bank. The PFIs will bear the full credit risks of the sub-projects financed
from the Line-of-Credit.
9.            Potential sub-borrowers will apply to a PFI for a sub-loan.  Sub-loans may be
denominated either in US$, in which case the sub-borrower bears the exchange rate risk, or in Litas, in
which case the government will bear the exchange rate risk. The interest rates charged by PFIs on sub-
loans in US$ or Litas shall be variable and determined by PFIs according to their risk assessment of the
sub-project, their lending costs and the costs of funds on lent by the Apex Unit. Interest rates shall be
market determined and positive in real terms. Applications will be assessed by each PFI on the basis of
the commercial viability of the proposed sub-project.  Applicants will need to demonstrate such
viability by undertaking feasibility studies which will detail the technical, economic, financial and
environmental soundness of the sub-project. In order to promote small investment projects, and
thereby improve competition in the sector, there will be a limit of US$250 thousand on the total size of
sub-loans that can be made under the Project to a single borrower. Since the proposed Bank loan is
intended to assist the development of private enterprise in the agricultural, food and rural sectors there
will be an additional restriction that companies will only be eligible for a loan under this credit line if
there is a least 51 % private ownership of the company. All activities financed under the Line-of-Credit
would be required to comply with GOL environmental standards. Terms and conditions, including
interest rates and repayment conditions, of sub-loans shall be determined by the PFIs upon strictly
The private commercial banks have not yet been selected.

commercial criteria subject to the following provisos: the loan repayment schedule shall not extend
beyond the productive life of investments made; the maximum repayment period shall be limited to 12
years; and any period of repayment grace shall not exceed 3 years. Grace and amortisation periods
would be based on the type of investment financed and the projected cash flow, and would be
commesurate with the repayment capacity of sub-borrowers.
10.          Institutional and Human Resource Development Component. The development of
human capital is now a priority for the further development of the whole food distribution chain and for
the promotion of employment in rural areas. This component would therefore consist of Technical
Assistance to assist in the following areas:
Marketing. Currently within Lithuania agricultural and food production is not determined
according to the wants and need of consumers as expressed through market signals or market
research. There are a variety of reasons for this. Paramount is the lack of market institutions
for the trading of agricultural inputs and outputs which result in primary agricultural producers
having a lack of choice as to purchased inputs and a lack of buyers for their output. This limits
competition amongst input suppliers and agro-processors so that primary producers pay higher
input prices and receive lower output prices than otherwise would be the case. This problem is
compounded by private farmers' lack of adequate storage and transportation facilities which
further impedes their inter-temporal and spatial marketing decisions. A lack of experience of
market behaviour over time and between locations together with a lack of market information
also hinders such decision making.
In addition to these problems related to the under development of market institutions, farmers
also face a lack of demand for their output. A main reason for this is that the output of many
Lithuanian agro-processors does not satisfy the wants or needs of consumers in the domestic or
export markets. There are a variety of reasons for this including a lack of trained marketing
professionals and the lack of an effective trade promotion agency.
Consequently the following Technical Assistance programmes shall be undertaken to alleviate
these problems:
Farm Level Marketing - The Development of Marketing Institutions: To assist the creation of a
decentralised market economy through the development of Lithuanian experience in the
establishment and operation of agricultural market institutions.
Agricultural Market Education: To assist participants in the agricultural markets develop their
experience of the determinants of market prices including the effects of product quality and
location, and the causes of price movements in the short, medium and longer terms.
Food Marketing Training Courses: To improve the marketing abilities of those involved in the
production and sale of processed agricultural products.

Trade Information Development: To assist the Agricultural Trade Agency, to be established by
the Ministry of Agriculture, create a service for the collection, processing, storage and
dissemination of trade data.
Product Workshops: To improve the export performance of the agricultural, food and fishery
sectors of the Lithuanian economy.
Export Promotion: To assist the development of Lithuanian skills in the production of export
promotional material and the undertaking of an international trade mission.
Business Skill Development.   The ability for entrepreneurs and business consultants to
prepare rational business plans and studies of the feasibility of investments is vital for the
success of the credit component of the project. Although Lithuanian capability in these areas is
developing there is a need for the training of private farmers and managers of Agricultural
Companies who currently tend to lack the business skills and experience required to plan sound
investments and effectively manage their enterprises. Private farmers require simple training to
understand the profitability, cashflow and capital position of their businesses as a priority and
subsequent training in the judgement of project feasibility. The managers of Agricultural
Companies require training in methods to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of their
businesses and in the skills to implement the changes required.
Thus the following Technical Assistance programmes will be undertaken:
Training Private Farmers in Understanding and Judging Feasibility: To assist Lithuanian
institutions develop and deliver training courses for private farmers on the concept and
techniques required to develop feasible investment projects.
Agricultural Company Management Training: To strengthen and develop the managerial
capacity of the Agricultural Companies and thereby aid the process of their transformation.
Extension System  Development.  In 1993 the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Service
(LAAS) was established and in a short space of time this organisation has made great progress
in providing extension services to private farmers. The establishment of the organisation was
greatly assisted by EU-PHARE which provided much of the physical investment required
(vehicles, technical equipment, computers, office equipment and supplies, etc.). LAAS has
also received technical assistance and training from a variety of countries including Denmark
and Sweden and organisations such as VOCA.  Currently LAAS is receiving Technical
Assistance funded by EU-PHARE and the British Government's Know How Fund. These
technical assistance programmes are providing training for farm advisors and financing an
experienced co-director to assist the director of LAAS with strategic planning and to co-
ordinate the training input. Although the advisory service is developing well, other aspects of
the farm extension system remain under developed and there is a need to increase the flow of
information from research and education organisations and the Ministry of Agriculture to the
advisory service and farmers.

The Ministry of Agriculture is a key organisation within the overall extension system since it
has the roles of fostering competitive agricultural and food sectors through its policy making
role and through the production and dissemination of information.
In order to be able to increase the flow of information it is necessary that appropriate
information collection systems are developed. Currently, the rapid privatisation of the farm
sector has resulted in a lack of reliable information since the information systems collected data
from the former state and collective farms (the non-land assets of which have been privatised
into "Agricultural Companies") rather than private farms.
Consequently the following Technical Assistance programmes shall be undertaken:
Flexible Extension System Development: To further the development of the whole extension
system by facilitating the two-way flow of information through the system so that it meets the
need of farmers.
Ministry of Agriculture Management Training: To facilitate the adaptation of the Ministry of
Agriculture and related institutions to their new role of fostering a competitive market based
economy.
The Further Development of the Census of Farm Businesses: To reduce the cost of undertaking
the Institute of Statistic's census of farm businesses so that it may be undertaken on an annual
basis.
The Development of a Survey of Private Farm Accounts: To implement a survey of farm
accounts that is broadly compatible with similar surveys used in market based economies.
Survey of Farmer Opinion: To provide information on the opinions and perceptions of farmers
and thereby aid the monitoring and evaluation of the Private Agricultural Development Project.
Rural Employment Generation. The privatisation of the farm sector through the restitution of
land and the privatisation of the non-land assets of the state and collective farms into
Agricultural Companies will inevitably result in: the creation of a large number of small farms
which are of insufficient size to generate sufficient income to satisfy all the expenditure needs
of a family; and an increase in visible unemployment as the Agricultural Companies restructure
and shed the labour which currently constitutes hidden unemployment. Therefore, increasingly
there will be a need for members of families operating small farms to undertake alternative
income generating activities, on- or off-farm, in addition to farming. Likewise, in order to
avoid rural depopulation, there will be a need to assist rural communities develop new job
opportunities. It has been noted by the Women Farmers' Union that within Lithuania in many
cases it is females on farms that are attempting to undertake alternative activities. Thus in
order that the assistance meets the identified needs in Lithuania and to avoid the female rural
population being economically disenfranchised by the restructuring and development process a
large part of the assistance shall be targeted at the needs of the female rural population. A



Project Implementation Plan                                                             117
Technical Assistance programme shall be undertaken to: stimulate the development of
alternative rural employment opportunities by raising the awareness of the rural population to
alternative opportunities, assisting the development of demonstration community based projects
(particularly those undertaken by females), and providing training specifically directed towards
the needs of female farmers.
Rural Business Development Center (RBC). Experience demonstrates that stimulating the
new employment required to compensate for losses resulting from structural adjustment is a
difficult task. Local populations usually have little experience of utilising their own enterprise
and businesses that are set up have high failure rates. Experience also shows that agencies
established to provide business support can have great success in fostering indigenous
enterprise and nurturing new businesses through the critical first few years. The skills required
in such agencies extend far beyond the standard business consulting functions. First, such
agencies must adopt a proactive approach - if they do not, potential business opportunities are
lost either through the inability of untrained individuals to express them clearly or through the
fear that they will not be taken seriously. Second, the agencies must have a sound ability to be
able to recognise potentially viable projects based upon little information so as to be able to
screen out business ideas that have little or no chance of success.  Staff seconded from
successful businesses are crucial in order to fulfil this role. Third, the agency must act as a
facilitator, drawing together individuals with the appropriate skills to support the development
of specific business proposals. Such individuals may include those with the skills required to
judge market potential and technical feasibility, as well as those that can assist businesses
undertake financial analyses and prepare marketing strategies.  Since different business
proposals would require different expertise, rarely would such an agency maintain all the skills
within the organisation. Extensive contacts are therefore vital to the operation of the agency.
Currently, no such agency exists within Lithuania. The consulting companies that do exist
have inevitably have concentrated their efforts on improving the communication and presenting
of business proposals through the preparation of business plans and investment feasibility
studies. Even where these are based upon sound models and accounting principles they usually
ignore the changes occurring within the Lithuanian economy, the need to target the wants and
needs of consumers and the problems of business management (especially the need for
flexibility). Thus, such an agency - the Rural Business Development Centre - will be
established to fulfil these functions. The agency will primarily be innovative in adopting
strategies to foster new business developments thereby easing unemployment. It will however,
undertake such actions as are necessary to strengthen the financial and marketing ability of
managers and consultants alike. Where appropriate the RBC will pre-qualify local consulting
companies to assure the quality of services supplied to Project beneficiaries.
Land Reform. The current land reform programme has its roots in 1989 when it became
possible for individual farmers to lease up to 50 hectares of agricultural land on favourable
conditions. In 1991 a new land reform law was passed the prime objective of which was (i) to
restore land and real property rights to those who had owned land prior to 1940 and to their
heirs; and (ii) to privatise land that had been held by collective farms. The land laws were

further amended in 1993 and 1994 in the light of experience with operating the restitution
programme. A new draft law on land registration is now (1995) in preparation. A law on
mortgaging land was passed in 1992 but has not yet been implemented. A law governing
physical planning and development control is only in draft form. Some ten per cent of farm
lands have been surveyed to a sufficient standard for the issue of a certificate of title while a
further thirty per cent have been marked out roughly on the ground.
As a result of these difficulties as yet there is no active land market in Lithuania. An active
land market would further the allocation of land between alternative uses on the basis of the
economic returns from different activities. Lenders would also be encouraged to accept land as
security for loans since valuations could be based upon real market transactions and lenders
would be able to readily realise their collateral. The establishment of a land market should be
encouraged by speeding up the restitution of land, the creation of an efficient land register
containing only legally required and guaranteed informnation, the provision of legal support for
the drafting of land related legislation; and an improved Lithuanian capability in the valuation
of land. The following Technical Assistance programs shall therefore be undertaken.
Legislative and Administrative Development: To foster the development of a land market in
Lithuania by the provision of specialist assistance for the further development of applicable
legislation and administration systems, increasing the efficiency of the system, the development
of skills in the management of cadastral data and increasing the capacity for cost recovery.
Land Information System: To continue the on-going development work on the land information
system required to legally guarantee land transactions.
Rural Credit Systems. A survey of private commercial banks indicated that whilst they were
interested in participating in the Project as lenders to agro-processing companies they were
unlikely to be willing to lend for on-farm development. Conversely, whilst the Agricultural
Bank of Lithuania has indicated its interest in on-lending the line-of-credit to farmers and
agricultural companies (as well as other eligible sub-borrowers) it currently does not satisfy
World Bank eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Project as a PFI. The Government is
however committed to ensure that the ABL becomes eligible to act as a PFI. It is therefore in
the process of improving the capital structure of the bank through the removal of bad loans
resulting from past politically directed lending from ABL's portfolio and is considering
subscribing to new share capital in ABL. Technical Assistance will therefore be provided to
assist the ABL in its institutional development and improve its lending procedures. The
following Technical Assistance will therefore be provided.
Rural Banking: To prepare a Rural Credit Manual for all PFIs.
Institutional Development Program for ABL: To improve the operational structure and policies
of ABL so as to be an eligible PFI under the PADP. The assistance program will include
support for the development of the following twelve key areas: Planning, Budgeting and
Performance; The Measurement Process, Organisational Restructuring; Human Resource

D. Project Costs
12.       Total Base Costs of the Lithuanian Private Agricultural Development Project are estimated
at US$ 54.8 million. This Base Cost estimate is based upon the cost estimates prepared by the PHRD
team assisting the Ministry of Agriculture.
The Credit Component of the Project will consist of a US$ 30 million Line-of-
Credit in the form of a World Bank loan, This will be disbursed via the
participating financial intermediaries. Sub-borrowers would be required to
make the following contributions toward sub-project costs: no less than 15% in
cash or in-kind for individual farmers; and no less than 20% in cash or in-kind
for all others. For new investment by enterprises, the self contribution in cash
or in-kind would be at least 30%. Loan funds would be disbursed to the PFIs
as follows: 100% of the eligible sub-loans approved by PFIs in the first
eighteen months of the Project, 85% of the eligible subloans approved in the
following 12 months and 75% of eligible subloans approved in the remaining
period of project implementation. During the life of the Project the PFIs
contribution to the project costs will increase up to 25% of the subloan
amounts to be approved. The local contribution for investment is estimated to
be US $16.7 million equivalent.
The estimated base cost of the Institutional and Human Resource Development
component of the project is US$8.1 million.
13.       Total Project Costs are estimated at US$54.8 million. This estimate does not include
allowances for physical and price contingencies. This is due to the fact that the Bank contribution is the
US$ 30 million Line-of-Credit. The Institutional and Human Resource Development Component of the
Project will be grant financed by bilateral and multilateral donors and from EU counterpart funds
which will be used to fmance local costs involved in running the Rural Business Development Centre.
The costs given are indicative and the final costs will be the result of each individual donor's
procurement practices.
14.      Foreign Exchange:  The foreign exchange component is estimated to be 66%  of the
estimated Total Project Cost.

II. IMPLEMENTING ARRANGEMENTS
A. Organisations Responsible for the Project and Interagency Co-ordination
17.              Background. In response to the transformation of the economy from a command to
a market based system the Ministry of Agriculture is restructuring its operations. This restructuring
reflects the necessity of the Ministry to foster a competitive economy based upon private
entrepreneurship rather than directing production activities. Consequently a decentralised approach has
been adopted to Project implementation. The Minister of Agriculture will be responsible for the
Institutional and Human Resource component of the Project and will be assisted in this by the creation
of a dedicated Project Management Unit (PMU) within the Ministry and a related Agricultural
Technical Unit which will be independent of the Ministry. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the
Bank of Lithuania (BOL) acting as an APEX organisation will be responsible for the Credit component
of the Project.
18.              Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU in the Ministry of Agriculture will be
headed by a Deputy Minister reporting directly to the Minister in order to ensure a high level of
accountability and co-ordination. The PMU will co-ordinate project implementation and will oversee
the implementation of the Technical Assistance programmes which comprise the Institutional and
Human Resource Development Component of the Private Agricultural Development Project and other
multilateral and bilateral technical assistance.
19.       Rural Business Development Centre (RBC). The RBC will be established to support private
investment in Lithuanian farm, forestry, agro-processing and rural enterprises by promoting excellence
in the provision of business advisory services through its co-ordination, referral and co-operative role
and through the development of human capital and practical business intelligence. The RBC will
therefore play a major role in Project implementation. It will foster the development of new business
proposals, assist entrepreneurs identify appropriate sources of professional advice, and where the
necessary skills are lacking shall in the short-term ensure that the needs of private investors are satisfied
and in the medium-term take remedial action to improve private provision of the services required by
investors. The RBC shall also enhance the flow of information to entrepreneurs by developing relevant
databases of information required by the entrepreneurs in the agricultural, food and rural sectors of the
economy and by hosting seminars for relevant to the business community. The RBC shall additionally
assist sub-borrowers undertake procurement in accordance with Bank guidelines. In order to facilitate
the rapid implementation of the Project by increasing the flow of potential sub-projects to the banks
selected as Participating Financial Intermediaries, the RBC shall act in conjunction with foreign experts
providing technical assistance to stimulate the development of alternative employment opportunities in
rural areas. As part of a pilot-project in a selected district of Lithuania the RBC shall provide intensive
assistance to develop potential sub-projects identified by the foreign experts and shall prepare the
feasibility studies which PFIs will require to appraisal proposed sub-projects.
21.              Participating Financial Intermediaries. Banks which meet the eligibility criteria
outlined in the Staff Appraisal Report that wish to on-lend the Line-of-Credit to eligible sub-projects in

accordance with the objectives of the Private Agricultural Development Project shall be invited to
become Participating Financial Intermediaries (PFIs). It is expected that the PFIs shall include both
private commercial banks and the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL). Currently the ABL would not
satisfy the eligibility criteria referred to. However, the Government is committed to rectifying this
situation at the earliest opportunity and is undertaking remedial action so as to improve the capital
adequacy of the ABL. An Institutional Development Programme for the ABL has also been included in
the Institutional and Human Resource Development Component of the Project and multilateral donor
grant funding (EU-PHARE) has been agreed to support this Technical Assistance. The management of
the ABL is committed to implementing the required institutional restructuring so as to become a viable
and fully commercial bank. In addition, in order to further this, the Government has committed itself
to phasing out its use of the ABL as a channel for subsidised credit2 to the agricultural sector and, in the
interim, when acting as a fiscal agent of the Government the ABL shall not bear any lending risk.
22.              Ministry of Finance and Bank of Lithuania. The Government of Lithuania will act
as Guarantor of the loan and hence the Ministry of Finance shall bear ultimately responsibility for loan
repayment.  In order to ensure banking propriety the Bank of Lithuania shall act as an Apex
organisation. Technical Assistance has previously been provided to the BOL by organisations such as
the World Bank, the IMF and the US Treasury in order to improve bank regulation and supervision.
Additional assistance is being provided with US Aid's support to further improve the system with
particular regard to on-site examination of banks. As part of the World Bank Enterprise and Financial
Sector Assistance Project the BOL has created an Apex unit directly responsible to the Director of the
International Department. The four staff of the Apex shall have received training in Washington on
World Bank procedures.
B. Agreements between Borrower and Implementing Agencies
23.              The following agreements have been reached between the World Bank and the
Government of Lithuania:
(a)     The MOA will continue to establish the Project Management Unit. The staff required for
the PMU will be seconded from the MOA. PMU staff shall undertake training courses on
project management, procurement, disbursement, monitoring and reporting requirements,
consistent with WB project management standards.  The operating costs of the PMU
together with the salaries of the Lithuanian staff of the PMU shall be met from the budget
of the Ministry of Agriculture.
(b)     The Rural Business Centre shall be established as a closed joint stock company.
The Goverment has also committed itself to paying out the provision of subsidized credit to the
agricultural sector.

consistent with project lending objectives and expectations. Adjustments would be made to
reflect any imbalance;
(k)     In the event that disbursement of the credit line does not reach at least 50%  of
commitments by June 30, 1998, the Bank, in consultations with the Borrower, would

31.              The responsibilities of the PMU are designed to ensure close liaison with all
organisations having an impact on the successful implementation of the project.
32.              Bank of Lithuania - Apex Unit. The Apex Unit shall open a Special Account in a
bank and on terms and conditions acceptable to the World Bank. Initially at the request of the
borrower the Bank will make an initial deposit into the Special account of up to the authorised
allocation. Replenishment of the account will take place at monthly intervals or when one half of the
initial deposit has been drawn down whichever being the earlier. Request for replenishment will follow
standard Bank requirements. All replenishment applications will additionally be based upon Borrower
reconciled monthly bank statements for the special account. The Apex Division would disburse funds
from the Special Account to the PFIs for the financing of eligible sub-projects in accordance with
standard Bank procedures. In addition the Apex Division would:
i)           maintain the Loan Account, Special Account, and the consolidated Project
Accounts;
ii)          consolidate reimbursement applications received from the PFIs, through the
PMU, submission of withdrawal applications to the World Bank, on-lend and
channel the Loan funds to the PFIs and maintain adequate records of all Project
related expenditures;
iii)         maintain the loan accounts for the respective share of the Loan on-lent to each
PFI, and collection of principal, interest and other charges, that are payable by
the PFIs in accordance with the terms and conditions stipulated in the
subsidiary loan agreement;
iv)          assure the compliance with audit requirements in co-ordination with the PMU;
v)           provide the MOF, the PMU and the World Bank such information on the above
as they may reasonably request; and
vi)          the APEX  unit would work closely with the BOL's Bank Supervision
Department in assessing the initial and continuing compliance of participating
banks with the Bank's eligibility criteria.  This notwithstanding, the final
determination of the bank's eligibility to enter, and continue to participate, in

the PADP would rest with the Bank of Lithuania Banking Supervision
Department, subject to World Bank approval.
D. Role of the World Bank during Supervision
33.              Given the limited experience of implementing World Bank projects in Lithuania,
the range of donor co-financiers, the breadth of the TA package and the inexperience of potential
investors, there will be a major role for World Bank supervision. The establishment of the PMU will
provide effective initial implementation of the project but, to ensure that objectives are being met and
that problems are rapidly identified and solved, ongoing monitoring and supervision will be required.
Whilst the objectives of the Project are both clear defined and fixed, the implementation methodology
to achieve these objectives has been designed to be flexible so that the Project can respond to the on-
going transformation that is taking place within Lithuania. This greatly increases the importance of the
supervision exercise.
34.              Supervision highlights.  Since this is the first World Bank project for the
agricultural sector of Lithuania, there will be three supervision missions in each of the first two years.
Thereafter supervision missions will be twice yearly. Supervision will include:
(a)          a project start-up mission to check the operation, accounting and reporting
procedures;
(b)          a mid-term review to be carried out after 24 months; and
(c)          a project completion review to be carried out within six months of closing of
the Project.
35.              Objectives. The supervision exercise will study problems highlighted by the PMU
progress reports and review: the performance of implementing agencies including the PMU, RBC, the
Apex Unit of BOL, the ABL and other PFIs; the financial conditions of PFIs; the achievement of
specified measurable outputs and overall project objectives; changes in the business environment and
progress with privatisation; policy issues and conditionalities; and the performance and effectiveness of
the required Technical Assistance provided by donors. Supervision missions shall also take decisions on
cases which do not fit the normal project criteria and study the impact of the project on a range of
individual sub-borrowers. An overall objective is to adapt the project over time to meet changing
needs and market conditions.
36.              Outputs. An aide-memoir for each supervision mission will draw conclusions on
progress and recommend changes. The aide-memoir will be circulated to GOL, World Bank,
implementing agencies and donors. Back to office reports will also be prepared by World Bank staff.
37.             Mission participants. Supervision missions will ordinarily consist of the World
Bank Task Manager and a banking/financial specialist. Since the majority of the Technical Assistance



132                                                            Project Implementation Plan
programmes are directed towards investment in human capital a training specialist shall join the
supervision missions as required by the Task Manager. Additional specialists from the areas of
Marketing, Agricultural Economics/Policy, or Extension may be required to join supervision missions
from  time to time.  Since this is the first World Bank agricultural project in Lithuania a
disbursement/procurement specialist is also likely to be required. To improve cost-effectiveness, where
appropriate, World Bank Regional Mission staff for the Baltic Countries will be included. These staff
now have some experience from the existing World Bank programmes in the region. In accordance
with co-financing agreements, representatives from EU-PHARE and other donors will be invited to
participate in the major supervision missions. The exact number of participants in given supervision
missions is difficult to predict. The estimates given below are consequently very tentative.
III. IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES
A. Timebound Schedule
39.             Credit Component. PFIs will in the be eligible to utilise the Line-of-Credit for the
five years of the Project.
40.             Institutional and Human Resource Development Component. Detailed Terms of
Reference have been prepared for each Technical Assistance programme proposed to assist the
development of the Lithuanian agricultural and food sector and the rural economy. These TORs are
available upon request.  Summaries of the Project preparation, implementation and monitoring
activities are presented below in Chart 2.
B. Procurement Arrangements and Schedule
41.             Credit:  Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with World Bank
guidelines (issued in January 1995) customary for financial intermediary operations. In particular,
where the goods and works to be procured are estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent per
contract procurement will be undertaken according to normal commercial practice and where this limit
is exceeded procurement shall be undertaken in accordance with the International Shopping procedures
on the basis of three price quotations from two different countries. Since the maximum eligible sub-
loan to any individual borrower will be US$250,000 it is not expected that International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) procedures would be applied to sub-loans under this project. However, in the unlikely
event that special dispensation were allowed, contracts for the supply of goods and works with an
estimated value of US$ 500,000 or greater would be procured according to ICB procedures.
Proprietary items and those only available from one supplier may be acquired by direct contracting.
Procurement documentation shall be submitted to the World Bank for review prior to the first two
contracts to be procured by International Shopping and submitted by each PFI for any contract to be
procured by ICB.

42.             Technical Assistance:  All TA will be financed by bilateral and multilateral
donors. Procurement will be undertaken according to each donor's practices.
43.             Procurement Review. Procurement procedures shall regularly be reviewed by the
PMU and the PMU shall assist the World Bank supervision missions monitor and evaluate the
procurement practice of PFIs and sub-borrowers.

C. Disbursements
44.              The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over five years from
effectiveness. Evidence from the survey of Lithuanian farms undertaken during the sumnmer of 1994
and local expert opinion suggests that there is strong demand for long term credit from the agricultural
and food sectors in Lithuania. The major constraint upon effective utilisation of the Line-of-Credit is
likely to be the lack of experience of farmers, entrepreneurs and their advisors in undertaking studies of
the feasibility of intended investments ad the lack of experience of the loan officers of the PFIs in
undertaking the commercial assessment of loan applications. Thus, it is expected that only 25 % of the
loan will be disbursed in the first eighteen months of the Project. However, once there is greater
Lithuanian experience in these areas, it is expected that disbursement will become faster so that 30% of
the loan will be disbursed in the following 12 months and 45% in the remaining implementation period.
45.              In order to alleviate the constraints on the effective utilisation of the Line-of-Credit
it is vital that the Institutional and Human Resource Development component of the proposed project is
undertaken as a matter of urgency so as to assist the development of Lithuanian capability in
undertaking feasibility studies and loan evaluations. It is also important that the appropriate allocation
of scarce resources within the agricultural, food and rural sectors and between these and other sectors
of the Lithuanian economy is further encouraged by assistance for the development of a competitive
market based economy in Lithuania. The majority of Technical Assistance expenditure will therefore
be disbursed during the first two years of the project.
46.              The Line-of-Credit will be disbursed by the Apex Division of BOL retrospectively
to cover 100% of eligible sub-loans made by PFIs in the first eighteen months, 85% of eligible sub-
loans in the following year, and 75 % of eligible sub-loans thereafter.
47.              Funding for the Technical Assistance programmes linked to the Project will be
made according to the contractual obligations undertaken by the multilateral and bilateral donors and
the consultants appointed.

48.              Credit Component. Since the PFIs will bear the responsibility of repayment of the
World Bank Line-of-Credit, sub-loans will need to be assessed upon the ability of the borrower to
repay the loan and interest.
49.             Institutional and Humtan Resource Component Lithuanian public institutions have
limited experience of cost recovery for publicly supplied services. It has been noted that whilst some
services may be justified upon public good grounds, other services directly benefit the users and if not
charged for represent a transfer from tax payers to the users. Such a practice often implies a transfer
from less to more wealthy.  Consequently, Technical Assistance programmes will encourage the
adoption of cost recovery practices.
E. Project Risks
50.              Macroeconomic Stability. Currently the International Monetary Fund is assisting
GOL in using a currency board arrangement to maintain a fixed Exchange Rate between the Lita and
the dollar.  This policy has been instrumental in the successful decrease in the rate of inflation
experienced in Lithuania.  A major risk however relates to the extent to which such sound
macroeconomic polices can be maintained for both political and economic reasons. Such uncertainty
increases borrowing risks by introducing domestic and foreign price uncertainty.
51.             Appropriate Business and Banking Skills. The other main area of risk relates to the
uncertainty of ensuring that potential investors can undertake, or have undertaken, appropriate studies
of the feasibility of investments and the ability of bank loan officers to appropriately assess the loan
applications. To the extent that a great deal of the Institutional and Human Resource Development
component of the Project is directed to improving Lithuanian capabilities in these areas this risk should
be appropriately mitigated.
F. Loan Covenants for Implementation
52.              A complete list of loan covenants to be monitored during the Project will be
included within the Staff Appraisal Report.
IV. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
A. Actions to Monitor Development Objectives
53.             Individual TORs within the TA package contain clearly defined measurable
outputs. This tight definition of objectives and outputs for the TA component will simplify monitoring
of development objectives. The project indicators below are derived from the planned measurable
outputs of the TA component with additions for the credit component.

54.              Baseline, mid term and end of project surveys of a constant sample of farmers will
be a central feature in monitoring and evaluating the success of this project.
55.              The project indicators will form the basis for much of the supervision plan and
particularly will be used in the one year implementation review, the mid-term review and the project
completion review. Monitoring will be strengthened by the involvement of World Bank staff and
representatives of donors.
56.              The need to fine tune or restructure the project after the mid-term review or earlier
supervision missions will be based on the following project indicators.
B. Project Indicators
57.              Although a number of indicators can be measured in absolute terms, many must be
considered in relative terms as the project proceeds.
58.              Key Physical Indicators of successful TA implementation. These are specified
in the individual TA TORs. Highlights are as follows:
Numbers trained:
farmers and others trained in basic accounts and investment feasibility;
Agricultural Company employees and managers trained in management;
individuals trained in food marketing; and
practising and potential exporters trained.
Auction established.
Farm Accounts Survey conducted annually.
Processor associations receiving detailed export support.
The production of a rural enterprise guide.
Four women's community initiatives established.
Women Farmers Trained
Auction/wholesale manuals produced.
TV/Press/Radio campaigns on rural development opportunities, co-operation,
accounting and investment, auction/wholesale principles, technical topics for
farmers.
Business seminar series for agro-industry, food processing sector.
Videos on understanding accounts, business planning, marketing, business
management
Range of written material including training manuals, workbooks and
promotional booklets.
59.              Level of improvement in farmer understanding and awareness. Measured by the
opinion survey of a constant sample sf farmers (baseline, mid-term and end of project surveys).
Improvements measured in understanding and awareness of the following:
simple credit and investment processes;
basic marketing principles;

*             measuring financial performance;
*             currently deficient technical skills in forage conservation, feeding principles,
housing requirements, etc.;
*             small scale business opportunities;
*             value of co-operation;
*             auctions and wholesale market principles;
role and use of banks; and
*             use of extension services.
60.              Number and quality of Lithuanian experts. This will be assessed for all fields of
Technical Assistance as outlined in the TORs including marketing, market structures, accounts,
feasibility and business planning, investment support, rural lending. This will be partly measured
through the level of Lithuanian participation in providing training, changes in education courses,
number of new business courses, perceived quality of graduates, Lithuanian expert commentary in
press and media and other local initiatives.
61.              Physical Indicators of Farm Improvement -The ongoing survey of farmer opinions,
credit line records and regular monitoring visits to farm businesses throughout Lithuania will gather
evidence for the following improvement indicators.
new/improved buildings;
drainage and other on-farm infrastructure developments;
new and second-hand machinery investments;
increases in livestock numbers on individual units;
growth in average farmed area;
improving profits;
improved attitude to security and ability to respond to change;
specialisation's since start of project; and
*             diversification's since start of project.
62.              Numbers of food processors, agricultural traders and agricultural service
companies and range of Lithuanian food products for home and export markets.
63.              Profitability and business growth. Monitored through establishment under the TA
package of the Farm Accounts Survey.

64.               Credit Component Indicators.  Rate of disbursement of the credit line to the
target sector shall be measured by:
*             total amount disbursed and repaid;
*             average size of loan and size distribution;
*             proportion of funds disbursed in loans of less than $50,000;
number and percentage of total loans given which are smaller than $50,000;
and
*             the allocation of funds between on-farm credit and credit for agro and forest
industries.
65.               Failure rate' of investments supported. The presence of failures is not entirely a bad
indicator as it shows that risks are being taken. TA support and good pre-investment advice should,
however, ensure a greater proportion of successes. The type of investment which fails should also be
monitored. Loan repayment default rate will be monitored by Type of Investment, such as:
farm (private, Agricultural Company);
*             agro-processing (new, old);
farm services (new, old); and
other rural businesses.
66.               The actual rate of return achieved on investments shall also be monitored and
compared to those predicted in the feasibility studies that formed the basis of the loan applications.
