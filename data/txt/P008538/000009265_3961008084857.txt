MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE IBRD TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA
FOR A PRIVATE AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Lithuania in the amount of US $30 million to help finance a project which would
assist in the development of the private agriculture sector in Lithuania. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard LIBOR-based variable interest rate applicable for US dollar single currency loan, with a maturity
of 20 years, including 5 years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent through participating
financial institutions (PFIs) to project beneficiaries. EU-PHARE and bilateral donors (Finland and
Sweden) have agreed to cofinance the Institutional and Human Resources Development Component of the
project. A preliminary agreement has been reached with Denmark to provide additional cofinancing.
Background
2.           Agriculture is the second largest sector in the Lithuanian economy and has been one of
the country's main sources of income, employment, and foreign exchange earnings. By the end of 1994,
agriculture accounted for nearly 23% of GDP, employed about 25% of the labor force, and produced 24%
of all exports. Traditionally the sector produced a surplus, mostly in livestock products, which accounted
for 67% of total agricultural output. Crop production, the bulk of which has been grain for the livestock
industry, has averaged 30% of total agricultural output for most of the past decade. By 1994, agricultural
production was about 35% lower than 1987-89 average levels, while exports declined by roughly 50%.
The livestock industry has been particularly hard hit. Crop production has also declined and over 20%
of arable land was left idle in 1994'.
3.           Despite these recent problems, Lithuanian agriculture has the potential to become a reliable
source of income and employment for the rural population. This will require structural adjustments in the
sector induced through policy reforms and rational investment strategies. Future production levels and
patterns will have to be determined by market conditions based on comparative advantages. Already,
Lithuania has been quite successfuil in redirecting its agricultural exports to non-former Soviet Union
(FSU) markets. There are also signs that investments are being made in the sector as farmers, with
improving agricultural terms of trade, start to regain confidence.
Policy Reforms
4.           Macro stabilization. Since regaining independence in 1991, Lithuania has embarked on
a reform program aimed at reorienting its economy away from a centrally planned system toward a
market-based one. In that context, the Government of Lithuania (GOL) has made substantial progress in
economic stabilization and structural reforms. Inflation declined from over 1,000% in 1992 to 410% in
1993. In 1994 the macro situation stabilized to the extent that inflation was down to 45%. The estimated
inflation for 1995 is even lower, at around 30%. Since 1993 the country has had a fully convertible and
stable currency, the Litas (LTL), pegged to the US dollar. Prices have been liberalized, a new trade regime
is being developed, and the country has made progress in reorienting its trade. The share of non-FSU
exports to total exports increased from 28% in 1992 to over 50% in 1994. Moreover, there has been
significant progress in the privatization of banking institutions, small businesses, and agricultural land.
More detailed analysis of the sector is available in Lithuanian Agriculture and Food Sector Rteview, IBRD #1311-LT,
issued on April 14, 1995.



- 2 -
5.            Agricultural Reforms to Date. The GOL is also committed to the transformation of the
agricultural sector to compete in a market economy - a transition that includes agricultural policy reform,
land reform, and privatization. The GOL's initial response during the post-Soviet era was to protect
farmers; however such protectionist policies are now being progressively removed. To date the GOL has
made considerable progress in a number of areas: (a) land restitution is at an advanced stage; (b)
privatization of small-scale processing enterprises has been significant; (c) the C,OL does not sets
procurement quotas (except for a strategic food reserve) or controls consumer prices; (d) retail margin
controls on foodstuffs were removed in early 1995; (e) import tariffs on foodstuffs, with few exceptions,
were reduced to more moderate levels under the agreed Extended Fund Facility (EFF 1 program with the
IMF; (f) bankruptcy laws have been enacted; and (g) competition laws and fair practice supervisory roles
have been strengthened.
6.            Reversal of Policy Reforms. In recent months, the Govemment of ,ithuania has been
subject to tremendous political pressure to take into greater account the social impact of the transition in
the agricultural sector as well as the protectionism of the Westem developed economies vis-a-vis imported
agricultural goods. Due to increasing economic and social hardship, particularly for farmers and others
in the rural sector, the Government has re-introduced minimum price supports for selected commodities
and has slowed the elimination of subsidized credit. These recent moves are clearly a reversal of the
previous liberal policy reforms achieved by the Government. Nevertheless, the new supports are limited
in scope, and while they would delay the liberalization of the sector, they would not be able to reverse
the structural reforms already being taking place in the sector. The minimum marginal price support
scheme covers only a small number of products (milk, beef, pork, rapeseed, buckwheat and flax), and the
LTL 137 million allocated for this in the 1995 budget was equivalent to less than 40/. of the total Gross
Value of Agricultural Output in that year. Furthermore, the recent trend in the market has led to market
prices often exceeding the set minimum prices for most of the products, hence rendering the price support
scheme ineffective and harmless. Additionally, contrary to the Government's announcement of gradual
reduction, the budgetary allocation for subsidized credit has declined by more than 5-% from LTL 110
million in 1994 to LTL 50 million in 1995.
Banking Sector Development
7.            Current Banking Sector Crisis. Like the neighboring Baltic countries, Lithuania's banking
sector is going through a difficult period. During the last weeks of 1995 a banking cri. is emerged, which
compelled the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) to suspend operations of two of the larger private commercial
banks. In addition, 13 other smaller private commercial banks are in the process of liqjidation. All three
state banks--the State Commercial Bank, the Savings Banks, and the Agricultural Bank of Lithuania (ABL)
have insufficient capital bases. It is evident that drastic changes are required to reform the banking sector.
8.            The banking difficulties have a number of causes, the most fundamental of which are the
large imbalances in the economy which have created a "quasi-fiscal" deficit. Commercial banks have been
pressured to finance this deficit, resulting in a significant volume of non-performing loans. Banks
themselves continue to have weak lending skills, some have been subject to fraud and insider abuse, and
have a tendency to overreach themselves in terms of asset volume and the development of branch
networks. The supervisory function of the BOL, although significantly improved in recent years, remains
weak and the BOL has not been sufficiently independent.



- 3 -
9.           Recognizing the need for banking sector reform, the Government has requested World
Bank support in the form of the Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project, approved in April
1995. The main objectives are to assist the GOL in its pursuit of enterprise and financial sector reforms.
In addition, a Structural Adjustment Loan, aimed in part at stabilizing the banking system, is under
preparation by the Lithuanian authorities, with the joint support of the World Bank and the IMF. The
objective of this program is to restore solvency to the banking system as well as to establish and enforce
a new legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework in order to restore discipline to the system.
10.          The Government's Commitment to Strengthen the Rural Financial System. Against this
background, the proposed Private Agriculture Development Project (PADP) has been designed to provide
immediate support to strengthen the rural financial system while complementing the more-broadly based
financial and enterprise sector reforms. The PADP would help create a viable rural credit delivery system
to fill the vacuum in commercial credit for farmers and small-scale rural enterprises. In addition, the
PADP would also address other sectoral issues hindering the transformation of agriculture into a
competitive and sustainable source of income and employment.
11.           One private commercial bank, which has already satisfied the eligib! lity criteria for PFIs,
has committed to participate in the proposed PADP. Yet the GOL has also recognized that, with a
network of 46 branches throughout the country and a well-established rural clientele, the ABL is likely
to be the main channel for rural credit. The GOL has already initiated the first steps to restructure and
recapitalize the ABL by: (a) writing-off "political loans" from the ABL's portfolio; (b) eliminating the
channelling of political loans through the financial system; (c) increasing the ABL's capital; and (d)
separating the fiscal agency roles of the ABL from its commercial lending. By diverting recapitalization
funds from the Agricultural Support Fund (the main source of agricultural subsidies), the proposed project
would achieve the dual goals of reducing ad-hoc subsidies in agriculture while increasing the ABL capital
without additional budgetary pressure.
12.          The new management of the ABL is fully committed to the transformation of the ABL
into a financially viable and self-sustaining commercial bank. It has already committed itself to an
intensive institutional development support program with foreign technical assistance. Consistent with the
general banking sector support, the proposed PADP would provide a comprehensive Institutional
Development Program (IDP) through a two year twinning arrangement with an experienced foreign bank.
TA activities for strengthening and improving credit management in ABL and other participating financial
institutions (PFIs), had already begun in late 1995, with a team of long-term consultants financed by EU-
PHARE, thus beginning the first steps towards creating a viable rural financial system.
13.          Immediately following the ABL recapitalization, the Government Vill be the majority
shareholder; however, the Govemment has clearly stated that this would be a temporary step in the process
towards full privatization of the ABL. In the interim, the Government would ensure full autonomy for
the ABL in management, including lending operations. By December 1997, the Board of the ABL will
prepare a detailed plan, with a definite time-schedule, for privatization.
14.          While the ABL would not remain immune in the event of a large-scale banking crisis, it
has a number of strengths that give every indication that it would weather such a c-isis. These include
the partial Government ownership, strong management, and the quality of the TA already in place. It is
expected that by mid-1996, the new operational guidelines for credit operations would become effective
and the first round of training of loan officers would be completed before disbursement of the proposed
project would begin. It is expected that the ABL would meet all the eligibility criteria within a short
period from the date of the loan effectiveness.

Project Objectives
15.          The main objectives of the project are to assist the Govermment in the development of a
viable, private agriculture sector and foster economic growth in rural areas by providing a combination
of financial and technical assistance. These objectives would be achieved by addressing some of the key
policy and institutional constraints through the deepening of ongoing policy dialogues and a
comprehensive institutional and human resource development program. The main outcomes of the project
would be a strengthened rural financial intermediation system and the establishment of commercial lending
in the agricultural sector. In addition, Lithuanian capacities in environmentally sound approaches to
agriculture would be strengthened through improvement in agricultural extension services, provision of
advisory services to agro-processing industries, and the training of personnel from PFIs in environmental
review methods.
16.          Another important objective of the project is to alleviate poverty and social difficulties
in rural areas due to increasing unemployment caused by the structural adjustment associated with
transition, particularly among women and pensioners. Likewise, the continued process of land restitution
will result in the creation of many small farms, a significant number of which will be unable to generate
sufficient income to meet household needs, and would therefore require alternative, off-farm, sources of
income. The PADP has been designed as a first step in addressing these issues.
Project Description
17.          The Project has two components:
The Rural Credit Component (US $46.7 million equivalent, 85% of total project cosi) consists of:
(a) A Credit Line to provide US $30 million equivalent to PFIs for the financing of investment and
seasonal working capital for eligible sub-borrowers. PFIs would be fully auttonomous in the
selection of borrowers, approval of subprojects, and determination of lending terms. Beneficiaries
must be private investors with a minimum of 51% private ownership, and subprojects must be in
compliance with environmental regulations specifically designed for credit operations.
(b)  An Institutional Development Program (IDP) to provide TA for PFIs in areas crucial to the
restructuring and strengthening of rural credit delivery systems. PFIs would adoort improved rural
credit management systems with new lending guidelines and procedures, and loan officers would
receive necessary training. The ABL would receive substantial support through a twinning
arrangement with an experienced international bank. Appropriate training would be provided to
PFIs in environmental screening consistent with the environmental guidelines of Lithuania.
The Institutional and Human Resource Development Component (US $8.1 million equivalent, 15% of
the project cost). The Institutional and Human Resource Development Component (IHDDC) would provide
TA to improve the efficiency of the institutional framework and create an environment conducive to
private sector development. The main areas of TA include: (a) expediting land reform and development
of land markets and the mortgage system; (b) strengthening the farm extension service )n the delivery of
advice on technology skills, the basics of farm business management and accounting and investment
planning; (c) improving the collection and dissemination of market information, domestic and foreign
trade promotion, and aiding in marketing; (d) establishment of the Rural Business Dexelopment Center



- 5 -
to better coordinate and strengthen the Lithuanian consulting capacity in business planning, farm
management and accounting, and assist potential beneficiaries in the preparation of feasibility studies for
investments; (e) training loan officers of participating financial intermediaries in agricultural lending,
including credit risk assessment; and (f) creating alternative employment opportunities by providing
vocational training for the rural population, with particular attention to women. The World Bank and
other donors would jointly supervise this component through the Project Management Unit (PMU), which
would have prime responsibility for coordination and implementation of the component.
Project Cost and Financing
18.          The total project cost is estimated at US $54.8 million (LTL 219.2 million). The Bank
loan would finance 55% of estimated total project costs, which is equivalent to about 83.3% of the
projected foreign exchange component. Donors' parallel cofinancing for about US $8.1 million equivalent
would finance 14.8% of total project costs. Sub-borrowers' contributions have been calculated at the
minimum levels of 15% and 20%, respectively, for farm credit and agro- and forestry industries. The
Government has requested that the Loan be a LIBOR-based variable rate single currency loan (SCL) in
US dollars, based on the Government's assessment of its national foreign debt obligations.
19.          Retroactive Financing. Up to US $2.5 million, equivalent to 8.3% of the Loan amount,
would be financed retroactively for eligible subloans approved and disbursed by PFIs (starting from
October 1, 1995), provided all lending criteria and procurement guidelines are followed as stipulated in
the Loan Agreement.
Project Implementation
20.          Overall Proiect Management. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) lhas established a joint
World Bank and EU Project Management Unit (PMU) with TA support by EU-PHARE. The PMU would
be responsible for coordinating project implementation. MOA does not yet have adequate capacity or
experience in implementing a large investment project that is also linked to substantial policy reforms.
The proposed project would strengthen MOA's capacity for policy formulation, project management, and
coordination of donor-financed TA activities. The PMU would be headed by a director at the level of
Deputy Minister and staffed with personnel who possess adequate technical and professional skills. In
addition, a long-term resident advisor would assist the PMU director for the duration of the project
implementation. The necessary training in World Bank procurement and disbursement procedures,
monitoring, and evaluation, would be provided for PMU staff. The first round of training is scheduled
to take place at the project launch workshop immediately following Board approval.
21.          Implementation of the Rural Credit Component. The MOF, through the APEX Unit in
the Bank of Lithuania, would on-lend the credit line funds to eligible PFIs, which would, in turn, extend
subloans to the ultimate intended project beneficiaries. The PFIs would be selected according to eligibility
criteria which include full compliance with the Bank of Lithuania regulations, capital adequacy, sound
financial policies, and institutional capacity with professional staff adequately trained and specialized in
medium- and long-term investment lending, and a sufficient network of branches in rural area. According
to sub-borrower demand, the PFIs would lend in US$ or local currency, and they would bear the full
credit risk.



- 6 -
22.          Implementation of Institutional and Human Resources Development Component (IHDC).
The IHDC would be implemented by respective Lithuanian counterparts, including the Lithuania
Agricultural Advisory Service, Lithuanian Women Farmers Association, and Farmers Union, with the
assistance of foreign experts. Local consultants would participate to the maximum extent possible. A
Rural Business Development Center (RBC) would be established to foster the private sector provision of
business consultancy services to farmers, agro-processors, agro-services, and rural entrepreneurs, and
enhance the provision of services by existing business consultancy agencies. The IHDC and the Rural
Credit Components will be implemented by the respective counterparts over three years for the IHDC and
five years for the Rural Credit Component under the supervision of the PMU.
Project Sustainability
23.          The project's support for GOL's policy reform and TA program, which has been designed
specifically to address the constraints that the sector is facing today, would create a competitive
environment conducive to private economic activity. Creation of land ownership rights and legally
binding collateral and strengthening of PFIs' lending skills would substantially reduce risks for financial
intermediaries.  Support to strengthen agricultural extension and training, and tlhe farm  business
management capabilities of the project beneficiaries, would reduce the risks in lending to new private
entrepreneurs. The rural credit component would demonstrate the benefits of commercial credit and help
establish the necessary discipline among borrowers. As a result of this project and the accompanying
sectoral adjustments, by the year 2000, farm and agro-processing credit provided by independent, private
banking institutions could become part of the national credit system.
Lessons Learned from Previous Bank / IDA Involvement
24.          The project draws on the Bank's previous experience in integrated agricultural
development projects in Central and Eastern European countries as well as on lessons learned from the
difficulties presently facing the FSU countries. In particular, the project design has incorporated the
lessons learned in the Latvia Agricultural Development Project (LADP). Supervision of LADP has taught
us that building a new financial institution is costly and takes a long time. Provision of specific supports
to potential investors in preparation of "bankable" business plans, is critical in a country which does not
yet have a business and legal environment conducive to promoting private investment. In addition, lessons
learned about coordination and cofinancing with donors on TA have led to establishment of a joint World
Bank-EU Project Management Unit which would improve efficiency in TA e:oordination and
implementation.
25.          A lesson learned from the slow disbursement of other Bank-financed prcjects in Lithuania
is that substantial and specific preparatory work for implementation is necessary to expedite the start-up
of implementation. Implementation of the proposed project would commence promptly after Board
approval, since the necessary TA for PFIs are already in place, preparation of new lending manuals and
training of new loan officers has already begun, and PFIs have started to develop a pipeline of potential
subloans. Furthermore, in order to satisfy the condition for loan effectiveness as soon as possible, a draft
fiscal agreement and draft subsidiary loan agreements have been prepared and are currently being
finalized.



-7-
Rationale for Bank Involvement
26.           The Government has requested the Bank's assistance in agriculture sector reform. The
proposed project is the first investment operation in the agricultural sector in Lithiuania to be supported
by the Bank Group and would support the emerging private agricultural sector.2 Market failures stemming
from imperfect information flows, inadequate institutional and human resources, and the remaining legacy
of past interventionist policies have prevented farners and small-scale entrepreneurs from gaining access
to commercial long-term credit. A lack of lending skills and suitable funds has also aggravated the
situation. The project would provide interim measures to overcome these transitional constraints by
providing long-term credits and comprehensive institutional and human resource development TA support.
In addition to enhancing the financial viability of agricultural investment, the project would reduce risks
in agricultural lending stemming from lack of collateral, high transaction costs, etc. Substantial TA
support for participating banks would strengthen the credit delivery system to the sector. In addition, EU-
PHARE is planning to establish a credit guarantee scheme which would be directed at small-scale
borrowers. The Bank has had and would continue to have an instrumental role in (coordinating external
technical assistance.
27.           The project would also help strengthen Government policy-making and implementation
capability at a critical juncture by providing opportunities for policy dialogues. Thi . project is consistent
with the priorities of private and financial sector development strategies outlined in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS), which was discussed by the Board during the presentation of the Klaipeda Environment
Project (Ln 3816- LT) on December 8, 1994.
Agreed Actions
28.           Actions Taken Prior to Negotiations. Prior to negotiations, the Govemment has prepared
and conveyed to the Bank the timetable for recapitalization plan for ABL; and the (Covernment, with the
Agricultural Bank of Lithuania, has prepared and submitted to the Bank a new "Statement of Policies"
which clearly delineates its new commercial lending principles and autonomy; and the ABL has submitted
clearly defined TA modules, TOR, and a set of monitorable indicators for the institutional development
program.
29.           Agreements Reached. During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a) annual reduction of the total agricultural subsidies by no less than 4% in real terrms from the previous
fiscal year's level; (b) recapitalization of the ABL would be completed within six months from the project
effectiveness; (c) after ABL becomes eligible to participate in the PADP, a part of the funds disbursed
under the credit line for eligible subloans could be used by Government to replace bonds issued for the
recapitalization of ABL; (d) adoption of the new rural credit manual and guidelines for the ABL's entire
lending operations; (e) the amount and the effective date for the retroactive financing; (f) the authorized
amount and location of the special account; (g) disbursement percentages and proceduires; (h) a maximum
subloan size of US $250,000; (i) compliance with the appraisal procedures, and on-lending arrangements
and other modalities; (j) compliance with the accounting and auditing and reporting reluirements, and with
environmental standards acceptable to the Bank; (k) appropriate project management and supervision
arrangements; and (1) roles of the APEX unit and its responsibilities.
2      An Import Rehabilitation Loan for $60 million equivalent has provided some support for importation of needed
agricultural inputs.

30.          Conditions of Effectiveness.  Prior to effectiveness, conclusion of a Fiscal Agency
Agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Lithuania, and a Subsidiaty Loan Agreement
between the APEX on behalf of the Ministry of Finance and at least one eligible PFI would be required.
Gender Issues
31.          While the proposed project would provide additional income and employment
opportunities for poor farmers and the rural population as a whole, it would particularly help improve the
living standards of poor women. There is considerable evidence that unemploymen among women is
greater in rural areas and there are even more limited opportunities for them to apply for credit. The
PADP would provide women with equal access to credit.  The Telsiai District chosen for the rural
employment pilot project component of the PADP has formed a working committee consisting of
representatives of the Lithuanian Women Farmers Association, the Farmer's Union, and the Association
of Women Professionals, to work closely with the Swedish TA team in identifying and promoting
employment opportunities for the rural poor, particularly women.
Poverty Category
32.          Program  of Tarzeted Interventions.  The proportion of the poor among project
beneficiaries is significantly larger than the national average. The average agricultural wage declined from
97% of the national average in 1990 to less than 50% in 1994. As the bulk of rural poverty is the result
of the dramatic decline in rural employment, a program is included in the project to train those
unemployed or underemployed in rural areas in alternate skills, and help them start their own businesses,
as well as providing increased access to credit.
Environmental Aspects
33.          The project has been rated as environmental screening category "Ii." The proposed
operation is expected to have positive environmental effects through the promotion of improved land use
practices, farming methods, and agricultural product processing. The proposed projeci is consistent with
the Lithuanian environmental assessment procedures and the provisions of Operational Directive 4.01
'Environmental Assessment.' The project would contribute towards strengthening of local capacities in
environmentally sustainable approaches to agricultural development.
Program Objective Categories
34.          The project relates directly to the Bank's objectives in supporting orivate sector and
financial sector development. The targeted program would alleviate rural poverty by creating altemative
income generation opportunities through training, enhanced information flows for business opportunities,
and provision of investment credit.

Participatory Approach
35.          The project was prepared through the joint efforts of the Goverirment of Lithuania,
concerned Ministries, NGOs, and grassroots level agencies, with support from foreign and local experts
financed by a Policy and Human Resources Development Grant (PHRD). Two working groups were set
up by the Ministry of Agriculture and the Agrarian Committee of the Parliament (Seimas) respectively,
and held regular briefing sessions with the project preparation team to discuss the needs of the agricultural
and food sectors and to disseminate information on the project. NGOs were also regularly consulted so
that the strategy, as it developed, was consistent with the needs of the broad rural constituency. During
project preparation, a farm survey was carried out by the Lithuanian Agricultural Advisory Services and
the Association of Agricultural Companies with the help of expatriate experts to better identify farmers'
requirements in terms of financial and technical assistance. The results of the survey were widely
disseminated and used as a focus of debate and were used in project design to reflect the actual conditions
and constraints of the potential beneficiaries. Findings of the Bank-prepared Lithuanian Agriculture and
Food Sector Review, which were extensively discussed, have also been incorporated during project design.
36.          Terms of Reference for the Institutional and Human Resource Development Component
were drafted on the basis of the needs identified by both public authorities and NG( )s, circulated among
wide audiences for comment, discussed in respective working committees, and redrafted to target the needs
of project beneficiaries. In addition, comments from donors have been solicited and incorporated.
Throughout the project preparation, strong support was received from bilateral donors and the EU, which
also participated in Bank-led preparation missions.
Project Benefits
37.          The project would contribute towards the creation of a sound rural financing system while
complementing the Bank's on-going efforts in banking sector reforms. The project would provide interim
measures to overcome the constraints of economic transition by providing long-term credit and permanent
working capital. Furthermore, TA for land reform efforts (the completion of which would require many
years beyond the project life) would expedite registration of land titles, help create a mortgage system with
more tangible collateral, and allow consolidation of fragmented farmland through transactions in a land
market. The credit line provided under the project would finance private economic activity and stimulate
the supply response. Improved productivity and environmental management of primary and processing
enterprises are other consequences of the project, together with increased competitiveness and enhanced
marketability of Lithuanian products.
38.          The project would provide an opportunity to instill discipline, both in borrowers and
financial intermediaries, and would reduce risks in agricultural lending stemming from the lack of
collateral and high transaction costs. In addition, the project would enhance financial viability of
agricultural investment through strengthening extension, marketing support, etc. l'he Government has
decided that recapitalization funds for the ABL would be diverted from the main source of subsidies, the
Agricultural Support Fund, thus reducing funds available for subsidies. The project would also provide
an opportunity to reduce agricultural subsidies, hence lessening the fiscal burden on the Central
Government's budget.
39.          Additionally, the project would, at a grass-roots level, help identify alternative income
opportunities and provide the corresponding training to pursue those opportunities. Such efforts would
combat the growing rural poverty and unemployment which disproportionately affects women. After a



- 10 -
successful pilot period, this program  would be expanded nation-wide.  Other benefits include
improvements in marketing capacity, linkage between research and extension, and train ng in business and
management skills.
Risks
40.          As part of the ongoing efforts of the GOL to move to a market based, private agriculture
sector, the project obviously carries some risks; chief among them are: (a) recurrent macro-economic
instability; (b) possible political instability; (c) market and exchange rate fluctuations; (d) weakness of the
emerging financial sector; (e) unfamiliarity on the part of the MOA with project implementation
procedures, thus delaying the project; and (f) financial risk inherent in new, private fan-ning, i.e. farmers'
limited capacity to repay credit. The first two are beyond the control of the proposec project. Given a
commitment by the Government of Lithuania to continue economic reform, as evideiiced by the recent
agreement with the IMF on an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and dialogue with the Bank on the proposed
Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL), these risks would be somewhat mitigated. The strengthening of
financial intermediaries' institutional capacity to assess credit risks and market analysis, as well as farm
and business management advisory services, would counteract some market and financial risks.
41.          The Government is only gradually phasing out subsidized credit. There is a risk that it
would "crowd out" the Bank's credit line and other commercial credit. However, as subsidized credit is
purely for short-term working capital, and is limited in size and declining, it is not expected to have a
major impact on the proposed project. There is also a risk that the Government could adopt policies that
jeopardize its macro-economic stabilization by increasing expenditure or decreasing taxation revenue,
which would place upward pressure on the inflation rate and jeopardize the functions of the Currency
Board. Similarly, in response to rising unemployment and the international uncompetitiveness of its
exports, the Government could undertake a devaluation of the currency or undertake protectionist trade
policies that in the long run would hurt the transformation of the agriculture secto -. This could also
jeopardize macro-economic stability. These macro-economic and sectoral issues are addressed through the
EFF criteria agreed upon by the Government in negotiation with the International Monetary Fund and
under the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan.
Recommendation
42.          1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
