1.05      The first three NES projects are sufficiently advanced to assess
their effectiveness. Initially, delays in budget preparation and receipt of
funds by the nucleus estates, slowed implementation. To resolve this, GOI
has simplified financial procedures with automatic release of funds for the
first two quarters to the estates. Smallholder and estate plantings are now
on schedule, with the planting or rehabilitation of about 46,900 ha of
rubber, 10,000 ha of oil palm and 3,300 ha of coconuts (Table 1.1). Field
development is good, with total plantings for NES I, II, and III, already
52% completed. The construction of smallholder infrastructure, however, has
been less satisfactory and the movement of smallholders to the project areas
at times has been behind schedule. At certain locations this causes labor
shortages for further project construction and maintenance of tree crop
plantings. When building roads, water supplies, village facilities and
settler housing, the central and provincial governments and nucleus estates
need to carefully plan and coordinate their inputs. To facilitate this, NES
III and IV initiated several changes in project design and organization.
The nucleus estates now have greater autonomy in designing and implementing
the smallholder components and this has improved the timeliness of infra-
structure construction. The DGE has estabished a special team (Team Khusus)
to assist the nucleus estates, particularly with coordinating agencies
engaged in project works. NES IV and V contain funds to commence prepara-
tory works for the succeeding projects. These cover key start-up activities
such as nursery establishment, access roads, and laborer housing. While all
these activities have considerably helped project implementation, the Team
Khusus needed strengthening to expand and upgrade its project formulation,
design and supervision activities. NES V commenced this, and provides
considerable consultant services to Team Khusus which would enable it give
greater technical assistince to the estates in project area selection,
project area and village design, tree crop establishment and processing
facility construction. These services would also assist Team Khusus give
more attention to the timely disbursing of project funds, and prepare it to
play a much larger role in the preparation, design and supervision of Bank
assisted projects. Despite these problems the DGE has well prepared and
implemented NES projects. It played a key role in preparing the difficult
(involving land redistribution) West Java components of NES V and this
project. Progress with tree crop plantings are now excellent; and disburse-
ments, which at end-1980 were 11% of total funds allocated to the first four
projects, are presently (mid-December 1981) 20% of these loans.
Project Formulation
1.06      This project would be the sixth in the NES series.  By using PTP XII
and PTP XXIII to transfer technology to smallholders and settle them on predo-
minantly tree crop holdings, it meets the GOI's desire for using the technical
and managerial resources of the public sector estates to promote smallholder
development. It also would intensify land use and farmer productivity in West
Java and Bengkulu, raise smallholder incomes by increasing food crop, rubber
and coconut oil production for local and export markets; and assist stop the
eroding and degrading of project lands in West Java.

1. BACKGROUND AND PROJECT AREA
General
1l01      Under its nucleus estates and smallholders development program, the
Government of Indonesia (GOI) has requested Bank assistance to develop about
28,000 ha of tree crops (rubber and coconuts),, food crops and house gardens in
West Java, Bengkulu and Maluku provinces with the public sector estates
PTP XII, PTP XXIII, and PNP XXVIII as development agents. The project would
immediately benefit some 8,450 families in the first two provinces and,
through estate development in the other, set :he stage for additional
smallholder investments at a later time. it would also include technical
assistance to the Directorate General of Estai:es (DGE) and the participating
PNP/PTPs.
1.02      GOI identified the project with Bank assistance, and it reflects the
national needs and priorities outlined in the Third Five-Year Plan
(Repelita III, April 1979-March 1984). GOI aiad the Bank prepared the project,
using feasibility and resource survey studies by PTP XII, PTP XXIII,
PNP XXVIII and the consultant firm P.T. Agriconsult International. This
report is based on material contained in the above studies, and the findings
of an appraisal mission composed of Messrs. M. Saddington, C. Carlier (Bank),
T. Phillips, L. Gullan, P. Durham (Commonwealth Development Corporation), and
W. Cooke (consultant), which visited Indonesia in August 1981.
1.03      GOI's major objectives in the agricaltural and rural sectors, and
its development strategies, are detailed in thie Staff Appraisal Report of the
Nucleus Estates and Smallholders V Project, May 6, 1981 (SAR NES V), and would
not be described again here. This report also outlines the Bank Group's
agricultural lending strategy, describes the rubber, palm oil and coconut
subsectors, and lists the Bank Group's lending in these subsectors.
The NES Projects
1.04      Recognizing the scarce technical and managerial expertise available
within GOI to implement rural development projects, GOI has increasingly
sought to use the technical and managerial resources of the public sector
estates to promote and guide smallholder development. The Bank, since
November 1977, has helped finance five nucleus estates and smallholders
projects. When fully developed, these projects would settle/resettle some
49,000 smallholder families, developing for them about 66,000 ha of rubber,
27,000 ha of oil palm, 10,000 ha of coconuts, and associated food crop and
house garden areas. For the nucleus estates, they would develop about
44,000 ha of rubber, 18,000 ha of oil palm, and 6,000 ha of coconuts.

1.05      The first three NES projects are sufficiently advanced to assess
their effectiveness.  Initially, delays in budget preparation and receipt of
funds by the nucleus estates, slowed implementation. To resolve this, GOI
has simplified financial procedures with automatic release of funds for the
first two quarters to the estates. Smallholder and estate plantings are now
on schedule, with the planting or rehabilitation of about 46,900 ha of
rubber, 10,000 ha of oil palm and 3,300 ha of coconuts (Table 1.1). Field
development is good, with total plantings for NES I, II, and III, already
52% completed. The construction of smallholder infrastructure, however, has
been less satisfactory and the movement of smallholders to the project areas
at times has been behind schedule. At certain locations this causes labor
shortages for further project construction and maintenance of tree crop
plantings. When building roads, water supplies, village facilities and
settler housing, the central and provincial governments and nucleus estates
need to carefully plan and coordinate their inputs. To facilitate this, NES
III and IV initiated several changes in project design and organization.
The nucleus estates now have greater autonomy in designing and implementing
the smallholder components and this has improved the timeliness of infra-
structure construction. The DGE has estabished a special team (Team Khusus)
to assist the nucleus estates, particularly with coordinating agencies
engaged in project works. NES IV and V contain funds to commence prepara-
tory works for the succeeding projects. These cover key start-up activities
such as nursery establishment, access roads, and laborer housing. While all
these activities have considerably helped project implementation, the Team
Khusus needed strengthening to expand and upgrade its project formulation,
design and supervision activities. NES V commenced this, and provides
considerable consultant services to Team Khusus which would enable it give
greater technical assistvnce to the estates in project area selection,
project area and village design, tree crop establishment and processing
facility construction. These services would also assist Team Khusus give
more attention to the timely disbursing of project funds, and prepare it to
play a much larger role in the preparation, design and supervision of Bank
assisted projects. Despite these problems the DGE has well prepared and
implemented NES projects. It played a key role in preparing the difficult
(involving land redistribution) West Java components of NES V and this
project. Progress with tree crop plantings are now excellent; and disburse-
ments, which at end-1980 were 11% of total funds allocated to the first four
projects, are presently (mid-December 1981) 20% of these loans.
Project Formulation
1.06      This project would be the sixth in the NES series.  By using PTP XII
and PTP XXIII to transfer technology to smallholders and settle them on predo-
minantly tree crop holdings, it meets the GOI's desire for using the technical
and managerial resources of the public sector estates to promote smallholder
development. It also would intensify land use and farmer productivity in West
Java and Bengkulu, raise smallholder incomes by increasing food crop, rubber
and coconut oil production for local and export markets; and assist stop the
eroding and degrading of project lands in West Java.



1.07      The project would continue and expaad development commenced under
NES V, and further prepare DGE and the public sector estates for future Bank
sector lending in the NES program. PTP XII would develop smallholder food
and tree crops in relatively highly populated West Java, thus continuing in
this province a program initially commenced unider NES V, while PTP XXIII
would establish smallholders around the Bengkuilu nucleus estate it currently
is establishing under NES V. To increase DGE's expertise in preparing and
supervising smallholder infrastructure development, the project would
provide technical assistance in road planning and construction to the Team
Khusus, which in turn would make this expertise available to the PNP/PTPs.
To help restructure and strengthen the Departtient of Agriculture's estate
administration and support staff (SBPN), it would provide them with
technical assistance in project preparation anid financial analysis of the
estates.
1.08      Using start-up funds NES V provided, PTPs XII, XXIII and PNP
XXVIII have already undertaken preparatory works. PTP XII has started
rehabilitating the access road to the Agrabinta estate, while PTP XXIII and
PNP XXVIII have established rubber nurseries at Seluma and Seram. These
activities would ensure NES VI-s early implementation. The proposed project
also contains funds for preparatory works for future NES projects.
Location
1.09      The project is located in three provinces, West Java, Bengkulu and
Maluku. The West Java component has two adjacent sites, Cikaso and
Agrabinta, situated on the West Java south coast some 220 km due south of
Jakarta in the districts (kabupatens) of Sukatumi and Cianjur. Both small-
holder sites border old PTP XII rubber estates of the same name. PTP XII's
Cikaso estate has a leased area of 2,000 ha gross, with a surrounding pro-
posed smallholder development area of 3,500 ha gross, while the Agrabinta
estate-s leased area is 3,000 ha gross, with a proposed smallholder
development area of 6,400 ha gross.
1.10      The Bengkulu site (gross area 22,000 ha), known as Seluma, lies
about 14-34 km southeast of Bengkulu township along the eastern side of the
Bengkulu-Manna road. The site, about 20 km long and 6-12 km wide, is situa-
ted in kabupatens North and South Bengkulu. The Bengkulu-Curup road is its
northern boundary, a protected forest is its eastern boundary, and a locally
financed smallholder rubber replanting project near Tumbuan village, its
southern boundary. The site, which is solely for smallholders, surrounds
the rubber nucleus estate which PTP XXIII is currently establishing under
NES V to service the proposed smallholders. The Maluku site is on the
southern coast of Seram island, lying about 100 km to the north-east of
Ambon, the provincial capital. Its gross area is some 11,000 ha, consisting
of several PNP XXVIII concession areas bordering the Gulf of Elpaputik.

Climate
1.11      The climate at all sites is wet tropical, with generally a short or
no dry season. Mean annual rainfall varies from 2,450 mm at Seram to 3,635 mm
at Cikaso and Agrabinta. Table 1.2 shows the mean annual rainfall at the
various sites. In West Java the dry season is normally between May and
September, however, the monthly averages at the sites are generally above 200
mm for the driest month. Nevertheless extended dry periods (below 60
mm/month) of four to five months do occur about once every five years. The
Bengkulu site has no pronounced dry season, and only occasionally a month
below 150 mm. At the Maluku site, the dry season extends from November to
March. The amount and annual distribution of rainfall are suitable for the
selected crops (rubber, coconuts or food crops) at the different sites.
Temperatures are relatively high and uniform year round, and do not limit crop
growth. Average monthly maximum temperatures vary from 29-310c, and minimum
from 21-220C.

Topography and Soils
1.12      The West Java sites lie adjacent to each other in a narrow coastal
strip some 60 km long, and extending up to 10 km inland from the sea. They
have a narrow coastal plain, which quickly becomes undulating to hilly away
from the coast, and quite mountainous with many deep ravines further inland
to the north. Several large rivers dissect the sites, flowing from north to



5-
south into the Indian Ocean, and make access across the area difficult. The
largest river, the Cibuni, separates the two Cites. The land generally lies
at 5-150 m above sea level, and while the Agrebinta or eastern end conta-ns
perhaps the larger proportion of flat land, bcoth sites have at least 25% or
more above 35% slope. The sites' topography generally is unsuitable for food
crops, which should be restricted to the coastal plain, or to small, flat
plots on top of the ridges and in the valleys, About two thirds of the area
is generally suitable for tree crops. The soils are red yellow mediterranean
and grumosols, consisting of limestone sediments on the hilly to mountainous
land, and regosols in the coastal area. They are acidic to neutral, contain
medium amounts of nitrogen and potash, but are low in phosphorus. However,
with the correct fertilizer inputs they are suitable for tree and food crops.
In places the soils are shallow (10-20 cm deep), underlaid by rock. PTP XII
is currently surveying the sites to exclude such small areas from crop
development.
1.13      The Seluma site lies in the narrow area between the western Sumatra
coast and the Barisan mountain range. In the west it is flat to undulating
(0-15% slopes), with this land form covering up to 40% of the total area,
while towards the east it is undulating to hilly (15-40% slopes). Some 50% of
the site is above 30% slope. The main soils are red-yellow podzolics, brown
podzolics and brown latosols. They are all lc,w in plant nutrients, and highly
acidic. However, with the correct fertilizer inputs, they are suitable for
rubber and food crops.
1.14      The Seram site is on the narrow coastal plain and terraces between
the island's southern coast and the central Seram mountain range to the north.
it is flat to undulating in the north, dissected by three major rivers and
many small streams, all running south. The rivers are fast flowing, rise
quickly following rain in the moutains and their beds have moved considerably
up and down the coastal plain over time. Site elevation is from sea level to
250 m. The soils are silty clay, with some sandy areas near the coast, and
have good potential for coconuts and rubber. Only coconuts would be planted
in sandy areas.
Land Use, Population, Farm Size and Tenure
1.15      West Java.  Present land use at the two West Java sites is similar
to that described in the NES V SAR (para. 2.0g), that is, a mixture of house
lots, rainfed sawah (rainfed, bunded rice fields), upland crops (rainfed rice,
corn, cassava, soybean, peanut or vegetables), kebun (small, irregularly
planted areas of rubber, coconuts, cloves, bamboo, various fruit trees and
timber species), open grasslands and belukar (scrubby regrowth). Table 1.3
shows the present estimated land use at the two sites.

1.16      Farmers usually plant upland crops on sloping areas, which they crop
only once every two or three years. The grasslands consist mainly of Imperata
cylindrica, a coarse grass of little nutritional value known as alang alang,
which quickly takes over areas left fallow. Belukar grows on steep or other
areas which farmers have thinned or cleared for timber or cropping, but then
left unused or uncropped-for at least five years. The project would establish
tree crops mainly on the grassland and upland areas.
1.17      The proposed project areas lie within the boundaries of several
large villages (two at Cikaso, two at Agrabinta) which themselves
consist of several hamlets or small groups of houses known as dukuks. As
there is insufficient suitable land, the project would be unable to develop
tree crops for every family in each village. Thus the project would treat the
dukuk as the basic unit for development, that is, establish tree crops for
every family within each dukuk developed. Existing farms occupy the entire
gross area proposed for smallholder development, with some 3,700 separate farm
families (about 1,350 families at Cikaso and 2,350 at Agrabinta) operating
them. Average gross farm sizes are 2.6 ha at Cikaso and 2.7 ha at Agrabinta.
Farm size distributions are generally similar to those shown in NES V SAR
(para. 2.09, Table 2.3). Except for some 100 ha which farmers own (Tanah
Milik title), the provincial government owns (Tanah Negara title) the land at
the sites. The lurahs have discretionary control over the government land and
can grant individual farmers the right to cultivate it. The Government,
however, can withdraw this right to cultivate at any time, and thus can
direct, if necessary, that farmers release this land for the project, or for
redistribution to other farmers. The West Java Governor has alienated the
*areas proposed for development, and all farmers concerned, including those
with Tanah Milik titled land, have agreed to enter the project.
1.18      Bengkulu.  Secondary forest predominantly covers the Seluma site,
particularly in the center and western portion, with grassland or scrubby
growth adjacent to it and with small patches of wild rubber and coffee spread
throughout the project area, and upland crops mainly near the villages on



-7-
the eastern boundary. Present land use within the 22,000 ha is approximately
100 ha swamp forest, 200 ha rainfed sawah, 1,000 ha kebun, 1,000 ha alang
alang, 1,200 ha coffee, 1,300 ha wild rubber, 1,900 ha upland crops, 6,300 ha
scrubby regrowth and 9,000 ha dryland secondary forest.
1.19      An estimated 2,550 farm families cu:Ltivate or have land rights in
the project area. They are basically shiftingl cultivators, who clear a site
and grow upland crops (mainly rainfed rice) on it for two years. During the
first year they usually interplant the area with rubber or coffee, which they
then leave until it bears. On average each family is cultivating about 3.0
ha, consisting of 1 ha p.a. of upland crops and 2 ha of bearing tree crops,
either rubber or coffee, or a mixture of both. Each family has several small
sites around their village, and as they wish -o expand their holdings, they
clear forested land progressively outwards from the village. Table 1.4 gives
the estimated farm size distribution for the area.

1.20      The community (margha council) basiaally owns and controls the use
of this land. When a family wishes to open naw land, they ask the margha for
permission. Providing they continue to cultivate or occupy that land, they
have the right to use it and own the produce from it. However, if they
abandon the land for a certain period (6 montAs to 3 years), the right of use
reverts to the margha. The Governor has alieaated the area proposed for
development, and provincial and PTP XXIII officials are currently taking a
census of the project area farmers to determine all those with land rights,
and make certain, as expected, that all farmers agree to enter the project.
1.21      Maluku.  The Seram island site (11,300 ha) is covered by old coconut
plantations (850 ha, over 70 years old) and forest (10,150 ha). The forest
consists of primary and secondary growth, plus some abandoned rubber. The
coconuts are still producing at a low level. The primary forest contains some
timber of commercial value, while the secondary forest has large amounts of
bamboo but little else of value.



- 8-
1.22      The project area lies within old PNP XXVIII concession areas and
provincial government land. The Directorate General of Agrarian Affairs
(Agraria) is currently renewing the PNP leases, and alienating additional
areas PNP XXVIII requires for the project. By about end-March 1982 Agraria
would complete its surveys and land title checks, and issue PNP XXVIII with
the right to use this land (Hak Guna Usaha).  The issuing of Hak Guna Usaha is
a condition of disbursing for the works PNP XXVIII would undertake under the
project. Squatters, from coastal villages bordering the concessions, have
cultivated small patches (total about 50 ha) of coconuts, bananas, cocoa and
food crops within the concession areas. While they have no land title they do
have rights under customary (adat) law, and PNP XXVIII would compensate them
for their trees.
Existing Infrastructure and Services in Smallholder Areas
1.23      Existing Infrastructure.  Agrabinta and, to a lesser extent, Cikaso
have extremely poor access, both into and within the project areas.  This
severely constrains development of the sites. Except for a small, hand-
operated vehicle ferry over the Cikaso river, which limits loads and the flow
of vehicles, access to the Cikaso estate is reasonable. However, access to
and within the proposed smallholder area is poor to nonexistent. At Agrabinta
only four-wheel drive vehicles can traverse the access road from the kabupaten
road (offtake at Patrol village) to the estate. Access within the smallholder
area is by bike or walking track, and the site is dissected by several large
rivers (para. 1.12). Although the sites border each other, it is impossible
to drive directly from one to the other. Because of the sites long, narrow
shape, the main access roads must traverse completely each site. Thus the
sites would require some 84 km of main access road, and PTP XII has started
construction of this (65 km) using start-up funds from NES V. Jakarta,
some 160 km away, is the closest major port to the sites.
1.24      PTP XII currently operates old rubber estates at Cikaso and
Agrabinta. It recently planted (1978/79-80/81) some 500 ha of tall coconuts
(50 ha underplanted with cocoa) at Agrabinta. The project would rehabilitate
both estates, which would then serve as nucleus estates for the proposed
smallholder development.
1.25      A bitumen road connects the Seluma site with Bengkulu, the
provincial capital, and present port. The provincial public works would
replace one bridge (25 m long at 22 km marker from Bengkulu) on this road
by December 1983. A bitumen road also connects the site to the new Bengkulu
harbor which the province is constructing, and is scheduled to complete by
end-1983. The smallholder site presently has no internal road network. PTP
XXIII's only other activity in the province is the establishing of a 5,000 ha
rubber nucleus estate (under NES V), which would service the proposed



- 9 -
smallholder site. PTP XXIII started work on the nucleus estate in late 1980,
and has constructed an access road into the site, and is currently
establishing 700 ha of rubber. Under start-up funds (from NES V), it also is
establishing 200 ha of rubber for the proposed smallholders.
1.26      In Maluku the Seram island site is isolated.  Transport in and out
of the area is only by small motor launch. The site has no jetty or wharf,
and large equipment or supplies must be unloaded on the beach from landing
ships (LST vessel, 200 ton). The nearest main port is Amahai, some 50 km
southeast around the coast, with a new jetty (1979) capable of handling 2,000
ton vessels. The provincial government is presently extending to Seleman, on
the island's north coast, the road running north from Amahai to Makariki (12
km). An access road to the project area would off-take from this road some 4
km north of Makariki. From there the proposed main estate compound is some 25
km to the west. The road contractor has already constructed the road to the
proposed project area access off-take, and expects to complete it to Seleman
by end-1983. Ambon, the provincial capital, is connected to Amahai by light
plane or passenger ferry. PNP XXVIII has operated the old coconut estates at
the project site since the early 1960s.
1.27      Existing Services:  West Java.  The project area's two subdistricts
(kecamatans) and six villages have some public health, education and
agricultural facilities. About half of the villages have health facilities,
all have elementary schools (grades 1-6) and two have junior high schools
(trades 7-9). Most villages have a local market place, although the kecamatan
market is at a considerable distance from them all.  The two kecamatans have
agricultural extension services, however, only one or two extension staff
(usually a field extension worker, PPL) are stationed in each kecamatan, which
each have in excess of 5,000 farm families. The desired extension
worker/farmer ratio is about 1 PPL/1,600 farmers. Generally the agricultural
services are concentrated in the sawah areas, with little or no services in
the upland areas, that is, the proposed project areas.
1.28      Existing Services:  Bengkulu.  Public services in the Seluma site
are similar to those described in West Java. Some villages have health
services, all have elementary schools, while two have junior high schools.
Agricultural extension services are available at the kecamatan level, but the
ratio of PPLs to farmers is lower than desirable.

THE PROJECT
2.01      This project is the sixth in the Bank assisted NES series, and
would continue GOI's smallholder development Frogram using public sector
estates to establish nucleus estate and smallholder tree crops and
infrastructure. It would also assist the program's future expansion by
rehabilitating and upgrading an existing estate which would eventually
promote future smallholder development. The project would establish or
rehabilitate some 17,000 ha of rubber and 9,5CO ha of coconuts (11,500 for
the estates and 15,000 ha for smallholders) and provide processing
facilities, in the provinces of West Java, Ber.gkulu and Maluku; resettle
some 8,450 families in West Java and Benkulu; and rehabilitate and expand
PNP XXVIII, an estate in Maluku. The project would provide technical
assistance to DGE and the public estates.
Project Works
2.02      The proposed project would include:
A.  West Java - PTP XII at Cikaso and AErabinta
(a)  Nucleus Estate Development
(i) planting about 1,170 ha of rubber at Cikaso and 970 ha of
rubber and 500 ha of coconuts at Agrabinta, rehabilitating

480 ha coconuts at Agrabinta;
(ii) constructing estate housing and buildings at both
sites,
(iii) constructing about 30 km of collection roads (13 km at
Cikaso, 17 km at Agrabinta), rehabilitating some 60 km of
collection roads (24 km at Cikacso, 36 km at Agrabinta) and
160 km of farm tracks (70 km at Cikaso and 90 km at
Agrabinta);
(iv) rehabilitating a rubber factory at Cikaso (8 ton/day) and
Agrabinta (9 ton/day), and conEtructing copra preparation
facilities on both sites and a copra processing factory

Agriculture Development
2.03      West Java.  All project land would be free from title or compen-
sation disputes, and available for redistribution. At each site PTP XII
would pool the land suitable for tree crop planting into blocks of at least
50 ha, and up to 500 ha. Suitability would depend on slope and present or
potential land use. Because of harvesting difficulties on land too steep,
the estate would plant coconuts up to about 30% slope and estate rubber
up to about 35% slope. Existing irrigated or rainfed sawahs and suitable
flat areas required for villages, houses and gardens or foodcrops would not
be planted to tree crops. Each settler family would receive 1.5 ha of block
planted coconuts. The project would redistribate project area lands so that
each settler family would be left with at least 0.5 ha for their house,



- 14 -
garden and food crops. Any families moved into a new village area, in
addition to the 1.5 ha of coconuts, would also receive a cleared 0.5 ha for
their house and garden (0.2 ha) and food crops (0.3 ha). PTP XII would
provide these settlers with a Rp 110,000 (US$178) cash payment for subsis-
tence (Rp 55,000), and to purchase (Rp 55,000) seedlings for the garden,
vegetable and food crop seeds and fertilizer and pesticides. At each site
PTP XII would make available seeds, fertilizer and pesticides which the
smallholders could purchase annually for their gardens and food crops. So
far at NES V West Java sites the smallholders have used these funds to
improve their gardens and food crops. PTP XII would maintain and fertilize
the block planted coconuts until they come into bearing and were transferred
to the smallholders. At this stage (fifth year after planting) PTP XII
would provide tree crop extension services, fertilizers and agrochemicals,
collection, processing and marketing services for the smallholders. The
smallholders would finance these services (para. 3.13). The existing
kecamatan agricultural services would provide food crop extension services.
2.04      Bengkulu.  As in West Java all project land would be free from
title or compensation disputes, and available for redistribution. Each
existing settler family would receive 2.0 ha block planted rubber, and
at least another 1.0 ha of which 0.5 ha would be suitable for their house,
garden and foodcrops. If possible the remaining 0.5 ha could include any
coffee, cloves or kebun areas the settlers consider too valuable to
demolish. New settler families would receive 3.0 ha, of which 2.0 ha would
be -uiltable for rubber, 0.5 ha for house, garden and foodcrops, and the
remaining 0.5 ha for either food or tree crops. PTP XXIII would clear 2.5
ha per family, block planting 2.0 ha with rubber and leaving 0.5 ha for the
house, garden and food crops. The estate would maintain and fertilizer the
rubber until maturity in the sixth year after planting when the smallholder
becomes responsible for it. PTP XXIII would supply each family resettled
with an initial package of seedlings, seeds, fertilizers and pesticides for
the garden and the food crops. After the smallholders take control of their
rubber, PTP XKIII would provide tree crop extension services, collection,
processing and marketing services, and make available seeds, fertilizers and
pesticides which the smallholder can purchase for both his tree and food
crops. The local kecamatan agricultural services would supply food crop
extension services.
2.05      Maluku.  PNP XXVIII would establish a 4,000 ha rubber estate on
the proposed site's western end, on the eastern end, and possibly on
coastal areas, it would establish a 3,000 ha coconut estate. As their
existing operations include only some 600 ha of rubber, 3,300 ha of coconuts
and 1,100 ha of nutmeg on scattered sites, along with a proposed oil palm
development in Sulawesi, the proposed plantings would become one of its
largest and most important production areas.
Physical Development-
2.06      Land Clearing and Planting.  Using the prospective settlers and
other labor, the estates would manually clear the sites. They would use
chainsaws on trees, regrowth or bush, and weedicides on small brushes and



- 15 -
alang-alang.  They would poison old rubber treas, preferably in the year
before land clearing. If that is impossible, they would poison the stumps,
and any regrowth. To facilitate the burning of felled timber, the estates
would clear mainly during the dry season (April to September in West Java
and Bengkulu, November to February in Maluku). They would first underbrush
the area, then fell all trees, leaving them for six to eight weeks to dry
where cut down, preferably in a north-south direction. After the first
burning, the estates would chainsaw the remaining timber of about 15 cm or
less in girth, stack this around stumps and larger logs, and reburn the
area, concurrently spraying with weedicide any alang-alang or other weeds.
They would then manually plant the cover crop, line the tree rows, do
required terracing, and dig the pits for the trees.  Finally, during the wet
season, they would plant the tree crops.
2.07       In Maluku the existing labor is insufficient and unskilled in
planting rubber. PNP XXVIII would arrange with one of the Javanese provin-
cial governments for families skilled in rubber estate work to transmigrate
to Maluku as estate labor. Additionally, when clearing the existing coconut
areas, PNP XXVIII would cut the tree trunks into sections and stack to
ensure they burn completely.  To prevent cocorut beetle breeding, it would
quickly plant the cover crop and ensure it covers stumps left in the field.
2.08       Nurseries.  The, estates should establish nurseries about twelve
months before planting. In West Java, using start-up funds from NES V,
PTP XII would establish rubber and coconut nurseries during the 1981-82 wet
season. PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII have both established nurseries and
commenced planting at Seluma and Seram during the 1981-82 wet season (PTP
XXIII, 200 ha smallholder rubber; PNP XXVIII 400 ha rubber, 250 ha
coconuts). They used NES V start-up funds, antd would continue to use these
funds for nursery production for 1982-83 plantings, the first field
plantings the proposed project would finance.
2.09       Road Construction.  The estates wouLd establish a network of
access, collection and village roads throughout the proposed sites, and a
network of estate or farm tracks through the -:lantations. Project roads,
which would complement the existing provinciaL and kabupaten roads, have
three basic designs. Firstly, principal access roads (Department of Public
Works Class III Standard), which would connec-: the project area, factory and
main offices with the nearest provincial road; secondly, primary collection
and village roads which would connect the estate divisions and all villages
with a principal access road, and year round would allow heavy loads to be
transported to and from the estate divisions and villages to the processing
facilities; and thirdly, estate or farm tracks which would allow infield
produce collection and input distribution to within some 300 m of any tree
crops or cultivated area. The project would require about 25 m of these
tracks per ha of tree crops on undulating land and 30 m per ha in more hilly
areas. These tracks would also serve as streets or secondary village roads
within the smallholder villages. As far as pDssible all roads would follow
ground contours to reduce gradients and earthworks to a minimum. All



- 16 -
estate and farm tracks would be surfaced with a minimal thickness of gravel
to ensure their use during the wet season when agricultural activity is
generally at its peak. Table 2.1 lists the road design standards, which are
Directorate General of Highways (Bina Margha) standard designs.
2.10      The project would construct a total of about 61 km of principal
access road, 250 km of primary collection or village road, 680 km of estate
or farm track and 80 km of secondary village road. It would also
rehabilitate about 60 km of primary collection road and 160 km of estate
track. Except for bridgeworks the estates would construct the roads and
tracks by force account. Using funds from NES V, both PTP XII and PTP XXIII
already have commenced constructing (by contract) the access roads to their
respective sites, that is, PTP XII to Cikaso and Agrabinta (65 km) and PTP
XXIII to its nucleus estate at Seluma (8 km). This latter road would also
service the proposed smallholders. The estates would locally recruit
consultants to assist survey road alignments, design the cross-section and
supervise construction. Table 2.2 shows each estates' proposed estimated
road construction by length and type. The estates would ensure that their
machinery suppliers train the estate road construction staff in the
appropriate use of the purchased machinery. An assurance was obtained
from GOI that PTP XII, XXIII and PNPXXVIII would hire consultants, under
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, to assist survey, design and
supervise construction of the road works (see para. 2.25).
9.11      Housing, and Sanitary Facilities.  In West Java and Bengkulu
PTP XII and PTP XXIII would construct (mainly by contract) about 4,600 small-
holder houses (1,200 in West Java, 3,400 in Bengkulu) and rehabilitate
another 2,230 (1,580 in West Java, and 650 in Bengkulu). Besides building
new villages, PTP XII and PTP XXIII would replace any substandard houses of
existing settlers. The basic house would be about 36 sq m including an
enclosed kitchen (3 sq m) and adjacent porch (3 sq m) attached to the back
of the house. The house would be of timber, or steel and prefabricated
materials, with either a tiled or galvanised iron roof. Wherever possible
the estates would use locally available materials, and generate the maximum
possible local employment. Within each site the house lots and housing
units would be modular and of uniform design. On each house plot the
estates would construct pit latrines at a minimum 15 m from the house and
potable water supply. The houses would be ready before the smallholders
arrive. The estates would locally recruit consultants to assist design the
village, food crop and garden layouts and supervise construction. For PTP
XII and PTP XXIII, these consultants would also assist with road design
(para. 2.10). An assurance was obtained from GOI that PTP XII and PTP
XXIII, under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank would hire these
consultants (see para. 2.25). Using standard estate designs, the estates
also would construct housing for their management and permanent field staff.

2.12      Water Supply.  At the West Java sites existing settlers obtain
potable water from small streams or shallow wells (1-3 m deep). Usually
these sources are adequate for year round water supplies, and PTP XII would
dig and equip a well for each new house lot. Equipping consists of a
concrete apron and raised ring (about 0.5 m) around the well top and a
structure for a rope and pulley. At Seluma local settlers also obtain
potable water from rivers, streams or wells (5-8 m deep). PTP XXIII would
dig and equip a well, or construct some other suitable water source, for
each new house lot for year-round water supply.
2.13      Village Infrastructure.  Settlement planning and village design
are related to traditional community living patterns and the physical
factors of topography, water supply and access. Generally the villages
would be about 200 families, consisting of a number of small groups or



19 -
blocks (25-30 households) arranged around a v[llage center with community
facilities. The villages would be constructeil on flat to gently undulating
land preferably with suitable underground waters The settlers' food crop
areas would be adjacent to their house lots and ideally within 0.5 km from
them. The community facilities usually include a village office, community
hall, elementary school, place of worship, market, sports ground and,
depending on village size and location, a sub--health center (sub-puskesmas).
Houses would also be constructed for the educational and health staff.
Allowing 0.2 ha per house lot and 0.1 ha per Eamily for community areas,
roads footpaths and waste land, the estates would clear some 0.3 ha/family or
60 ha gross/village. They would also clear all estimated 70 ha gross/village
for the 0.3 ha per family food crop area. Besides these areas, the estate
should allocate each village some 0.5-0.75 ha gross per family reserve land
for a graveyard, fuel wood reserve and community grazing land. The estates
would construct all the village infrastructure except the health and
education facilities which the Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) would
construct, using central government funds for local infrastructure
development programs (INPRES). In West Java }'TP XII would construct about
six villages (two in Cikaso and four in Agrab:Lnta). These are required to
settle farmers near to their proposed tree crop plantings. In Bengkulu PTP
XXIII would construct some 15 villages, of wh:.ch one would be a main
village, containing additional public buildings and services, for
example, a bank, post office, health center (puskesmas) and lower secondary
school. Table 2.3 shows the proposed village infrastructure by site.
2.14      Processing Facilities.  At each site the estates would have or
would construct sufficient processing capacity to handle their own and the
smallholder's production. Table 2.4 gives details by site of estimated
production and installed processing capacity. Under the project, PNP XXVIII
would install the total required processing capacity for rubber at Seram, as
constructing by stages would give only minimal savings. Only about Rp 6.4
million or 4% of the total expenditures could be delayed. However, at all
other areas the estates would install processing capacity by stages, and,
unider the project, install sufficient capacity to handle production up to
around 1990. At Cikaso and Agrabinta PTP XII would rehabilitate two existing
rubber factories in three stages, the first itL 1982, the second in 1987, and
the third in 1991. The project would finance the first two stages. PTP XII
would also construct a coconut oil extraction factory at Agrabinta to be in
operation by end-1986. This would initially Ihave a single 1.0 ton/hour screw
press, and eventually by 1995, five such presses (plus stand--by capacity),
working three shifts per day.  The project wouLld finance two of the presses,
which in 1990 would start working three shifts per day. Additionally, PTP
XII would construct two copra preparation facilities, one at each site.
Each facility would have an initial copra proc.uction capacity of 2 tons/hour
which would be sufficient up to 1990, when it .would be doubled.
2.15      At Seluma, under NES V, PTP XXIII woWuld install a 40 ton/day
rubber factory.  This could cope with the nucleus estate and smallholder
production up to 1990. Eventually PTP XXIII wrould build a second factory,
sited in the smallholder area, to handle the mtaximum production.

2.16      At Seram PNP XXVIII would install a coconut oil extraction factory,
which would be operating by end-1987. It would initially have a single
1 ton/hour screw press, and eventually (1994) three such presses (plus
stand-by capacity), operating three shifts per day. The project would
finance the one press stage of the factory, plus a 2 ton/hour copra
preparation facility and a small bulking depot near the Amahai wharf for
storage of coconut oil and copra cake before shipment to markets.
2.17      At all sites, if requested by GOI,, the completion of required
processing capacity could be considered for Bank financing under subsequent
loans. The rubber factory costs have been estimated to allow either 100%
crumb rubber production or a mixture of crumib and sheet rubber. The estates



- 22 -
would be responsible for installing, operating and maintaining all proces-
sing facilities. The project provides, however, for consultant assistance
to design, prepare specifications and tender documents, assist evaluate
tenders received and supervise construction of the project rubber and
coconut oil processing facilities. PTP XII and PNP XXVIII would construct
their coconut oil extraction factories using at least two main contracts:
(a) civil works plus buildings (design, supply and construct); and (b) plant
and equipment (supply, erect and commission). These factories would take
about 42 months from the appointment of engineering consultants to
commissioning. Assurances were obtained from GOI that: (a) PTP XII and PNP
XXVIII would hire consultants for the above mentioned work with
qualifications and under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (para.
2.25); (b) PTP XII would complete its coconut oil extraction factory by
December 31, 1986, and PNP XXVIII by December 31, 1987; and (c) if the PTP
XII mill is not in operation by the stated date, PTP XII would purchase from
smallholders at an appropriate price any coconut production offered for
sale after December 31, 1986.
Settlement and Community Development
2.18      Recruitment and Selection.  In West Java the smallholders would
come from those presently cultivating project lands either as owners or
renters of private land (Tanah Milik), or as leasers or squatters on govern-
ment land (Tanah Negara). The Provincial Government has already made a
census of all cultivators within the proposed sites and currently is obtaining
land owners agreement to give title to the project of the land required
for project purposes. Those leasing or squatting on government land have
also given to the project any rights to the areas they are cultivating.
Although existing right holders would become project beneficiaries, they
would not necessarily receive back under the project the same amount of
land they had pre-project.  In allocating project lands, preference would be
given to small farmers or the landless. Farmers who own or cultivate land
both outside and inside the project area may have to give their rights to a
project block to a-married child. In particular, families from Cikaso would
be ineligible to enter the project who, besides land in the project area,
own 1.0 ha or more within a sawah area, adjacent to the project area, where
the provincial government proposes to construct future irrigation
facilities. Cultivators from blocks or dukuhs which have insufficient
suitable land to allow each existing cultivator a tree crop block would be
given the opportunity to move to another block with excess land. All
project beneficiaries would have to live within the project boundaries, and
may have to move to a project village. Beneficiaries would be married
couples, aged 20 to 60 years, with possible exceptions to this age limit for
existing settlers. Those between 40 and 60 years should have children. The
PCC and project manager would select the smallholders to enter the project.
2.19      In Bengkulu the smallholders would be all those with cultivation
rights within the project area, and the inhabitants of several trans-
migration settlements adjacent to the site (total some 2,550 families).
After these groups, small farmers (3.0 ha or less) from the project



- 23 -
kecamatans and kabupatens would have priority. The Bengkulu PCC would
select the additional smallholders, and with PTP XXIII, transport them to
the site. The PCC also is presently takirg a census of those with culti-
vators- rights within the project area to obtain their agreement to entering
the project and giving to the project title of the required land.
2.20      PTP XII and PNP XXVIII would hire one member of each smallholder
family as a permanent estate laborer, and guarantee him or her a permanent
job until the estates hand over to the smallholder family the operation of
its individual holding. The estates would hire prospective coconut small-
holders for four years and prospective rubber smallholders for five years.
The estates would train the smallholders :Ln planting and maintenance of
immature trees, and harvesting and maintenance of mature trees. At Seluma
PTP XXIII would plant about 50 ha of rubber as a tapping training area for
smallholders. It also would establish other required facilities to run
about a one-week residential course in tree tapping and care. PTP XXIII
would train at least two members from eaclh smallholder family. To obtain
control of their holdings the smallholders must prove themselves satisfac-
tory estate laborers/trainees and willing to work and live on their tree
crop holdings.
2.21      Land Allocation.  In West Java *:he PCC, in association with the
Directorate General of Agrarian Affairs (DGA), where necessary would provide
all families with the right of use title 'hak pakai) to 0.5 ha for house,
garden and food crops within one year of ?roject works commencement in the
area. In Bengkulu the PCC, also in assocLation with DGA, would provide all
smallholders with hak pakai to 1.0 ha (house lot of 0.2 ha, food crop 0.3 ha,
remaining 0.5 ha suitable for either food crops or tree crops) within one
year of their arrival. If appropriate, the PCC and DGA would also provide
this for existing settlers. At all sites the PCCs and DGA would provide the
smallholders judged satisfactory settlers with land ownership title (hak
milik) to their entire holding within three years after settlement. The Bank
Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) however, would retain the hak milik certificates as
security until the smallholders repay their debt incurred under the project.
The provincial and kabupaten DGA would do the cadastral survey necessary to
define each smallholder-s holding. Each smallholder would receive a tree
crop block fully planted with the appropriate number of trees. An assurance
was obtained from GOI that each qualifying smallholder would receive within
three years after settlement hak milik to 1.5 ha of planted tree crops in
West Java and 2.0 ha of planted tree crops in Bengkulu and in each case an
additional area for house lot, garden and food crops to give a total of
about 2.0 ha in West Java and 3.0 ha in Bengkulu.
2.22      Subsistence.  In West Java and Bengkulu each family moved onto a
new house lot and food crop area would receive Rp 55,000 (US$88) initial
cash payment for food and transportation before arrival at the project
site. this would be in addition to Rp 55,000 for the purchase of inputs
(para. 2.02-2.03).



- 24 -
2.23      Health.  The West Java and Bengkulu provincial governments,
through their PCCs and using INPRES funds, would provide health care facili-
ties to Repelita III standards in the project areas.  In Java these stand-
ards are one puskesmas (one building 80 sq m, doctors's house 70 sq m, two
staff houses each 50 sq m) per 30-40,000 people and one sub-puskesmas (one
building 30 sq m, one staff house 50 sq m) per 5,000 people, and in the
Other Islands (includes Sumatra) one puskesmas per 15-15,000 people and one
subpuskesmas per 1-2,000. At both Cikaso and Agrabinta the PCCs would
construct one sub-puskesmas, and at Seluma one puskesmas and five sub-
puskesmas. The provincial health authorities would staff and operate the
centers. Health services, with a primary health care approach, would focus
on malaria control, immunization, nutrition, family planning and environ-
mental sanitation. Malaria control would include house spraying, malario-
metric surveys and treatment.
2.24      Education.  Using INPRES funds the West Java and Bengkulu PCCs,
in association with the Ministry of Home Affairs, would be responsible for
constructing an elementary school (grades 1 to 6) in each new village (6 in
West Java, 10 in Bengkulu). The project would provide funds for one lower
secondary school (SMP, grades 7 to 9) in Bengkulu. The Directorate General
of education would construct the lower secondary school, and be responsible
for staffing all schools.
Technical Assistance and Program Support
2.25      To help the DGE and individual estates implement the project,
the DGE in its overall smallholder development programs, strengthen SBPN
and prepare sugar projects in the Other Islands, the project would provide
the following consultant services:
(a) DGE would:
(i)  internationally recruit one civil engineer (with considerable
experience in road construction) to be attached to the Team
Khusus for two years. His contract would be signed, and he
would be ready to start work by September 1, 1982. He would
coordinate and supervise: (a) any road survey and design the
estates undertake, using consultants or their own staff, for
smallholder project preparation, appraisal and implementa-
tion; and (b) any subsequent road construction the estates
undertake, by force account or contract;
(ii)  internationally recruit a rubber processing engineer to be
attached to Team Khusus for two years. He would assist the
estates with the design, preparation of tender documents,
evaluation of tenders received and supervision of construc-
tion of rubber mills (contract to be signed by July 1, 1983);
(iii)  internationally or locally recruit appropriate short-term
consultants for Team Khusus to assist with the preparation of



- 25 -
future projects, and the implementation of this or other
ongoing projects, particularly with PNP XXVIIITs component at
Seram (24 man-months);
(iv) internationally recruit consultants for SBPN to plan, design
and help supervise implementation of sugar projects in the
Other Islands. SBPN is currently evaluating proposals for
this work, which would be financed by funds from NES V and
from this project (178 man-morLths, contract to be signed by
January 1, 1983); and
(v) internationally recruit a fina,ncial analyst and a land use
planner experienced in tropiccl tree crop development, each
to be attached to SBPN for two years. Both experts would
lead groups within SBPN which would advise and assist the
estates in development planning. The financial analyst's
group would review each estate-s financial resources annually
and would advise on the amount: of development the estates
could finance and the type and source of funds the estate
should employ. The land use planner's group would collect
all existing pertinent resource data (land use maps, topo-
graphical maps, soil surveys, climate and so on) and would
identify areas with potential for tree crop development.
Taking account of GOI s long-range regional planning, socio-
economic data, existing infrastructure and services, it would
establish priorities for further investigations and project
preparation in such areas. This group would closely coord-
inate with Team Khusus project preparation group. (48 man-
months, contracts to be signed by August 1, 1982). SBPN would
form two other groups to work on commodity marketing and
inspection services. Using funds already available under NES
I DGE would internationally recruit consultants to lead these
two groups;
(b) PTP XII would:
(i) internationally recruit consuLtants to design, prepare tender
documents and specifications, assist evaluate
tenders received, and supervise construction of the proposed
copra preparation facilities and oil extraction mill at
Cikaso and and Agrabinta (32 man-months, contract signed by
January 1, 1984);
(ii) locally recruit consultants to survey, site, design, and where
necessary supervise construction of the smallholder villages,
food crop area layout and project roads (196 man-months
consisting of 36 man-months for village design and 160 man-
months for road design and construction, contract signed by
August 1, 1982);



- 26 -
(c) PTP XXIII would:
(i)  internationally recruit an agriculturalist experienced in
rubber and oil palm establishment (24 man-months, contract
signed by September 1, 1982) to assist with the implementation
in Bengkulu province of PTP XXIII's development program;
(ii) locally recruit consultants to survey, site, design, and where
necessary supervise construction of smallholder villages, food
crop areas, and project roads (136 man-months consisting of 60
man-months for village design and 76 man-months for road design
and construction, contract to be signed by August 1, 1982); and
(d) PNP XXVIII would:
(i)  internationally recruit a financial expert to assist with the
financial management of the estate and training of counterparts
(24 man-months, contract to be signed by September 1, 1982,
plus an additional 12 months for short-term follow-ups);
(ii) internationally recruit consultants to design, prepare tender
documents and specifications, assist evaluate tenders received,
and supervise construction of the proposed copra preparation
facilities and oil extraction mill at the Seram site and copra
and coconut oil bulking depot at Amahai (30 man-months,
contract to be signed by January 1, 1985);
(iii) locally recruit consultants to survey, site, design and
supervise construction of project area roads (130 man-months,
contract to be signed by August 1, 1982).
2.26      Table 2.5 lists the required consulting services and their base
cost.  An assurance was obtained from GOI that the agencies would have signed
contracts and finalized arrangements for engaging consultants with
qualifications and under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank by the
dates specified in para. 2.25 and Table 2.5.
Status of Engineering
2.27      Topographical maps at 1:25,000 scale exist for Cikaso and Agrabinta,
and 1:100,000 scale for Seluma and Seram showing height contours and drainage
patterns. DGA has prepared (May 1980) 1:10,000 scale present land use maps
for Cikaso and Agrabinta, while PTP XXIII-s consultants have completed recent
field surveys (May 1981) of Seluma, checking on present land use. Sufficient
soils information is available for the sites except at Cikaso and Agrabinta
where PTP XII is currently checking on soil depth to exclude areas of shallow
soils. PTP XXIII has already excluded some 1,500 ha at Seluma because of
rocky outcrops. While more detailed work is not required to further
delineate shallow soils here, PTP XXIII would watch for them during land
clearing, and if encountered would exclude them. All estates have either

established or selected the sites for nurseries to supply the initial year's
plantings, and PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII are presently defining the boundaries
for the first year's land clearing. PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII have prepared
outline plans, presented on existing topopgraphic maps, showing project layout
and preliminary road alignments.  PTP XII is currently undertaking a
topographic, soil and vegetation survey for outline planning. Standard
designs and specifications exist for all smallholder and estate housing,
buildings, village infrastructure and roads. When the estates have cleared
the sites, to assist detailed planning, they would produce 1:10,000 basic
topographical maps with five meter contour intervals for at least the village
and food crops areas and project road alignments.
Implementation Schedule
2.28      GOI would fully implement the project over 12 years, that is, from
establishing the first nurseries till the last blocks of trees planted com-
mence bearing. The proposed project would assist with implementation over
five years, from mid-1982 till mid-1987. During the first 24 months the



- 28 -
activities most crucial to project implementation would be access road con-
struction at PTP XII; land clearing and estate housing and buildings at PTP
XXIII; and estate housing, labor recruitment from Java, and procurement of
initial road construction and agricultural equipment at PNP XXVIII. Using
start-up funds from NES V, the estates have already commenced most of these
crucial tasks.
Cost Estimates
2.29      Total estimated project cost over 12 years is US$250 million.  The
Bank and CDC would assist finance the project during the first five years,
during which period US$190 million is the estimated project cost, of which
US$103.9 million (55%) is the foreign exchange component. The cost of
start-up works, commenced under NES V, are excluded from this five-year
total. GOI would finance all project costs (US$60 million) from year six to
completion. Project costs are expressed in mid-1982 prices and because of
the tax exempt status of the implementing agencies, do not include taxes.
2.30      Base cost estimates were derived from the detailed cost analysis
of contract prices of recent similar works undertaken by estates, including
PTP XII, PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII, or have been based on the National
Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) standards and unit construction costs
in nearby areas. Consultant service costs are based on recent contracts for
similar services in Indonesia. Estimated direct and reimbursable costs are
US$12,000/month for foreign consultants and US$2,500/month for local con-
sultants (Annex 1, Table 5).  Before calculating base cost estimates, all
recent unit prices were projected to mid-1982 prices by using the appropri-
ate local and foreign price contingencies listed in Table 2.6. Base costs
include allowances for the recent (January 1982) 60% increase in domestic
oil prices. Because of the different wet and dry months in West and East
Indonesia, in West Java and Bengkulu PTP XII and PTP XXIII would clear and
prepare land from about April to September and plant from October to March,
while in Maluku PNP XXVIII would clear and prepare from about August to
January and plant from February to July. At each site estimated tree crop
establishment costs are based on these "development" periods, that is, at
West Java and Bengkulu from April 1982 to end-March 1987, and at Maluku from
August 1982 to end-July 1987. The cost estimates include an allowance for
physical contingencies of 15% for housing, infrastructure and roads, and 10%
for field development, services, equipment and supplies. The cost estimates
also include allowances for price escalations during implementation (30% of
base cost plus physical contingencies) based on the price contingencies in
Table 2.6.

Financing
2.31      The proposed Bank loan of US$68.1 million (including US$1.1 mil-
lion capitalized front end fee) would finance 35% of the project's estimated
total cost and 64% of the foreign exchange cost for the first five years of
project implementation. During this period CDC would finance the project in
parallel, and its proposed loan of US$28 million would supply 15% of the
project's total cost and 27% of foreign exchange costs. GOI would provide
to the project implementing agencies Rp 53.8 billion (US$86.1 million) out
of annual budget appropriations, and would secure suppliers' credit of about
Rp 5.6 billion (US$8.9 million) to assist ftnance the new processing plants.
GOI expects no problems in obtaining suitabLe suppliers' credits.
2.32      Nucleus Estate Development.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) would
finance the bulk of local cost for nucleus estates and estate tree crop
plantings, infrastructure, road building and agricultural equipment. The
MOF would obtain suppliers' credits to finance the foreign exchange cost of
the copra preparation facilities and coconul: oil extraction mills at PTP XII
and PNP XXVIII, and the rubber factory at PNP XXVIII. Because the
implementing estates do not currently have sufficient investment funds, they
would not finance any project works.



- 30 -
2.33      Smallholder Development.  The MOF would directly provide funds for
practically all smallholder local costs, while the Bank and CDC loans would
fund the foreign exchange costs. INPRES program funds would finance educa-
tion and health facilities. Smallholders would repay part of their develop-
ment costs, that is for the credit items of tree crop planting, subsistence
payments, settler housing, road, and tree crop development overheads (cal-
culated as 10% of the tree crop establishment costs). They would not repay
the noncredit items of water supply, village infrastructure, education and
health facilities, and project management (calculated as 5% of the tree crop
establishment costs and paid to the implementing estate). GOI would provide
the Rp 37.5 billion (US$60 million) required to carry out the project in
Years 6-12. These funds would maintain smallholder and nucleus estate
plantings while they are immature and construct additional processing capa-
city. The funds would come from the MOF and possibly machinery suppliers'
credits.  Sources for all project finance for the first five years are
summarized in Table 2.8.
2.34      Budgetary Allocations:  Smallholders.  The MOF, as at present,
would channel smallholder development funds directly to the nucleus estates
through quarterly disbursements in accordance with an approved annual budget
and in advance of the expenditures as required by the nucleus estates. Bank
funds would be used to reimburse expenditures by PNP/PTPs based on the
disbursement percentages for the works as carried out (para. 2.41). The
costs of development of smallholder credit items would be translated into
standardized credit amounts for individual settlers in credit agreements at
the end of the year when each tree crop area has come into maturity (see
para. 4.09). Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) would be the designated bank to
recover smallholders' outstanding debts. Subloans to smallholders would be
for 17 years, with a two-year grace period and repayments starting in the
sixth year after planting for coconut, and a three-year grace period and
repayments starting in year seven for rubber. Interest would be 10.5% p.a.,
and that accruing during the grace period would be capitalized.
2.35      Budgetary Allocations:  Estates.  The MOF would allocate funds for
nucleus estate and estate development quarterly in accordance with a pre-
viously agreed annual expenditure budget. It would make these funds avail-
able to the participating PNPs/PTPs either directly or through Bank
Indonesia (BI) under the terms of a loan agreement, or as interest-free
funds which GOI would convert to equity not later than three months after
the closing date for the Bank and CDC's loans. The loans would have
different lengths and grace periods depending on the estates- present and
projected financial ability to repay the loans, and whether the funds come
from GOI-s annual budget appropriations or from the Bank and CDC loans. GOI
would only on-lend budget funds for a maximum of 16 years including an
eight-year grace period. All loans would have a 13.5% p.a. interest rate
payable on the amounts withdrawn and outstanding. The finalizing of these
financing arrangements in a form and substance satisfactory to the Bank is a
condition of disbursing against the works the individual estates would
undertake with the funds. Both PTP XII and PNP XXVIII would require inter-
est-free funds, which later would be converted to equity, to financially



- 31 -
undertake the proposed nucleus estate development. PTP XII currently has a
tight cash flow position, resulting from earlier development loans obtained
from BI and commercial banks with onerous repayment conditions, present low
commodity prices, and a large development program GOI is requesting it to
undertake. Some 80% of PTP XII's income comes from tea, which presently is
selling at depressed prices, and for which future prices are forecast no
better. PNP XXVIII has a poor financial standing, having made losses in the
last two years because of a small, inadequate production base which is
predicted to cause future losses. Any other proposed developments for PTP
XII during the next eight years must be closely scrutinized to ensure PTP
XII's debit to equity ratio does not exceed 60/40. GOI and the Bank have
already agreed to a development program for ENP XXVIII until 1990. Annex II
contains projected cash flows for PTP XII and PTP XXIII. The project file
contains other detailed financial data for the estates.
2.36      For PTP XIIs nucleus estate develcpment MOF would provide budget
funds as a 16-year loan, including eight years grace, and repayable in 16
semiannual repayments over the balance of the loan period.  It would provide
Bank and CDC funds on an interest-free basis, and would convert these funds
to equity not later than three months after the Bank and CDC loans closing
date. For PTP XXIII-s nucleus etate development MOF would provide budget
funds as a 16-year loan, including an 8-year grace period, and Bank and CDC
funds as a 20-year loan, including an 8-year grace period. For PNP XXVIII's
estate development MOF would provide budget funds as interest-free funds and
would later convert them to equity, and Bank and CDC funds as a 20-year
loan, including a 12-year grace period. An eight year grace period is nor-
mal for rubber development which takes six years to come into bearing.
Because of its weak financial standing, PNP XXVIII would have 12 year grace
periods. MOF would also repay all PNP XXVIII]s current outstanding debts to
other estates, and write these debts off. During the proposed development,
and for other future developments, the estates would keep a debit to equity
ratio of no greater than 60/40. Projected cash flows for PNP XXVIII suggest
that its debt to equity ratio would increase to 70/30 around 1988-95. As
PNP XXVIII is an entirely government-owned entity, this would be acceptable,
however, once through this period it also should reduce its debt to equity
ratio to 60/40, and not exceed this in future. To ensure the sound finan-
cial basis of PTP XII, PTP XXIII and PNP XXVI]II, assurances were obtained
from GOI that (a) it would provide the nucleus estate and estate development
funds as described in this paragraph; (b) it would ensure that PTP XII and
PTP XXIII would at all times maintain a ratio of long-term debt to equity of
not more than 60/40, that PNP XXVIII would for the first 15 years of the
project maintain a ratio of long-term debt to equity of not more than 70/30
and afterwards would at all times maintain a ratio of long-term debt to
equity of not more than 60/40; and (c) PTP X:-I, PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII
would consult with the Bank before undertaking any other new development
project exceeding Rp 1.5 billion in the case of PTP XII and PNP XXVIII and
Rp 2.0 billion in the case of PTP XXIII.

Onlending Interest Rates
2.37      Under the NES program, the GOI has an established interest rate
policy of lending or onlending public funds to smallholders at 10.5% p.a.,
and to public sector estates at 13.5% p.a. With inflation rates projected

at 12% for 1982, and falling to about 10% thereafter, the interest rate
for smallholders would be slightly negative in real terms. However, this
interest rate is justified for the present project since smallholder bene-
ficiaries are below the absolute poverty level, and GOI wishes to assist
this target group.
Procurement
2.38      Agricultural machinery (US$3.4 million including contingencies),
road construction equipment (USI1.7 million), and rubber processing equip-
ment (US$0.8 million) for rehabilitating PTP XII's rubber factories would be
procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with
Bank Guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers would receive a prefer-
ence in bid evaluation of 15% of the cif cost or the import duty, whichever



- 33 -
is the lower. GOI would procure rubber proce3sing and coconut oil extrac-
tion equipment (US$12.0 million) for the new factories through procedures
ensuring competitive prices, and with the suppliers advancing about
US$8.9 million in credit. Equipment, spare parts and supplies costing less
than US$50,000 would be locally or internatiolally procured through prudent
shopping involving at least three price quotations. Additionally, each
estate could procure one unit or set of road construction machinery and
equipment (including items costing more than US$50,000 each) for initial
road works through prudent shopping involving at least three price quota-
tions. The total procured in this manner wouLd be limited to the aggregate
amount of US$1.4 million. To the extent possible DGE would centrally pro-
cure road construction equipment and agricultural machinery for the estates,
using the minimum number of contracts. The estates would construct the
coconut oil extraction factories using a limited number of contracts, this
number to be agreed between the Bank and GOI, with a minimum of two main
contracts: (a) civil works plus buildings (sapply and construct); and (b)
plant and equipment (supply, erect and commission). In establishing and
maintaining tree crops the estates would procare small equipment such as
chainsaws, hand sprayers and nursery watering systems through prudent
shopping, or local competitive bidding which is acceptable to the Bank.
Because GOI does not allow importation of vehicles, all motor vehicles and
cycles would be procured locally following GOI procedures. However, the
Bank would not disburse against them. ICB in accordance with Bank
Guidelines would be used to procure about US$5.5 million of agrochemicals
(excluding urea). The estates could procure up to US$1.5 million of agro-
chemicals annually following prudent shopping procedures involving at least
three price quotations. Since P.T. Pusri is the sole producer, supplier and
distributor of urea in Indonesia, and since world market urea prices are
about 70% higher than Pusri's price, and foreign bidders would not be inter-
ested in tendering, the estates would procure urea (US$1.8 million) directly
from Pusri or its authorized distributors witaout competitive bidding as
was done in earlier NES projects.
2.39      Contracts for consultant services ('JS$8.0 million) would be
awarded in accordance with Bank Guidelines on the use of consultants.
2.40      All civil works contracts for housiag, project and processing
plant buildings, settlement and estate infrastructure, and principal access
roads (US$54.3 milion) are small and widely szattered in area and time span.
Most contracts are about US$0.5 million, and Dccasionally up to US$2.0 mil-
lion, and would not be of interest to international contractors. These
works would be carried out following local competitive bidding according to
current government procurement procedures whiah are acceptable to the Bank,
or by force account if suitable contractors are not timely available or if
the estates can do the work cheaper than contractors. Except for major
bridge works, the estates would construct all roads by force account, while
they would construct most settler houses, estate buildings and village
infrastructure by contract. Assurances were obtained from GOI that: (a)
the works would be grouped into a number of saitable contracts (minimum size



- 34 -
whenever feasible US$320,000) that would enable large local contractors or
joint ventures of small local firms to bid; and (b) documents for contracts
to cost US$320,000 or more would be submitted to the Bank for review before
tendering and award. GOI procurement procedures for contracts below
US$320,000 include provisions to strengthen locally based firms, and firms
owned by economically weak groups.
2.41      A Smallholder Development Agreement between the DGE and the
nucleus estate would specify the details of the work to block plant the
15,000 ha of smallholder's tree crops and maintain them for four years for
coconut and five years for rubber. Similarly, the financing arrangements
between BI and PTP XII, PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII would specify the work to
establish and maintain the rubber and coconut plantings for the estates.
Tree crop development involves the execution of a series of specialized,
integrated services of labor and machinery (such as land clearing, land
preparation, nursery establishment, planting, farm and estate track
construction) which cannot be procured in a timely, sequential manner
through a competitive bidding processs. Therefore, the estates themselves
would undertake these works either by force account or subcontract, plus
some other works that must be integrated with tree crop development and
phased over an extended time period, such as land clearing for village
infrastructure, food crop and house and garden areas, and collection and
village road construction. Unit cost information for tree crop development
is well established and could be used to monitor financial requirements and
guarantee quality control.
Disbursements
2.42      The Bank and CDC would finance the project in parallel, with CDC
disbursing for tree crop establishment and annual maintenance until bearing
(excluding agrochemicals). This includes all land clearing, even that for
village infrastructure and the smallholders  house lot, garden and food crop
areas, nursery and budwood garden production, land preparation, planting,
weeding and maintaining, estate overheads, and farm and estate track
constructing and maintaining. The Bank would disburse for the following
items at these rates:
(a) 35% of the civil works including roads, smallholder and estate
housing, buildings, garages, workshops and divisional offices;
(b) 100% of the foreign expenditures for road construction, agricul-
tural and processing machinery and equipment, 100% of the
ex-factory cost (less any identifiable taxes) of equipment
manufactured locally, and 60% of imported farm equipment purchased
locally;
(c) 100% of the foreign expenditures for agrochemicals, 90% of local
expenditures for prudent shopping, and 100% of the total
expenditures for urea (ex-factory); and



- 35 -
(d)  100% of the cost of all consultant services, and start-up
expenditures for future Bank-assisted NES projects.
The Bank would not disburse for tree crop establishment and annual mainte-
nance until bearing, vehicles, motorcycles, siaallholder and staff relocation
expenses, payments for subsistence and seeds mnd fertilizer packages, and
equipment for the two coconut oil processing factories and the new rubber
factory at Seram. An estimated schedule of disbursements, based on actual
cisbursement rates for earlier NES projects, is shown in Annex I, Table 2.
For the loan-s initial three years the projeci:ed disbursements are more
conservative, or the same, as actual disbursemaents for area development
projects in the East Asia Pacific Region as documented by the Bank-s Project
Advisory (PAS) Staff. However, because management is now stronger and more
centralized in NES projects, disbursements in the loan's last two years are
projected at a faster rate than shown in PAS- schedule. Documentation made
under Statements of Expenditure, supporting cLaims for local procurement of
chainsaws, sprayers, and nursery watering sys:ems and civil works carried
out by force account, would be retained in Inionesia and made available to
Bank supervision missions for inspection and review.
Accounts and Audits
2.43      PNP/PTPs participating under the project would keep separate
accounts for all investment costs relating to NES VI smallholders as well as
nucleus estate project implementation, and woald provide such accounts as
part of a separate six montly report to the DGE, the Bank and CDC no later
than 30 days from the end of the semester. Beginning with NES I, PNP/PTPs
have been standardizing their bookkeeping procedures and accounting
methodology following procedures agreed to by the Bank and GOI. This has
facilitated auditing. The new methodology has enabled the State Auditor to
audit an increasing number of PNP/PTP accounts.
2.44      PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII are presently audited by the State Audi-
tor, while PTP XII is audited by a private commercial auditor. NES VI
project accounts and related disbursements made under statements of
expenditures, would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank (this includes the State Auditor), and the audit reports would be
submitted to the GOI, the Bank and CDC no later than August first each year.
State auditing may eventually substitute private auditing for PTP XII when
its accounts have been standardized, and capacity-of the State Auditor
improved. An assurance was obtained from GOI that these auditing practices
would be followed.
2.45      The DGE would submit six monthly reports on the project's progress
to the Bank and CDC using the format already agreed to by the Bank and Team
Khusus under earlier NES projects.



- 36 -
Environmental Effects
2.46      The project would establish tree and food crops in areas of
secondary jungle and alang-alang where a poor economic and ecological
pattern of shifting cultivation is presently practiced. Standard soil
conservation methods would be followed to prevent soil erosion. With the
establishment of a leguminous cover crop, soil fertility would be improved
by the application of fertilizers and crop rotation of food crop land. The
small quantities of chemicals used to control alang alang, pests and
diseases would have no significant adverse environmental effects. The new
rubber and coconut oil factories would adopt the appropriate standards for
the disposal of liquid effluent to ensure that it is nontoxic and that it
would not harm the health and safety of factory employees or the
preservation of fish and wildlife.
3. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
3.01      NES V SAR (paras. 4.01-4.05 and Chart I) describes briefly the
organization and functions of the Directorate General of Estates (DGE),
public sector estates, and other main government institutions involved in
the tree crop subsector. This is therefore not repeated here.
Project Management
3.02      The DGE would have overall responsibility for executing the
project. The Team Khusus would have primary responsibility for coordinating
project implementation, while the estates would be responsible and mainly
undertake the individual project works. At the individual sites the nucleus
estates (PTP XII and PTP XXIII) would implement smallholder development,
with the assistance of central government agencies and the West Java and
Bengkulu provincial governments. These, and the other estate (PNP XXVIII),
would develop processing facilities and other estate civil works and
plantings with guidance and supervision from the SBPN. For both smallholder
and estate development, the First Director of the implementing estate would
be the project manager, and for the individual sites the PNP/PTP concerned
would appoint one of its estate managers as site manager.
3.03      Team Khusus.  Team Khusus would coordinate project implementation
for the DGE. Its specific functions would include assistance to the project
managers and nucleus estates to prepare annual work programs and budgets,
assist with financial administration and guide in technical, engineering and
project procurement matters. It would also monitor and evaluate project
implementation, providing the inspection services of field development.
Under the project, it would internationally recruit a road engineer
(para. 2.25).



- 37 -
3.04      Project Manager.  Each of the projEct managers would prepare an
annual work program and budget, including quarterly cost estimates for all
works the nucleus estate would undertake for the smallholders, which the
Team Khusus would review and approve on behalf of the DGE before submitting
it to the MOF. The project managers would also be responsible for annual
budget requests for the noncredit expenditurEs of health and educational
facilities financed from the INPRES programs.  The DGE would make its own
budget allocation for technical assistance under the project. An assurance
was obtained from GOI that the project managErs, assisted by the Team
Khusus, would prepare and submit to the DGE annual work programs and budgets
by October 31 each year.
3.05      Nucleus Estates.  The nucleus estates would establish the small-
holdings, village infrastructure, roads and processing facilities.  The DGE
would make a Smallholder Development Agreement with the nucleus estates for
tree crop development, extension, processing and marketing services. The
signing of these agreements in a form and sulstance satisfactory to the
Bank is a condition of disbursing for the works the individual estates
would undertake under the agreement. Under this agreement's terms and
conditions, the nucleus estates would be responsible for the following
services:
(a) During Tree Crop Immature Period. Land clearing of tree crop,
house and garden and food crop area; planting and maintaining
the tree crops until maturity; procuring and applying inputs for
the tree crops development; siting houses and villages and
constructing settler houses, water supply and sanitation
facilities; developing the village infrastructure, excluding
health and education facilities; constructing and maintaining
the principal access road, village and primary collection
roads, and estate and farm tracks; resettling the smallholders,
the providing of an initial subsistence cash payment (Rp 55,000);
a seeds and fertilizer cash payment (Rp 55,000) or a package of
seedlings, food crop and vegetable seeds, fertilizers and pesti-
cides for any West Java and Bengkulu smallholders moved into a
site; the supplying of seedlings, food crop seeds, and agro-
chemicals for sale to smallholders at the various sites; and
the employing full time of one member of each family and
training in tree crop establishment and maintenance; and
(b)  During Tree Crop Productive Period.  Supplying the smallholders
extension services, training them in harvesting, and collecting
their production for processing, loan recovery, and marketing.
To assist them in these works and services, the estates would locally and
internationally recruit consultants as stated in para. 2.25.



- 38 -
3.06      Estates.  PNP XXVIII would undertake all project works to estab-
lish and maintain its tree crop plantings, infrastructure and processing
facilities. It, however, has been weak financially, managerially,
technically and organizationally. To strengthen the estate managerially and
operationally, GOI has appointed production and commercial directors (both
new posts), and sent seven senior and nine junior staff to PTP VII in North
Sulawesi for training. When needed, it also would second experienced
management staff to PNP XXVIII from other estates; and has proposed a plan,
acceptable to the Bank, to consolidate and concentrate PNP XXVIII activities
at Seram and at one or two other sites. Besides the other consultants it
would hire (para. 2.25), PNP XXVIII would internationally recruit a
financial expert to assist with the day-to-day financial management of the
estate and training of counterparts.
3.07      Provincial Governments.  The West Java and Bengkulu provincial
governments would supply the smallholders with health, education, social
and food crops extension services. The Chairman of the Provincial Develop-
ment Planning Agency (BAPPEDA), assisted by the nucleus estate project
manager, would coordinate local government INPRES programs to construct
health and educational facilities. The kabupaten health authorities would
ensure malaria control by supplying chloroquine and house spraying.
Existing GOI programs would provide mother and child health care, including
nutrition and family planning.
3.08      Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC).  The West Java provincial
government has already established a PCC to assist the project. Its members
include the heads of the various project area kubupatens (Bupatis), the head
of the Provincial Estate Crop Services (DPD), the project manager (First
Director PTP XII), the site managers, the provincial head of the BRI, and
representatives of other relevant provincial government agencies. The PCC
has conducted a census of all concerned families and determined their
willingness to enter the project, and has arranged the alienation of private
and government land for the project. In the future the PCC would:
(a) arrange the construction, (under INPRES programs), of health
and education facilities in the project areas;
(b) arrange for recruitment of prospective smallholders for the
project to be accepted by the project managers as suitable estate
laborers;
(c) expedite the granting of hak pakai and hak milik to the
smallholders; and
(d) ensure adequate food crop extension services for the
smallholders.



- 39 -
3.09      Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI).  The BRI would be the handling bank
for recovery of smallholder debt obligations.  On behalf of GOI, BRI would
enter into smallholder credit agreements with each smallholder family when
the smallholder receives hak milik to his holding, about three years after
settlement. The nucleus estates would deduct: and transfer to the BRI the
smallholders- repayments from their production, which it would process and
market for him (see para. 4.09). GOI would pay the BRI a handling fee of 1%
or less on the total outstanding loans for this service.
3.10      Bank Indonesia (BI).  The BI would make available MOF funds to the
estates (see para. 2.35).
Agricultural Support Services for Smallholdei:s
3.11      At maturity (five years for coconu:, and six years for rubber)
when the smallholders receive control of their trees, the nucleus
estates would supply them extension, processing and marketing services. The
nucleus estates would organize the smallholders into groups of about 20
farmers, each of which would elect a group leader. The estates would
provide a chief foreman, with an extensive kaowledge of crop pests and
diseases and fertilizer requirements, who woald supervise about five
smallholder groups. The chief foreman would report all pest and disease
outbreaks to the estate which would supply the necessary pesticides for the
smallholders to apply.  If necessary, the estates would provide back-up
technical advice for the chief foreman to diagnose difficult to recognize
pests and diseases. The estate would also procure all the smallholders'
fertilizer requirements, and, at the correct time, bring it already mixed to
the smallholders' village, supplying him with a measure to apply the correct
amount of fertilizer per tree. The chief foreman would organize and
supervise his groups to apply fertilizer.  The estate would have a 90 sq m
building in each village, consisting of a 36 sq m office for the chief
foreman, and a 54 sq m warehouse.
3.12      Harvesting and Collection.  The estate would organize harvesting or
tapping schools of about two weeks for the smallholders. They would collect
the smallholders' production for processing from designated collection
spots. To ensure regular, continuous harveEting, and efficient collection,
the estates would allocate each group a harvesting schedule.
3.13      Marketing Services.  The estates would. market the smallholder-s
production. The estates would subtract fronL the smallholder's gross
proceeds all his fertilizer, pesticide, tree crop advisory services,
collection, processing and marketing costs, and would pay him once a week
for his production (para. 4.06).
3.14      Gardens and Food Crops.  In West Java PTP XII would give each
smallholder it moves into a new area Rp 55,000 to buy initial perennial
garden seedlings, food crop seeds and pesticides and fertilizers. While the
smallholders would be able to purchase the perennial seedlings in the



- 40 -
villages, PTP XII would supply pesticides and fertilizers for sale at the
estate godown in each village. As the smallholder would be a full-time
estate employee and earn a wage, in subsequent years he should be able to
finance his pesticide and fertilizer purchase for his food crops. The
kecamatan food crop services would supply the smallholder extension services
for his food crops. The Bank-assisted National Food Crops Extension project
(Loan 1267-IND) is training and stationing extension workers throughout West
Java at a ratio of one field worker (PPL) per 1,600 farmers.
3.15      In Bengkulu PTP XXIII would provide each smallholder at arrival
on-site with a package of perennial seedlings, food crop seeds, pesticides
and fertilizers.  In subsequent years PTP XXIII would supply perennial
seedlings, food crop seeds, pesticides and fertilizers at each of its
village godowns for sale to the smallholder. As the smallholder would
cultivate about 0.3 ha of food crops, he should be able to finance his
purchases of seeds and agrochemicals from his estate laborer wages. As in
West Java, the kecamatan food crop services would supply extension services
for food crops. The Bank-assisted National Food Crops Extension II project
(Credit 996-IND) in future would upgrade food crop extension services in the
project areas, and station one PPL per 800 farmers.
Operation and Maintenance
3.16      All principal access and village roads constructed by the nucleus
estates in the smallholder areas would be turned over to the provincial
governments. During project implementation the nucleus estates would
maintain them. After project completion the kabupaten public works would
have this responsibility.  However, the estates would maintain estate roads
at all times. An assurance was obtained from GOI that all project principal
access and village roads would be adequately and timely maintained by the
appropriate district agencies after project completion.
3.17      Public buildings and community facilities constructed by the
nucleus estates for the smallholders would be turned over to the appropriate
ministries, which would then assume responsibility for their operation and
maintenance. The Ministry of Religion would supply a religious leader to
the place of worship constructed in each village. The Ministry of Home
Affairs would appoint village officials and make the necessary arrangements
for the integration of the new villages into the existing district and
provincial governmental structure.
3.18      The nucleus estates would operate and maintain all harvest
collection tracks, crop collection equipment, and processing facilities.
The smallholders would contribute 100% of their share of these costs, and
the nucleus estate, after marketing the smallholder-s production, would
deduct these costs from their gross proceeds.

4. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKE" PROSPECTS, PRICES,
FARM INCOMES AND PROJECI' CHARGES
Agricultural Production
4.01      The project would establish and rehabilitate 26,490 ha of tree
crops and 1,700 ha of gardens and food crops, consisting of 17,010 ha of
rubber (including 1,370 ha rehabilitated), 9,480 ha of coconuts (including
480 ha rehabilitated), 680 ha gardens and 1,02(1 ha food crops. It also
would increase production on at least 1,500 ha of existing food crops. The
NES V SAR Annex 2 describes crop varieties and how, for its project areas,
the estates would establish nurseries, and clear, plant, maintain and
harvest rubber and coconuts. It also describes the existing settlers' food
cropping patterns and yields, and with the project, future food cropping
patterns and yields. In this project, these practices would be similar.
Table 4.1 summarizes the phasing of tree crop plantings, Table 4.2 tree crop
yields and production, and Table 4.3 project area cropping patterns, yields
and production.
Market Prospects
4.02      Rubber and Coconut.  For rubber and coconut oil, market prospects
remain essentially the same as reported in the NES V SAR (paras. 5.02-5.06).
The bulk (90%) of the additional project rubber production would be sold on
the world market, with the balance being sold locally. Rubber smallholders
usually sell their produce as unsmoked sheet or slab and lump to middlemen,
who then sell to processors. The price the smallholder receives varies
depending on the middleman's estimate of the diy rubber content (drc), and
usually is 35 to 40% of the f.o.b. value of prccessed low grade rubber.
Although quality is usually poor with slab rubber containing much dirt and
bark, the middleman's profit is usually excessive. With improved quality and
marketing conditions the smallholders should rEceive higher prices than they
presently obtain. Under the project, smallholders would be required to sell
enough rubber through the nucleus estate to meEt their debt repayments.
However, by reducing middlemen profits and improving the quality of the
produce, the nucleus estate would be able to pay them about 70% of the f.o.b.
processed rubber price, and this should encourage them to sell most of their
rubber through the nucleus estate. The nucleus estate in turn would sell
rubber production through the Joint Marketing Office (JMO), an organization
the public estates have established to market their products.
4.03      The incremental production of coconut oil and copra cake would be
sold locally. Smallholders initially would sell their husked coconuts to
the estates, who would produce copra and crush it for oil and cake. In
future, the smallholders may retain ownership of the oil and cake until the
estates sell it for them. The estates, of course, would process and market
it for the smallholders, charging them for these services. At present,
coconut smallholders sell some fresh nuts in the village or produce a low
quality, inadequatley dried copra (moisture content 15% or more) which they
sell to middlemen. Under the project, smallholders would be required to



- 42 -
sell enough fresh nuts through the nucleus estate for their debt repayments.
As in rubber processing, however, the nucleus estate would eliminate excess-
ive middlemen profits, have the latest and most efficient copra preparation
facilities and crushing mills, and thus be able to pay the smallholders a
premium above existing farm-gate prices, thus making it attractive for them
to sell their production through the nucleus estates.
4.04      Food Crops.  The smallholders would produce upland rice, corn,
cassava, and vegetables mainly for family consumption. Surpluses of
leguminous crops (peanuts), cloves, coffee and other garden production would
be readily saleable in adjacent market towns.
Prices
4.05      For financial and economic analysis, inputs and outputs have been
valued at present and projected (1990) prices expressed in mid-1982 constant
values. Future economic prices for rubber, coconut oil, rice, corn, peanuts
and fertilizers were derived from the Bank's Commodity Divisions forecasts for
world market prices and adjusted for transportation, processing, and handl-
ing costs down to the farm-gate level (Project File Working Papers). Crops
not traded on the international markets have been expressed in actual farm-
gate prices averaged over three years (1979-81) and adjusted for inflation.
Agrochemicals' economic prices have been assumed to remain constant in real
terms. Project rubber output has been valued 90% as Standard Indonesia
Rubber (SIR) 20 which sells c.i.f. New York for 7% less than ribbed smoked
sheet grade 1 (RSS 1). Subtracting ocean freight and brokerage costs would
give an f.o.b..price before taxes at Indonesian ports of Rp 773/kg mid-1982
and Rp 1,078 in 1990 (US$1-24 and US$1-72/kg respectively). The correspond-
ing f.o.b. financial prices are Rp 719 and Rp 1,002/kg, obtained by deduct-
ing export and sales taxes (7% of f.o.b. price, Indonesian ports). The
nucleus estate would pay the smallholder about 70% of the f.o.b. financial
price at Indonesian ports, that is, Rp 701/kg drc in 1990 (mid-1982 constant
values). World supply and demand would also influence the prices of the 10%
of rubber sold locally and its estimated value ex-factory would be some 73%
of SIR 20, f.o.b. main Indonesian ports. Thus its economic price would be
Rp 564/kg in mid-1982 and Rp 786/kg in 1990, and its financial price (less
2% tax) Rp 553 and Rp 770/kg respectively.
4.06      Before 1976, Indonesian coconut oil prices were generally compar-
able to world prices as Indonesia was an exporter. Since 1976, however,
domestic demand exceeded local production and GOI limited imports. Domestic
prices consequently rose above world market prices. After devaluation of
the Indonesian rupiah in November 1978, the local price declined to 31%
below the world market. Since then strong domestic demand has again pushed
local prices above world market prices even though, as a substitute for
coconut oil, GOI has diverted palm oil from the export to the local market.
World market prices for coconut oil are forecast to rise from US$697/ton
c.i.f. at Indonesian ports in mid-1982 to US$1,044/ton in 1990. Local
financial prices are projected to rise at a slower rate and to come into



- 43 -
line with world market levels, from Rp 480/kg (US$768/ton) ex-factory Java
in mid-1982 to Rp 646/kg (US$1,033/ton) in 1990. Similarly copra cake, the
principal by-product from coconut oil extraction, is projected to sell at
Rp 70/kg ex-factory in mid-1982 and Rp 85/kg in 1990. Assuming 4.5 fresh
coconuts produce 1 kg of dry copra (6% moisture), which, when pressed, gives
62% oil and 38% copra cake, the estates could pay the smallholders around
Rp 50 per fresh nut in mid-1982 (Rp 225/kg copra equivalent) and Rp 65/nut
in 1990 (Rp 293/kg copra equivalent). During harvesting periods, the
nucleus estates would pay all smallholders on a weekly basis, whether they
are producing rubber or coconuts. This would help ensure they sell enough
production through the nucleus estates to meet their debt repayments.
Weekly payments reduce the likelihood they would sell their production, even
though at lower prices, through other channels for a more constant cash
supply. The nucleus estates would establish committees, including represen-
tatives of the smallholders, which would meet monthly to set prices for
smallholder production. To ensure the smallholders have a constant cash
flow for their production, assurances were obtained from GOI that (a) the
nucleus estates would pay them weekly during the first three harvesting
years; and (b) the nucleus estates would establish committees including
smallholder representatives which would meet monthly to set prices. In
setting smallholder prices, the committee would take into account:
(a) all legitimate-and reasonable expenses of the estates in
collecting, transporting, processing and marketing of small-
holder production;
(b) the importance of encouraging both smallholder production and
good quality production;
(c) the need for the estate to earn a return on the capital employed
in the processing facilities;
(d) settler cooperative charges, if any, and GOI taxes; and
(e)  the desirability of both estates and smallholders sharing equi-
tably in the value added to smallholder production through
processing.
Farm Incomes
4.07      Future farm incomes have been calculated for the West Java
settlers assuming that each family has a 2.0 ha farm consisting of 0.2 ha
garden, 0.3 ha food crops and 1.5 ha coconuts. In Bengkulu, each small-
holder is assumed to have a 3.0 ha farm consisting of 0.2 garden, 0.3 ha
food crops, 2.0 ha rubber and 0.5 ha undeveloped. Revenues, costs and debt
repayments have been calculated in constant mid-1982 values, using present
and projected 1990 prices. Farm budgets have been calculated according to
cash flows. Family labor has not been costed, and each family should have
sufficient labor to cultivate the proposed garden, food and tree crops



- 44 -
without hiring labor. Farmers would pay a land tax (IPEDA) which would vary
according to the annual income from the land. Table 4.4 summarizes the
results for each province.
4.08      During the development period the smallholder is protected from
any loss or fall in income. His estate wages would give him an income,
which for many, would be equal to or greater than his present earnings, and
would insure against income declines due to food crop failures. In year
seven after planting for the rubber producers, and year six for coconut
producers, the smallholders would be able to commence and continue their
debt repayments without difficulty. Incomes with the project would be
considerably higher than incomes without the project, and should be a
considerable incentive for project area cultivators to join the project. In
future without the project the existing West Java cultivator's incomes would
be kbout US$305 per annum (the average income for about 70-75% of the West
Java smallholders) or US$60 per capita. With the project, by Year 10 all
family incomes before debt repayment should be at least US$2,600 or US$520
per capita. As the present Indonesian average per capita GNP is about
US$420 and the estimated per capita GNP in ten years (1992) is US$620, the
project would enable beneficiaries to significantly improve their income
levels relative to other income levels throughout the economy, that is, from
about 15% at present to 84% of per capita GNP. Additionally, an estimated
90% of project area farmers presently have incomes below the critical con-
sumption level. The project would lift these farmer's incomes above this
level.
Cost Recovery
4.09      Smallholder Loans.  At the end of the third year after planting
when DGA has prepared the hak milik titles for the land, the smallholders
would enter into a credit agreement with the BRI. This agreement would
include all credit expenditures by the nucleus estates during the preceeding
years, and provisional estimates of the estates credit expenditures during
year four after planting for coconut establishment, and during years four
and five for rubber establishment. The agreements for coconuts and rubber
would be amended in year five and year six respectively to include the
estates actual credit expenditures to bring the coconuts and rubber to
maturity. The nucleus estates would keep separate accounts of smallholder
development costs, and total credit items would be divided into standardized
credit amounts for each smallholder. The credits between the BRI and the
smallholders would be secured by land titles until repaid. The agreements
would be for 17 years, with repayments over 14 or 15 years, that is, with
two years of grace for coconut producers, and three for rubber producers.
Thus coconut smallholders would commence repayments in the sixth year after
planting, and rubber smallholders in the seventh. Interest would be 10.5%
per annum, and would be capitalized during the grace period.
4.10      Cost Recovery.  The estates, following procedures established
under the earlier NES projects, would recover the smallholder credits by
retaining the smallholders' annual credit repayment from the sales revenues
of the crops they would process and market for the smallholders. The



- 45 -
committees (see para. 4.06) would determine the price for the smallholder's
produce, net of taxes, depreciation, processing and marketing costs, and
management fees. The estates would then detErmine the individual small-
holders total sales revenue and would deduct from it an amount sufficient to
repay the annual loan installment. An assurance was obtained from GOI that
it would cause each smallholder to sell to PTh XII or PTP XXIII sufficient
quantity of coconuts or rubber at the determined prices to amortize his
debt obligations. The estates would keep all records of raw material
delivery to the factory by smallholders, and of factory or mill output and
sales revenue. They would transfer all cost recovery to the BRI which would
keep a record of all individual smallholder accounts.
4.11      Besides repaying all credit development items, smallholders would
pay a land tax (IPEDA), which village heads would collect and turn over to
local and provincial administrations for providing public services. IPEDA
can be considered a direct project tax which contributes towards the opera-
tional costs of the governmental agencies involved in the villages. It is
assessed as a percentage of the value of farm production and the amounts
collected would increase as crop yields rise. Annual IPEDA payments are
estimated to reach about Rp 60,000 per farm in West Java, and Rp 50,000 per
farm in Bengkulu.
4.12      Rent and Cost Recovery Indices.  Tci determine the extent of cost
recovery and the relation of project charges to benefits, cost and rent
recovery indices have been calculated. Cost recovery indices vary from 60%
to 71%, and rent recovery indices from 94% to 96%. These results are
satisfactory, and Table 4.5 shows the rent and cost recovery indices
calculations. In calculating these indices, export and sales taxes which
GOI charges on rubber (7% of f.o.b. price, Irndonesian ports), and coconut
oil (sales tax 2.5% of f.o.b. price, Indonesian ports), have been excluded.
If they were, the rent and cost indices woulc increase.

5. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
5.01      Benefits.  The project would intensify land use at the three
proposed sites, and in West Java and Bengkulu provinces create 2,200 new
farms, associated smallholder settlements and infrastructure. Through land
clearing, the constructing of roads, houses, estate buildings and processing
facilites, and supplying agro-chemicals, extension services and technical
assistance it would establish or rehabilitate production from about 26,500
ha of tree crops, 1,700 ha of gardens and food crops, and improve production
on another 1,500 ha of food crops. It would directly benefit 8,450 small-
holder families, and provide full time employment for another 3,900 families
working for the estates. By creating potential employment opportunities in
other sectors to service the agricultural settlements the project would
indirectly benefit at least another 3,600 families. During the initial
development period the project would provide each smallholder family with
one full time job for four or five years, and, as project beneficiaries are
presently doing work of low productivity, when the tree crops are bearing
would create at least one new permanent job per project family directly
assisted or hired. By rehabilitating PNP XXVII, the project would help
GOI's smallholder development program expand in the future. It would also
increase rubber exports and local supplies cf coconut oil, create productive
employment for the rural poor, and ensuring a productive and sustainable use
of underutilized land and water resources.
5.02      The base cost of settling a family under the project would very
from US$5,400 for a coconut smallholder at Agrabinta to US$7,400 (constant
mid-1982 prices) for a rubber smallholder at. Seluma (Annex I, Table 4). At
Seluma the higher development cost per family is explained by the larger
area the project would develop for rubber snmallholders (2.0 ha versus 1.5 ha
coconut in West Java). At each site the credit, or repayable costs, are
some 86% of the total settlement cost. As t:he project would create about
12,400 new permanent jobs in agriculture (pacra. 5.01) for a total investment
of US$130.9 million (base cost plus physica]. contingenecies), each job would
cost US$10,600. This compares favorably wit:h job creation in medium- to
large scale industry in Indonesia at about UTS$20,000.
5.03      Expected future crop yields and production with the project are
shown in Table 4.3. Additionally, Chapter 4 discusses and presents the
economic and financial prices for inputs and outputs, based on the Bank-s
commodity price forecasts and domestic prices. The project files contain
tables showing the expected crop production costs and labor requirements per
ha, and the total expected agricultural benefits at maximum agriculture
production in the project areas.
5.04      The project file contains tables ,howing the monthly labor
requirements per crop. In West Java, since the project area has excessive
labor supplies and considerable employment of low productivity, the



- 52 -
agricultural and unskilled laborer wage has been shadow priced. Economic
wages have been assessed at Rp 500/man day (about 50% of the market wage),
the estimated value of low productive work in the project areas, and the
opportunity cost of discontinuing this work. Because of the labor shortages
to undertake the project in Bengkulu and Maluku and cost of transporting
labor to the project area, the current wages there have not been shadow
priced.
5.05      Investment Costs.  As used for the economic analyses, and expressed
in mid-1982 prices, the total investment costs including physical contingen-
cies but excluding price contingencies are:

Bengkulu           34.6        Seram               34.6
Investment costs are net of taxes and transfer payments, and foreign exchange
costs were converted to rupiah at Rp 625 = US$1.00, assuming a standard con-
version factor of 1.0. Investment costs have been adjusted to reflect the
economic value of fertilizers, and in West Java, the economic value of
unskilled labor used in plantation establishment.
5.06      Development Period.  Table 4.1 shows the phasing of tree crop plan-
ting at all sites, and Table 4.2 the yields and production over time. Inclu-
ding the plantings financed by NES V start-up funds, in West Java and Bengkulu
the estates would commence some tree plantings during the 1981-82 wet season
(October-May); and at Seram during the 1982 wet season (April-October).
Smallholders would move to the sites during the project's first year, and
during the second year, start growing food crops. They would achieve the
projected food crop yields over five years and projected garden yields in 15
years.
5.07      Economic Rates of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions, and
discounting project costs and benefits over 30 years, the economic rates of
return are summarized as follows:

Bengkulu           14              Seram                13
5.08      Sensitivity Analysis.  Sensitivity analysis was used to determine
the project-s sensitivity to cost overruns, benefit reductions, and lags in
benefit flows. To that end, crossover values at a 10% discount rate were
calculated for the cost and benefit streams. The crossover value is the
value of the variable tested for which the project s net present value,
calculated at 10% discount rate, is zero, or equivalently, the value beyond
which the economic rate of return would be beLow 10%. Therefore, the
greater the difference between the crossover value and the value assumed in
the analysis, the less sensitive the economic rate of return is to the
variable tested. Table 5.3 shows the results.
5.09      Values in Table 5.3 indicate that Cikaso and Agrabinta nucleus
estates are the most sensitive to the variables tested. The other four
components, however, could experience considerable increases in cost or
decreases in benefits, or a three year time lag in the commencement of
benefit streams (while project costs are assuned not to lag), before their
economic rates of return would fall below 10%. While adverse conditions
more readily would cause Cikaso and Agrabinta nucleus estates economic rates
of return to fall below 10%, these components should still be undertaken.
PTP XII-s management would closely monitor the progress of these components,
and as they are solely estate investments, would have complete control over
all the works.

5.10       Table 5.3 shows the 1980 audited accounts for PTP XII and PTP
XXIII, and 1980 management accounts for PNP XXVIII, which are yet to be
audited. While both PTP XII and PTP XXIII made profits in 1980, lower
commodity prices and rising labor costs would constrain profits over the
next several years. Additionally GOI wants these two estates to invest
considerably more in nucleus estate development in the near future, thus
putting more strain on their finances. PNP XXVIII is currently making
losses, and requires financial restructuring and new investment to become

5.11      Annex 2 contains the projected cash flows for PTP XII and
PTP XXIII, while the project file contains Tor the three estates projected
profit and loss accounts for the proposed developments, capital expendi-
tures under the project, other capital develoDment expenditure, and other
detailed financial data. These analyses indicate that the estates could
undertake their proposed works and repay the debts incurred under the
project if GOI provides the estates with the proposed mix of equity and
loan funds (para. 2.35-36), and ensures they keep to the suggested ratios
of long-term debt to equity (para. 2.36).
5.12      The financial analyses of PTP XII show that while it can under-
take this project two other major developments it is now commencing must be
reduced in size. These are a GOI fully financed nucleus estate in West
Kalimantan (proposed PTP XII investment Rp 15.5 billion) and replanting and
reaabilitation of PTP XII rubber lands in Java including old PTP XXX leases
(proposed investment Rp 29.5 billion). Over the next five years these
investments should be reduced to around Rp 6.7 billion and Rp 14.5 billion
respectively to ensure PTP XII keeps a ratio of long term debt to equity of
no more than 60/40. Additionally, to further help its cash flow position
PTP XII should only borrow about 50% of these funds. GOI has agreed to a
reduction in these investments.
5.13      The financial analyses of PTP XXIII show it to be financially
strong and well able to repay the small amourt of funds it would borrow
under this project.
5.14      Project Risks.  There are no unusual technical risks for the pro-
posed project. The proposed agricultural practices, inputs and yields are
based on experience gained in estate development programs, and the earlier
NES projects. Management weaknesses have existed in previous NES projects,
especially a diffusion of management responsibility between the DGE, the
nucleus estate, the project manager and provincial governments. Since
mid-1980 these have been remedied by delegating increased authority to the
nucleus estate, and by selecting the First Director of the estate as a
project manager. Consequently project management and implementation have
improved considerably.
5.15      At present PNP XXVIII is weak technically, managerially and finan-
cially. However, with the measures already l:aken by GOI to strengthen it
managerially, and the proposed technical and financial assistance outlined
in Chapters 2 and 3, it would be able to undertake its part of the project.
In earlier Bank assisted projects the implementing estates were also weak.
However, with project assistance they all have developed into strong
financial and managerial entities.
5.16      There is a risk that smallholders would not sell their production
to the nucleus estates, and the estates would thus be unable to collect the
smallholders annual loan repayments. However, because the estates would
operate the harvest collection services, they would be in a strong position
to monitor the flow of smallholder production and to take action if the



- 56 -
smallholders did not repay loans. The smallholders, through their Credit
Agreements with the BRI, are legally bound to repay through the nucleus
estates. Additionally, to keep their processing facilities operating at
full capacity, the estates would act competitively to obtain the
smallholders production. As well, the project provides that the estates
would pay the smallholders weekly, thus ensuring they have a regular cash
income, which should make cash sales at lower unit prices to middlemen less
attractive.
5.17      Under Credit 319-IND due to the estates  inexperience the process-
ing facilities were built late and the resulting unprocessed production
caused revenue losses. To counteract this, the project would provide inter-
national consultants to plan, design, assist with tendering and supervise
the construction of all major processing facilities.
5.18      Taking the above safeguards into account, and along with the
results of the sensitivity analysis, the project's indicated risks are
judged acceptable.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached with the Government on
the following points:
(a)  PTP XII would complete its coconut oil extraction factory by
December 31, 1986 and PNP XXVIII by December 31, 1987, and if the
PTP XII mill is not in operation by the stated date, PTP XII
would purchase from smallholders at an appropriate price any
coconut production offered for sale after December 31, 1986
(para. 2.17);
(b)  GOI would ensure that each qualifying smallholder would receive
within three years after settlement hak milik to 1.5 ha of
planted tree crops in West Java and 2.0 ha of planted tree crops
in Bengkulu and in each case an additional area for house lot,
garden and food crops to give a total of about 2.0 ha in West
Java and 3.0 ha in Bengkulu (para. 2.21);
(c)  DGE and the estates would hire consultants as outlined in
paras. 2.10, 2.11, 2.17, and 2.25 with qualifications and under
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, and would have
signed contracts and finalized arrangements for engaging them by
the dates stated in para. 2.25 (paras. 2.10, 2.11, 2.17 and
2.25);
(d) GOI would (i) provide nucleus estate and estate development funds
as described in para. 2.36; (ii) ensure that PTP XII and PTP XXIII



- 57 -
would at all times maintain a ratio of long-term debt to equity
of not more than 60/40; (iii) PNP XXVIII would for the first fif-
teen years of the project maintain a ratio of long-term debt to
equity of not more than 70/30 and afterwards would at all times
maintain a ratio of long-term debt to equity of not more than
60/40; and (iv) PTP XII, PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII would consult
with the Bank before undertaking any other new development pro-
ject exceeding Rp 1.5 billion in the case of PTP XII and PNP
XXVIII and Rp 2.0 billion in the case of PTP XXIII (para. 2.36);
(e) GOI would (i) group works for local competitive bidding into a
number of suitable contracts (minimum size whenever feasible
US$320,000) that would enable large local contractors or joint
ventures of small local firms to bid; and (ii) documents for
contracts to cost US$320,000 or more would be submitted to
the Bank for review before tendering and award (para. 2.40);
(f) PTP XII, PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII would (i) keep separate accounts
for all investment costs under the project for smallholders and
estate development; (ii) these accounts would be audited each year
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently
applied by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; and (iii)
the audit reports would be submitted to the Bank no later than
August 1st of each year (paras. 2.43-2.44);
(g) The project managers, assisted by Team Khusus, would prepare and
submit to the DGE annual work programs and budgets by October 31
each year (para. 3.04);
(h) All principal access and village roads constructed under the
project would be adequately and timely maintained by the appro-
priate district agencies after project completion (para. 3.16);
(i) GOI would ensure that (i) the nucleus estates would pay the small-
holder weekly during the first three harvesting years; and (ii)
the nucleus estates would establish committees including small-
holder representatives , which would meet monthly to set commodity
prices following guidelines enumerated in para. 4.06 (para.
4.06); and
(j) GOI would cause each smallholder to sell to PTP XII and PTP XXIII
sufficient quantity of coconuts or rubber at the determined
prices to amortize his debt obligations (para. 4.10);
6.02      Agreement was reached with the Government that the Bank's loan
would not become effective until GOI has fulfilled all conditions necessary
for the effectiveness of the CDC loan.
6.03      Agreement was also reached with the Government on the follow-
ing conditions of disbursement against individual project components:



- 58 -
(a) Agraria issuing Hak Guna Usaha to PNP XXVIII for its concession
areas at the project site in Seram Island, Maluku province (para.
1.22);
(b) The signing of financing arrangements between the MOF or BI and
the individual estates in a form and substance satisfactory to the
Bank (para 2.35); and
(c) The signing of smallholder development agreements between the DGE
and the nucleus estates (para 3.05).
6.04      With the above assurances and conditions the project would be
suitable for a Bank loan of US$68.1 million with a 20-year maturity
including a grace period of five years, and a CDC loan of US$28 million on
mainly similar terms. The borrower would be the Republic of Indonesia.

Ia  Apart from  the trading results of 1985/86, which have been treated on this schedule as arising steadily in 1986, all other Seram  project income
and expenditures previously detailed in terms of years to June 30 have been reclassified in terms of the calendar year, using the assumption that
they will arise evenly through the project year.
/b  Capital expenditure for the LUWU project has been derived from PNP 28's constant price projections and the Working Party's amendments thereto with
adjustments made to increase the costs of roads and processing equipment to a level that bears comparison with NES V oil palm development costs.
As a result of our adjustments, the finance required for the oil palm project (other than for working capital) has risen to Rp 51,866 million,
compared to a figure of Rp 41,680 million given in a document submitted to the Working Party. The NES VI mission has not appraised the LUJWU project.
/c  Net working capital has been determined as equivalent to two months' sales.
7d  Finance plan adopted for the LUWU project:  40X of finance fo initial capital expenditure in each year is provided inthe form of equity and the
balance as a long-term loan carrying interest at 13-1/2% p.a. Up to 75% of working capital needs are met by a loan for this purpose on which
interest at 12% p.a. is charged. Each annual drawdown of the long-term loan has been considered separately for repayment purposes; in each case
interest is capitalized for the first six years and then the combined sum of principal and capitalized interest repaid by equal annual install-
ments over the remaining years through to the end of project year 16 or later, when necessary, to give a minimum term of ten years from drawdown
to repayment of the final installment.
/e  The capita(expenditure for two hybrid coconut seed gardens, each of 180 ha, has been based on the physical inputs for the NES V coconut seed gardens.
7W  Finance plan adopted for the coconut seed gardens:  407.of the finance required each year has been provided by equity capital and the balance by a
loan carrying interest at 13-1/2% p.a.  In the same way as the LUWU project, each annual drawdown of the loan has been considered separately for
repayment purposes; in each case interest is capitalized for the first six years and then the combined sum of principal and capitalized interest
repaid by equal annual installments over the remaining years through to year 16, or frm commencement of the first coconut seed garden to 1998.

NUCLEUS ESTATES AND SMALLHOLDER VI PROJECT
Start-Up Funds
NES V - Start-Up Funds
1.        NES V provided start-up funds for the three estates involved in
this project. Table I shows the items and amounts involved. While the Bank
and DGE have agreed on the allocation of total funds to each estate, if
necessary, the allocation of funds between items could be changed.
NES VI - Start-Up Funds
2.        The project provides US$11.5 million start-up funds to initiate
activities, such as planning, nursery and field development, construction of
houses, buildings and roads, for future Bank-assisted tree crop projects. GOI
and the Bank have already agreed to allocate some of these funds to PTP VI,
PTP XXIII and PNP XXVIII for start-up activities of NES VII (Table 2).
Other estates could also use these funds, including, among others, PTP IV,
PTP XII, PNP XIX, PTP XXIX/XXV, PTP XXVI, PTP XXVII, PNP XXVIII, and PTP XXIX.
Before any funds are allocated to these or other estates, however, DGE and
the Bank would agree on the particular works the estates would undertake and
the estimated cost.
