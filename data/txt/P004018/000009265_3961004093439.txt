MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF iNDONESIA
FOR THE FLORES EARTHOUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
1.    Ihe following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of
Indonesia for US$42.1 million equivalent is submitted for approval m support of the
Govenmnent's earthquake reconstruction efforts. The proposed loan would have a term of 20
years, including five years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
2.    La-kgpnid. The earthquake that occurred in Flores at 1:30 pm. on December 12,
1992, was one of the strongest and most destructive earthquakes in recent Indonesian history and
the first of this magnitude recorded on the island of Flores. The tremor had a magnitude of 7.5 on
the Richter scale and affected an area of about 10,000 square kilometers on the island of Flores.
The earthquake's epicenter was located in the Flores Sea, at an estimated depth of 15 kdlometers
below sea level, some 50 kilometers northwest of the city of Maumere. Between December .2
and 22, 148 aftershocks occurred with nmxitnum magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 6.0 on the
Richter scale. The earthquake generated tidal waves (tsunami) along the northern coast of Flores
with a maximumn height of about four meters at Babi Island and three meters at Wuring and
Maumere. The most serious damage occurred over an area of about 6,000 square kilometers,
affectng the kabupatens (Districts) of Ende, Mlores Tinmr, Ngada and Sikka and the towns of
Ende and Maumere, which received severe damage to their basic infrastructure, government
buildings, markets, religious buildings, shops, schools, health facilities and housing. Overall, 1,951
people have died, 2,126 were injured and more than 25,000 houses, 600 schools and 135 health
factis were destroyed or severely damaged. The damage to homes and public infrastructure
(roads, bridges, jetties, airport facliies, irrigation works, water supply and distribution systems,
schools, health facilities, and govemment buildings) totals an estimated Rp. 564 billion (US$273.5
million equivalent; The earthquake's total damage to agriculture (irvestock and field crops),
fishing (boats, nets and other equipment) and comncal and other private buildings (mcluding
p- vate schools and health facilities) is sfill being assessed by the Government. The pictures
included at the front of this Memorandum illustrate the magnitude of the damages.
3.    To cope with the disaster, the Government has fomnulated a three-stage program. The
first stage, rescue and relief operations, directed by the National Coordiating Board for Disaster
Control (BAKORNAS) , focused on the immediate actions needed to help the people affected and
lasted for about three weeks. The second stage, rehabilitation and recovery, is being carried out
by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and other line deparunents represented in BAKORNAS
and is focused on temporary arrangements and rapidly executed projects to put vital infrastrucre



-2-
back into service. The second stage started on December 27, 1992 with an expected duration of
three months for temporay measures. In canying out Stages 1 and 2, the Government of
Indonesia (GOI) is being assisted by United Nations reilief agencies, private sector organizations,
non-govenmnental orgnizations and bilatal agencies. The dwd sXe, reconstruction, comprises
the longer-tenn restoration effort, with about 50 days of pling and two to three years of
execution. The Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs and the State Minister for
Development Planning (concurently the Charn  of the National Development Plaming
Agency, BAPPENAS), in cooperation with other government agencies, especially the Ministry of
Public Works (MPW), are responsible for this third stage task. Speciad emphasis will be given to
the use of seismic-resistant constuction standards in the following types of infrastructure that
have been given priority in the reconstruction program: roads and bridges, port facilities, water
supply, irngation and river works, and social infrastructure including homes, hospitals, schools,
and maikets.
4.    The overall Reconstmution Program for public infastructure and housing would cost an
estimated US$148.7 million. To fmance this program, GOI has approached various extena
donors and multilater  sources. Mny govermments ane multilateral donors have responded
positively. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to complete its apprais of a
US$37.6 million loan (for roads and bridges, port faciities and water resources) fiom its Special
Fund resources in mid-April 1993. The Australian Intemnational Development Assistance Bureau
(AIDAB) is ready to provide about US$13.0 million to assist in the reconstrction and
development program.  The proposed Bank loan will provide 45% of the extenal financng
sought by GOI.
5.    Bak Approach and Project Preparation. In response to a Govenment request for
assistance in mconstructing        damaged by the earthquake, the Bank's initial damage
assessment mission, comprsng three staff from the Resident Staff in Indonesia (RSI), visited
Maumere one week after the earthquake, on December 19, 1992, to assess the situation and
gather information for a possible reconstruction loan. The Bank staff looked also at the
possibility of using funds from existing loans for projects with co nents in Flores and
detenmined that the funds from existing loans were already eannarked for actiities ogially
planned. Staff from the RSI visited Flores again January 25-29, 1993, to idetfy and apraise the
proposed project. Negotiations for the loan were conducted in Jakarta from March 11-13,1993.
6.    Project Objives and Rationale for Bank Involvement. Within the framework of the
reconstruction program and the external assistance being proposed by ADB (reconstruction of
national and provincial roads, port facilties and water resources) and AIDAB (as yet unidentfied
but likeJy to concern longer term reconstruction and development efforts over a five-year period),
the objective of the proposed multisectoral project would be to minimize the adverse economic
impact of the disaster by assisting in the reconstruction of essential road infriastucture, health and
education facilities to promptly restore economic activity and social services in the affected areas.
As the island of Flores is in the poorest province of Indonesia, the project fis well with the
poverty reduction focus of Bank's assistance strategy for Indonesia. In additiorw, the project will
introduce measures to lessen the impact of possible future earthquakes. The project will cover
sectors in which the Bank has experience and therefore a comparative advanage in quidldy



-3 -
idenfying needed repairs, coordinating new work with ongoing contracts (in the roads sector),
and ensuring that reconstruction plans are compatble with the overall policy framework in each
sector. Bank involvement will also bring international experience to bear on the development of
General Reconstruction Guideines (GRGs) for the affected area and to prevent the recurrence of
similar earthquake damage in the future by streigthening existing building codes and/or their
enforcement Land use controls (height and building bulk limitations) will also be improved with
spec  restrictions and penalties for high-risk zones, e.g., areas subject to tidal wave impact and
unstable subsoil/geology.
7.    proiect Descrition. The proposed project witl finance reconstruction activities over a
three-year period, including (a) reconstruction investnents in (i) national and kabupaten roads and
bridges (31% of base costs); (ii) education and healdth facilities (39% of base costs); and (iii) other
facilities (10% of base costs); and (b) tecnical astistmice in the management of the overall
reconstruction progran and in the development of measures to mitigate earthquake, landslide and
tidal wave (tsunami) damage in the future, frcluding technical assistance in spatial planig and
the provision of taining in geology amn  seismology and the procurement of equipmen for
seismological studies (20% of base costs).
8.    The reconstruction hwestments would be focused on four subsectors (details are in the
Technical Annex):
(a)   roads and bidges - to reconstruct and rehabilitate sections of the national highway
system destroyed or badly damaged by the carthquake and landslis which
followed, and a portion of the local roads and bridges connecting towns and
vilages to the highway system;
(b)   educational faities - to reconstruct and re-equip damaged schools;
(c)   health facilities - to recotuct and re-equip damaged hospitals and clinics; and
(d)   other faciliis - to provide for (i) the relocation and reconmruction of the
commercial center of the town of Maumere and the fishig vilage of Wuring (both
extensively damaged as a result of the earthquake and tidal waves); and (ii) the
reconstuction of three volcano observation stations and the construction of a
natur hazards information cener in Maumere.
9.    Project technical assistance would prepare detvUled designs and procurement documents
and supervise contracts for project components. It would also provide support to project
management and (a) help develop General Reconstruction Guidelines for the affeted areas; (b)
rec    n revisions to the local building codes where needed; and (c) imnprove the level of
tchnical dexpr   in earthquake-resistant construction, in both the construction industry and the
public sector via training to enhance the quality and resilience of national infrastructure and
prvate buidings.



-4 -
10.   The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at US$62.9 milion equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of 32%. The proposed Bank loan of US$42.1 million would
finance about 67% of total project costs. Retroactive financing of US$7.0 illion is proposed to
cover the expenditures for the removal of debris, opening of roads, providing temporary hospitals
and medical facilities fion December 19, 1992. A summary of project costs and finarcing is
presented in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, the proportion of expenditures
to be financed and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetab1e of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations ia Indonesia are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Maps (IBRD 24567, 24568 and 24569) are also attached.
11.  Implementation. The project would be implemented over a three-year period using the
Government's existing organizational framework and in a manner consistent with its exising
policies, -,rocedures and p.-actices. Special measures would be limited to those required for
accelerated implentation and assurance of quality. Overall mana"emernt arrangements would
be reviewed with the Bank by December 31, 1993, and a      ?Ianageme. ?lan to take effect at the
begnning of the second project year and providing for transition to post-recorstmction systems
would be determined at that time. Managenent of the project as well as the overall
Reconstruction 1Fogram would be controlled fully by the Central Govenmment, in full consultation
with the region  goverments. Under broad authority of the Ministers of EKUIN and
BAPPENAS, the Deputy Chaiman V for Regional Development of BAPPENAS (Deputy V)
would be responsible for overaU project management and serve as Chainnm of a Steering
Commintte comprising the other concemed Deputy Chairmen of BAPPENAS (Deputies I and U,
the Director General for Budgetary Affairs of the Minisatry of Finance, and the Secretary Genea
of the Ministry of Public Works (SEKJEN MPW). The Steermg Committee would be supported
by a Reconstruction Mana,tement Team (RMT) reporting to the SEKJEN MPW. The RMT
would be located in Flores, with a small Secretariat in Jakarta, and it would be responsible for
operational project planning, adminision and supervision. The RMT would be responsible for
the coordination and managemnt of project implementation, which would be carried out by
Project Inplementation Units (PIUs).  In addition, a program for implementation quality
assurance, geotechnical studies and post-reconstruction planning would be establishd under
Deputy V, BAPPENAS.
12.   The Government has also been considering taking measures for Imementing the project
in an effetive manner. These would include the following:
(a)   a program for quality assurance and post reconstruction planning wil be
established in BAPPENAS (Deputy V) to ensure the quality of subproject
planning, design and construction during implementafion and for more effective
plmning to mitigate the impact of possible futume earthquakes in Indonesia,
(b)   teams of supervision engineers, separate from PIUs, wil be employed to supervise
and certify the design and qualky of project works;
(c) building codes will be revised, if necessary;



-  -
(d)   cerdfication will be prepared by RMT that sites for the reconstruction of education
and health facilties (and fte construction of the new hospital in Maumere) are
adequate;
(e)   the land cerificate for the construction of the new hospital in Maumere will be
transferred tc, the hospital director, and
(f)   a subprojects will be subject to GOrs environental asseszment procedures
(AMDAL), which are acceptable to the Bank; any sub-projects xequiring
involuntary resettlement or involving indigenous people wi  be subject to special
review by the Bank, prior to inplementation, to ensure that enviromnental
standards acceptable to the Bank have been applied.
13.  Tle details of the above implementation anrangetnents were reviewed at negotiations and
tecorded in the Minutes of Negotiations.
14.   Actions Agreed. The Borrower has agreed to:
(a) prepare General Reconstruction Guidelines (GRGs) and area-specific
reconstruction guidelines by July 31, 1993, and submit said guidelines for view
and comment by a tchnical panel established by the Governnent in consultation
with the Bank and finalize and implement them by September 30, 1993;
(b)   finalize, by August 31, 1993, the selection of roads, bridges, education, heath and
other facties for reconstruction and repair,
(c)   maintain adequate qualified staff in each of the PIUs and the RMT and provide the
necessary facilities to ensure qualitative and timely implementation and supvision
of the proposed project;
(d)   to cany out an agreed project ipplementation plan in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank;
(e)   to carry out traiing under the project in accordance with a program and
procedues satisfactory to the Bank; and
(f)   to prepare, implement, and monitor a relocation plan for the relocation of
inhabitans in the affected areas in accordance with procedures and in a m er
satisfactory to the Bank. The reeipt by the Bank of a satisfactory relocation plan
is a condition of disbursement for this conponent of the project.
15.   Sustainakila1: General Reconstrucdon Guidelines developed under the project to make
reconstruction works earthquake resistant and the construction quality supervision measures
supported by the project would contribute to eniancing sustinability of project works.



- 6 -
16.     nane is    a R . The project would provide the Government with tlse finacial and
technical assistanoe needed to reconstruct key infrastructure in the area most seriously damaged
by the earthquake. The only significant risk is the possibility of delays, which could result from a
potential loss of momentmm nomaly experienced in reconstruction activities, and from
inadequawe peonnel to  iptnett all of the sub-pxojects. To address these risks, the project wil
consist of short-term, well-focused components and will provide neeeed implementation support.
Frequent supion missions are planned during the first two years of the three-year
mplementation period so that adjustments to the program can be made as needed to resolve
promptly problems causing delays.
17.   R _o       n. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

FLORES EARTHQUAKE RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
TECHNICAL ANNEX
1.          Flores is located in the Province of Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTI). The Province
consists of an island group extending for over 500 kilometers from east to west in the eastem half
of the Indonesian archipelago. There are 566 islands in the group but most are very smal and only
42 are ihabited. Tee islands are much larger than the others. These are Flores, Sumba and the
westemm part of the island of Timor (the eastem part of Timor fornms the separate provnce of
=nor Thmur). Together these three islands comprise 84 percent of the total land area of the
province, which is more than 47,000 square klometers.
2.          Flores, with an area of 14,200 square kilometers, comprises 30 percent of the tota
land area of the province. The island is 350 kilometers in length, varies from 12 to 70 kilomers
wide and is located within an area which is considered to be the driest in Indonesia with a
pronounced dry season generaly from May to November. The ramy season is from December
through February and the nal average 1nf  ranges from less than 1,000 mllintrs in the
east of Flores (954 mllimnetrs was recorded in Maumere) to 2,500 mimetes in the western
part of the island (the highest mean amnnal rainfall, 3352 millimets, was recorded im Ruteng).
The isand has a mountaminous terrain rsig to above 2,400 meters at Mount Rana  with several
peas above 1,500 meters. There are 14 volcanoes (of which nine are active) and the landscape
corises volcanic cones, solid lava flows, grassy savannah and mountam forest with steep slopes
(which, in many places, attain 45 to 60 degrees) and deep ravines that make access to many pars
of the island extremely difficult. Landslides and slumps often occur on these steep slopes, often
tiggered by heavy rains but also by earhqukes, and geological or natural erosion rates are high
There are 12 main nvers with an overall length of under 100 lklomete  and, in most cases, these
rivers flow dectly into the nearby oceans and have no chance to develop an alluvial plain Flat
areas can be found along river valeys, the most etsive one being the valey of the Lowo Rea
River. The north coast shows a 'drowned' topography, with the occuence of wide coral fringes
whereas on the south coast hardly any coral is found. River terraces in the south show evidence of
recent lowering of the erosion base. This may be explained by an active tilting of the island
towards the north along an east-west axis, as the southem part of the island seems to be uplifted,
whereas the northen part ppears to be subsiding.
3.          The island  has a population of 1.4 mMion people and comprises the five
kabupatens of Ende (population 218,000), Flores Timur (population 266,000), Manggrai
(poputation 500,000), Ngada (population 196,000) and Sikka (247,000). The population density



TZCIWCAL AN=
Page 4 of 36
ranges from 65 to 100 persons per square kilometer in most of the kabupatens. The highest
density is in Sikka, where the population density is 140 persons per square kilometer. Most of the
population is rural, with no more than 75% of the total population living in urban areas.
4.          With an average per capita income level of Rp. 345,000 (US$167.15) in 1990,
NTT is Indonesia's poorest province. According to Bank estimates, the overall incidence of
poverty was 46 percent in 1990, more than double the national average of 20 percent and much
higher than in West Kalimantan, Indonesia's second poorest province with an incidence of 34
percent. Although NTT has less than two percent of Indonesia's population, it contributes nearly
five percent of Indonesia's poor, with an estimated 1.47 million people below the poverty line.

Source: Public Expenditure, Prices and the Poor, Annex 1.3 and Table 1.5
5.          The province is one of the least industrialized in Indonesia, with mauing
accounting for only 3.5 percent of provincial income and 0.2 percent of national industri output.
Over 80 percent of the population are engaged in agriculture and fishery. Most farming takes
place on dry fields although wet rice is grown in some areas where there is sufficient water. For
the most part, people depend on manioc and corn. Fishing is an important activity and several
fishing villages are located on the northem coast. Squid is salted locally and sent to Singapore,
and seaweed fanimg is also beginning to be exploited commercially. There are also two pearl
fanning operations. The largest employment group is in the handicrafts, textle and clothing sector
where over 12,000 people are engaged, with almost 5,000 of these in Kabupaten Ende on the
island of Flores. The province is not a major international trading area. The total recorded exports
in 1989 were US$ 8.5 milon, or 0.1 percent of hIdonesia's non-oil exports. Coffee accounted for
90 percent of the total, with Kabupaten Manggarai on Flores acoounting for 60 percent of all
coffee produced in NT. Only just over half of the recorded exports are shipped direcdy from the
province, the remainder being tansshpped through other provinces. Almost all direct exports go
through the port of Reo on the north-west coast of Flores.
6.          The entire Province of NIT, accounting for about 1.8% of the total population,
contributes only 0.8 percent of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or one percent if the oil
and gas sector is excluded. This is due to its smal population and also to its low per capita
income. Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) per capita in the province is the lowest in
Indonesia. In 1984 it was Rp 200,000, less than half the national average even excluding the oil
and gas sector.

The Earthquake
7.          The Indonesian archipelago is one of the most tectonically, and therefore
seismically, active areas in the world. Since 1900, there have been recorded in Indonesia 20
earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 7.0 on the Richter scale, and eight of these generated tidal
waves (tsunami). Historical records show that Indonesia has frequently experienced earthquakes
of all intensities with epicenters distributed throughout the countiy. The Indonesian archipelago is
located at the point of interaction of three crustal plates: the Indonesian-Australian Plate, the
Eurasian Plate and the Pacific Plate. The boundaries of these plates are, of a fault type in West
Sumatra, a trench type south of Java, a strike slip fault type north of West Irian Jaya and a trench
and strike slip fault type east of the Philippines.
8.          The island of Flores is located on the Eurasian plate along the boundary between
the Eurasian and the Indonesian-Australian plates. The formation of the island is the direct result
of plate tectomcs, with the oceaic Indonesian-Australian crustal plate moving under the Sunda
Shelf and creatng an active zone of thrust faults extending north of Mlores and progressively
deeper as the friction plane dips lower. As a result, shallow and therefore potentially destructive
earthquakes occur frequently in and around the island of Mlores itself. The island is located in the
active seismic zone classified as "very high risk" by the Southeast Asia Association of Seismology
and Earthquake Engineering. Between 1981 and 1990, and within the vciniy of the island, there
have been three earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6.5 on the Richter scale and eleven
with magnitudes between 4.0 and 6.5. There was a major earthquake in 1961 that was felt all
over the island, producing major disturbances in central lores, particuarly along the north coast.
The most strongly shaken area extended along a line contecting Ende, to the south, with the
epicenter located some 60 kilometers off north coast of the island. The maps are attached.
9.          The earthquake that occurred in Flores at 1:30 pm. on December 12, 1992, was
one of the strongest and most destructive earthquakes in recent Indonesian history and the first of
this magniude recorded on the island of Mlores. The tremor had a magnitude of 7.5 on the
Richter scale and affected an area of about 10,000 square kilometers on the island of Mtores. The
earthquaks epicenter was located in the Flores Sea, at an estimated depth of 15 kilometers below
sea level, some 50 kilometers northwest of the city of Maumere. Between December 12 and 22,
148 aftershocks occurred with maxinum magnitudes ranging from 3.0 to 6.0 on the Richter scale.
The earthquake consisted of a low angle reverse fault caused by a back-arc thrust. According to
eyewitnesses, the earthquake lasted for several minutes (estimates range from two to five mmutes)
and consisted of three shocks. The earthquake generated tidal waves (tsunami) along the
northem coast of Flores with a maxinmn height of about four meters at Babi Island and three
meters at Wuring and Maumere.
10.         The majority of coastal damage can be attributed to the effects of the tidal waves
and sand boils (rapid ground subsidcnce coupled with an upsurge of ground water causmg local
flooding) whereas the majority of damage idanli can be attributed to the direct effects of the
earthquake and to its indirect impact in the form of landslides and rock avalanches. The direct
damage can be fiuther divided into that caused by vibration of man-made faities and that caused
by ground failure and landslides. The tidal waves, sand boils and vibration of man-made faci;lites



TZCHNICAL ANWC
Page 6 of 36
resulted in the destruction of many buildings and most of the loss of lifM. Tidal waves destroyed
completely the vilage on Babi island and 260 people, out of a total population of 950, lost their
lives. Tidal waves also caused major destruction and loss of life in the fishing village of Wuring. In
both cases, loss of life was caused mainly by people trapped by sand boils and subsequently
crushed by the debris hurled at great force by the tidal waves. Ground failure, consisting of
surface fracts, landslides, differential compaction of the soil, and liquefaction produced most of
the damage to infrastructure. In addition, since the earthquake occunred during the early stages of
the amua monsoon season, the danger of landslides wil continue as the exposed hills absorb
more rain. Since the earthquake, in January 1993, a further 90 people are reported to have lost
their lives in the town of Larantuka, in East Ftores, due to the destruction of buildings caused by
high winds and heavy rams.
11.               The most serious damage occurred over an area of about 6,000 square
kilometers, affecting the kabupatens of East Flores, Ende, Ngada and Sikka and the towns of
Ende and Maumere, which received severe damage to their basic infrastructure, govemment
buildings, niarkets, religious buildings, shops, schools, health facilities and housing. The towns of
Ende and Maumer were severely damaged and at least 31 villages were destroyed. Overall,
1,951 people have died (the mam causes of death were skull and chest fractures and drownmg),
2,126 were injured (injuries consisted of bone fractres, head and chest wounds, abdominal
injuries as well as extemal injuries and burns) and more than 25,000 houses, 600 schools and 135
health facbies were destroyed or severely damaged. TIhe damage to homes and public
inrastructure (roads, bridges, jetties, airport faciities, irrigation works, water supply and
disibution systems, schools, health facilities, and govermment buildings) totals an estimated Rp.
564 bDllion (US$273.5 million equivalent). The earthquake's total damage to agriculture
(livestock and field crops), fishing (boats, nets and other equimen) and codmmrcia and other
prvate buildings (including pnvate schools and health facilites) is still being assessed by the
Govemment.
12.         There was a marked increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases, malaria and
diariea during the first and second weeks after the disaster. By the end of the third week, the
number of cases reduced to slighdy above nonnal. The earthquake caused damage to nine major
water distribution networks (in Ende, Lantka, Maumere, Nebe, Talibura and Tanjung Bunga)
and selected water samples from kabupaten SDkka showed an icrease in colifonms and salinty.
Me disaster caused severe damage to felds, farms and livestock and food storage facilities at a
time when food stocks from the previous harvest were almost exhausted and new food crops
were not yet ready for harvest. The damage to an estimated 2,000 smal boats and fishing boats
seriously disrupted the supply of fish and the destuction of the cold storage facilities at Maumere
destroyed tuna stocks conpletely. Telecommunication equimnt and instalations were damaged
and conmunications with certain areas along the north coast of East Flores and with parts of
kabupaten Ende were completely cut off. The main road lining Ende with Maumere was
completely blocked by landsides at 18 different locations. The airport runways at Ende and
Mamere remained inct, but the control towers at both airports were rendered inoperable. Piers
and jetties were damaged at Ende and Maumere. One of the three jetties at Maumere was
complely destroyed and the remaning two jetties were rendered unsafe although temporly
operable. Liquefaction has seriously damaged the sea wals, port admnistration and passenger



TECHNICAL AN
Page 7 of 36
buildings and the open storage area in Maunere. The Pertamina fuel storage tanks at Ende and
near Maunere remained intact
13.         The damage to buildings varied according to soil conditions and the nature of
construction. Most of the damage occurred to buildings that were constructed using heavy bricks
or blocks (or masomy) for the walls and heavy roof stmctures. The damage to these buildings
resulted from the failure of the brite masonry wals and the subsequent collapse of the roof due
to the lack of adequate coUar beams holding the walls and the roof together. In the case of
wooden buildings, the damage was usually due to the failure of the foundation or due to the lack
of adequate anchorage of the posts. In the case of other buildings using reinforced concrete as a
structural material with the walls and partitions constructed of non-load bearmg brick masonry,
the damage resulted from structura failure due to (a) the use of large sections of masonry walls
without reinforcement; (b) the use of inadequate reinforced concrete columns and beams (with
disproportional small cross-sections, insufficient reinforcement and a lack of adequate transverse
reinforcement and detailing); and (c) lack of proper reinforcement at the top of large openings
(for doors and windows) in the masonry walls.
14.         Another factor that contributed to the failure of many building structures was the
quaUlty of construction, in particular with regard to the following:
(a)   there was inadequate quaiLty control of the materials used in the fabrication of the
concrete (the sand was contamiated, and there was inadequate gradation of the
aggregates);
(b)   the mix of the concrete was done by hand without proper control of the amount of
water added;
(c)   the steel reinforcem  did not follow established practice for reinforced concrete
earthquake resistant design, particularly in the spacing of the transverse
reinforcement and in the design of the hooks to provide adequate confinement;
(d)   iadequate form work resulted in elements with wide vanations in their cross
sections; and
(e)   the casting of concrete was done without proper compaction resulting in extensive
honey combing (and therefore inadequate strength).
15.         One of the most obvious reasons for damage to roads was lack of engineered
slopes. In many areas in Flores, slopes are steeper than the angle of repose for the soil causing
unstable conditions. Even without an earthquake these slopes fail when heavy rains increase soil
pore pressure.

Government's Response to the Earthquake
16.         To cope with the disaster, the Govenmnent foniulated a program that divides the
work to be done into three stages: Stage 1 - basic emergency repair, focused on the inmmediate
actiors needed to help the people affected during the first two weeks of the disaster; Stage 2 -
rehabiltation and recovery, focused on rapidly implemented works to put vital infrastructure back
into service and provide temporary shelter for the homeless within three months of the disaster,
and Stage 3 - reconstruction and development, focused on the longer-term reconstruction effort
with associated measures to mitigate against the failure of ifrastructure, buildings and services in
the future. Stage 1 was directed by the National Coordinating Board for Disaster Control
(BAKORNAS) and Stage 2 is being carried out by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and
other line departmnents represented in BAKORNAS through spea supplements of their
respective FY93 budgets. In carrying out Stages 1 and 2, the Government of Indonesia is being
assisted by United Nations relief agencies, private sector organizations, non-governmental
organizations and bilateral agencies. Stage 3, under the Coordinating Minister for Econonmc
Affairs and the State Minister for Development Planming (concurrently the Chaiiman of the
National Development Plaing Agency, BAPPENAS), in cooperation with other government
agencies, provides for about 50 days of planning and two to three years of execution beginning at
the start of FY94 on April 1, 1993. Actua implemenation of the reconstruction work wil be
perforned by those agencies that would normally be responsible for the type of work involved.
Special emphasis wSi be given to the use of seismic resistant construction standards in the
following types of infrastructure that have been given priority m the reconstruction program:
roads and bridges, port facilities, water supply, irrigation and river works, and social
infastructure including homes, hospitals, schools, and markets.
17.         7he overall Reconstruction Programn for public infrastructure and housing would
cost an estimated US$148.7 million, for which the Government sought about US$93 million from
various external donors and multilatral sources. Many govemments and mutilateral donors have
expressed a willngness to assist the Government of Indonesia (GOI) in financing its
Reconstruction Program. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to complete its
appraisal of a US$37.6 nillion loan (for roads and bridges, ports and water resources) from its
Special Fund resources in mid-April 1993. The Australian Interational Development Assistance
Bureau (AIIDAB) is ready to provide about US$13.0 illion to assist in the reconstruction and
development program. The proposed Bank loan wil provide 45% of the external financing
reuired. Participation in the reconstruction program is summarized in Attachment 8.
The Bank's Response
18.         In order to be ready to respond to a Government request for assistance in
reconstructing infrastructure damaged by the earthquake, the Bank's strategy was to begin
immeiately preparing for a possible emergency reconstruction loan while at the same time
identifying uncommitted funds from existing loans concerning projects with components in Flores.
The Bank's initial damage assessment mission, comprising three staff from RSI, visited Maumnere



TSCHNIC&L aMX
Page 9 of 36
one week after the earthquake, on December 19, 1992, to assess the situation and gather
infoxmation for a possible reconstruction loan. The Govetmment request for assistance was
proposed initially by the Ministry of Public Works on December 28, 1992, and submitted officially
to the Bank by BAPPENAS on January 14, 1993. RSI staff visited Flores again January 25-29,
1993, to identify and appraise the proposed project.
19.         During appraisal, the already uncommitted balances from on-going loans were
reviewed with Government. The Bank is curently supporting the bettenment and periodic
maintenance of national and provincial roads in FMores under the Highway Sector Project (Loan
3133-IND; amount US$ 350 million; current closing date June 30, 1993). Support for the
kabupaten road programs in East Flores, Sikka, Ende, and Ngada has previously been provided
under the Second Rural Roads Project (Loan 2881-IND; amount US$190 nillion; closing date
extended to December 31, 1993), and wIll be continued under the proposed Eastern Indonesia
Kabupaten Roads Project (negotiated in February 1993). Cumulative disbuIsements (to mid-
January 1993) under Loan 3133-IND are approximately 65%, but the undisbursed balance is
already comuitted or has been earmarked for specific works. Cumulative disbursements under
Loan 2881-IND are approximately 87% and again there are no remaining funds that could be
allocated for the reconstruction of earthquake damaged kabupaten roads. In the case of the
proposed Eastern Indonesia Kabupaten Roads Project, it was considered inappropriate to amend
the allocation of funds under this proposed Loan to fimance reconstruction works for earthquake-
affected kabupaten roads in Flores, particulady given the speciaimplementation and design and
supervision arrangements that will be needed for their satisfactory execution. The proposed loan
will be to provide the Government with US$42.1 million or about 28% of the estimated cost of
the Reconstruction Program covering the most urgent needs in four different sectors.
Project Description
20.         The proposed project will finance reconstruction activities over a three-year
period, including:
(a)   reconstruction investments (80% of base costs):
(i)   itional and kabupaten roads and bridges (31% of base costs);
(ii)  education and health facilities (39% of base costs); and
(iii)  other facilities (10% of base costs); and
(b)  technical assistance (209%o of base costs):
(i)   the provision of technical assistance in the management of the overall
reconstruction program, including design and supervision (15% of base
costs);
(ii)  the provision of technical assistance, training and equipmt in earth
sciences (geology and seismology); engineering (geo-technical, structural,



!Z5UMICAL Al*
Page 10 of 36
construction, etc.); and socio-economic aspects of earthquake engineering;
and geo-technical spatial plamiing for the locadon of human settlements
(5% of base costs).
Reconstruction investments
21.         The major objective of the project is to ensure that buildings and infastructure are
designed, located and built to withstand any seisnic events that may occur in the future in Flores.
The reconstruction component is designed to achieve this objective with special regard to roads,
bndges, schools and health facilities (all of which failed extensively during the earthquake) and to
the location of urban settlements (many of which were extensively damaged due to being sited on
soils subject to liquefaction).
Roads and Bridges (US$20.0 mitlion)
22.         Many national, provincial and kabupaten road links and bidges in the East Flores,
Sikka, Ende and Ngada disticts were badly damaged by the earthquake, by the consequent
landslides and, in the case of some coastal road sections, by the tidal waves (tsunani). The
resultant damage to roads includes fomaion and pavement failure, colapse of dramage and
taining wall structwms, and other failures occasioned by landsips above and below the road
alignment Damage to bridges ranges from approach and abutnent failures to total destruction.
23.          The terrain in the four earthquake-affected kabupatens is very mountainous, and
roads are mostly built in side-cut or along the tops of ridges. Slopes are generally steep and soil
conditions poor, with all dlasses of road being affected by larnslips and washouts during the west
monsoon rainy season. Traffic volumes on national and provincial as weJl as on kabupaten roads
are mostly very small, with the result that the economic retums from road improvements are
generally low. Emergency works have now reopened the more important of the earthqake-
damaged road link to the extent that passage by motorized vehicle is again possible, although in
many instances such passage is still difficult and also often unsafe due to the risk of further
landslips occuning.
24.         The Govemrment has requested both the Bank and the Asian Development Bank
(ADB) to support its planned road and bridge reconstruction program and, in particular, to assist
it to ensure that works are designed and implemented in accordance with standards appropiate
for the seismic conditions on the island  The Bank is curently supporting the betterment and
periodic maintenance of national and provincial roads in Flores under the Highway Sector Project
(Loan 3133-IND). Support for the kabupaten road programs in East Flores, Slkka, Ende, and
Ngada has previously been provided under the Second Rural Roads Project (Loan 2881-IND),
and will be continued under the proposed Eastem Indonesia Kabupaten Roads Project (negodated
in February 1993). ADB is also supporting the national and provincial road programs in Flores
under its Tenth and Eleventh Roads Projects, and its current involvement in the four earthquake-
affected kabupatens is more extensive than that of the Bank under Loan 3133-IND. ADB has
not, however, been involved in financing kabupaten road works on the island, and its proposed
Twelfth Roads Project, which is a kabupaten roads operation, will not cover NIT.



TECIZCAL AMX
Page 11 of 36
25.         To simPlify  mangement arrangements for the proposed road reconstruction
program, the Govenmment has therefore requested that (a) the Bank finance under the project the
reconstruction of (i) kabupaten roads; and (ii) national road liiks that are the subject of an
ongoing, committed or proposed contract under Loan 3133-IND; and that (b) ADB finance
reconstruction of other earthqake-affected national and provincial links.
26.         Cumulative disbursements (to end-February 1993) under Loan 3133-IND are
approximely 66%, but the undisbursed balance is already committed or has been eannarked for
specific works. Cumulative disbursemenes under Loan 2881-IND are approximately 87% and
there are no remaining funds that could be allocated for the reconstruction of earthquake damaged
kabupaten roads. The proposed Eastem Indonesia Kabupaten Roads Project (negotiated Loan
amount US$ 155 minlion) is focused primarily on improving the maintenance of kabupaten roads
in each of its 51 selected kabupatens, but would also support a smal (average +/- 20 km per
kabupaten per year) betterment program in each.I It is not considered appropriate to amend the
allocation of funds under this proposed Loan to finance reconstruction works for earthquake-
affected kabupaten roads in Flores, particularly given the specil iWplemention and design and
supervision arrangements that will be needed for their satisfactory execution.
27.         The proposed Bank loan would therefore finance part of: (a) the incrmental costs
of earthqake-related reconstruction and mitigaton works on those national roads that are
curenty being mataied or improved under Loan 3133-IND; and (b) the costs of earthquake-
related reconstruction and mitigation works on kabupaten roads. In additon to restoring roads to
their pre-earthquake conditon, the project would provide for appropiate mitigation measures-
such as stabilizaion of slopes through the reducton of cut angles and where, possible, the re-
establishmt of ground cover-so as to prevent or limit damage during possible futre
earthuakes. Subject to projected benefits justfyig the associated inrmenta costs, the project
would also fiance very limited betterment works on cetain kabupaten roads where such
bettment would be sensily grouped with reconstruction and mitigation works under a single
contract package. The technical standards and economic criteria adopted for the proposed
Easten Indonesia Kabupaten Roads Ptoject would be applied when considering to include an
elemem of bettent, and the design of the project provides for the integrated planming and
management of al Bank-financed kabupate road works vithin the four subject kabupatens.
28.         Two national road links are included in the proposed project, namely the Ende-
Paga link (Link N.006) of the Ende - Maumere road (iuding the urban section within the town
of Ende) and the Kewapante - Bts Plotim link ALnk N.017) of the Maumere -Larantuka road. A
contact for the betennent of the nura section of the Ende - Paga link was signed end-June 1992.
Periodic maintenance for one section of the Kewapante - Bts Flotin link was financed under Loan
3133-IND in 1990, and a contract for the periodic mntenance of another section on the link was
signed end-November 1992. The contractors for both ongomg packages have mobgized, but had
completed very litde site work prior to the earthquake.
1     The Bank is also supporting the iovement of kabupaten roads in certain provinces in
the western part of Indonesia under the Kabupaten Roads m project

29.         Much of the Ende - Paga link is in steep side-cut, and  the terrain and soil
conditions along much of its length are particularly difficult, with landslips occurring fiequently
during the west monsoon. Additional work over and above that already contracted will be needed
to establish improved alignments over short distances, to make good damaged retaining walls and
other structures and, where practicable and justified, to stabilize slopes. The length of the section
for which supplenentary works are required has been estimated initially at 31.5 kIn, and the
associated reconstruction and mitigation works cost at approximately US$ 3.1 mnllion. The
Kewapante - Bts Flotim link generally runs through less rugged coastal terrain, and the
earthquake damage is more localized albeit still severe. Additional work over and above the
planned periodic maintenance is needed to reconstruct the damaged sections, with special
attention being needed on stretches where sofls were apparently subject to liquefaction. The
length of the section for which supplementary works are required has been estimated initially at 24
km, and the associated reconstruction and mitigation works cost at US$2.3 million.
30.          itl estimates of the lengths of kabupaten roads and bridges requiring
reconstruction are as follows:
Kabupaten              Roads      Bridges
(kkm)        (m)
East Flores              44.1          --
Sikka                    24.4          12
Ende                     72.0         189
Ngada                    29.0          25
Total                   169.5         226
31.         A list of the individual road sections and bridges idendfied as requiring
reconstruction and replacement is presented in Attachment 4. The damage assessments are based
on priminay condition surveys conducted in Janmary 1993 by the central and regional public
works agencies. The preliminary base cost estimate for the idetified kabupaten road
mconstruction and mitigation and bridge repair and replacement works is US$ 10.7 million.
32.         The proposed loan amount for the project is based upon its encompassing
reconstruction and mitigation works on national and kabupaten roads and bridges totaling US$
3.8 milLion and US$ 10.7 milion respectively. The Govermnent will affange for detailed road and
bridge condition surveys and a careful review of the Ende - Paga betterment contract and the
Kewapante - Bts Flotim periodic maitance contract to be conducted so as to establish more
precisely the scope and nature of justifiable hicrmental works needed on the two identified
national link and of the reconstruction and mitigation works needed on the kabupaten road
networks. It was agreed at negotiations that (a) this work will be undertaken by consultants
saisfactory to the Bank and wil be completed by August 31, 1993; (b) the results wSi be subject
to (i) review by the Reconstruction Management Team Highway Consultants; and (ii) to approval
by the Bank. In the event that the estimated cost of the justified program of reconstruction and
mitgation works exceeds the cost estimate on which the proposed loan amount is based, the



TECWIC&L AN
Page 13 of 36
scope of the project will be amended to encompass only those highest priority works whose
cmnulative cost is within the above cost estimate, and Govenmment wil arrange additional
financing from other sources for other justified works.
33.         The design of road and bridge reconstruction works wil be preceded by a
geotechnical evaluation of their present alignment, and will incorporate economically appropriate
measures to reduce the risk of damage being caused by possible future earthquakes. Cracked and
broken sections of road fornmations and bridge approaches will be removed, and the sub-base and
base courses wil be rebuflt before replacing the surface application. For bridge approaches,
consideration wil be given to using structural slab where ground conditions are poor and, where
applicable, abutments will be designed to withstand soil liquefaction. Where economically
feasible, bridges will be rebuilt to applicable current standards for width and loading. Where
recessa, torary detours will be established to permit continued flow of traffic. All
demolition and construction works will be carried out with due regard to preservation of the
natural environment, with ontractors being required to adopt appropriate mitigation measures.
34.         The management arrangements for the project wil ensure that the program of
kabupaten road reconstruction and mitigation works is planned joindy with the programn of
maintnance and betterment works  to be financed under the proposed Eastem Indonesia
Kabupate Roads Project, and that appropriate and consistent design criteria, supervision
standards and envionmental protection and mitigation approaches are applied to works under
both projects.
Education Facilities (US$13.9 million)
35.         Tis project component, to be implemented by the Mistry of Publc Wors
(MPW) on behalf of the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC), wiUl provide for (a) the
reconstruction of 165 schools and tie repair of 178 schools in the kabupatens affected by the
earthqake; and (b) the provision of educational equipymt and furniture to replace that damaged
or destroyed during the earthquake. The details are presented in Attachment 5.
36.         The proposed reconstuction of totally damaged buildings wil generally be on
existing sites, if these sites are adequate (i.e., not prone to ground failure). The proposed
program of work is in two phases for both the reconstrction and repair of schools and education
facilities. The first phase is for the immediate construction of temporary facilities made of
inexpensive materials and the muior repairs required for some buildings to render them fit for
occupancy. The first phase is being financed by the Govemnment and is scheduled for completion
by end-March, 1993. It wil provide for limited educational facilities to ensure the provision of
basc education services wihin each community. Curentdy, both teachers and students are
disadvanaged as classrooms are being conducted in tents or outdoors. The second phase is
included in the project and will comprise the repair of major damage, the upgrading of tmporary
schools and the rconstruction of schools destroyed by the eathuake. Ihis will be miplemented
over a two year period from April 1, 1993, through Math 31, 1995, including facility planning,
preparaion of desigs, plans and tender documents.

Health Facilities (US10.4 million)
37.         This project component will provide for: (a) the reconstruction and repair of two
hospitals and 121 heath centers and health sub-centers located in the kabupatens affected by the
earthquake; and (b) the provision of medical and related equipment to replace that damaged or
destroyed during the earthquake. The details are presented in Attachment 5. The civil works
would be implemented by the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) on behalf of the Ministry of
Health (MOH) and the specialized medical and other equipment and fiuniture will be provided by
MOH.
38.         The capacity to provide health care to the community has been severely hmpered
by the disaster. Many patients are stil in tenporary shelters (tents) in the two hospitals damaged
by the earhquake and many of the health centers which were totally destroyed are operating
precariously under tents. Rehabiliton and reconstruction is therefore an urgent priority. The
proposed program of work is in two phases. The first phase is being financed by Govemment and
is for the imediat construction of temporary facilities made of inexpensive materials and the
mior repairs requred for some buildings to render them operational. The first phae is in
progress and is scheduled for completion by end-March, 1993. It provides for limied medical
faciies to ensure the pvision of basic health care wivtn each conmuity. The second phase
would be included in the project and would include the repair of major damage and reconstruction
of both hospitals and health care faclities. This will be implemented over a three year period fomn
April 1, 1993, tbrough March 31, 1996, including facility plamning, preparation of designs, plans
and tender documents.
39.         The proposed reconstruction of totally damaged health centers and hospital
buildings will generaly be on existing sites (if these sites are adequate), as mmy structures witdin
the facilities can be repaired. In the case of the General Hospital in Maumere, plas were being
considered prior to the eartuake to rebuild the hospital on a new site and upgade its status
from Class D to Class C. As a result of the extensive damage to this hospital, the MOH has
confirmed that reconstruction wil take place on the new site and the hospital status wil be
upgraded. The project would finance the constuction and equipment required for the new
hospital. The Government confimed at negotiations that (a) the proposed site for the new
hospial is adequate in terns of location, area and seismic risk; (b) land ownersip is vested with
the Disict Goenment and that the Decree dated January 18, 1993, from the Bupati constituted
the legal bais for the constuction of the new hospital; and (c) the upgrading from Class D to
Class C is justified.
Other Facilies (US$6.0 milion)
40.          Ths project component compnses (a) the relocation of part of the com lercia
center at Maumere and the fishing vilage of Wuring, and (b) the reconstruction of three volcano
observation staton and the construction of a natural hazards infonnaton center in Mumere. The
relocation sub-conponent is to be implemented by the Ministry of Public Works (MPV) on behalf
of the Pwvil and Kabupaten governments. The component inludes access roads and
footpaths, drainage and street lighting, retaining walls and simple harbor facilities as well as the
landscaping  and tree planig of waterfront areas and their tansformation into public parks.



TauCNZVAm
Page 15 of 36
Private shops, dwelligs and other pnvate facilities are not mcluded. The reconstuction
component is to be implemented by MPW on behalf of MME andw ill be closely integrated with
the technical assistance provided to MME under the project (see paragrh 46, below).
41.         In the case of Maumere, the waterfront zone is considered unsafe for hma
habitation and the buildmgs raning there will be demolished and relocated m sae areas. The
waterront zone winl be transormed into a public park area designated as a memorial to those
who died in the earthquake (see Attachment 6). In the case of the fishing vilage of Wurig, the
residents have already relocated to safer land and are rebuilding their dwelings from materials
salvaged from the vilage. The manfing buildings wil be demolished and salvage maerals
provided to the fishing community. The land will be cleared and remodeled to form a simple
harbor from where the fishing community can carry on its fishing activities. The site curendy
occupied by the fishig community winl be provided with access roads, footpaths and drainage
(and water supply and other facilities under the overall reconstrucim program). E 1virCnmental
assessment and, if necessary, resettlement plans satisfacotry to the Bank wil be prepared and
reviewed by the Bank prior to construction.
Technical Assistance (US$12.5 million)
42.         Technical assistance would be provided for project management as well as the
implementation of measures to mitigate earthquake damage in the future, includmg the provision
of training in earth sciences (geology and seismology), in engineerng (geo-technical, strucal,
construction, etc.) and in socio-economic aspects of eathquake engineering and the pement
of equipmnt for seismological studies. Draft terms of reference for the proposed consultancy
services have been reviewed at negotiations.
ProjectMawagemem
43.         Technical assistance would be provided to the MPW-based Reconstuction
Management Team and its Secriat as well as for planning, geo-teclnical studies .and
implementation quality review actvities to be overseen by BAPPENAS. The technical consulting
support of structral engieers, geo-tecbnical engmeers, and slope protection and fast-track
implementaion experts would be needed to assist in the preparation of detailed designs, conact
supervision, the provision of advice to project implemenation and supervion units, the
preparation of appropriate design standards and pracfices. and, where necessary, the  vson of
current building codes. Paricular atention will be paid to ensuring adequate construction qua
during impleme on by establishing quality assurance standards within designs and contracts
and by establishing quality control procedures during supervision of on-going civil woArs.
Technical assistance witl also be provided to meet the requiwreents for env eal assessment
and/or the preparation of plans for resetdement and indigenous people, if any.
44.         Both in the case of components financed under the project and in the case of those
financed under the overall reconstruction program, the experts engaged under the project would
ensure that the units pteparing the reconstruction designs would not merely repair and/or retro-fit
structures to their pre-earthquake strengdt and/or stiffness or rebuilding structres in the sane
place using the same materials, configuration, structural system, foundation, and tehiqes,



TZCR=CAL ANU
Page 16 of 36
without considering superior alternatives. The team of experts would therefore investigate the
affected areas and make recommendations regarding buildngs and structures that have to be
demolished or those that can be economically rehbilitated. For private buildings and facilities not
included in the reconstruction program, the team will advise the governmental units on the
development of regulations regardmg the number of stories, structural systems, and type of
foundations that should be used in the design and construction of new buildings. They wil also
fonmulate recommendations on how to upgrade existing structures that suffered damage, and pln
for drainage, water supply, and other facilities as well as rehabilitation of the road network.
45.         The advice and recommendations of the experts will be consolidated into a set of
General Reconstruction Guidelines (GRG) and area specific guidelines (e.g. for urban conditions,
nrual conditions, irrigation works, highways, social facilities, etc.) which would be incorporated
into civil works contracts and which would be used in on-the-job training of the labor force. Due
to the urgency of beginning reconstruction of the damaged area and the need to ensure that the
work is adequately coordinated, GOI confinned at negodations that the ORG wil be prepared by
July 31, 1993. Once these guidelines have been prepared, they will be promptly reviewed by a
technical panel of experts satisfactory to the Bank, and implemented by September 30, 1993.
Each govrm        imit would review its buildmg code in conjunction with the preparation of
ORG and make those revisions that are necessary to reflect local conditions.
Earth Sciences
46.         Project-supported training in earth sciences (geology and seismology) would be
provided in three fonns. The first would be a program of continiing professional trining to be
conducted in Indonesia by a team of experts in the fields of earth science and particularly in
earthquake engineering and seismology. The progran would be designed to upgrade the
egineering profession and to start the development of reliable "seisnmc zone maps." Structural
engmeers would help develop "niicro seismic zone maps" for key urban areas throughout
Indonesia to lower their vulnerabiy to possible future earthquakes and tidal waves. The second
type of training would consist of locally developed courses for structural engmeers, private
contractors and provincial and mmicipal engineers in order to increase their knowledge of geo-
technical engineering and to expose them to procedures that must be etnployed to reduce the
probability of future earthquake damage. The third type of traming would consist of locally
developed training courses for the technicians in charge of the construction in the field
(carpenters, iron workers, those in charge of preparing concrete mix, etc.). the provision of
technical assistance in geo-technic spadal planning measures to mitigate against the location of
human settlements in areas subject to ground failure, tidal waves, flooding and landslides in the
redevo,lopment of Flores and as a basis for the introduction of such measures in areas "at risk" in
Indonesia. Local capabilities in earthquake damage mitigation would be further buttessed by the
procurement, under the project, of seismic instruments expected to cost about US$0.5 million.
Spatial Planning
47.         The impact of the earthquake has rendered current spatial socio-economic
development proposals for the island obsolete. For example, the destruction of the coral in the
national park raises major concems about the potential development of tourism in and around



TECHNICAL ANNEX
Page 17 of 36
Maumere. The project would therefore provide technical assistance to assist BAPPENAS m the
fommilation of spat  socio-economic policy guidelines and in the monitonng and evaluation of
the ipact of the overall reconstruction program. The project would also provide technical
assistance to assist MPW in drawing up spatial socio-economic development proposals that take
account of the impact of the earthquake and the geo-technic and seismic studies to be undertaken
by the earth science center in the development and location of infrastmcture, human settlements,
agricultue, fishing and other economic activities (including tourism).
Project Cost and Financing
48.         Cost Estimates. The total project cost, including contingencies, is estimated at
Rpl30.0 bilion or US$62.9 milion equivalent, with a foreign excharge component of 35%.
Detailed project costs are presented in Attachment 1. Base costs, expressed in January 1993
prices, reflect rates for ongoing contracts for various types of works. Price contingencies,
equivalent to 9% of base costs plus physical contingencies, are based on local inflation rates of
5.5% for 1993-96, and foreign inflation rates of 3.1% for 1993-96. Physical contingencies,
totaling about 12% of base costs, were calculated on the basis of 10 % for equipment and 12 %
for civil works. The project cost includes taxes and duties of Rp 11.8 billion (US$5.7 million
equivalent)-

49.         Financing Plan. The proposed Bank loan of US$42.1 million would finance
about 67% of total project costs, representing 100% of estimated foreign exchange reuirements
and 49% of local financing. The mmaining costs would be covered by the Government, split
between MPW (32.6%), BAPPENAS (0.2%) and the Ministry of Mines and Energy, (MME),
(0.3%to) as shown in Table 1. During negotiations, it was agreed that adequate countexpart
financing wiUl be made available pronmpdy to participating agencies. While provision has been
made for Bank finmcing of technical assistance, training, equipment and studies, Govenment
intends to seek grants for these components with Bank assistance. Any loan funds so replaced
with grant financing would be utilized for other components of the project, as agreed between the
Government and the Bank.
Project Management
50.        The project would be mMaged as part of the overall Reconstruction Program, and
the managerial arrangements would be shared with other parts of the Program including those to
be financed by the ADB. It would be implemented over a three-year period and use GOI's
existing organizational framework in a manner consistent with its existing policies, procedures and
practices. Special measures would be lmited to those required for accelerated iplenon
and assurance of qualty. OveraU management arrangements would be reviewed with the Bank
by December 31, 1993, and a management plan, to take effect at the begining of the second
project year and providing for transition to post-reconstruction systems, would be agreed at that
tine.
51.        Management of the Bank-financed project as weU as the overall Reconstruction
Program would be controlled fily by the Central Government, in ful consultation with the
regional govermments. Under broad authority of the Ministers of EKUIN and BAPPENAS, the
Deputy Chainan V for Regional Development of BAPPENAS (Deputy V) would be responsible
for overall project management and serve as Chamnan of a Steering Committee comprising the
other concerned Deputy Chairmen of BAPPENAS (Deputies I and II, the Director General for
Budgetary Affairs of the Ministry of Finance, and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Public
Works (SEKJEN MPW). Th Steering Committee would be supported by a Reconstrction
Management Team (RMT) reporting to the SERJEN MPW. The RMT would be located in
Flores, with a smaill Secretariat in Jakarta, and it would be responsible for operational project
planming, administration and supervision. The RMT would be responsible for the coordinaton
and management of project implementation, which would be carried out by Project
Implementation Units (PIUs). in  -ditioi.,  program for  lemention quality assurance,
geotechnical studies and post-recotruction planning would be established under Deputy V,
BAPPENAS.
52.         The Flores-based RMT and its Jakarta-based Secretariat would support the
SEKJEN MPW and Deputy V BAPPENAS in carrying out all aspects of project planning,
administration and supervision The RMT would be headed by the RMT Manager, a senior 001
official who would be seconded to the project for its duration. The RMT Mmnager and
Secretaiat would report for operational purposes to the SEKJEN MPW. The RMT would
include sectoral units for roads and other ifracture (schools, health faciits and other
facilities) to be financed under the project (as well as units for irrig4duon and other infrstucture



TZCWCAL ANC

not financed under the project) and supported with a smaUl advisory team including expatriate
design and construction engineers. The RMT would be based in Fores, where office
accommodations and support services would be provided by MPW in the four project kabupatens.
Technical assistance supporting the RMT would include expatiate design and construction
enginers. The Secretariat in Jakarta would be supported by an expatriate implementation advisor
and a smll adminisative team to assist with such matters as consolidation of financial statements
and coordination of related foreign assistance. Together, the RMT and Secretariat would assist
through: (a) provision of technical advice to the PIUs and concemed directorates general, in
particular with regard to geo-technical considerations (see para. 44); (b) environmental impact
assessments and plamning for resettlement or indigenous people (see para. 66); (c) review of
design and construction quhty (see para. 43); (d) preparation of quarterly and anual reports on
physical progress in collaboration with the PIUs for review by the Steering Commntuee and the
Bank (see pam. 67); and (e) preparation of project accounts (see para. 64). Costs of technical
assistance for the RMT and Secrtariat would be shared under the Bank and ADB loans.
53.         The Flores-based PIUs would be responsible for actual implemenion of works,
but would be assisted by staff and consultants of the RMT and Secretariat. In staffing the PIUs,
the agencies may also augment govenmment staff with their own consultants to assist m carrying
out detailed desigs, procurement, contating, and the supervision nf construction. The PIUs
will be rsponsble for (a) carrying out any specdal activities that might be rquired under GOI
policies and Bank guidelines such as ennenal assessment and planning for resettlement and
indigenous peoples; (b) design of cmi works; (c) preparation of tender documents; (d) land
acquisition where necessary; (e) nmainternance of accounts; (f) preparation of loan withdrawal
applications for submission to the Bank through the RMT and Secretaiat; (h) scheduling of
works and supervision of contmt magers (PIMPROs); and (i) coordination with local
goverment staff.. Separate from the PIUs, teams of supervision engines would be contracted
by the RMT to supervise and cert  the qualty of design and construction.
54.         The BAPPENAS-based  implementation quality, geotechnic studies and post-
reconstuction planng program would be managed by Deputy V and his staff This program
would include: (a) support for a small team to monitor and evaluate the overall Reconstruction
Program; (b) support for collaboration with the Institute of Technology at Bandung and the
Minitry of Minig and Energy to cany out geotechnic studies in Mlores and, more generally, to
stngthen geotechnic sciences in Indonesia required for more effective earthquake plamni, and
(c) support for a small team that would collaborate with the provincial and local governments in
ading the present regional development plans for Flores in terms of lessons learned as a result
of the 1992 earthquake.
55.         Temis of refne for the RMT, Secretariat and BAPPENAS-based assistance
programs were agreed at negotiations. It was also agreed at negotiations that Goverunent wi
aign and maintain a sufficient nmnber of qualified staff at the RMT, Secrtaia and each of the
PIUs, indluding project managers satisfactory to the Bari to ensure that the project is
implemented as planned. The project imple o schedule is shown in Attchment 2 and the
project manament arrangements are shown in Attachment 7. The above project management
arrangements were confirmed at negotiaions.

Procurement
56.         Initial Emergency Procurement. Due to the emergency nature of the project, up
to 26% of total expenditures will cover commitments for the early rehabilitation work necessary
to restore basic services in the areas affected. The following procedures are being used for these
initi com itnts: (a) addenda to existing ICB contracts for incremental works estimated to
cost US$4.0 nillion and urgently needed works on national road links (see paragraph 32.); (b)
force account and direct contracting for civil works contracts for schools and health facilities,
each contract valued at less than US$200,000 up to an aggregate amount of US$10.0 million;
and (c) sole source contracting up to a total of about US$2.0 million for consultants. Most of
these items would be financed retroactively.
57.         Civil Works. Large civil works contracts, valued at US$1.0 million or more,
including the reconstruction of Maumere hospital, will be procured using intemational
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures which represent about 8% of total project expenditures. In
bid comparison, local contractors will be allowed to 7.5% domestic preference. Most other cvil
works are expected to be too widely dispersed and too small to attract the attention of foreign
bidders. Therefore, about 46% of the total expendiures will be procured through local
compettive biddig procedures (LCB) satisfactory by the Bank. LCB contracts would be valued
at less than US$1.0 million each would amount to US$29.1 million.
58.         Equipment and Furniture. It is not practicable to packge equipme  and
school funiture in lots likely to attract foreign bidders; also, it is available locally at competitive
prices. Individual contracts for equipment and furmiture wil be procured through LCB following
procedures acceptable to the Bank. Furniture and equipment, in packages not exceeding
US$50,000, up to an accumulated total of US$0.7 million (of which the Bank will finance US$0.6
rillion) wil be procured through shopping with three quotations from eligile bidders. Higldy
specialized seismic equipment, which is avaflable from a very limited number of suppliers, will be
procured through intemational shopping procedures on the basis of tbree price quotations from
eligble bidders from three countries. Contracts for proprietary items of equipment may be
awarded after direct negotiations.
59.         Technical Assistance, Training and Studies.  Project tchnical assistnme,
training and studies comprising 19% of total expenditures wil be engaged or canried out under
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank and following the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. Subject to the agreement of the Bank in each case, sole source procedures wil be
pennitted for the selecdon of consultants to establish the RMT and engpieg firms to perform
the critical engierg and design work needed prior to highway reconstruction, provided the
qualifications of the fims selected and their proposed rates are acceptable to the Bank.
60.         Review of Procurement Documents and Decisions.  Project civl works
contracts and procurement of equipment and fiunitre with an estimated value of US$200,000 or
more and consultant contracts (except for individual consultants) costing US$100,000 or more
respectively, will be subject to prior Bank review. Other contracts below this threshold will be

TECHICAL ANNEc
Page 22 of 36
(c) Technical Assistance, Training and Studies:
100% of total expenditures (net of tax).
62.         Disbursement under the project will be made on the basis of Statements of
Expenditre (SOEs) except for the following items, for which disbursements would be made
against full docmntation: (i) civil works above US$200,000; (ii) equipment and furniture above
US$200,000; and (iii) technical assistance above US$100,000. SOE records would be available to
Bank staff as required for inspcion during supervision. In order to facilitate disbursnents, a
special account shall be established by DG Budget in Bank Indonesia or a state commercial bank
acceptable to the Bank to enable payment authorization from the account to be made in Jakarta
and Flores. The account would be mainined in US dollars with an inial deposit of US$6.0
million, equal to about four months of expenditures.
63.         The Bank loan of US$42.1 million would be disbursed over three and a half years,
dosing on December 31, 1996. No appropriate Bank profile exists for this kind of multi-sectoral
reconstruction loan. Expenditures made after December 19, 1992, the date of the Bank's first
damage assessment mission, up to a ceiling of US$7.0 million would be eligible for emroactive
fnacig for the removal of debrs, opemng of roads, providig temporary hospitals and medial
facilities. The Disbursement Schedule is presented in Attachment 3. Receipt by the Bank of a
satsfactoy relocation plan for the relocation and reconstruction of the coimmcia center of the
town of Maunere and the fishing vilage of Wuring is a condition of disbursem  for that
component
Accounts and Auditing
64.         The RMT would maintain separate records and accounts of all transactions under
the loan in accordance with sound accountng practices. Ihe RMT would consolidate the PlUs
financid statmes  and prepare consolidated project accounts which would be smmarired on an
ongoing basis to show:
(a)  actud versus planned expendtures for each quarter, itemized by project
component and by project Kabupaten
(b)  actual versus planed expendtures to date, itemized by project component and by
project Kabpat; and
(c) financing of the expendiures by the Bank and the Govermnent.

Page 23 of 36
65.         Unaudited consolidated project accounts would be submitted by the RMT on a
quarterly basis to reach the Bank withn 45 days after the end of the quarter. The audited project
accounts, including the SOEs and Special Account, accompanied by the auditor's report, opinion,
and comnwnts on the project accounts, SOEs and Special Account would be forwarded to the
Bank within nine months after the end of each fiscal year. These accounts, including the Special
Account and SOEs, will be audited annually by indWependent auditors acceptable to the Bank and
will include opinions on all expenditurs including those made against SOEs. In the case of SOEs,
the audit report should contain a separate opinion by said auditors as to whether the snatenm    of
expenditure submitted during such fiscal year, together with the procedures and intern  controls
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals.
Environmental and Social Impact
66.         The project will have a positive impact on the environm    Stabizaion,
contourg and, where possible, reforestation of slopes on major roads wil help prevent soil
erosion and landsLides in these ecologically delicate mountainous zones and thus a repetition of
the extent of damage that resulted from the December earthquake. Earthquake damage miigation
measures caried out under the project should aid goverment in gradually improving construction
design standards and inspection procedures, reducing damage from future earthquakes in both
urban and rural evints. Reconstuction of schools and heath facilities destroyed by the
earthquake wil have a strong positive social impact, with relocation restricted to cases where
present sites are unstable and dangerous, e.g., those where liquefaction occurred. Improved
environmenal designs will also be incorporated in the General Reconstruction Guideines beig
prepared by the participating agencies and regional govemments with spealizd advice. All sub-
projects wil be subject to GOrs environnt assess me  procedures, AMDAL, which require
the preparation of   me ntl assessments, mitigation plans and monitoing plans where there
are fisks of negative impacts. These assessments will be reviewed by the establshed provinc
and/or central AMDAL Commissions and the Bank. Consultation with the affected people and
local NGOs will be part of the enviromnil review process. In addition, any sub-projects
requiring involuntary resettlement or involving indigenous people will be subject to special rview
by the Bank, prior to iplemention, to ensure that en ental standards acceptable to the
Bank have been applied. Technical assistance will be provided through the RMT to exedite and
enhance the quality of AMDAL procedures and to take measures to migate the adverse impact
of project activities on indigenous or displaced people. TIhse arrangements were confimned at
negotiations.
Reporting and Monitoring
67.         The RMT would prepare quarterly reports on the project based on the reports of
each agency, showing the physical progress against the plan for each component, with an
explanation of any significant delay from the plan and oudining what remedia actions are being
taken. The reports should be submitted to the Bank concurrent with the unaudited quartedy
project accounts discussed above. In addition, the quarterly and annual reports will be submitted
to the Secretriat and to the Steering Committee. A project completion report will be prepared
within six months of the closing date of the loan.
