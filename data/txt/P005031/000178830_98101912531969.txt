I. INTRODUCTION
A.   Background
1.01      The Gcvernment of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Egyptian Iron
and Steel Companty (HADISOLB), a public sector enterprise, have requested Bank
financing of US$;64 million equivalent to assist in implementing HADISOLB-s urgently
necded `eg2 I rehabi' tation and debottlenecking program (Stage I) at its Helwan
plant (IBRD Map No. 15272). The proposed Bank project (the Project) would be a
major component of Stage I. The second component will be implemented with financial
assistance from Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the Federal Republic of
Germany (FRG) arLd a third component with equipment supplied by the USSR. Stage I
is designed to take advantage of a substantial sunk investment which is only
producing at about 50% of design capacity at present. It will rehabilitate the
old facilities and introduce better operating practices thereby increasing HADISOLB's
efficiency, particularly in terms of energy conservation, and its achievable
output to about 75% of capacity by 1987. A subsequent Stage II program, which is
expected to be fully defined by early 1983 within the context of the proposed
Project, would raise the achievable output to the full design capacity. In 1980,
Egypt imported about one million tons of finished steel products at a cost of
about US$385 million. The expected increase in HADISOLB's output as a result of
Stage I will help reduce the import needs of the country as well as make the
Company profital:Je thereby eliminating the Government subsidies to one of its
largest public sector manufacturing enterprise.
1.02      The Project will involve financing of equipment, civil works and technical
assistance and provide the first significant step towards strengthening the organi-
zation and operations of HADISOLB which are presently weak. The Project's success
will critically depend on meaningful progress in this area. A key aspect of the
Project is the granting of sufficient autonomy to the Company regarding pricing,
investments, procurement, personnel policies and remuneration levels adequate to
attract and retain qualified employees as well as motivate them to perform well.
1.03      The Project is expected to cost about US$106 million equivalent including
about US$76 million in foreign exchange. It will be financed with about 39% equity
(US$42 million) from the Government and about 61% from the proposed Bank loan
(US$64 million),,
1.04      Following preparatory missions in July 1979, October 1979 and April 1980,
the Project was appraised in September 1980 and reviewed in December 1980 by
a mission consisting of Messrs. D. Carpio (Chief), W. O'Neil and W. Bertelsmeier
of the Industrial Projects Department and Mr. F. Kaps of the Country Programs
Department I, EMIENA Region.
B.   Bank Group Involvement in the Egyptian Steel Industry
1.05      Bank Group involvement in the Egyptian steel industry started with a
metallurgical sector study undertaken as one of six industrial sub-sector reviews
financed under the Bank Group's Agricultural and Industrial Imports Project of
December 1974 (cr. No. 524-EGT and Ln. No. 1062-EGT). The study was carried out
by Atkins Planning (UK) during 1976-77 and identified, among others, a high
priority rehabilitation/debottlenecking requirement for HADISOLB.  On the basis
1J Annex I contains a glossary of technical terms used in this report.

of this study and subsequent discussions among the Government, HADISOLB, the
Executive Organization for Industrial and Mining Complexes (IMC) 1/ and ourselves,
the Bank approved a US$2.5 million engineering loan in July 1977 (Iron Ore Benefi-
cation and Engineering Project - Loan No. S5-EGT) to finance the foreign costs for
three consultancy tasks; namely: (i) a techno-economic evaluation of beneficiating
the local iron ore used by HADISOLB which is very difficult to utilize due to its
poor quality; (ii) design and engineering, including the preparation of tender
documents, for an iron ore beneficiation project should the techno-economic
evaluation identify an economically viable process; and (iii) a diagnostic study
of the technical, operating, managerial and organizational as well as marketing
problems of HADISOLB with recommendations for practical approaches towards solving
these problems. The first and third tasks were undertaken by the US Steel Engineers
and Consultants (UEC) and completed at the end of 1979. The recommendations
contained in UEC's diagnostic study formed the basis for HADISOLB-s Stage I
Rehabilitation Program and the proposed Bank Project. Likewise, on the basis of
UEC's iron ore beneficiation study, HADISOLB intends to build a semi-industrial
pilot plant for washing the ore in order to develop the necessary technical and
operating data for a rigorous techno-economic evaluation.
1.06    HADISOLB, the three other small semi-integrated  public sector steel
companies, (para 2.06), and the El Nasr Coke Company were also beneficiaries under
the Bank's Second Industrial Import Loan of July 1977 (Ln. No. 1456-EGT) receiving
financing for the import of equipment (US$10 million) and raw materials (US$18
million). Finally, the Bank and IFC are considering participation in a major
(US$800 million) joint venture integrated steel project (El Dikheila) between the
Egyptian Government and a consortium of Japanese steel and trading companies.
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND THE STEEL INDUSTRY
A. The Industrial Sector
2.01   Industry 2/ has become a significant sector of the Egyptian economy with
its share in GDP rising from 8% in 1946 to 13.5% in 1979. In that year industry
employed about 1.3 million persons, or nearly 12.4% of the civilian labor force
while industrial exports, valued at about LE 500 million (12.7% of the gross value
of industrial output) provided about 18% of commodity exports. The industrial
structure is weighted heavily in favor of industries producing consumer goods
which account for about 58% of industrial gross value added; intermediate products
(building materials, fertilizers, chemicals, and metals) account for about 34%;
and capital goods, for only 8%.
2.02 As a result of the nationalizations of the early 1960s, the public sector,
comprising some 200 enterprises, accounts for almost all large and medium scale
industrial enterprises. It generates some two-thirds of the value added in
industry and mining and provides slightly more than half of total industrial
employment, mainly in four subsectors: textiles, food products, metal and engi-
neering, and chemicals. Egypt-s basic industries are all in the public sector and
1/ IMC, a public sector agency within the Ministry of Industry, was responsible
for supervising the installation of HADISOLB's newer production facilities,
including the iron ore mining facilities at Bahariya (para 4.03).
2/ Manufacturing and mining excluding petroleum.



-3-
include iron and steel, aluminum and fertilizer. The private sector accounts for
about one-third of total value-added in industry and about half the sector-s
labor force. Textiles, food products, leather, woodworking and furniture, and
engineering are the important industries of private activity.
2.03    The industrial sector was characterized in 1973-74 by significant idle
productive capacities but rapialy improved during L975-77 iollowing the
announcement in 1973 of the "open door" policy which resulted in the relaxation
of controls and greater availability of foreign exchange. This period was
followed by a temporary slowdown in the growth of industrial output in 1978
(5.7%), but a subsequent recovery in 1979 (11.5%) pointing to the increasing
impact on producition of the investment efforts during the last few years.
2.04      Egyptian industry has significant long-term prospects to grow and broaden
its base deriving primarily from the large and growing domestic market, adequate
local energy resources and a strategic market location vis-a-vis the Middle East
and Europe. An industrial structure and tradition already exist, as well as a
large and relatively low-cost labor force.   Since development of agriculture is
proceeding slowly and the service sector (mainly Government) is overstaffed, it is
to industry that the Government looks to provide stimulus to growth as well as to
absorb the growing labor force through continued expansion, efficient import
substitution emphasizing intermediate and capital goods, and expanded exports. For
example, the sub-sector studies (para 1.05) point to the need to develop exports
and the capital goods and construction industries on a priority basis.  The latter
two subsectors will directly benefit from the Project, since they use HADISOLB's
products as a major input.
2.05      The Bank½s recent loans to industry include:  (i) program loans to
alleviate foreign exchange constraints and thereby improve capacity utilization;
(ii) assistance to individual, large, high priority projects; (iii) attempts to
address the principal issues affecting the productivity of major subsectors; and
(iv) assistance no financial intermediaries to enable them to provide financial
and technical asistance to private sector firms, including small scale industrial
enterprises. The implementation experience of the Bank-s large industrial
projects in Egypti during the 1970's has been poor in terms of long construction
delays and substantial cost overruns, primarily due to four factors:
(i) the severe constraint in the capacity of the local civil works contracting
industry, includ.ng a chronic shortage of cement, rebars and other construction
materials due to foreign exchange constraints which limited imports; (ii) delays
in the release of local currency funds from the Government due to its difficult
fiscal condition:; (iii) a cumbersome procurement procedure (including boycott
provisions) which prolonged the process of bid preparation, evaluation and
award; and (iv) some delays in filling the foreign exchange financing gap
created by the suspension of disbursement by Arab co-financing sources following
the Camp David Agreement in 1978. The more recent Bank industrial projects now
require international tendering of civil works contracts, where this is a major
item, and also place emphasis on the establishment of strong project implementa-
tion units as well as more efficient procurement arrangements to overcome some
of the problems experienced in the past. The recent improvements in the fiscal
situation of the Government as well as in the balance of payments position are
also expected to ease some of the constraints on project implementation.

B. Development of the Steel Industry in Egypt
2.06     Steel-making, as a modern industry in Egypt, began with the establishment
of the Delta Steel Company in 1947 and the National Metal Company in 1948, both
near Cairo, and the Egyptian Copperworks in Alexandria, in 1952. These three
facilities use steel scrap as raw material utilizing mostly the open-hearth
furnace (OHF) and to a lesser extent the electric-arc furnace (EAF) steel-making
technologies and producing mostly concrete reinforcing bars (rebars) as well as
some other non-flat products. Their combined production in 1980 was about 0.3
million tons per year (tpy) of finished products. HADISOLB, in Helwan near Cairo,
is the only integrated steel complex in the country; it started operation in
1958 and had an initial capacity of about 0.3 million tpy of flat and non-flat
steel products based on iron ore mined locally near Aswan. With the assistance
of the USSR, HADISOLB in the mid-1960's began an expansion which increased production
capacity to about 1.3 million tpy of finished products. There are also four small
public sector foundries and forges 1/ making castings and forgings with a capacity
of about 0.1 million tpy of products. The present installed steel-making capacity
in Egypt is about 1.7 million tpy of finished products 2/, but production has been
constrained to about 55% of capacity due to the operating problems at HADISOLB.
2.07    The Egyptian steel industry accounted for about 2% of GDP in 1979 and
employed about 45,000 employees (3% of the industrial labor force); about 55%
of these are in HADISOLB.
C. Structure and Organization of the Egyptian Steel Industry
2.08    Except for the few very small foundries still operated by the private
sector, the steel industry was nationalized in the early 1960's. The organization
of the public sector steel industry is shown on the following page and briefly
described below. With the Government as majority shareholder, the Ministry of
Industry has prime responsibility for the industrial public sector enterprises.
In this context, the General Shareholder's Assembly 3/ of each company is chaired
by the Minister of Industry (or his representative) and the company chairmen
report directly to the Minister. Also directly under the Minister of Industry
are the General Organization for Industrialization (GOFI), which is responsible
for investment planning and procurement, and the Executive Organization for
the Implementation of Industrial and Mining Complexes (IMC) which is responsible
for the actual implementation of some large scale industrial and mining projects
under the Ministry of Industry. Finally, there is the High Council for the

2.09    The operation of individual public sector enterprises is the responsibi-
lity of an operating Board of Directors and the enterprise management within the
framework of existing policies and legislation. The chairman of the board is also
the company president; he and the top management members of the board are appointed
by the Minister. The labor representatives on the board are elected by the
employees. The degree of enterprise autonomy (para 2.11) is heavily regulated by
law and/or by ministerial policy which has effectively caused these enterprises to
operate like civil service agencies under a complex and restrictive system of
administrative rules and regulations.
D. Issues and Problems of the Steel Industry
2.10    The Egyptian steel industry faces a number of serious problems which
affect its present performance and future development prospects. The key problem
areas relate to the: (i) institutional and policy framework for the public sector
enterprises; (ii) obsolete state of equipment and technology of existing steel
mills and the need for upgrading the skills of management and workers; and (iii)
poor financial situation of the steel companies.
2.11   Institutional and Policy Framework:  Under existing legislation and policies,
public sector enterprises are under a severe disadvantage relative to private
sector and joint venture companies due to restrictions on salary structure, number
of job grades, procurement, pricing, marketing, investments and retention of
profits. Thus, these enterprises are finding it increasingly difficult to attract
and retain qualified personnel as well as motivate employees to perform effectively,
while being at the same time heavily overstaffed in the administrative and un-
skilled labor groups because of the past Government practice of imposing employment
quotas. This has led to a gradual weakening in the management and organization
of most public sector enterprises, particularly those that have obsolete/inappro-
priate facilities, or serious technical problems, or very low labor productivity.
Many of these enterprises are not profitable and not in a position to offer
meaningful production bonuses to reduce the large gap in total compensation
between private sector and public sector pay levels.
2.12      The Government is now seriously considering specific legislative pro-
posals to radically reform and liberalize the policies and regulations governing
the public sector enterprises, and thus lay the base for higher efficiency in the
sector. In the meantime, several ad-hoc liberalization measures have been gradually
introduced during the past three years: no employment quotas, an increase from
LE 0.5 million to LE 0.75 million in procurement contracts not requiring GOFI
involvement, free dealings in foreign exchange including retention of all or part
of foreign exchange export earnings, direct imports of capital goods, elimination
of the ceiling on bonus and incentive systems, unlimited participation of foreign
contractors in civil works, and selective increases in some industrial product
prices (e.g. steel, textiles) which are about 80% to 105% of international levels.
Also, as a result of the substantial improvement in the country's balance of
payments as well as the Government's fiscal condition, the central Government
now has sufficient resources to invest in the rehabilitation/modernization of
public sector enterprises.
2.13      Obsolete or Inappropriate Equipment/Technology and Need for Training
The production facilities of the four public sector steel companies suffer from
a variety of technical problems. In general, there is a combination of obsolete



or inappropriate t:echnology, old equipment, capacity imbalances and inefficient
work-flow patterns. The technical problems are exacerbated by poor to mediocre
operating practices and a shortage of highly skilled and qualified operators,
further undermined by the financial attractiveness of working in nearby oil
exporting countries. Consequently, production performance is poor -- in terms of
low capacity utilization relative to design capacity, low yield levels, and high
consumption rates of inputs, especially energy. The technical problems of the
steel companies can only be overcome through well-conceived rehabilitation programs
which are complemented by training of the labor force in new technologies as well
as improvements in operating procedures and upgrading of management skills and
systems.   GOFI is expected to initiate a feasibility study for a modernization/
rehabilitation project for the three smaller public sector steel companies in the
next few months. This effort, together with the implementation of HADISOLB's
Stage I Program, and the proposed El Dikheila project, as well as the preparation
of the Stage II Rehabilitation Program of HADISOLB, would cover the modernization/-
expansion needs of the steel sector until the late 1980s.
2.14       Financial Situation:  The profitability of the public sector enterprises,
including the steel companies, is not satisfactory due to various technical and
operating problems and general inefficiencies, as well as the substantial finan-
cial burden imposed by the past Government policy of: (i) fixing input and output
prices at relative levels that do not provide adequate profits; and (ii) causing
substantial overemployment.  The industry has suffered from a severe lack of
financial resources needed for adequate maintenance, rehabilitation/modernization,
and working capital. The combined financial statements of the four public sector
steel companies are sunmmarized below.

2.15     The financial results are heavily influenced by HADISOLB's operations.
For example, HADISOLB's revenues account for about 46% and 40% of the combined
revenues of the four public sector steel companies for 1978 and 1979 respectively.

offset the profit of the three smaller steel companies of about LE 2 million in
1978 and accounted for 86% of the combined losses for 1979 respectively. The
liquidity (current ratio) of the steel companies continues to be unsatisfactory.
The capital structure (debt/equity ratio) however, has remained sound in spite
of cumulative losses because of the substantial additional equity capital that
the Government has provided, primarily to HADISOLB, to cover both investments
and increases in working capital requirements. The Government, as part of the
proposed legislation to liberalize the public sector enterprises (para 2.12), is
also reviewing the financial aspects of their operations, especially the pricing
of their outputs with the view to providing reasonable profits under conditions
of efficient operations.
2.16    The major problems facing the Egyptian steel industry can be overcome
with a strong commitment on the part of the Government especially for reforms
in the way the public sector enterprises are managed and regulated. But these
problems should not detract from the inherent comparative advantage in steel-
making that Egypt possesses and ought to exploit. The country has a relat-
ively substantial and growing market for steel which could take advantage of
economies of scale in production, a fairly well developed infrastructure, an
industrial tradition including steel-making, its own hydrocarbon energy resources,
some iron ore deposits (para 4.03), and a relatively cheap and readily trainable
labor force. In addition, Egypt is at a stage of industrialization where
important linkages between the steel sub-sector and the capital goods/consumer
durables sub-sectors as well as the construction industry should be established
as a means of broadening the industrial base and of employment creation. Thus,
the efficient modernization of its steel industry should be among the high
priority programs of the Government, specially since there is already a large
sunk investment in the steel industry that is not fully productive at present
but whose output can be increased substantially at a much lower investment cost
per ton of incremental output compared to new (green-field) plants.
III.  MARKET AND PRICE TRENDS FOR STEEL PRODUCTS
A. The International Steel Industry and Market
1. Historical World Steel Consumption and Production Trends
3.01     During the early 1970's, the world steel industry had an optimistic
demand outlook for the decade and substantial capacity 1/ additions were plan-
ned and implemented.   However, the recession of 1975 cut consumption by about
20% in the industrial countries and 10% worldwide from their respective pre-
vious peaks in 1973 and 1974 respectively. The subsequent recovery of demand
1/ Capacity is generally measured in terms of crude steel equivalent. There are
two generally accepted definitions of capacity: "gross" or "normal" capacity,
which is about equivalent to the engineering design capacity and alternatively,
"effective" or "sustainable" capacity which can be achieved for sustained periods
under normal working conditions. In this report, the second (i.e., "effective")
definition is used. Effective capacity in the US and Japan is roughly 95% of
the gross capacity; in the EC it is about 87% of the gross capacity.



- 9 -
was slower than expected, while firmly committed investments could not be delayed
or cancelled. Thus, capacity increased faster than demand and capacity utiliza-
tion rates in the industrial countries dropped drastically to between 75% and 82%
during 1975-78, although the rates remained close to their practical achievable
levels in most developing countries. With the low capacity utilization rates in
the major historical steel producing areas, i.e. US, Japan and the European Com-
munity (EC) -- which together account for about 53% of total world steel capacity
and about 41% of world consumption, steel prices became severely depressed due to
heightened ccrmpetition and the steel industry in the market economies was plunged
into disarray. The deteriorating situation of the industry in the developed
market economies finally led to strong government intervention in the major steel
producing and. consuming areas such as the US, Japan and the EC. As a result, some
degree of ordler began to evolve after mid-1978.   Historical (1970-80) world steel
consumption, production and capacity data by group of countries are shown in
Annexes 3-1 aLnd 3-2 and are summarized below:

b/ Production as % of consumption.
3.02    While steel consumption declined in the industrial countries between
1973 and 1979, it grew steadily in the developing countries, by about 7.5% per
year, and in the centrally planned economies (CPE) by close to 4% annually
during the same period. The developing countries as a group import (net) roughly
one-third of their steel consumption, although individually their degree of
self-sufficiency varies considerably. Between 1970 and 1979, self-sufficiency
declined fronm 20% to 16% respectively for North Africa and the Middle East
region but increased for the Asia and the Pacific region from 54% to 72% and



- 10 -
for Latin America and the Caribbean region, from 72% to 82%. During the same
period the net imports of the developing countries increased from 21 to 37 million
tons and those of the CPE's from practically nothing to about 12 million tons.
These increases in net imports were supplied primarily by Japan and the EC. Thus,
even though steel-making capacity in the developing countries as a group increased
by about 98% from 46 to 91 million tpy during 1970-80, the group-s self-sufficiency
improved only slightly from 64% to 68% as demand during 1970-80 grew from 59
million tons in 1970 to an estimated 125 million tons in 1980 or by 212% (para
3.05).
2. Future World Steel Demand and Supply Trends
3.03   Forecasts of steel demand are generally based on assumed growth rates
of GDP. Before the 1975 recession, the relationship between growth in steel
consumption and growth in GDP in the industrial countries had been stable 1/.
However the extremely slow recovery in steel consumption after 1975, even when
GDP growth had recovered somewhat, led to an evolving consensus in the industry
that the basic relationship had changed during the mid-1970's. Three factors are
thought to have caused this change: (i) about 30% to 40% of the steel deliveries
in industrial countries are consumed in sectors involving fixed capital formation;
thus, as the growth in fixed capital formation continued to remain low relative to
other sectors in the economy the growth in steel demand was also adversely affected;
(ii) there has been a gradual decline in the usage of steel per unit of final pro-
duct as substitution by other materials such as aluminum and plastics intensified
after the energy crisis of 1973/74, as energy conservation pressure led to smaller/
lighter product designs (e.g. automobile) and as the quality of steel improved,
thereby requiring less steel; and (iii) the increasing use of continuous casting
technology (Annex 3-3) which, in addition to being less energy intensive, provides
higher steel yields than traditional production methods. In other words, a larger
quantity of finished product is produced from each ton of crude steel when continuous
casting is used. Consequently, demand in terms of crude steel equivalent, which
is the generally accepted statistic for measuring steel demand and production,
declined.
3.04      Forecasts of steel demand and production capacity for various regions
have been prepared for 1985. 2/ The forecasts assume that GDP growth rates in
the industrial countries would be depressed at an average of only 2.8% per
year during 1979-85 as a consequence of recent recessionary trends. In addi-
ition, the continuing impact of the three factors mentioned in para 3.03 above
is expected to further lower the GDP/steel consumption growth ratio for the
industrial countries to about 0.68 during 1979-85, compared to the historical
value of about 0.87 during 1960-74 and about 0.7 during 1974-79. On this
basis, steel demand in the industrial countries is expected to grow at an

2/  The forecasts are based on a world steel market study (The International
Steel Market and the Outlook for Light Non-Flat Products, April 6, 1981)
undertaken jointly by the Bank's Industrial Projects Department, the Economic
Analysis and Projections Department and a specialized steel market consulting
firm.



- 11 -
average rate of only about 1.9% per year between 1979 and 1985 1/ and reach 390
million tons in 1985. It should be remembered that steel consumption in the
industrial countries increased at an average annual rate of 5.3% during the
1960's, and while it did not show any consistent growth pattern in the 1970's,
the projected 1985 demand is still 3% lower than the peak recorded in 1973.
This is a conservative forecast of steel consumption by 1985 assuming continued
sluggish growth in the economies of the industrial countries.
3.05    The sluggish economic performance in the industrial countries expected
during 1980-85 will also dampen the economic growth of developing countries.
Thus, steel demand in the developing countries is projected to grow by only
about 5.6% per year 2/ during 1979-85 and reach about 165 million tons in 1985.
Steel demand in the CPE's is assumed to grow by about 2.5% per year during 1979-
85. The followirtg table gives estimates and forecasts on consumption/demand,
production, capacity and capacity utilization for 1980 and 1985 respectively for
various regions and economic groupings.

- 12 -
3.06    Total world steel demand is expected to reach 855 million tons by 1985
as against a world production capacity of 915 million tpy of crude steel equivalent.
Developing countries are expected to account for nearly half of the increase in
capacity between 1980-85 with the CPE's accounting for the remainder. The antici-
pated absence of capacity additions in the industrial countries reflects the
phase-out of obsolete capacity in the EC and the US, the weak market forecast, as
well as the emphasis on cost-saving and modernization investments to increase
profitability rather than capacity. Under this scenario, capacity utilization in
1985 will be about 93% in the market economies compared to an estimated 81% in
1980, and 95% in 1970. This would be close to the effective steel-making capacity
that could be sustained over an extended period of time.
3.07     In the early 1980's, the basic steel supply and demand structure in the
industrial and developing countries will probably remain the same as in the
1970's.   In the developing countries, a larger proportion (about 60%) of steel
demand and production will continue to be non-flat products such as rebars, wire
rods and light sections used in civil engineering construction activities with the
rest (40%) in flat products, such as tin plate, coils, sheets and plates, which
are used for equipment, pipes and consumer durables. As pointed out in a recent
study 1/, non-flat steel products, particularly rebars, tend to be competitively
produced also by semi-integrated steel mills of smaller sizes and located close to
the market since the simplicity of the technology and small economic sizes,
freight savings, and responsiveness to short-term market trends favor this type
of structure. Thus the developing countries are expected to increase capacity
primarily in non-flat steel products. On the other hand, flat steel products
require a more sophisticated technology and are in general more efficiently
produced by large integrated mills mostly in the industrial countries.
3.   International Price Trends for Steel Products
3.08     On the basis of the above discussions, it appears that during 1980-85,
the steel industry in the market economies will be able to adapt better to
market conditions and reestablish a healthy balance between demand and capacity.
In addition to considerations of profitability, the capacity utilization rate is
generally believed to be the most influential short-term determinant of steel
prices. As capacity utilization rates approach 90% and a seller's market be-
gins to develop, market pressures will start to push prices higher. Although
it is difficult to generalize, past experience indicates significant price
increases--and particularly so in the export markets--as the capacity utilization
rate exceeds 90%. Since the steel industry in the market economies is projected
to operate at about 93% capacity by the mid-1980's, prices -- and here again
especially export prices -- could therefore be expected to firm up and the pro-
fitability of the industry should be satisfactory. Beyond the mid-1980½s, addi-
tional capacity would be required to avoid a shortage situation and temporary
extreme price increases may occur if additional capacity is not added in time.
Any steel shortage will particularly affect the developing countries, since this
group is always the first to suffer in terms of price as well as availability
whenever a tight demand/supply balance develops and since the group-s degree
of self-sufficiency is projected to improve only slightly from about 68% in

3.09     The international prices of selected steel products have been projected
for 1985 (Annex 3-4) taking into account price trends for iron ore and energy,
the economic activity in various regions, and the expected average capacity
utilization rate for the industry.  The forecasts, together with historical
values are shown below. To arrive at the CIF price to most developing countries,
ocean freight and related charges will at present generally add roughly between
US$40 to 50 per tona of product; by 1985 they are expected to be about US$50 to 60
per ton (all in constant 1979 terms).

3.10    The anticipated situation of the world steel industry by the mid-1980s
would indicate opportunities for the developing countries to expand their own
steel industries wihere efficient import substitution is possible. Thus, developing
countries with relatively large and growing markets, some industrial infrastructure,
relatively low labor rates which more than offset their lower labor productivity 1/
compared to industrialized countries, and domestic sources of iron ore and/or
energy (e.g. coal, natural gas etc.) would be in a good position to undertake
an expansion of their steel industries. One such developing country is Egypt.
B. Egyptian Steel Demand and Production Trends
3.11    Egyptian apparent consumption of finished steel products 2/ was about
1.64 million tons in 1980 compared to about 0.67 million tons in 1970 indicat-
ing an average anniual growth of about 9.4% during that ten-year period. In
contrast, during 'i950-1970, consumption had grown by only about 4% per year.
Domestic production, however, increased by only about 8.8% per year during
1970-80, and in 1980 supplied only about 57% of consumption. HADISOLB pro-
1/  Although labor productivity in the developing countries, with the possible
exception of South Korea, is only 25% to 50% of that in industrial countries,
wage rates are only 10% to 25% thereby providing some source of comparative
advantage. Furthermore, steel production in some mills located in developing
countries (e.g. South Korea, Brazil) has now reached or exceeded design capa-
city, thus making the equipment productivity of these mills comparable to
chose Zn developed countrries.
2/ Finished flat and non-flat steel products respectively are assumed to be
equivalent to about 75% and 90% of the crude steel weight. Thus the 1.64
million tons of finished steel consumption in 1980 would be equivalent to
roughly 1.92 million tons of crude steel.



- 14 -
duced about 0.36 million tons of flat products and 0.16 million tons of
non-flat products in 1980 equivalent to 78% and 14% of the local consump-
tion of these types of products respectively. The 1979-1980 consumption was
approximately distributed as follows: rebars and rods - 50%; other non-flat
products, including steel castings and forgings - 23%; and flat products -
27%. The construction industry is the dominant market for steel products in
Egypt at present, accounting for about one-half of steel consumption.
Construction activity had grown at an average annual real rate of 6.5% during
1971-76 and 14% during 1976-79, and the construction boom is expected to
continue well into the 1980's due to strong housing demand and industrial
investment activities.
3.12     The historical (1970-80) production, imports and consumption of steel
products in Egypt are shown in Annex 3-5 and summarized in the following page
for 1977-80 together with the forecasts for 1985 and 1987. The production in
1980 reflects the continuing increase which started in 1975, particularly at
HADISOLB and National Steel Company, as the local steel companies improved
operations and took advantage of the additional capacity that was installed
in the early and mid-1970s. However beyond 1980, only minor increases in
local production can be expected from the existing facilities without any
major capital investments. The forecast for 1985 and 1987 assumes that HADISOLB's
Stage I Program as well as the proposed El Dikheila project proceeds as scheduled
thereby resulting in substantially higher production of rebars/rods, medium and
heavy sections, as well as flat products. However, the forecast does not assume
any other major investment in the steel sector except for a small continuous bil-
let casting facility at Delta Steel. HADISOLB's flat product output is expected
to reach 430 and 495 thousand tons during 1985 and 1987 respectively, compared to
355 thousand tons in 1980. The Company's non-flat product output is likewise ex-
pected to be 294 and 351 thousand tons during 1985 and 1987 respectively compared
to 160 thousand tons in 1980. The major increase in rebar/rod production will
come from the proposed El Dikheila project which is expected to start operations
in 1985 with an initial output of 200 thousand tons and to reach 790 thousand tons
by 1987. The three semi-integrated public sector steel companies are expected to
initiate feasibility studies for modernization/expansion projects but the scope
and timing of such investments can not be reliably assumed at present and are not
shown in the production forecasts. It should suffice to point out that the scope
will take into account the types of non-flat products (e.g. rebars, drawn wire,
and light sections) that would otherwise be imported by Egypt as indicated in the
previous table.
3.13    The projected domestic demand for steel products is expected to in-
crease by an average of about 8.2% per year during the 1980s. As mentioned
earlier, domestic steel consumption increased by an average of about 9.4% per
year during 1970-80. In general, steel demand in a developing economy that is on
the threshold of rapid industrialization, as is the case of Egypt, will grow at
slightly more than the rate of growth of GDP. The Egyptian GDP has increased by
about 7.6% per year during 1970-80 and is expected to grow at an average rate of
about 7% annually during 1980-87. 1/ In particular, the industrial sector is
expected to be the fastest growing sector during the early 1980s, increasing its
output by as much as 8% to 10% per year. Thus, an average growth rate in steel
consumption of 8% to 9% per year very reasonable and probably even somewhat
conservative. 2/   Finally, demand during the mid-1980½s is expected to be
1/   Bank estimate.
2/   During 1970-80, the implied steel consumption/GDP growth ratio averaged
about 1.24; for the forecast period (1980-87), the implied ratio would
be 1.17.

e/   The forecast uses the- average consumption for 1979 and 1980 as the 1980 base and an
average increase of 8.2% per year for total steel consumption during 1980-87. The projected
demand is assumed to be distributed as 27% flat, 50% rebars and rods, 23% other non-flats.
f/   Import duties on rebars were suspended in 1980 and international prices were low, prompt-
ing a large import quantity to build-up local stocks. Although apparent consumption does
not take into account stock changes, an adjustment is needed for 1980 to ensure a good
base figure for the dlemand projections.  It is assumed that only about 528,000 of the
728,000 tons importedl were actually consumed in 1980 with the remainder carried over as
stocks for 1981 (as of March 1981, Delta Steel had stocks of roughly 200,000 tons of
rebars and rods). Thus, 1980 rebar and rod consumption would be about 828,000 tons
compared to local production plus imports of about 1,028,000 tons.



-16-
distributed as follows: 50% rebars and rods, 27% flat products and 23% other
non-flat products as was the case during 1977-80.
3.14    A UNIDO-sponsored study completed in January 1979 estimated that Egyptian
steel demand in 1983 and 1987 would be about 2.1 and 3.1 million tons of finished
products respectively which implies a demand of about 2.4 million tons by 1985.
The earlier (1978) market evaluation by UEC in connection with the HADISOLB
diagnostic studies (para 1.05) projected a consumption of about 2.3 million tons
and 3.3 million tons of finished products for 1985 and 1990 respectively. The
forecast above used in this report is in line with the UEC projections and slightly
less than that forecasted in the UNIDO-sponsored study.
3.15    On the basis of the above steel consumption forecasts, HADISOLB should
have no difficulties in selling the additional production from Stage I. Egypt
will still be importing some flat steel products included in the Stage I product-mix
and could absorb the entire output of HADISOLB even if the Company chooses not to
proceed with the small quantity of additional exports from 1985 onwards.
C. Comparison of Egyptian and International Prices for Steel Products
3.16       The Egyptian economy has a centralized structure and commodity prices
are still extensively controlled by the Government even after the "open-door
policy" was announced in 1973.   Due to the complex industrial linkages as well as
sensitive socio-economic factors, only a gradual elimination or reduction of
consumer and industrial non-food price subsidies can be expected for a large
number of products and then only within the context of somewhat parallel increases
in wages and income. Nonetheless, a visible trend in increasing local prices
closer to international levels for a few industrial products, such as steel, has
emerged.
3.17     Domestic steel prices and distribution margins for steel products are
controlled by the Government. Price changes have been infrequent though substantial
when they occured. There were only three price increases since 1970: in November
1973; in December 1977 (by 25% to 30%); and the most recent in March 1980 (by 20%
to 30%). Prior to 1980, domestic ex-factory prices ranged from 85% to 100% of the
FOB export prices from Europe and Japan or about 60% to 80% of the landed cost of
imports into Egypt (excluding duties). The recent (March 1980) price increases,
however, brought the Egyptian price level reasonably in line with international
prices. Local ex-factory prices are now 100% to 130% of the FOB export prices in
Europe or Japan and about 80% to 105% of the landed cost of imports (Annex 3-6).l/
For non-flat steel products, which constitute two-thirds of local steel consump-
tion , domestic ex-factory prices are about 90% to 105% of the landed cost of
imports (excluding duties). Steel therefore is among the few commodities whose
present local price approximates international levels. The present prices are
shown below:
1/   The current domestic ex-factory prices range from roughly 90% to 110%
of the US Trigger prices (1980, 4th quarter) for hot and cold-rolled
sheets, heavy plate, galvanized sheets, rebars and some sections.

b/   In line wilth conventional systems elsewhere of charging extras accord-
ing to width, thickness, grade and other typical specification options.
3.18   There are tariffs on imported steel products 1/ ranging from 5%
to 40% which further increase the difference in the final cost to the consumer
betweeen the imported product and the local steel. On the other hand, energy
inputs (power, nLatural gas, and fuel oil) are priced throughout the economy at
substantially less than their economic or international price equivalent (para
8.01). 2 /   In the case of HADISOLB, the Company also receives an indirect
Government subsidy, equivalent to 33% of the price of coke purchased from EL
Nasr Coke Company (para 4.17). But the Government intends to progressively
phase-out and eliminate the coke subsidy as HADISOLB's financial strength
improves with increases in production, efficiency and/or selling prices.
Thus, steel producers, though receiving somewhat less for their products
compared to the landed cost of imported steel, are also paying less for their
energy inputs which constitute a substantial portion of steel production
costs.   Nonetheless, because of the obsolete and inefficient operations,
coupled with the low productivity of the Egyptian steel industry, steel
producers in Egypt as a group were unprofitable until prices were raised in
March 1980. Wit:h these new prices, the steel companies as a group are
expected to about break even or show a small profit.
1/ The 20% import duty on rebars has recently been suspended.
2/ The Government has acknowledged the need for a more realistic energy pricing
structure.  In the context of two recent Bank energy projects in Egypt
(Power III and Cairo Gas Distribution) approved in FY 1980, the Government
has initiatedl a comprehensive petroleum product pricing study and the
preliminary results of the study are expected by the end of 1981 and will
be discussed with the Bank. In addition, some increases in the prices of
petroleum products and natural gas mnay be announced before the end of 1981.

IV. THE COMPANY
A. Background and Ownership
4.01     The Egyptian Iron and Steel Company (HADISOLB), the project sponsor, is
the only integrated steel plant and the largest steel producer in Egypt. The
Company was established in 1954 with the construction in Helwan, near Cairo, of
a 0.3 million tpy (finished products) integrated mill supplied by DEMAG (FRG).
Commercial operations started in 1958. HADISOLB uses local iron ore from its
own mines as raw material for steel-making and buys its coke from the El Nasr
Coke Company, another public sector enterprise located adjacent to HADISOLB's
Helwan plant. The first iron ore mine, near Aswan, had a low quality ore (42%
Fe and high phosphorus content) and was a relatively small-size deposit (25
million tons); it was discontinued in 1975 (para 4.03).
4.02    HADISOLB's equity shareholdings have not changed significantly since
the early 1960s. About 98% of the equity is held by the Government and other
public sector entities and the remaining 2% by private shareholders, including
DEMAG, the supplier of the original plant. Since nationalization in 1961/62,
the private shareholders have been entitled to a minimum dividend of 4% on the
face value of the shares. This dividend is guaranteed and has in fact been paid
by the Government since HADISOLB has not been profitable for the last seven
years. The equity shareholdings are shown below:

1964. In 1968 it signed an agreement for a USSR-designed and supplied
expansion to be carried out in two phases. The first phase was started in
1968 and mechanically completed in 1973; it involved primarily the addition
of a 0.6 million tpy (liquid steel) integrated flat product plant. The second
phase, with an incremental capacity of also 0.6 million tpy (liquid steel)



- 19 -
involved an expansion/modernization of the non-flat products facilities. It
was started in 1972/73 and mechanically completed in 1978, except for the
medium section mill which was completed only in 1980.   A new iron ore mine at
Bahariya, some 350 kms southwest of Cairo, was also developed with USSR tech-
nology and started operations in 1973.   The Bahariya iron ore, although bet-
ter than the Aswan ore, is also of poor quality (para 4.08 - 4.10) but the ore
reserves of the mine are relatively large (250 million tons).
4.04    HADISOLB's major steel-related production facilities and their respected
rated capacities are shown in Annex 4 and summarized below together with the
recent production performance.

C. Major Problem Areas
4.05    The periods 1974-77 and 1978-80 were the operational learning periods for
HADISOLB-s first and second phase expansion projects respectively. The produc-
tion performance of HADISOLB has slowly improved but is still low, with production
of the steel shops only at about 54% of design capacity in 1980. Under present
conditions, that is, without any major rehabilitation and operations improvement
projects, output can be expected to improve to at most only about 0.9 million
a/   The mining capacity is actually 3.3 million tpy but constraints in the
train loading' facilities limit potential shipments to Helwan to not more
than 2.5 million tpy at present (assuming locomotives and wagons are
available). This actual shipping capacity is adequate to serve the
present requirements of HADISOLB as well as future requirements under
the proposed Project.



- 20 -
tpy of liquid steel or about 60% of liquid steel capacity by 1985 after some
more learning experience. The extremely poor production performance of HADISOLB
at present and unfavorable future prospects without a substantial rehabilitation
program are primarily due to three major problems: (i) a low quality raw
material (local iron ore) that is difficult to process; (ii) equipment which
either embodies obsolete or inappropriate technology; and (iii) an organization
and management that is basically inadequate to operate and maintain a plant of
HADISOLB-s size, complexity and difficult technical conditions, coupled with
overemployment and an uncompetitive salary structure. Even a strong organization
and management would find the complexity of the operations and the technical and
personnel problems of the Company a difficult challenge.
4.06     Several consulting firms have studied various aspects of the technical
problems of HADISOLB since the mid-1970s. The latest and most comprehensive
diagnostic studies were undertaken by US Steel Engineers and Consultants (UEC)
under the Bank-s engineering loan (para 1.05). The UEC studies also developed
practical approaches for solving these problems and provided the basis for
HADISOLB-s Stage I Rehabilitation Program (paras 4.18 - 4.23)
4.07    The three major problem areas (para 4.05) and the proposed solutions
are briefly described below:
4.08    Low Quality of the Bahariya Iron Ore: The local ore mined by
HADISOLB at Bahariya has an average content of only 52% Fe, a rather low grade
compared to about 60% to 65% for the typical internationally traded iron ore.
The most serious problem with the ore is however its relatively high content
of undesirable compounds such as salts (sodium chloride and potassium chloride),
silica, alumina and manganese which make the operation and maintenance of the
sinter plant and the blast furnaces very difficult. The use of high quality
imported ore or pellets for blending with the local ore would help significantly
but is not possible at present because there are no adequate port-handling
facilities and local rail transport is also a serious bottleneck.
4.09      Several studies have been undertaken concerning the possible
beneficiation of the Bahariya ore. UEC-s technical evaluation, on the
basis of comprehensive laboratory tests and some pilot plant tests at US
Steel½s facilities suggest that a leaching and washing beneficiation process
will reduce the salt content, in terms of chlorine equivalent, by about 85%.
In this context HADISOLB is proposing to build a semi-industrial pilot ore
leaching/washing plant to further evaluate the technical, financial as well as
environmental aspects as a basis for a full feasibility study. The Bank is
financing, under the engineering loan, the cost of consultants who will design
and engineer the pilot plant. Any decision on a commercial scale beneficiation
project will probably be part of HADISOLB's Stage II Rehabilitation Program.
In the meantime, as part of the Stage I Rehabilitation Program, HADISOLB will
partially compensate for the low quality iron ore by implementing the relevant
operations improvement schemes proposed by UEC, and by adding equipment to
overcome the reduction in effective capacity as well as the process restrict-
ions imposed by the low quality ore (paras 4.11 and 4.12). But production
efficiency at the sintering and blast furnace operations will continue to
suffer until a method for improving the quality of the iron ore raw
material is implemented.
4.10    Notwithstanding the low quality of the Bahariya iron ore, it is still
an economic raw material for HADISOLB because the cost of mining and transport
is low (financial cost is US$10 per ton of ore delivered to the plant and
economic cost is roughly about US$15 per ton) compared to the landed cost into



- 21 -
Egypt of high quality imported iron ore (at least US$40 per ton) 1/. The low
mining cost is due to the relatively easy mining conditions, the low capital
investment in the mine associated with the USSR-supplied equipment and techno-
logy and the use of many items of salvaged heavy equipment from the Aswan High
Dam construction project.
4.11 Equipment andJ Related Technical Problems: The technology and equipment
associated with much of the original DEMAG plant is over 20 years old and has
also suffered from inadequate maintenance practices in the past; and thus it
is obsolete and must either be scrapped or rehabilitated given the technolo-
gical developments during the last twenty years. Aside from the old DEMAG plant,
the newer facilities supplied by the USSR are also experiencing technical and
operating problems.  In general instrumentation in these facilities is  unsatis-
factory. Thus, of the roughly 17,000 instruments in the new facilities, about
11,000 have been planned for replacement during the next three to five years.
In the sintering plants, the high cloride content of the ore has caused salt
deposits to drastically reduce the effective sintering capacity and efficiency.
With a modified grate bar design recommended by UEC, and better instrumentation
and operating practices to be introduced as part of the proposed Bank Project,
the existing sinter plants should be able to support the Stage I target production
of 1.2 million tpy of liquid steel equivalent. The fifth sinter machine (para
4.20) included in the Stage I scope will raise sinter production to support
the design production level of 1.6 million tpy of liquid steel equivalent.
4.12  The operations of the two new blast furnaces have been adversely affected
by several factors; the high salt (chloride) and silica content of the iron ore,
the low blast temperatures caused by the low calorific value of the top gas, and
the use of poorly calcined fluxes (limestone and dolomite). The ultimate
consequences of these factors are: a coke consumption rate that is roughly 40%
higher than the projected rate under Stage I; an effective capacity that is
roughly 60% of the attainable capacity; a very short operating life for the
furnace refractory linings; and frequent and expensive maintenance work (and
downtime) to remove scales as well as to reline the furnaces. UEC has submitted
several recommendations, particularly the use of an acidic slag in the blast
furnaces followed by external desulphurization, to minimize these operating
problems and these recommendations have been incorporated in the Stage I scope.
4.13    The three new basic oxygen furnaces (BOF) in the steel-making shop also
have problems which will be corrected under the Bank Project. The continuous
slab casting shop has produced close to capacity but the yield is poor (e.g. too
many rejects) and the surface quality of the slab is also poor. Better instru-
mentation and better operating practice should correct most of the slab-casting
problems.  The three continuous billet-casters on the other hand, have produced
at only one-third of capacity and are the most serious production bottlenecks at
present. A major modification of the billet casters will be required to correct
the problems and the Project scope includes a major revamp of one billet
caster. The remaining billet casters will be modified in the Stage II Rehabili-
tation Program to minimize the disruption of production during the Stage I
implementation period as well as to confirm the level of improvement that could
be achieved through the modification of the first billet caster.
1/   On an iron content basis, that is, per ton of Fe, the financial cost and
the economic cost of the Bahariya ore would be about UJS$19 and US$29 res-
pectively compared to the landed cost of high quality imported ore of
about US$62. These costs are in 1980 ITS$.



- 22 -
4.14      Finally, the iron ore storage and handling system at the Helwan
site is limited and cannot support an output of more than roughly one million
tpy of liquid steel at present, especially not with the disruption in railway
transportation from the Bahariya mines during the three-month sandstorm
season. Again, Stage I is designed to overcome this problem. At the
Bahariya mine, mining capacity is adequate with the addition of five 70-ton
trucks which were financed under the Bank's Second Industrial Import Loan (para
1.06).
4.15   Management and Organizational Problems:  As mentioned earlier (para
2.11), the policies and regulations governing public sector enterprises are
among the major causes of the managerial and organizational problems of
HADISOLB. The Government has agreed however, to provide HADISOLB such degree
of autonomy in the areas of investment, procurement, pricing, and wages and man-
agement policies to enable the Company to achieve its financial and operational
objectives under the Project. Even now, HADISOLB is already taking advantage
of the liberal regulations (para 2.12) introduced during the last few years.
Thus, the Company has introduced a more innovative incentive system during the
past two years, and although it has several shortcomings and still leaves a
wide gap between salaries and wages paid in the private sector, the system
appears to have had a positive impact on overall performance. In addition,
the top management of HADISOLB has began to recognize and take corrective
measures with respect to the weak operating systems of the Company. Thus,
UEC, under a separate UNIDO financed project, designed a computerized prevent-
ive maintenance and spare parts control system which has been implemented
also with technical assistance from UNIDO. This UEC assignment recommended a
much broader set of computerized support functions for production such as a
production planning system and a raw material control system; these have been
included in the scope of the Project. The Company has also established an
energy conservation unit and an industrial engineering unit to fill important
organizational voids in the technical support staff. But much remains to be
done. For example, the employee turnover rates, specially among managers (20%-
30%) and among engineers and skilled workers (10% - 15%) are still very high.
Also, while the Company has a relatively well-conceived training program,
implementation is not satisfactory. At present, the steel mill has no envi-
ronmental protection standards nor does it have any pollution monitoring
equipment. Finally, industrial safety is also not adequately emphasized.
Under the Project, these shortcomings will begin to be corrected (para 5.05).
D. Financial Performance
4.16 The recent financial performance of HADISOLB is shown below, and the pro-
jected situations with and without Stage I are discussed in Chapter VII.

a/ The fiscal year for HADISOLB was changed from calendar year to July-June starting
in July 1980. A half-year statement was therefore prepared for January-June 1980.
4.17      HADISOLB has not been profitable for many years now.  This is mostly
due to the very slow build-up of capacity utilization for the new facilities
and to a lesser extent, to the steel product prices set by the Government which,
until March 1980, were much below international levels. Since 1978, losses
have been reduced substantially due to the steel price increase in December 1977
and the slow, but consistent, increase in production. In spite of the large
cumulative losses, HADISOLB's debt/ equity ratio was very good at 9:91 in June
1980 due to the 100% equity financing from the Government for the USSR-supplied
facilities. Nonetheless, an increasingly large fraction of the growing
current assets required to support the higher production level are being
financed by short-term debt because cash generation is inadequate. The
current ratio has declined from 1.6 in 1974 to 1.2 in mid-1980. As noted
before, the Government presently subsidize HADISOLB's coke purchases to mini-
mize the Company's losses. The subsidy amounts to LE 25/ton of coke, or about
33% of the coke price 1/. Without the subsidy, the coke price charged by El
Nasr Coke Company of about LE 75 per ton would be comparable to international
prices. It is the intention of the Government to gradually phase-out the coke
subsidy (para 3.18).
E. HADISOLB's Stage I Rehabilitation Program
4.18 There is a very large sunk investment in HADISOLB's facilities (steel
plant and mine), with a gross book-value of about US$0.7 billion equivalent
1/   Only one-half of the subsidy was given to HADISOLB in 1979 and none was
given in the first half of 1980.  However the full subsidy is in effect
for FY81. Without the 16.6% (LE 12.50/ton) coke subsidy in 1979, the
loss would be LE 12 million instead of LE 1.9 million.



- 24 -
and a replacement value at present prices of roughly US$1.5 billion. The
rehabilitation and modernization of IIADISOLB, coupled with improvements in
operating practices and a strengthening of its management and organization
is the most economic alternative available to Egypt to meet a large por-
tion of its steel requirements. During 1979-80, HADISOLB gradually developed
Stage I on the basis of part of the UEC recommendations, designed to increase
the achievable output to about 1.2 million tpy of liquid steel equivalent, or
about 75% of the original design capacity of 1.6 million tpy. A subsequent
Stage II Program, which will be defined by March 1983 as part of the Bank
project with the assistance of consultants (para 5.05), will further increase
the achievable output to the full design capacity or even more, depending on the
result of studies to be undertaken shortly. In this context, HADISOLB has
agreed that its decisions on new investments as well as choices of operating
practices shall take into account, to the extent that is technically and finan-
cially feasible, such economic factors as the economic cost of production
inputs, capital cost, economic benefits, and long-term trends in the inter-
national prices of steel. HADISOLB will also review by December 31, 1983, the
technical and financial feasibility of using coke-oven gas in its operation and
make reasonable efforts to reach agreement with the El Nasr Coke Company for the
supply of coke-oven gas. 1/
4.19    The original Stage I concept developed by HADISOLB only involved the
physical plant rehabilitation; it was subsequently refined and broadened
during appraisal to maximize the energy conservation aspects, to include the
initial steps towards strengthening of the management/organization of HADISOLB,
to promote substantial improvements in the Company's operating practices, and
to introduce technical assistance to help ensure efficient implementation of
Stage I. The subsequent Stage II will likely involve: revamping of the other
two continuous billet casters; replacement of the oxygen plants; upgrading of
the cold-rolling mill to produce high quality blackplate suitable for tin plate
and galvanized sheet production; installation of electrolytic tinning facilities
either as part of HADISOLB's operation or as a separate joint-venture project;
installation of a continuous bloom caster; expansion of the train loading
capacity at the Bahariya mine; and iron ore beneficiation.
4.20       Stage I is expected to cost about US$174 million equivalent or
about US$580 per ton of incremental liquid steel output. It thus compares
most favorably with the cost of about US$1,500 per ton (1980 prices) for
new greenfield plants (blast furnace, BOF steel-making, continuous casting
and rolling facilities). It will be implemented with financial assistance or
equipment supply from three different sources: (i) the USSR, whose scope of
work mainly involves the supply of equipment to ease some of the production
bottlenecks in the new plant it recently supplied; (ii) KfW, whose project
involves the rehabilitation of the four old rolling mills in the original
DEMAG plant; and (iii) the Bank, whose Project is described in Chapter V. A
protocol of agreement spelling out the remaining obligations, including supply
of specified equipment, of the USSR supplier was signed in September 1980 and
1/   A possible natural gas-based ammonia/urea project may be initiated by El
Nasr Coke Company. This would free the coke-oven gas, which is presently
used for fertilizer production, for use by HADISOLB. There is an exist-
ing coke-oven gas pipeline connecting the two plants. The substitution by
coke-oven gas of part of the natural gas requirements of HADISOLB appears
to be economic and should be encouraged by the Bank.



- 25 -
is now under implementation.  In addition to the supply of five equipment pack-
ages (only three of which are essential to Stage I) and some spares, it also
involves some technical assistance to overcome specific operating problems. The
equipment packages will be supplied at an FOB cost of US$3.6 million equivalent.
An additional cost of about US$6.4 million will cover freight and local purchases.
Of the US$10 million total cost, about US$7 million equivalent is for a fifth
sinter machine w`hich is not needed to reach the Stage I output of 1.2 million
tpy of liquid st,eel equivalent but for reaching the design output of 1.6 million
tpy. The fifth sinter plant is expected to be completed in late 1984 or early
1985. The other equipment will be delivered before the end of 1983. The total
cost (about US$10 million) will be financed by the Egyptian Government through
its bilateral clearing account with the USSR. The Government funds will be
recorded as loans to HADISOLB but will probably be converted to equity as was
done with previous loans.
4.21   The KfW-financed component of Stage I is expected to cost US$58 million
equivalent; it was appraised in July 1980 and will be implemented on a turnkey
basis. The bidding documents were issued in early 1981 and contract award
is expected in late 1981. KfW envisages a loan of about US$45 million equiva-
lent; it will be made to the Government on concessionary terms and onlent to
HADISOLB (para 6.09). The remaining cost of about US$13 million, all for local
purchases, will be financed by the Government in the form of additional equity
contributions to HADISOLB.
4.22   The cost and financing plan for Stage I is as follows:

a/ Includes interest during construction (IDC) and contingencies.
b/ Includes estimated indirect foreign exchange cost.
4.23    The three components of Stage I are physically separable but opera-
tionally inter-related. Thus, implementation of the components can proceed
independently of each other but should be coordinated in terms of time-schedule
to ensure that all elements are in place and ready to function by the target
Stage I completion date (which is the same as the Bank Project completion date).
In terms of implementation schedule, the USSR component, which is already under-
way,is expected to be completed first, followed by the KfW component and then
the Bank Project. Thus, even if the KfW and/or the USSR components are delayed
by roughly six-months, the operating benefits from the Bank Project or Stage I
are not expected to be adversely affected.

V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept and Description
1. Stage I Rehabilitation Program
5.01   As stated previously the overall concept of HADISOLB's Stage I Rehabili-
tation Program evolved from the extensive technical/economic/management studies
conducted by US Steel Engineers and Consultants (UEC) between 1977 and 1979,
financed under Bank Loan No. S5-EGT, (para 1.05). From that work, and further
discussions between HADISOLB, UEC and the Bank, a list of key high priority
elements was selected as the basis for Stage I. Subsequently, at the Bank-s
request, a follow-up study was done by EGITALEC/ITALIMPIANTI to confirm the
technical viability of Stage I and the Bank Project itself including its basic
makeup, design, scope, equipment list, unit capacities, product flow, yields,
and attainable capacity of the complex. A process flow chart and the expected
production levels of HADISOLB after completion of Stage I are shown in Annex
5-1.
5.02      The prime objective of Stage I, of which the proposed Bank Project is
a critical component, is to more effectively utilize the extensive existing
facilities through rehabilitation and roundout investments, together with
operational and management improvements designed to achieve substantial increases
in productivity and product quality as well as reduce costs of production,
particularly through energy conservation. 1/   Stage I will also facilitate more
effective integration between HADISOLB-s relatively new USSR-supplied plant and
its older DEMAG-built plant.2/ Significant improvements in productivity,
quality and efficiency will be achieved through:  the shutdown of some older,
less efficient iron and steel-making facilities (i.e., the older, small blast
furnaces and the Thomas Shop) and shifting of iron and liquid steel production
to more efficient facilities (i.e., new, larger blast furnaces, and BOF shop)
together with more extensive use of continuous casting instead of ingot teeming;
the introduction of more effective and reliable instrumentation systems to
improve process control; the modification of deficient facilities and/or instal-
lation of complementary equipment to overcome existing technical and design
shortcomings; and most important, the implementation of operations and manage-
ment improvement schemes. Stage I would raise the achievable production
level of HADISOLB during the mid-1980 s from about 0.9 million tpy of liquid
steel equivalent to about 1.2 million tpy by FY88. HADISOLB-s management also
recognizes the importance of terminating uneconomic production facilities and
confirmed that as soon as the Stage I target production level of 1.2 million
tons of liquid steel per year is nearly attained, HADISOLB will review the case
for closing the small blast furnaces and the Thomas steel-making shop, and take
appropriate action based on full consideration of financial and economic
factors. Initial steps towards developing an environmental protection capability,
1/ For example, coke consumption per ton of saleable product is expected to
fall by over 25%.
2/ Until recently these two plants, located at the same site, had been
planned and operated separately, with little or no interchange of products,
and services between the two.



- 27 -
as well as the strengthening of the industrial safety and occupational health
practices, and of the training program of the Company, are all included in the
Stage I Program scope.
2.   The Bank Project
5.03      Within Stage I, the Bank Project will consist of two packages - an
equipment package and a management/operations improvement package including
technical assistance.
5.04      The equipment package in the Bank Project includes items to improve,
modify or introduce the following: raw material handling and preparation (iron
ore yard, sinter plant modifications); lime calcining; external desulphurization
of hot metal (outside blast furnace); BOF steelmaking, ladle preparation, trans-
fer cars, argon stirring; one continuous billet casting machine; ingot teeming
facilities; instruments, scales and weighing equipment; pollution monitoring
equipment; a newq computer for the information service center; electrical dis-
tribution; and additional plant services including supply of oxygen and argon
gas. With respsect to the installation of a new oxygen plant equipped with an
argon separationi unit, a brief technical study by HADISOLB-s consultants will
be prepared to confirm the viability of accelerating by three years the replace-
ment of one of the existing oxygen plants. Completion of this review will be a
condition of Bank disbursement for this item. Additional details are given in
Annex 5-2.
5.05      The operations and management improvement package, as well as the
closely related technical assistance services, are designed to implement the
Project efficiently and - of greater long-range importance - to improve opera-
tional efficiency, control costs of production, improve the general performance
level of HIADISOLB and plan the future development of the Company in an economic
manner. It consists of the following:
(a) Implemnentation of about 80 operations improvement schemes
recommended in the UEC diagnostic study. HADISOLB has already
implemented, or is in the process of implementing, about 150
other operations improvement schemes which had also been
recommended by UEC.
(b) Development and introduction by July 1984 of a more competitive and
effective job classification/grade system and remuneration system as
discussed in para 5.28.
(c) Development and application of computerized management control and
information systems including, but not limited to, the following
which are to be implemented by the end of 1984: production planning
and material tracking system; manpower planning and control system;
raw material control and mines development system; and rolling stock
utilization control system.
(d) Strengthening of the industrial safety and occupational health
practices (para 5.15).
(e)  Development by the end of L982, and thereafter implementation of
environmental protection standards and policies acceptable to the
Bank, including the proper operaticn and maintenance of the pollution



- 28 -
monitoring instruments to be installed as part of the Project
(para 5.15).
(f0  Development of a sound long-range plan for overall plant rehabi-
litation and roundout, including the conceptual engineering and
design of the Stage II Rehabilitation Program, and completion of
a feasibility study by March 1983.
(g)  Strengthening of the Company's general training program, including
development by December 1982 of a managerial training program and
policy/program of training or retraining redundant employees to enable
them to be productively employed in the Company or elsewhere (paras
5.23 to 5.26).
Agreement was reached with the the Company that it will undertake these programs
with the assistance oL consultants, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.
B. Production Program, Raw Materials and Utilities
1.   Production Program
o.06      The Company's production build-up over the next eight years is expected
to be gradual, being restricted by the operating and raw material problems
described in Chapter IV, but partially alleviated under Stage I by (i) gradual
removal of production bottlenecks (especially billet caster); (ii) the introduc-
tion of improved operating and maintenance practices; and (iii) higher metallic
yields as a consequence of improved process control and instrumentation.

a/ Assumes effective utilization of technical assistance for project implementa-
tion and operating practices.
bl Under the Project and based primarily on adopting suggestions made by UEC,
HADISOLB is expected to achieve some improvements in overall plant metallic
yield. TWSe have assumed a nominal improvement of 3 percentage points in the
liquid steel to finished product yield. Metallic yields assumed to be attained
through the Project are judged to be somewhat conservative and may be surpas-
sed.
c/ Including cast billets for sale.  The product mix for FY88 and later years is
shown in Annex 5-3.
d/ Without Stage I, pig iron production ranges between 120,000 to 60,000 tpy,
similar to the case with Stage I.



- 29 -
The assumed Stage I production build-up, reaching the full target output only
in FY88, is admittedly slow. However, it is considered realistic given the
uncertainties involved in introducing improved operating practices and in the
reponsiveness of the Company to the difficult challenge it faces in imple-
meriting Stage I, 3.s well as the constraints in the project implementation
capability in the country, particularly the overloaded industrial infrastruc-
ture and lack of trained manpower.
2.   Raw Materials
5.07      At the projected FY88 production level with Stage I, HADISOLB will use
2.1 million tons o:f iron ore, 0.86 million tons of coke and 0.40 million tons of
limestone (from its own mines). The required quantities of local iron ore and
limestone are expected to be available without problems.  Under Stage I, the
iron ore storage and handling capacity at Helwan will be increased to permit
the build-up of stocks (up to 2 months supply). In order to assure reliable
transportation between the mine and the steel plant, measures are also being
taken by the Railways to avoid blockage of the tracks by shifting sands, during
the three-month sandstorm season, including improved track maintenance by
mechanized means. In anticipation of the higher iron ore requirements under the
future Stage II Program, project studies are now underway to expand and improve
ore mining facilities which would be included in the Stage II Program scope. As
mentioned earlier (para 4.09), HADISOLB also intends to construct a small pilot
plant (of about 50 to 100 tons per day) for washing/leaching the local iron ore.
In the long-term, the possibility of utilizing high quality imported iron ore, to
permit economic levels of blending with local ore, is being reviewed by HADISOLB.
Blending of imported and local iron ores will be possible when the proposed El
Dikheila port becomes available in the mid-1980s as presently planned.
5.08      All of Egypt's coking coal requirements are imported from the USA,
Poland, USSR, Soulh Africa and Australia.  In the near term it is expected
that there will be enough coking coal available on world markets. However, in
the long-term, the availability and particularly the price, of good coking
coal are more uncertain, although these are not presently considered serious
problems. HADISOILB has a representative on Egypt's coal import committee, to
help assure that adequate imports of coking coal will be made, as needed to
support continuous coke plant operations. Finally, the El Nasr Coke Company
has sufficient calpacity to supply HADISOLB's coke requirements under the Stage
I Program. 1/ Supply of raw material and additives needed for steelmaking,
are not expected to cause problems for HADISOLB.
3.   Utilitieas
5.09      Electric Power:  HADISOLB is working closely with the Egyptian Elec-
trical Authority (EEA) 2/, to assure that its expanding needs for electric power
will be met effectively without causing delays in the startup of new facilities
or curtailing future production due to lack of power. Although EEA does not
make legal commitments, that authority has confirmed (verbally) that HADISOLB's
projected requirement of 115 MW (maximum half-hour load) at 1.25 million tpy
level (at 0.75/0.85 power factor), is already incorporated in EEA-s approved
1/ Major maintenance of some coke ovens may be necessary at a future date.
2/ HADISOLB has a representative who sits as a committee member during meetings
of the Egyptian Electrical Authority.



- 30 -
load and facility plans for 1981-1985. HADISOLB's own estimate of load
requirement (about 105 MW) allows for some margin of safety since - under the
Project - new electrical load management equipment is expected to result in
more effective load management and thereby reduce peak power requirements.
5.10      Water:  HADISOLB obtains its plant service water from its own system
(operated by the Egyptian Water Authority) near the Nile River, adjacent to the
Helwan plant.l/ Capacity of this system is adequate for the Stage I needs.
Its reliability will be improved under the Project by addition of automatic
starting diesel engine-driven pumps to cover occasional surge water demand,
power outages and other emergencies.
5.11      Natural Gas:  HADISOLB's total requirement for natural gas under
Stage I is expected to be about 230 million cubic meters per year, based on
continued heavy usage of natural gas for injection in the two new blast fur-
naces and assuming that El Nasr Coke Company will continue to use all the coke-
oven gas. A major pipeline from gas fields in the Gulf of Suez to the Cairo
ares conducts this gas to the Helwan plant; availability of natural gas for
HADISOLB-s use is not expected to be a problem during the 1980-s.
5.12      Argon Supply:  The supply of argon gas for the new argon stirring
stations is to be provided from a new oxygen plant equipped with an argon
separation unit, all included in the project scope.
5.13      The Government agreed to ensure that HADISOLB will have access to all
the coke and utilities (e.g. water and energy) needed for the efficient operation
of the Company.
C. Ecological and Occupational Health Considerations
5.14      At present, HADISOLB does not have effective programs for proper
occupational health safeguards for employees, plant safety, plant air quality,
or control of liquid effluents; nor does it have suitable equipment to measure
actual conditions existing in the workplace for air and water pollution. 2/ As
an example, HADISOLB-s recent records for lost time accidents indicate a level
about 50 times that being experienced in steel plants in developed countries.
Fatal accidents are also about 5 to 10 times higher.    The attitude of HADISOLB
management in the past has been that operating problems took precedence over
environmental and occupational health problems. However, over the last few
years the topic has been raised frequently by the Government authorities and
the Bank, and a gradual change in attitude is developing. At least the top
management of HADISOLB is now more committed towards improving worker safety and
ecology. As part of the Project, HADISOLB agreed that a consultant would help
work out a practical action program - including detailed procedures - to be
implemented by the Company with the help of the technical assistance firm to be
chosen under the Project (para 5.18).
5.15     Specifically, the Company would undertake the following:
(i) Development by the Company of an effective Plant Safety and Occupational
Health Program which will include short training visits to IIADISOLB by experienced
managers of steel safety programs now in use in other countries, along with the
1/ Potable water is supplied by wells at Helwan.
2/ Possibly with exception of noise.



- 31 -
supply of descriptions of systems used, safety manuals, and related material
aids. Such visits will be arranged through the technical assistance firm (para
5.18). Visits of HADISOLB's safety personnel to foreign steel plants would also be
arranged. Such plans are to be implemented soon after hiring of the consultants,
and will cover at least: (a) classes in safety awareness; (b) regular in-plant
safety meetings; (c) provision of routine safety equipment such as hard hats,
safety shoes, gogZgles, ear protection, and protective clothing; and (d) training
in safe working methods and procedures.
(ii) With respect to ecology and working conditions, HADISOLB will purchase
under the Project, suitable instruments for initial monitoring of air and water
pollution, and develop (with Bank assistance and help from the technical assist-
ance firm) an ongoing program for effective measurement, and continued monitor-
ing of employee working conditions (i.e., gases, dust, fumes, noise, chemical
and radiation exposure, temperature, etc., at job site) and air and water pol-
lution in the plant and immediate surrounding area. The Company will also
develop, suitable standards for air and water pollution and a plan for future
control of air anld water pollution, including pollution control facilities
to be incorporated in its Stage II Rehabilitation Program.
D. Project Implementation, Management and Training
5.16      HADISOLB recognizes the importance of efficient implementation of
Stage I and of quickly developing the scope of the Stage II Program particularly
given the present: situation where Egypt has to rely on imports for a large part
of its steel requirements. Overall control of implementation rests with HADISOLB.
The implementation arrangements envisage a project implementation unit (PIU)
and a coordination unit (CU) within HADISOLB with adequate authority and
responsibility for the entire Stage I reporting directly to the chairman. The
PIU and CU will be assisted by an experienced foreign operating steel company
(OSC) providing broad technical assistance particularly in the implementation
of the management: and operations improvement program, and a local engineering
company (EGITALEC) providing more focused project engineering and management
assistance for the implementation of the equipment package included in the
Project. In add.ition, individual foreign or local consultants may be hired from
time to time as dleemed necessary by either the Bank (in consultation with
HADISOLB) or by HIADISOLB for specific trouble shooting or very highly specialized
technical expertise (e.g. pollution, civil works). This implementation arrange-
ment is schematically shown in Annex 5-4 and the division of responsibilities is
shown in Annex 5-5 and described briefly below.
1. Project Engineering Assistance for the Equipment Package
5.17      The PIIJ, established in 1980, is comprised of individuals with exten-
sive plant operating and maintenance experience, but with limited knowledge in
project management and implementation. Given this lack of suitable experience
and the limited staff of the PIU, and even after recognizing that the physical
part of the Project is relatively simple, HADISOLB agreed that the PIU will
restrict its function to overall top management control, coordination, and
follow-up; and delegate most of the day to day work of project implementation
such as engineering, procurement, critical path scheduling, inspection, expediting,
shipping, field supervision and control, construction management, budgets, testing
and commissioning, to the more experienced personnel available through EGITALEC,
the recently hired project engineering firm. Thus, most of the responsibility



- 32 -
for effectively carrying out the work of implementation, and ensuring that project
schedules, costs, and other aspects are controlled efficiently, will be delegated to
EGITALEC,l/ a joint venture of ITALIMPIANTI of Italy, a well-known and experienced
firm with world-wide design and erection experience in steel plant facilities,
and of the four public sector Egyptian operating steel companies. ITALIMPIANTI
has given an assurance to HADISOLB that EGITALEC will have prompt and complete
access to all the specialized expertise available at ITALIAMPIANTI as needed.
HADISOLB's contract with EGITALEC includes provisions for technical support
from ITALIMPIANTI.
2. Technical Assistance from an Operating Steel Company for Improvements
in Operations and Management
5.18      An experienced foreign operating steel company (OSC) is to be selected
to provide technical assistance to both the PIU and the CU. The OSC will assist
the PIU in handling needed coordination between technical detail and operating
aspects of the Stage I Program and the several comprehensive technical studies
which have already been completed. It will also assist the PIU in such areas
as specialized aspects of equipment design, desired operating characteristics of
new facilities, steel plant operating practices, commercial practices, as well
as Project implementation and operator and maintenance training. The most
important function to be covered by the OSC is assistance in actual implementa-
tion of the operations and management improvement programs mentioned in para
5.05. The CU will coordinate the implementation of these programs between
HADISOLB's operating departments and the OSC. The OSC's tasks would also cover:
(i) technical assistance in implementation of the equipment package included in
the Project as needed, and not covered by HADISOLB-s contract with EGITALEC and
(ii) full access to HADISOLB of all operational, managerial, and commercial
know-how of the OSC, throughout execution of the Project, covering all areas of
plant operations, maintenance, process control, management, training, etc.
including troubleshooting and general problem-solving. A satisfactory initial
Project implementation organization, with appropriate working relationships
between the PIU, the CU, OSC and EGITALEC, and an appropriate staffing plan for
both the PIU and the CU has been agreed upon.
5.19     Although the equipment package included in the Bank Project is not
complex, the overall coordination of the three components of Stage I, together
with the plant's serious raw material, operating, and maintenance problems, and
the highly complex technical and economic analysis needed to develop a good
Stage II rehabilitation plan will all require a very high level of effort and
coordination to achieve HADISOLB's long-range objectives within a reasonable
time (say 6 to 8 years). Adequate technical assistance and effective engineer-
ing services are essential elements to achieve the improvements indicated
in this report. A draft contract negotiated between HADISOLB and EGITALEC has
been reviewed by the Bank and comments have been given to HADISOLB. Satisfactory
contracts with EGITALEC and with an OSC are conditions of loan effectiveness.
Finally, agreement was also reached that these consultancy services will be
retained throughout project execution, including during the start-up period in
the case of the OSC.
5.20      A list of five highly qualified foreign operating steel companies
(OSC candidates) for the technical assistance services has already been agreed
upon, and satisfactory terms of reference for such services has already been
1/ For a few selected equipment packages, the equipment supplier will assume
some of the duties mentioned above.



- 33 -
issued. Proposals are expected to be received by HADISOLB in June/July 1981
and a contract signed by August 1981.
5.21      The schedule for implementation of the Project is given in Annex 5-6.
To get the Project moving on schedule, prequalification of major suppliers would
have to be completed by June 1981; the writing of the main specifications by
June/October 1981; invitation to bid to be issued by July/November 1981; and
major contracts signed between February and August 1982. Mechanical completion
is expected by March 1985, followed by a testing and commissioning period
through September 1985.
5.22      The above schedule is considered realistic and attainable.  It gives
cognizance to local conditions and makes adequate allowance for some expected
difficulties in slaking needed changes in HADISOLB's manageaent laid control
practices, and in its organization. For purposes of monitoring actual progress,
the above schedule 1/ and also individual unit implementation schedules pre-
pared by EGITALEC will be used.  The development of a simple but accurate
schedule for implementation, and the periodic updating of this schedule, is
included in the responsibilities of EGITALEC. It has been agreed that such
schedule will be updated quarterly and will be sent to the Bank as a part
of the reporting requirements for this Project.   Both the USSR component and
the KfW component, are expected to be physically completed before the end of
1984 while the Bank Project is expected to be mechanically completed by the
first quarter of 1985. However, in order to allow for unforeseen delays, and a
moderate learning curve, the attainment of full production under the Stage I
program is not claimed until FY88 for purposes of the financial and economic
analysis of Stage I and the Project.
3.   Traininlg
5.23      Stage ], and the Project in particular, contain a few areas where the
introduction of -partially or entirely new processes are involved, such as: (i)
external desulphurization of hot metal; (ii) argon stirring; (iii) BOF practices
(i.e., calcined lime supply, new ladle preparation practices, slide gates); and
(iv) continuous casting.
5.24      In such cases, training under the OSC contract at foreign plants
operating such equipment and/or brief training conducted by foreign experts at
HADISOLB is envisaged. Other cases involving very specialized expertise - such
as operations/maintenance on specific instruments/control systems; pollution
monitoring, electrical distribution, computer applications, will probably
require additional training and follow-up from the OSC or directly from equip-
ment suppliers (as a part of their installation/startup services). HADISOLB has
agreed that adequate arrangements for such training will be included in contrac-
tual arrangements with the OSC and equipment suppliers.
5.25      Another aspect of employee training now being considered by HADISOLB
is retraining some of its surplus manpower. This consideration is part of an
overall long-range plan for HADISOLB to gradually reduce its excess manpower
through normal attrition, shifting existing manpower to new or expanded produc-
tion facilities whenever possible, and/or shifting excess personnel to other use-
ful functions inside or outside the plant (possibly including general services,
1/ It is expected that schedules utilized for purposes of management object-
ives will be tighter.



- 34 -
maintenance, plant housekeeping, collection of scrap throughout the plant area,
etc.).
5.26      HADISOLB's plan for handling its problem of excessive manpower
does not include forced layoffs or cutbacks of its surplus work force (esti-
mated as over one-third of its present work force), but instead depends on
a more gradual reduction as outlined above. Agreement was reached that
HADISOLB will carry out adequate training programs designed to train HADISOLB
staff for productive employment within the Company or elsewhere. In addition,
HADISOLB will follow strict recruitment policies to help contain over-staffing.
E. Organizational Improvements and Associated Risks
5.27      Stage I faces one very serious risk -- the weak organization of
HADISOLB -- which could seriously hinder the effective implementation of the
program as well as prevent the Company from realizing the full improvements in
productivity, efficiency, and quality that are expected to be attained. Thus,
the institution-building aspects included in Stage I through the proposed Bank
Project, including the Project implementation arrangements, are very important,
and make the Bank role crucial to the success of Stage I. However, it is recog-
nized that only a step-by-step and evolutionary process of change and improve-
ment will bring about the strengthening of HADISOLB. The Bank's strategy under
the proposed Project is to help set the most basic institutional foundations
upon which further hoped-for improvements can be built. This involves two main
areas: the first relates to the ability of the Company to plan its operations
and to operate its plant efficiently and effectively, and the second relates to
the ability of the Company to attract and retain qualified personnel as well as
to motivate its workforce to perform well. The first area was discussed in
paras 5.15 to 5.19, while the second is discussed below:
5.28      Employee turnover in HADISOLB is very high, particularly in the
managerial and skilled labor group.  In addition, differentiation between jobs
is grossly inadequate, allowing for only seven job grades from the chairman
down to the lowest employee compared to the over 30 job classifications found
in steel companies in the industrial countries and advanced developing count-
ries. Thus, not only is the absolute level of wages/salaries uncompetitive,
but the relative salaries within the Company also do not promote individual
motivation and acceptance of responsibility/authority due to the absence of
meaningful differentiation. The production incentives are now primarily designed
to reduce somewhat the total compensation gap between the public sector and the
private sector 1/ and only secondly to induce better productivity. They are
based solely on total output. The incentive system must be improved to take
into account responsibility, authority, the value of the equipment/product
handled, efficiency, product quality as well as productivity, etc. as in other
modern steel mills. To prepare for the enactment of a public sector reform law
(para 2.12), HADISOLB agreed to develop with the assistance of the OSC a job
classification and grading system that will form the basis for a more rational
basic salary structure in the future as well as a transitional remuneration and
incentive system suitable to its requirements. After taking into account the
Bank's comments, the Company agreed to take steps to implement such system not

1/   At present, the salary levels in the private sector are about 100% to
200% higher than for similar occupations in the public sector.

VI. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Project Cost Estimate
6.01    The total financing required for the Project (including interest during
construction) is estimated at about US$106 million equivalent, of which USb76
million is in foreign exchange. The cost includes a physical contingency of 10%
and an overall price escalation of about 16% on foreign purchases, and about 25%
on local purchases. The project cost estimate is based on the current exchange
rate of US$1.00 = LE 0.69.
6.02    The original capital cost estimates were prepared by UEC in January,
1979. Foreign exchange costs were based primarily on budget proposals from
international equipment suppliers, and also on adjusted cost data for equipment
and materials fronm other recent steel projects. The capital cost estimates and
related assumptions were reviewed and updated in December 1980 by EGITALEC/
ITALIMPIANTI. That review incorporated late modifications in project scope,
and also updated the local currency costs, particularly for civil works and
erection services.
6.03    A summary of the estimated capital cost is given below and a more detailed
breakdown is shown in Annex 6-1.

6.04    Except in a few cases where substantial differences in the design or
physical scope of the equipment rehabilitation became necessary (i.e. lime
kilns), EGITALEC's estimates were reasonably close to UEC's - indicating
reasonably firm original estimates.
6.05    HADISOLB has not yet applied for exemption from import duties, and
a provision of about 12% of the CIF value of direct imports has been included
in the capital cost estimates to cover these costs. This estimate is based on
the prevailing tariff structure for the mix of items involved. The estimated
total base cost of engineering and consultancy services is about US$5.2 million.
The technical assistance to be provided by the OSC of about 250 man-months, are
expected to be provided at an average man-month cost of US$13,000, including
salary, costs, know-how fees, international travel and subsistence. Actual costs
will depend on the final selection of a contractor from a list of 5 well-qualified
firms from 5 different countries. The Bank will finance this item. The services
of EGITALEC for the Project, with some back-up support from ITALIMPIANTI, are estim-
ated to require about 600 man-months at an average man-month cost of about US$3,300.
The large difference in cost per man-month is due primarily to the amount of local
services involved for EGITALEC, and the low salaries prevailing in Egypt, as com-
pared to developed countries. In addition, some specialized foreign or local indi-
vidual consultancy services, of about 10 man-months or less, may be needed at an
estimated average cost of US$10,000/man-month.
6.06      The costs of civil works, a relatively small component of the Project
amounting to about 3% of the base cost estimate, have been determined on the
basis of construction costs of civil works projects carried out by EGITALEC in
Egypt during 1980. As a general example of cost levels prevailing in Egypt,
building costs average about 275 LE/m1 (US$398) for complete heavy industrial
buildings. Hourly labor costs, which have a major influence on erection and
installation costs, range from LE 0.7/hour for unskilled labor in the public
sector to LE 11/hour for highly skilled labor in the private sector. It is
expected that much of HADISOLB's skilled erection/installation labor will come
from private sources. Price escalation for equipment is calculated on the basis
of projected international equipment price increases of 9.0% in 1981, 8.5% in
1982, and 7.5% annually during 1983-85 in major equipment supplying countries.
The same price inflation rates have also been used for about US$12.0 million
(BCE basis) worth of local currency costs (except mainly erection and commis-
sioning costs) on the assumption that price escalation on these items in Egypt
will follow the rates in those countries. However, for erection and commission-
ing costs, civil works, and local equipment/electrical supplies, amounting to
about 12% of the base cost estimate, a price escalation rate of 18% per year
has been assumed based on experience in the recent past and the expectation
that the cost of erection/ installation labor in Egypt will continue to rise
faster than the international level, due in part to shortages. The above cost
estimate, including the provisions for physical and price contingencies, is
considered adequate.
B. Financing Plan
6.07    The following table gives the proposed financing plan for the Project:
LE Million       US$ Million       _
Bank Loan               44.2               64.0           61
Government Equity       28.7              41.6           39
Total                   72.9             105.6          100



- 37 -
6.08      The US$64 million Bank loan would be made to HADISOLB at the standard
interest rate for a period of 15 years including 4.5 years of grace. HADISOLB
will bear the foreign exchange risk and also pay a guarantee fee to the Govern-
ment which would bring the total cost of borrowing to 10% over the actual Bank
lending rate (now expected to bring the total rate to HADISOLB to about 11%
which is roughly in line with present local commercial interest rates).
The Government has agreed that the remaining foreign exchange cost and
the local cost of the Project would be financed by the Government through
additional equity contributions (US$41.6 million equivalent). In addition,
agreement was reached that should cost overruns occur, the Government will
provide, or cause 'EADISOLB to be provided with additional funds including
foreign exchange in the form of equity and/or long-term loans (in the propor-
tion of not more than 60% loan) promptly as  needed to complete Stage I and the
Project on time.  For purposes of this covenant, the Project is considered
complete when the facilities included in the Project scope have been tested and
proven to be satisfactory in accordance with established engineering procedures
and have operated at an average production rate of 75% or better of their Stage
I incremental target output (where applicable) for not less than 60 consecutive
days. The Project is expected to finish the completion tests around September
1985.
6.09      The KfW 'Loan amount and on-lending terms are still subject to final
negotiations in May/June 1981 between the Egyptian Government, KfW and HADISOLB.
For purposes of the financial analysis, it has been assumed that the KfW loan
would total DM 90 million or US$45 million equivalent and would carry an
interest rate (on-lending) of 8%. The loan would be for 20 years, including 5
years grace.
C. Procurement
6.10      The tota:L value (CIF/ex-factory basis) of the equipment, materials
and spares for the Project is about US$58 million, of which about US$54 million
will be bid internationally in accordance with procedures consistent with the
Bank-s procurement guidelines and the balance (US$4 million), which is determined
to be not well suilted to international procurement, will be purchased locally. Of
the internationally bid items, about US$47 million (87%) are expected to be pro-
cured through international competitive bidding (ICB) and about US$7 million (13%)
through limited international tendering (quotes solicited from not less than 4
suppliers from 3 different countries). Limited international tendering will be
restricted to imported items estimated to cost less than US$500,000 (CIF
basis, and not exceeding a total of US$3 million) equivalent, proprietary
equipment, items of limited international supply whose delivery periods are
critical to the timely completion of the Project, and items required to have
technical compatibility with existing equipment, including standardization of
operations and maintenance practices. Civil works, which are not expected to
exceed US$3 million equivalent will be procured through local competition
involving both local and joint venture construction companies registered in
Egypt. The list of pre-qualified contractors will be approved by the Bank.
Although the local civil works contracting capacity will continue to be severely
strained for some time to come, HADISOLB is not expected to have any difficulty
in obtaining acceptable bids on the basis of local competition. To minimize
delays in procuremient, particularly in bid preparation, evaluation and award,



- 38 -
the Government has been asked to grant HADISOLB full authority on procurement
decisions with respect to the Project witlh GOFI having only a representative
in HADISOLB-s procurement review committee (paras 2.08 and chart on page 5) as
was the case in the Bank's first textile project (Loan No. 1292-EGT of June
1976).
6.11      For internationally bid items to be financed by the Bank the list of
goods will require prior Bank approval and major equipment suppliers will be
prequalified in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank. Qualified
local equipment suppliers will be allowed to participate in ICB with a 15%
(or the import duty rate if lower) preference margin provided the domestic
value added exceeds 20%. However, because of the limited capacity and capabil-
ity of the domestic equipment industry, practically all the equipment to be
bid internationally, is expected to be supplied from abroad. The contracts
for the OSC consultancy services, (US$3.0 million) as well as EGITALEC's
services (US$2.0 million), will be financed by the Bank. Down payments for
these two contracts (up to about US$0.3 million) are to be financed from the
unutilized funds of the Bank's engineering loan (Ln. No. S-5EGT). Under the
proposed loan, retroactive financing of up to about US$1.5 million to cover
subsequent payments for the consultancy services and other payments after March
1, 1981 will be allowed so that Project implementation will not be delayed.

VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01    This chapter discusses the financial outlook of HADISOLB under two
scenarios:  (i) the 'without Stage T- case, i.e., without rehabilitatior, and
the 'with Stage I case-, i.e., with the rehabilitation program. The financial
objectives of HADISOLB under the Project are to reach and mailntain a satisfactory
liquidity within t'hree years, to generate sufficient profits without any Govern-
ment subsidies wit'hin five years and thereafter pay dividends, build-up reserves
and finance a portion of future investments consistent with the current ratio,
debt service coverage ratio and debt/equity ratio stipulated in para 7.12.
A. Production and Sales Forecast
7.02 As noted previously, HADISOLBs present output is far below its rated
capacity and production in 1980 was approximately one-half of design capacity.
The effecl:s of the rehabilitation are expected to be felt by FY84 and gradually
reach its full impact in FY88 as shown in para 5.06 for the production build-up.
Sales forecasts by product are given in Annex 7-1 and Annex 7-2. 1/ The use
of natural gas and' blast furnace gas instead of fuel oil is reflected in both
cases with and without Stage I starting in FY82.  The projections for FY81 and
FY82 are essentially the same with or without Stage I. The production build-up
assumed for the USSR-built medium section mill, which was only started up in
late 1980, is not expected to be substantially affected by the rehabilitation,
nor is the output volume of the relatively minor production lines of cold-
formed sections and galvanized sheet. Since HADISOLB's inventories of saleable
products are already very large, 2/ no increases in inventories of finished
products are assumed. With proper production planning, HADISOLB should even
be able to reduce its finished products inventories below present levels.
7.03   The ex-fact:ory prices of steel in the financial forecasts for both the
cases with and without Stage I, are assumed to remain constant in real terms
at the new prices put into effect in March 1980 (para 3.17) which were roughly
80% to 105% of the landed cost of imports during 1980. For the without Stage
I case, the input costs, such as the cost of energy 3/ and labor, are assumed
to remain in real terms at the 1979 level because HADISOLB is not expected to
be profitable.  However the price of coke is expected to increase from about
LE 75/ton at present to about LE 88.5/ton by 1988 in December 1980 prices, and
this additional burden would have to be subsized by Government since cash
generation by HAD-[SOLB would be insufficient.   For the with Stage I case
however, the cost of energy and labor are assumed to gradually increase in
real terms. Thus for FY88 and beyond, the following prices are assumed in
1/  Starting July 1980, HADISOLB changed its fiscal year from January-December
(same as calenLdar year) to July-June.  FY81 refers to fiscal year 1981 cover-
ing the period-1 July 1980 to June 1981.
2/  This is due to deficiencies in production planning and a lack of coordina-
tion between various departments, particularly marketing and production.
3/  This would impily that without Stage I, the Government will have to provide
HADISOLB cash subsidies, in addition to the coke subsidy, to cover future
increases in t:he prices of natural gas and electricity. These additional
cash subsidies are not shown in the financial projections without Stage I but
on the basis of the price increases assumed for the case with Stage I, would
amount to about LE 1 million in FY83, increasing to LE 3 million in FY 85 and
LE 4 million in FY88 (in December 1980 prices).



- 40 -
real terms (in constant 1980 LE): natural gas -- LE 33/1,000 m3 com-
pared to LE 6.5/1,000 m3 in 1980 (408% increase); and wages and salaries --
50% higher than the FY80 level. The expected tightening of the demand-supply
balance for coal is reflected in an 8% increase in the price of coke by 1985
from LE 75/ton to LE 81/ton. Thereafter, the price of coke is expected to
increase at 3% annually in real terms, bringing the FY88 coke price to LE 88.5/
ton in December 1980 LE terms. The other assumptions used in the financial
projections are shown in Annex 7-3.
7.04      Even without Stage I,  HADISOLB might be able to achieve some cost and
yield improvements in its USSR-built plants. At the same time, HADISOLB is
likely to face increasing difficulties in the old DEMAG plant units, which have
been operating since 1958, even though it is difficult to exactly predict the
remaining useful life of these mills. The increasing risk of break-downs is
reflected in an assumed decrease in production and a total phase out by 1990.
Because of the deterioration of the blooming, plate, light and heavy section
mills, an increasing proportion of raw steel would have to be sold. Since there
are no other ingot rolling facilities in Egypt and export prospects are most
uncertain, the gradual deterioration of the blooming mill without rehabilitation
would bring about limitations on steel ingot production by the mid-1980s, and
force a shut down of the Thomas and EAF shops which both cast all their output
into ingots. By the late 1980s the expected end of the useful life of the
blooming mill would also affect the BOF shop which is casting about 8% of pro-
duction into ingots which then would have to be scrapped and recycled. These
factors are all reflected in the production and sales forecast without Stage I.
7.05      With Stage I,  HADISOLB is expected to be able to increase its
output to 1.2 million tpy of liquid steel by about FY88. Because of the
rehabilitation of the old DEMAG mills under the component financed by KfW,
the blooming, plate, light and heavy section mills will be shut-down for re-
vamping in FY83. They will be restarted in the following year and reach full
production by FY87. The rehabilitation will relieve the main bottlenecks in
the continuous casting areas, and thus create an additional output of 100,000
tpyl/ of finished flat products and 70,000 tpy of billets by FY88. During
the revamping of one continuous billet caster during FY83, billet production
(of the two remaining billet casters) will be only 140,000 tons. The revamped
billet caster would be restarted in FY84 and is expected to reach full pro-
duction by FY88.
B. Production Costs
7.06    Since HADISOLB mines its own iron ore, the cost of producing and deliver-
ing the ore is included in the various cost categories, such as labor and energy.
A comparison with the present production costs (Annex 7-4) indicates that average
variable costs per ton of crude steel would be about 35% lower after Stage I in
1979 prices (Annex 7-5). With the average variable cost per ton of raw steel roughly
equal to 80% of that of finished products for HADISOLB-s product mix, this would
result in about a 28% cost reduction per ton of finished product if there were no
real term increases in the unit cost of variable inputs. With real increases
in the price of energy inputs (para 7.C03), the VY8M -ariable cost Is about ?°%
higher than in 1979 (Annex 7-6). The production cost structure indicates the large
share of energy, in particular coke, in HADISOLB's production cost. It also shows
how expensive steel making is in the old Thomas shop, which consumes nearly
1/ Excluding plate from the old DEMAG mill.



- 41 -
1.5 tons of coke per ton of crude steel, due to the high coke rate of about
1,136 kg/ton of pig iron in the two old blast furnaces and to the poor
yield from hot metal to crude steel of 77%. HADISOLB's average production cost
without Stage I are shown in Annexes 7-7, and 7-8 are summarized below:

7.07      Without Stage I,  HADISOLB would basically continue its recent perfor-
mance with some improvements likely in the more modern plant units, but increas-
ing difficulties in the older mills. Recent production costs of HADISOLB per
ton of crude steel have been rather high, as shown in Annex 7-4. Also, the
older mills would face increasing risks of breakdowns, so that in constant
prices the cost of production of the old plant units can be expected to increase.
While this trend is, difficult to quantify exactly, it has been assumed for pur-
poses of the financial projections, that the cost per ton of finished product
in the older mills would increase by 2% annually in real terms. The shut down of
the inefficient Thomas steel shop expected to be forced by the deterioration of
the blooming mill would reduce the average cost of raw steel at HADISOLB by 4.3%
in constant prices. The real term increases in the cost of coke, natural gas and
labor (para 7.03) by FY88, however, would cause an increase in HADISOLB s cost
of crude steel by 22.2% in real terms.



- 42 -
7.08      With Stage I, HADISOLB is expected to achieve major reductions in
its production costs, including a 37% lower energy consumption per ton of
crude steel. First, the most important improvement would be the reduction of
excessive coke consumption in the two new big blast furnaces from 968 kg/ton of
pig iron at present (including coke fines used in the production of sinter) to
662. Excluding coke consumed at the sinter plant, the coke rate would drop from
736 to 530. Second, the increase in output from the more modern plant units
would allow the shut-down of the uneconomic Thomas shop, which would result in a
reduction of average variable cost by about 1.9% and of average total cost per
ton of crude steel by about 4.3%. Third, the rebuilding of the old DEMAG mills
would improve the present poor yields by 7 percentage points for heavy sections,
2 percentage points for plate, and 4 percentage points for light sections. The
variable cost per ton of those finished products would drop accordingly. Opera-
tions improvements in the more modern USSR-built rolling mills would lead to
yield improvements of 2 percentage points. Fourth, the increased output of the
BOF shop from 505,000 tpy in 1979 to 1,195,000 tpy of crude steel by FY88 would
substantially reduce the fixed cost per ton of crude BOF steel from LE36.4 to
LE 21.8 or by about 40%. The benefits from the incremental output in terms of
lower average fixed cost is significant because even at the roughly 50% capacity
utilization in 1980, HADISOLB was financially about breaking-even in terms of
profit and hence, its fixed costs were already about covered. Depreciation
charges were, however, small because of low investment costs. 1/ Any increase
in production would thus be highly beneficial. For the EAF, output level and
production cost per ton of crude steel are expected to remain unchanged.
Finally, there are a large number of minor benefits from the various smaller
investments which have not been quantified in the production cost summary after
completion of Stage I (Annex 7-5). It is expected that the full effect of the
cost savings will be felt beginning in FY86.
7.09      Without Stage I, HADISOLB is expected to remain in an unsatisfac-
tory financial condition and would have increasing losses and therefore
continue to rely on the coke subsidy provided by the Government to balance
its cash flow. This would be so inspite of strong debt/equity and current
ratios and mainly due to the poor production performance and decreasing out-
put from its deteriorating older facilities.
7.10      With Stage I,  the output and cost improvements mentioned earlier
(para 7.08), would substantially improve HADISOLB's financial performance
and thus remove the necessity for coke subsidies from the Government. Instead,
the Company would be able to first wipe out the accumulated losses and then
begin distributing dividends by the late 1980's. Because of its present low
debt/equity ratio, the additional debt to finance part of Stage I would not
increase the projected debt/equity ratio beyond a very good 16/84. Debt service
coverage is not projected to fall below 3 times which is also very conservative
and again due to HADISOLB-s small debt at present.
1/   Gross fixed assets (including mining) of HADISOLB per ton of liquid steel
capacity (i.e. 1.6 million tpy) is about US$242 on the basis of historical
(i.e. acquisition) cost for the fixed assets compared to an estimated
present capital cost of about US$1,500 for new greenfield plants. Gross
investments (gross fixed assets plus current assets) in HADISOLB is about
US$405 per ton of liquid steel design capacity.

The financial projections with Stage I do not include the planned Stage II
rehabilitation which will require some of the cash generated by Stage I.
7.12    To ensure t:hat the future profitability of HADISOLB will be satisfactory
under the Project, HADISOLB agreed that after Project completion, it will set
its steel prices and operate its production facilities such that:   (i) it can
earn sufficient profits to allow it to pay dividends, build adequate reserves,
and finance a portion of its future investments under conditions of efficient
operations; and (-ii) it will take into account the prices of internationally
traded steel products in setting its own prices. For purposes of this covenant
efficient operations will-mean: production of the steel-making shops at not
less than an average of 7,500 heats per year for each BOF vessel in operation;
a minimum metallic yield from liquid steel to finished products of 75% for
flat products and of 79% for non-flat products; and an average blast furnace
coke rate of not more than 600 kg/ton of pig iron. In order to protect the
financial soundness of HADISOLB, the Company also agreed that unless it
receives prior approval from the Bank, it will:
(i)   maintain at all times a debt/equity ratio of not more than 60/40
and after June 1984 maintain a current ratio of at 'Least 1.3;
(ii)   not incur any long-term debt if any future debt-service ratio
would be estimated to fall below 1.5 times and if the debt/
equity ratio would exceed 60/40; and



- 44 -
(iii) inform the Bank of the financing and implementation plans for invest-
ments totalling in excess of US$5 million equivalent in any one year
before completion of Stage I and ensure that such investments will
have no adverse impact on the Project or the compliance by HADISOLB
with its agreements with the Bank under the Project.
7.13      The summary sources and uses of funds for FY82-FY86 is shown below:

D.   Financial Rate of Return
7.14      The incremental financial rate of return of Stage I was calculated
on the basis of the difference between the -with Stage I' and -without Stage
I' cases, as presented in Annexes 7-1 and 7-2. The cost/benefit streams are
expressed in constant LE of December 1980 and shown in Annex 7-9. The financial
rate of return of Stage I is estimated at 36% before taxes and 32% after taxes.
Sensitivity tests are summarized below:
HADISOLB - Sensitivity Tests of Stage I Financial Rate of Return Before Taxes
(%)
Base Case                               36.5
Capital Costs up 20%                    30.8
One Year Project Delay                  27.6
Prices Down 10%                         28.1
Prices Up 10%                           45.1
Base Case (After Tax)                   31.8
Base Case (including Coke Subsidy)    41.6
To test the sensitivity of the rate of return further, a worst case scenario was
constructed: (i) output increase of only up to 1 million tpy of liquid steel,
(ii) achievement of only half the cost reductions assumed in the base case and,
(iii) one-year delay in implementation. Even under such combination of adverse
conditions, Stage I would be expected to achieve an 18% return before taxes.
E. Major Risks
7.15    While the incremental financial rate of return of Stage I is high, as
would be expected for a rehabilitation project, this is under the critical assump-
tions that: (i) the management will be able to implement and operate the new faci-
lities with reasonable efficiency; (ii) HADISOLB will follow a pricing policy that
will allow the Company to earn adequate profits under reasonably efficient opera-
tions; (iii) the three different components (Bank, KfW, USSR) of Stage I will be
implemented in a coordinated and timely manner.
7.16     Organizational weakness has been one of the reasons behind the diffi-
culties in increasing output and efficiency at HADISOLB. The proposed Project



- 45 -
is to address this weakness through the provision of technical assistance in
project implementation, plant operation and training. Moreover, the intro-
duction of new job classifications and remuneration levels are designed to
improve productivity, morale and HADISOLB's competitiveness for skilled labor
in comparison with other enterprises in Egypt.
7.17      As mentioned previously (paras 3.17 and 3.18), the ex-factory steel
prices in Egypt before the price increase in March 1980 were below international
levels and contributed to the poor financial performance of the steel companies,
including HADISOLB. The recent prices provide a more favorable cost/price
relationship and if maintained as agreed to by HADISOLE, should be adequate to
ensure a sound financial condition for HADISOLB after implementation of Stage I.
7.18      The three components of Stage I are operationally interlinked.  All are
based to a large degree on the extensive work done by UEC.   The KfW and Bank
components have been prepared in close coordination between the two financial
institutions. ntis coordination is intended to continue throughout the implemen-
tation of Stage 1]. To protect the Project against delays in securing financing
particularly in case cost overruns occur, the Government agreed to ensure timely
availability of funds to complete Stage I. While adequate measures have been
taken to reduce the Project risks as much as possible, the success of the
Project will hinge largely on the determination of the Government and the
Company to properly utilize the opportunities the Project offers for turning a
run-down plant into an efficient operation.
F.   Auditing and Reporting
7.19      All public sector enterprises in Egypt are audited by the Central
Agency for Auditjing, which is an independent governmental organization and
acceptable to the Bank. HADISOLB agreed to submit to the Bank annual financial
accounts and statements, audited by the Central Agency for Auditing or an
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank within seven months of the end of
each fiscal year.. The Company will also submit quarterly project progress and
procurement status reports, together with production and financial statements.
Finally, after completion of the Project, HADISOLB will prepare and furnish to
the Bank a comprehensive report on the Project, its implementation, initial
operation, and the updated costs and benefits expected to be derived therefrom.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
8.01    The economic costs and benefits of Stage I and the Bank Project are
expressed in constant LE of December 1980 and the tradeable items have been
valued at their respective border prices. The major non-tradeable items are
iron ore, labor, power and natural gas. Iron ore, which would be very difficult
to export because of its poor quality, is priced at its cost of production.
The average financial cost of power to HADISOLB, despite an increase from
LE .0083 (US$0.012)/KwH in 1979 to LE.012 (US$.017)/KwH in 1980, is still only 52%
of the economic cost of LE .023 (US$.034)/KwH. Power accounts for about 11.5%
of current production costs at economic prices. For natural gas, the economic
cost of LE 109.55 (US$158.85)/1,000 m3, or US$4.50/mcf is the energy equivalent



- 46 -
of the F.O.B. value of fuel oil. 1/ The financial price of natural gas in 1980
of LE 6.5 (US$9.42)/1,000 m3 is only about 6% of the economic price. 2/
Natural gas accounts for about 12.4% of HADISOLB's present production costs at
economic prices. The economic cost of labor is taken as identical to the
financial cost. Salaries and wages account for about 16.7% of the present
economic costs (Annex 8-1).
8.02    The tradeable items are coke, fuel oil, other raw materials excluding
iron ore, spare parts, and steel. With the exception of coke and fuel oil, the
finanancial prices of all inputs are based on the delivered cost of imports. On
the basis of international prices for imported coal, coke supplied by the El
Nasr Coke Company has an economic cost of about LE 75/ton (US$108.75), which is
in line with international prices. The price of coke is expected to increase by
8% in real terms by 1985 and at 3% annually in real terms thereafter bringing
the economic cost to LE 88.5/ton by 1988. Fuel oil is currently priced very low
in Egypt at LE 7.5 (US$10.88)/ton, compared to an economic value of about LE
131.79 (US$191)/ton, which is the current export price. 1/ Fuel oil accounts
for about 5.7% of HADISOLB's present economic production cost but after 1981,
HADISOLB will stop using fuel oil and instead, substitute a mixture of natural
gas (95% by calorific value) and blast furnace gas (5% by calorific value). The
economic value of the steel output is derived on the basis of the export and the
import substitution benefits. International steel prices are discussed in paras
3.08-3.09. Exports are priced at their projected F.O.B. value; products substi-
tuting for imports are priced at landed costs (F.O.B. export prices plus freight
and handling costs). Exports have been accounting for a small part of HADISOLB's
sales of flat products and their share is expected to decline further, as a
result of growing internal demand.
B. Economics of HADISOLB's Operations
8.03    Because of the economic distortions in the prices of both inputs and
outputs for steelmaking in Egypt, substantial adjustments need to be made to
HADISOLB's financial results in order to arrive at approximations of the
economic costs and benefits to Egypt and to make meaningful comparisons with
steel producers in other countries. HADISOLB's expenses and revenues are
adjusted as outlined above in Annex 8-1. The result of these adjustments
indicates a somewhat larger economic loss than the financial one for 1979.
Details of the adjustments for revenues are given in Annexes 8-2. In 1979,
the direct and indirect subsidies on the input side were largely (87%) balanced
by controls of domestic steel selling prices which were below the landed cost
of imports. In the longer term and with increasing production and efficiency
due to Stage I, HADISOLB is projected to not only be financially profitable,
but at economic prices, to generate a significant economic surplus.
C. Economic Costs and Benefits of Stage I
8.04    The benefits of Stage I can be grouped into two main categories:  (a)
cost savings, particularly in energy consumption, and (b) benefits of incre-
mental output.
1/   This is in line with the crude oil price of about US$39/barrel.
2/   The issue of energy pricing in Egypt is being discussed with the Govern-
ment in the context of the Bank's energy lending program.



- 47 -
8.05      The cost savings will be achieved through a variety of measures.
First, the output in the more modern installations will allow the closing down
of the inefficient and uneconomic Thomas steel shop and small blast furnaces.
This alone would reduce HADISOLB's average cost of crude steel by about 3%
between 1981 and the assumed attainment of the full benefits of Stage I in FY88.
Second, the Project would include various specific items (e.g., external
desulphurization, argon stirring, better instruments) that would help improve
operating efficiency. Third, the rehabilitation would improve yields as discussed
in para 7.08.
8.06      The table below shows the effect of the three major cost savings, i.e.,
the closing of the Thomas shop, the reduction in coke consunmption rates and the
impact of higher capacity utilization on fixed cost per output unit, on HADISOLB's
average cost per ton of crude steel. It also shows the substitution of fuel oil
by natural gas and blast furnace gas.

D.   Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
8.07      The incremental economic rate of return of Stage I has been esti-
mated at 42%.   Cost and benefit streams are shown in Annex 8-3.  Sensitivity
tests are summarized below:



- 48 -
HADISOLB - Sensitivity Tests of Economic Rate of Return of Stage I
(%)
Base Case                                      42.1
Capital costs up 20%                           36.9
One year project delay                         33.8
Prices down 10%                                35.3
Prices up 10%                                  48.2
Energy Costs up 3% annually in real terms   39.8
from 1981 onwards a/
a/   Power and natural gas; the real term increase in coke prices is built into
the base case.
A worst case scenario was also explored under conditions similar to those out-
lined in the financial analysis (para 7.14). Even with a one-year project delay,
an output of only 1 million tpy of liquid steel and just half of the expected
cost savings, Stage I would still show a rate of return of about 24%.
8.08    The rate of return of Stage I is rather high, which is expected for a
rehabilitation of an existing large sunk investment producing at only half of
design capacity at present and plagued with technical problems that cause
unusually high energy consumption. Thus, in addition to energy savings,
production increases can be achieved at a lower incremental investment cost
per ton of additional output compared to completely new greenfield steel
projects. For example, greenfield plants such as the proposed El Dikheila
steel project, have a much lower rate of return.
8.09    An attempt was made to separately estimate a rate of return for the
Bank Project as distinct from the other components of Stage I, although this
is somewhat artificial because of the operational interlinkages between the
three components of Stage I. The benefits that can clearly be attributed to
the Bank Project include the cost savings resulting from the various investments
such as argon stirring and external desulphurization; the latter is generally
considered to have the highest energy saving benefits in steelmaking, after
continuous casting. Also, the increase in output that would result from the
revamping of one continuous billet caster can be credited to the Project. An
economic rate of return thus estimated for the Bank Project is about 32%.
Sensitivity tests of the economic rate of return for the Bank Project show
similar results as for Stage I. Because the Bank and USSR components are
strongly complementary, a common rate of return has been calculated for both.
The rate of return of the KfW project is higher than for the Bank Project mainly
because the increase in labor costs as a result of the various salary and job
classification measures is charged to the Project.
8.10      HADISOLB's cost of production after Stage I, at economic prices for in-
puts, is competitive internationally for the following reasons: low investment
cost per ton of production (para 7.08), low cost for iron ore mining (para 4.10),
and low labor rates compared to developed as well as advanced developing countries.



- 49 -
E. Other Benefits
8.11      Other benefits from the Project include (i) improvement in plant
safety and occupational health with a reduction in accidents; (ii) the introduc-
tion of pollution monitoring instruments and development of a pollution control
policy which will be implemented in Stage II; (iii) institution building; and
(iv) improved planning for the future rehabilitation and expansion of HADISOLB.
8.12      One important Project benefit that is very difficult to quantify is
the inclusion of pollution monitoring equipment and improvement in plant safety
included in the Bank Project. Until now, there have been no monitoring devices at
HADISOLB. Under the Project, pollution will be monitored. The results of these
efforts would serve as a basis for a comprehensive pollution control program
during Stage II. While the pollution monitoring items are to address primarily
the long-term efiEects of pollution, there are also much more immediate benefits
for the health of the workers operating the plant.
8.13    The proposed Project would have a beneficial impact on HADISOLB
through such institution building aspects as strengthening and build-up of the
PIU, the CU and the computer center through various technical assistance
components. Also, better planning for Stage II is expected as a result of the
Project.
8.14    The institution-building aspects of the Project, while specifically
designed to benefit HADISOLB and help ensure the success of the Project, have
a much wider implication in the context of the public sector industrial
enterprise systerm.  The principle of enterprise autonomy in managing their
internal affairs and designing their organizational/operational systems and
policies according to their own needs in order to be efficient, while generally
recognized as desirable, is not effectively practiced in the case of the
public sector indlustrial enterprises in Egypt. This has held back the develop-
ment of this sector and had contributed to the net financial drain caused by
the public sector enterprises on the Government's resources. The Project,
which will directly affect one of the largest public sector enterprises is
expected to provide a meaningful example of what even a modest degree of auto-
nomy, when couplead with appropriate personnel, operating systems, procedures
and technical advice, can achieve in terms of improved efficiency and financial
viability. The Project also provides a purposeful approach to more effective
manpower planning and control, a major weakness of the public sector enterprises.
HADISOLB, instead of being continuously subsidized by the Government as would
be the case without Stage I, could now be expected to contribute in a meaningful
way to the Government's resources and the industrial development of the
country.
IX. AGREEMENTS
9.01     The following major agreements and confirmations have been obtained:
1. From the Government that:
(i)   HADISOLB will be provided such degree of autonomy in the areas
of investment, procurement, pricing, and wages and management
policies so that the Company can achieve its financial and
operational objectives under the Project (paras 4.15 and 6.10);



- 50 -
(ii)   It will ensure that HADISOLB will have access to all the energy
and water needed for its efficient operations (para 5.13); and
(iii)  It will provide IIADISOLB equity contributions (para 6.08) for
the local costs and remaining foreign exchange cost of the
Project not covered by the proposed Bank loan and provide or
cause HADISOLB to be provided with funds needed to complete
Stage I and the Project in a form as stipulated in para 6.08.
2. From HADISOLB that:
(i)    Its decisions on new investments as well as choices of operating
practices will take economic factors into account (para 4.18);
(ii)   To minimize the use of natural gas it will review the feasi-
bility of using coke-oven gas that may be made available by
El Nasr Coke Company (para 4.18);
(iii)  It will undertake and implement the various operations and
management improvement programs described in para 5.05 and
explained further in paras 5.15, 5.23 to 5.26, and 5.28;
(iv)   A suitable PIU and CU with appropriate technical assistance
will be retained throughout the project implementation
period. A satisfactory technical assistance contract with
EGITALEC and a foreign operating steel company (OSC) will be
conditions of loan effectiveness (paras 5.17, 5.18 and 5.19);
(v)    It will design by December 1982 and substantially carry out
training programs, satisfactory to the Bank, to train
surplus staff for productive employment within the Company
or elsewhere (paras 5.24 to 5.26);
(vi)   It will observe the financial covenants and ratios described
in para 7.12; and
(vii)  It will submit to the Bank within seven months of the end of
each fiscal year, annual financial statements audited by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Bank as well as quarterly
financial and progress reports within 45 days after each
quarter (para 7.21).
9.02      On the basis of the agreements mentioned above, the Project provides a
good basis for a Bank loan to HADISOLB of US$64 million equivalent for a period of
15 years including 4.5 years of grace at the Bank's standard interest rate plus
a guarantee fee (equal to 10% of the Bank-s interest rate) to the Government.

in ladle  or steelmaking furnace immediately
upon manufacture.
2.  Raw steel                   Refired steel in 1st solid state after its manu-
facture (typically in form of ingot or cast
billet/slab/bloom).
3.  Semi-finished products      Steel product in a solid form at an intermediate
stage of processing between liquid steel and
finished products (i.e. slab, bloom, billet).
4.  Finished steel products    Steel product in its commercial form as n'ormally
shipped from steel plant (i.e. rods, bars, angles,
beams, channels, hot rolled and cold rolled sheets,
hot rolled and cold rolled coils, plate, coated
products etc.).
5.  Billet - semi-finished  product, normally of cross section "  235CM2
6.  Bloom  - semi-finished product,  normally of cross section >  235CM2
7.  Slab   - semi-finished product, (typically 250MM x 1,300MM x lOM and variable).
8.  BOF    - basic oxygen furnace.
9.  Thomas Process -            An older steelmaking process which utilized air as
a medium in refining process, in a bottom blown
vessel. (Twas particularly well suited to processing
steel made from high phosphorous raw materials.)
10.  Sinter                       The product of the sinter plant - an aggregated
form of fine materials (iron ore, coke, lime-stone,
dolomite, flue dust mill scale and other materials)
produced at high temperature, and utilized as a

ANNEX 7-3

EGYPT:  HADISOLB REHABILITATION PROJECT
Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
1.    Unless otherwise stated, prices are expressed in constant LE of December
1980. The following inflation factors have been used for inflation of local
currency and the US$ in %):
Fiscal Years   1982   1983   1984   1985   1986   1987   1988   1989   1990
LE              ].3.0   18.0   18.0   18.0    6.75   6.0    6.0    6.0    6.0
US$              8.75   8.0    8.0    8.0    6.75   6.0    6.0    6.0    6.0
2.    Production cost analysis is based on 1979 data, the last year for which
comprehensive information was available at appraisal. Production cost figures
in the financial projections include the full cost of coke; the coke subsidy
is shown separately.
3.    Dividends are payable only after all accumulated losses have been wiped
out. Distribution of net income before taxes is as follows, once there are
no longer any carried over losses (in %):
Income tax                  55%
Workers participation       25%
Dividends                   15%
Total distribution          95%
Reserves allocation          5%
Total Income               100%
4.    Prices for both inputs and outputs are assumed to remain constant in real
terms unless otherwise stated.
5.   Working Capital requirements are expected to grow as a percentage of cost
of goods sold as follows:
Receivables                 90   days
Operating Cash              30   days
Other short-term debt, which accrued mainly to balance operating deficits of
HADISOLB, is assumed to be paid back depending on the cash flow. Inventories,
and payables which are very high at present, are assumed to remain constant in
real terms and increase only with inflation. The interest rate for short-term
debt is taken at 11.5% p.a.

bI   Fixed costs at the Thomas shop per ton of raw steel in 1979 were particu-
larly high because of the low output (27,000 tpy versus 78,000 tpy in
1980) due to the shutdown for several months. In m ore "normal" years,
fixed costs per ton of raw steel at the Thomas shop would have been LE 42
per ton of raw steel instead of LE 120; and total cost about LE 162 instead
of LE 240.

a/   The Capital Cost Stream shows the base cost estimate, excluding
interest during construction and price escalation, but including
physical contingencies. The capital cost includes the cost sinter
machine No.5 which is not necessary to reach the Stage I output.
If the cost of sinter machine No.5 were to be excluded, the rate
of return would increase by less than one percentage point.
b/   Negative values are due to the production loss because of the
rehabilitation in 1983.

ECONOMIC VALUE OF HADISOLB'S 1979 SALES
Output values are adjusted to price domestic sales at the estimated
landed cost of imports. The value thus adjusted of domestic sales would total
LE 126.3 million for 1979, as broked down below. The value of goods that are
not currently imported is calculated by adding 20% for insurance, freight and
port handling on top of the current European export price.
