1. THE ENERGY AND ELECTRICITY SECTORS
Energy Resources
1.01      Indonesia is well endowed with abundant energy resources and has
as yet underdeveloped natural gas, coal, hydroelectric power and geothermal
sources. Petroleum reserves have been exploited for some time and the
availability of indigenous oil caused Indonesia to develop a petroleum based
energy sector rather than exploiting other available energy resources.
Prior to independence the country relied on coal and hydroelectric energy to
a large extent for its commercial energy; petroleum currently accounts for
90% of total commercial energy consumption (para. 1.20).
Petroleum
1.02      Petroleum reserves are estimated at about 50 billion barrels but
proven reserves are between 10-15 billion barrels, a figure that has remained
static since 1970. Production, currently about 1.6 million barrels per day,
is expected to increase to about 1.8 million in five years; details are shown
in Table 1 below:

(million bbl crude

Source: IBRD estimates based on information supplied by MIGAS.
Given the complexity of the oil sector, these projections are highly conjec-
tural, especially since a rapidly growing share of total production will have
to come from new wells (mostly in new fields) and from secondary recovery.
Possible market constraints have not been taken into account. Primary



-2-
production from existing wells is expected to decline rapidly due to natural
exhaustion. The projected rate of secondary recovery (primarily from the
large Migas field in Sumatra operated by Caltex) is a function of investment
decisions that have yet to be made. The projected rate of production from
new wells, rarticularly in the later years, is a function of the rate of new
oil discoveries. More than half of Indonesia's oil is produced by a
multitude of relatively small fields and all new discoveries during the past
several decades have been modest in size.
1.03      Therefore, continuous large-scale exploration is required to main-
tain a minimum ratio between estimated recoverable reserves /1 and current
production. This ratio has declined in recent years as a result of a sharp
drop in exploration activities following a general weakening of the inter-
national oil market in 1977 and 1978, uncertainties concerning the interpreta-
tion of certain tax rulings by the US Internal Revenue Service affecting US
oil companies operating abroad, and Indonesian oil tax increases in 1976.  The
various tax problems have now been resolved and to revive the search for new
oil reserves, the Government introduced an important new incentive package
effective January 1, 1978. Subsequently, major new exploration plans have
been announced by most concession holders. The crude oil production projec-
tion for 1990 in Table 1 is based on the assumption that the level of
exploration will soon return to the 1973/74 level of around 200 new wells
drilled per year and that the success ratio will continue to be around 25%.
1.04      The annual growth of domestic consumption of oil is projected to
decelerate from 12% in 1979 to 8.5% in 1983 on the assumption that domestic
oil prices will be drastically increased over the next several years and that
alternative sources of energy will be developed. If current investment
plans for the expansion of the Badak (KALIMANTAN) and Arun (Sumatra) plants
materialize, LNG and condensate exports are expected to increase rapidly and
this will partly compensate for the slowdown in oil exports. Government has
therefore adopted a policy of developing other indigenous energy sources
such as hydro-electricity, coal, natural gas and geothermal steam, for
internal consumption.  See Annex 1 for details of production, exports,
imports and consumption.
Natural Gas
1.05      Natural gas reserves are about 34 trillion cu ft, of which 5 tril-
lion cu ft represents gas associated with oil production. Current internal
consumption is about 80 billion cu ft per year. Pipelines have recently been
laid to steel and fertilizer factories and consumption is expected to increase
at about 15% per year during the next five years. Following agreement with
/1 Recoverable reserves are variously estimated by the oil industry between
10-15 billion bbl. This is the equivalent of 16-24 years of production at
current levels of output.



- 3 -
Japan a few years ago, exports of natural gas in liquid form (LNG) have begun.
A study of natural gas utilization has been agreed under Credit 451-IND to
determine the potential usage of gas in Indonesia and the resources available.
Coal
1.06      Indonesia's coal reserves are conservatively estimated at 1.2 bil-
lion tons - 86% of which are in Sumatra and the balance in Kalimantan. Some
estimates place the total reserves at 15.0 billion tons. Actual production
was as high as 2.0 million tons per year in 1940, but declined to 140,000
tons in 1973. Rehabilitation measures increased production to 250,000 tons
last year; 150,000 tons came from Bukit Asam and 100,000 tons from Ombilin -
both in Sumatra.
1.07      Government has encouraged private concessionaires to survey
reserves with a view to large scale exportation of coal. A large concession
in South Sumatra has been given up by Shell but other concessions in
Kalimantan are under discussion. Government has decided to encourage the
development of coal for internal consumption wherever technically and
economically feasible. The coal deposits at Bukit Asam with about 100 million
tons of recoverable reserves, are considered the best prospect for near term
development; and as the power sector is the largest market, the coal to be
produced will be substantially used for power generation.
1.08      The Bank made an engineering loan (S-9) in 1978 of US$10.0 million
to finance the consultants' services needed to confirm the economic viability
and determine the features of a coal mining and transportation project at
Bukit Asam. About 3 million tons of coal will be produced annually, most of
which will be required to fuel the first two 400 MW units to be constructed at
Suralaya, the second unit forming part of the proposed project. The first
unit is being financed under Loan 1708-IND made in FY79.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.09      The hydroelectric potential of the country has been theoretically
estimated at about 31,000 MW, distributed as follows: Irian Jaya 9,000 MW,
Kalimantan 7,000 MW, Sumatra 6,750 MW, Sulawesi 5,600 MW and Java 2,500 MW.
Reconnaissance and preliminary studies (mostly the former) have been carried
out for sites where an installed capacity of about 15,000 MW is believed
feasible but little is known about costs of development. Irian Jaya, where
demand is negligible, has the largest potential, and Java, where demand is
large, has the smallest.
1.10      The total installed hydroelectric generating capacity in the
country is 635 MW - of which 433 MW is in Java, 174 MW in Sulawesi, 20 MW
in Kalimantan and 8 MW in Sumatra. Construction of a major hydroelectric
project has recently commenced at Asahan (600 MW) in Sumatra to supply power



to a large aluminum complex which will have a capacity of 225,000 tons of
aluminum per year. About 50 MW will be available for PLN's grid use. The
possibility of increasing Asahan capability by about 300 MW will be studied.
1.11      Two hydroelectric sites, Saguling (700 MW) in West T -ra and Mrica
(180 MW) in Central Java, are being studied by Japanese and Russian consul-
tants respectively. Both projects are included in PLN's development program
and are expected to be completed by 1986/87. A few small hydroelectric
schemes, associated with irrigation projects, are also included in this
program. PLN has responsibility for power sector planning but the financing
of projects and studies is decided by BAPPENAS on the basis of national pri-
orities. PLN has made proposals to BAPPENAS to finance the detailed field
investigation of schemes totalling about 4,000 MW and for reconnaissance of
sites with about 6,000 MW capacity during REPELITA Ill./l BAPPENAS gives
priority to studies of coal, hydro and geothermal schemes that can rapidly
proceed to the implementation stage, consequently some time may elapse before
a comprehensive catalog of available coal, hydro and goethermal sites is
compiled for the country.
Geothermal Resources
1.12      Indonesia has substantial geothermal energy potential and about
900 MW of generating capacity has already been proven. The fields are close
to the main population centers in Java and Sulawesi. A 30 MW plant is being
constructed by PLN at Kamojung in West Java under assistance from the
New Zealand with a total planned capacity of 90 MW; another 90 MW (3 x 30 MW)
at Dieng in Java is also scheduled for construction by PLN.
Nuclear Power
1.13      Studies carried out by the International Atomic Energy Authority
(IAEA) in 1976 concluded that a nuclear power station would be justified in
Java by the mid-eighties. Java system studies which were being carried out at
the same time by Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the UK using updated costs,
indicated that a nuclear plant would not be justified until the mid-nineties.
PCR's conclusion was confirmed by an independent Bank study in 1978, using
updated construction and fuel costs. PLN's long-term plans provide for a
nuclear power station in the mid-nineties. Feasibility studies for the first
nuclear power plant are being conducted with Italian help.
Firewood
1.14      Firewood.  Firewood is the most important source of energy in the
rural areas, but reliable and up-to-date figures on fuelwood and agricul-
tural waste consumption in Indonesia are not readily available. A recent
national survey conducted by the Forestry Products Research Institute
/1 Five-Year Development Plan (FY80-84).



- 5 -
indicated that per capita annual consumption of firewood in rural areas has
increased to 1.7 cu m in 1977 from 0.6 cu m in 1971. The methodology and
findings of this survey are presently being reviewed. Consumption in urban
areas has been estimated at 0.03 cu m, a decrease of 27% in relation to the
consumption of 0.11 cu m per capita in 1971. Another estimate made by FAO,
indicates an annual per capita consumption of 0.85 cu m in 1976, which is
considered a better approximation of consumption when comparisons are made
with other countries.
1.15      Charcoal consumption estimates show a decline from about 650,000
tons in 1968 to about 200,000 tons in 1976. The per capita consumption of
charcoal in urban areas is calculated at 3.9 kg/year, about four times the
per capita consumption in rural areas which is 1.0 kg/year. A major
obstacle in promoting an expansion in the use of charcoal is the subsidized
price of kerosene, which sells at a much lower price relative to the
comparable heat value of these two fuels.1i
Agricultural Wastes and Other Noncommercial Fuels
1.16      A study /2 conducted in 1976 estimated that 17 million tons of
agricultural and forestry wastes are produced annually.  About 33% of this
amount is rice husks (5.7 million tons), 18% is baggasse, 15% is logging
and sawmill wastes, and the balance comes from various other products.
Most of these are not being utilized as energy sources.
1.17      Recognizing the need to develop alternative sources of energy, the
Government has established in 1973 the Development Technology Center (DTC).
Due to a relative lack of funds and of permanent staff DTC's efforts are being
concentrated on some specific issues: rice husk utilization, bio-gas (based
on the global design), solar heaters and crop-driers and the pyrolysis of
rice-husks and sawdust. According to the institute's officials, the main
difficulty will be found at the implementing stage of a developed technology.
The initiative is presently coming entirely from the institute with its small
resources, and therefore, the results can only be limited.
1.18      The Forestry Products Research Institute is also working on some
issues related to the use of noncommercial fuels, such as the improvement
of the efficiency of cooking stoves and the utilization of sawdust and other
wastes.
/1 The charcoal price in 1976 was Rp 1.6 to Rp 4.0 per thousand BTU, compared
with the kerosene price of Rp 0.8/thousand BTU. This comparison takes
into account only the heating value of both fuels. Since the thermal
efficiency of cooking with kerosene is higher than with charcoal, the
comparison is still more favorable for kerosene.

1.19      It would be advisable that the Government give a broader and more
coordinated drive to the efforts of these two institutions in order to assign
priorities, eliminate potential work duplication and, at a later stage, set
up a well-planned program for the diffusion and implementation of the
developed technologies. With a long term, coordinated and adequate approach,
it might be expected that a reasonable part of rural energy needs could be met
by local sources of supply, diminishing to some extent the burden on the
demand for firewood.
Energy Sources
1.20      Consumption of commercial forms of energy in Indonesia grew in the
recent past at about 13.6% p.a., doubling in about five years. For REPELITA
III (FY80-84), growth is projected at 11% p.a., with the share of petroleum
products falling from 90% in 1977 to 79% in 1984. Currently, electricity
provides only 7% of the country's energy, but is projected to grow at an
annual rate of 22% to 11.3% by 1984. Table 1.1 below shows breakdown of
consumption by energy sources:

Organization of the Energy Sector
1.21      In May 1978, the Ministry of Mines and Energy was established as
part of a general reorganization of government departments to coordinate all
activities in the energy sector. The Ministry has overall responsibility for
mining, oil, natural gas and electricity. It controls the state enterprises
responsible for the execution of Government policies in the energy subsectors
- the national oil and gas entity (PERTAMINA), the coal agency (BATUBARA) and
the public power utility (PLN). The Ministry has been recruiting staff over
the past year and developing its organization and policies to fulfill its role
in the energy sector. A comprehensive energy plan does not yet exist (see
para. 1.22) but it is anticipated that such a plan will be developed in the



-7-
course of the next two or three years; information and data arising from
studies of coal and gas pricing, and energy demand will shortly be available
from studies agreed on or under discussion with the Bank and the USAID to
enable such a plan to be prepared. The Ministry's organization chart is shown
in Annex 2.
Energy Policy and Pricing
1.22      A detailed energy policy has not yet been formulated based on
detailed demand projections, examination of resources, costs of alternative
development strategies and pricing. However, in 1977 GOI established an
interdepartmental energy policy and planning committee at the technical
level, including private sector participation. The Chairman and Vice-
Chairman are the Directors-General of Oil and Gas and Power, respectively,
of the Ministry of Mines and Energy. The committee has drafted an energy
conservation plan for GOI's consideration and proposed certain measures on
captive power plants.
1.23      A permanent energy committee was formed several months ago by the
Minister, with the task of assessing energy technologies, dealing with day-
to-day energy problems and preparing long-term projections for demand and
supply. The Minister has also proposed the establishment of a National
Energy Board at ministerial level with the Minister of Mines and Energy
as Chairman. The function of the Board will be to review the proposals of
the technicians committee (para. 1.22), to establish the energy policy of
the Government and to give policy implementation instructions to Ministries.
1.24      Serious subsidy related distortions in the economy and the energy
sector are caused by the underpricing of petroleum products. Budgetary
subsidies on domestic oil consumption are estimated at about US$1.3 billion in
FY81 which are much below the economic subsidy calculated on the basis of
economic opportunity costs./l The budgetary subsidies arise from GOI paying
PERTAMINA the difference between sales revenues from the domestic market and
the cost of crude oil imports, production, freight, refining and petroleum
products sold. PERTAMINA recieves 20% of Indonesian crude oil production at
the oil companies' production cost plus USJ 20 per bbl; part is exported
because of its low sulphur content, part is refined locally; high sulpur crude
is purchased for local refining and some petroleum products are imported.
1.25      Bank staff have been urging GOI to reduce and ultimately to remove
subsidies but doing so would not be without penalties. About US$800 million
out of the total of US$1.3 billion annual budget subsidy, is for kerosene
consumed for lighting and cooking. Apart from some financial hardship that
would be caused by increased kerosene prices to poor people, any move to
/1 The estimated budgetary subsidies assumed that there will be a 40%
increase in the domestic price of petroleum products.



-8-
switch to wood fuel particularly in Java would rapidly denude the high land
forest areas in Java which are already small. Java has the highest density of
population per hectare in the world after Japan (1,000 per hectare). It is
not practicable to treat kerosene subsidies in isolation by removing subsidies
from other petroleum products only, because of kerosene's interchangeability
with other oil products.
1.26      PLN's share in the total oil consumption in Indonesia is only about
6%, consisting mainly of high speed diesel for diesel generating sets and gas
turbines and residual fuel oil in central power plants. The share of residual
fuel which is currently about one-third of PLN's total oil consumption will
increase due to commissioning Muara Karang and Semarang generating stations
in Java. The current structure of domestic prices results in little price
difference between diesel oil and residual fuel oil on an equivalent heat
content basis, and encourages the installation of captive diesel generating
plants by industries. PLN has taken special measures through its tariff and
connection charges to counter the trend and has succeeded (para. 1.32).
However, the distortions in domestic fuel pricing are also translated into
the power tariff structure as industrial tariffs have to be skewed to
maintain competition with captive generation.
1.27      In order to curtail the domestic oil consumption, government is
accelerating the development of other sources of energy, coal being one of the
most important (paras. 1.06-1.08). The coal field at Bukit Asam in South
Sumatra will be developed to a production capacity of 3.0 million tons per
year by FY 1985, primarily to fuel the first coal burning plant of 800 MW
capacity being built by PLN. The cost of the coal is expected to be lower
than the equivalent international price of oil. However, the price to PLN
may not be lower than the equivalent price of oil in the local market, if
the present level of oil subsidy continues. Such an event could encourage
uneconomic investment in captive generating plants using diesel oil, in
competition to supply from PLN.
1.28      Government took a major step towards removing oil subsidies in
April/May 1979 by increasing domestic oil prices (including those charged
the power sector) by an average of 40%. However, the devaluation of the
rupiah in November 1978 and the OPEC price increases have resulted in the
overall level of domestic oil subsidies remaining substantially unchanged.
The impact of the domestic oil subsidies on economic allocation of resources
and the resultant distortion in demand for alternative fuels were discussed
with the Government during the negotiations. Consequently, the following
understandings were agreed with the Government:
(a) Government policy is to ultimately abolish subsidies on domestic
oil consumption depending, primarily on the ability of consumers
to pay. Implications of subsidy removal and the best way of
achieving this objective will be analyzed in the energy pricing
study agreed to be carried out and financed under Loan 1513-IND.



- 9 -
Government will follow a selective and gradual approach in
abolishing the subsidies on domestic oil consumption.
(b) the price of coal from the proposed Bukit Asam Coal Mining and
its associated transport facilities project would be set so as to
achieve a reasonable rate of return on revalued assets, or to
reflect the opportunity cost of the coal. However, in the event
that, by the commissioning date of the Suralaya power station,
domestic oil prices are less than the equivalent level of the
Bukit Asam coal price, any excess in the equivalent price of
coal over that of domestic oil, will be compensated.
The Electricity Sector
Background
1.29      The power sector comprises the Directorate General of Electric Power
(PD) of the Ministry of Mines and Energy, PLN - the national power utility,
some small municipal franchises and captive plants.
Directorate-General of Electric Power - Ministry of Mining and Energy (MOE)
1.30      The PD of the MOE has been responsible for power sector policy
since 1978 (para. 1.21). Until recently it has been involved in establishing
the PD organization and gathering information on the sector. Until the
establishment of the PD, PLN was responsible for giving advice to the
Minister on sector policy, and for planning and licensing. The Bank was
concerned that PD might take over some of PLN's operational responsibilities
causing PLN to revert to the Government departmental status that existed prior
to 1972, thereby, losing its autonomy. Legislation has now been enacted
that clarifies PD's responsibilities which are in policy planning and
direction, franchise licensing and general policy supervision of the power
sector. The act provides for private and cooperative franchise partici-
pation in the sector but it states that such franchises will only be
licensed in areas where PLN is-unable to provide supply in a reasonable
period of time. The act also provides for licensing cooperatives for
the distribution of electricity with bulk purchase from PLN and permits the
establishment of private franchises for generation to sell in bulk to PLN
which will continue to be the only public sector utility in the country. No
problems have yet arisen in the delineation of MOE and PLN responsibilities.
The Bank staff will monitor the situation to ensure that the existing
autonomy of PLN is maintained.
Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (PLN)
1.31      PLN, the beneficiary of the proposed loan, is the national power
utility in Indonesia primarily responsible for all generation, transmission
and distribution in the country. It was first formed in 1961 but only began



- 10 -
to grow into a national entity when it received a new charter in 1972. PLN
had about 1.8 million consumers at the end of FY79 and generated about
two-thirds of the electricity in the country for that year (see
Section 2- The Beneficiary).
Captive Plant /1
1.32      Until about 1972 when PLN received its new charter, the power
sector was uneven in performance, lacking in coordination and financial
strength. Power demand was not met with any reliability and installations
were small and dispersed. Captive plants grew rapidly to fill the vacuum
and the current aggregate installed capacity of such plants is 1,700 MW
compared to the 2,200 MW of PLN. Since 1976, public power supplies have
progressively become more available, particularly in Java where the sector
development effort has been concentrated. Growth of captive plants fell
from about 15% p.a. in the mid-1970s to about 5% in FY77 and FY78 (see
Annex 3 for details). Captive plants will continue to be installed as the
degree of PLN's development, even in Java, is not yet at a stage to meet all
demands at all locations in a timely manner. PLN's energy sales are
projected to grow at 21% p.a., compared to captive plant growth at 5% p.a.,
based on current trends. Consequently, PLN's share of the market will
progressively improve. If the current trend continues the captive generating
capacity will constitute only 25% of the total by 1986-87.
Rural Electrification (RE)
1.33      Rural electrification is being undertaken by PLN with consultancy
assistance from among others, NRECA, financed by USAID, which has also
provided a loan for seven project areas (US$20 million). Financial
assistance in the form of a loan has also been committed by Holland,
Fl 15.5 million (US$7.7 million) and as a grant by Finland, FM 0.48 million
(US$0.12 million).
1.34      Rural electrification as defined in Indonesia, covers all towns and
villages in the country except provincial capitals and second level
provincial towns. PLN plans to electrify during Repelita III (end FY84),
about 3,700 of the 64,000 villages that exist in Indonesia; currently 1,081
villages are included in committed projects covering about 298,000
consumers. Indonesia does not yet have a plan or time scale in which all
villages in the country will have access to electricity, but those villages
and areas in which electricity would have the greatest economic impact are
given priority. Some time must elapse before a national RE plan is feasible;
currently only 6% of the total population has electricity and a sector base
to support RE is required before the program is embarked on nationally.

Tariff Structure
1.35      PLN's tariff schedule is based on a 1972 study carried out by
SOFRELEC using estimated short-run marginal costs. It was introduced by
Government decree in June 1973. Subsequently, surcharges were introduced
which increased the average level by about 200% but for administrative reasons
the surcharges were applied only to the energy (kWh) charges and not to the
demand (kW) thereby distorting the tariff structure by overcharging for
energy and undercharging for demand.
1.36      During negotiations for Loan 1513-IND (Seventh Power Project),
agreement was reached that PLN would design a new tariff structure which would
become effective not later than April 1, 1979 and that the Bank would assist
PLN in this regard. The date was postponed to April 1, 1980 by agreement
during negotiations of Loan 1708-IND (Eighth Power Project). The studies have
now been completed. A covenant in the project agreement for the Eighth Power
Project (Loan 1708-IND) requires that the new tariff structure will reflect
long run marginal costs (LRMC) to the Indonesian economy of meeting the demand
for electricity as closely as possible. However, distortions in the price of
diesel and fuel oil and the need for social tariffs preclude strict applica-
tion of LRMC differentials among all consumer categories (see para. 1.27).
The new tariff structure would be implemented at the same time as an increase
in tariff levels of 38%.
1.37      Tariff structures require review frequently to reflect the chang-
ing costs occasioned by changes in the policies, the development programs
and the demand forecasts on which the costs are based. In order to maximize
the assistance already given to PLN by Bank staff, the Bank will continue
its dialogue on tariffs with Government and PLN and provide assistance as
required.
2. THE BENEFICIARY
Background
2.01      The beneficiary would be PLN, the Government-owned national power
utility, primarily responsible for the supply of electricity in Indonesia
from generation to the retail level. PLN's history goes back to 1961 when
three Dutch-owned power utilities in Java were nationalized by Government.
Effective growth began in 1972 when Government decided to remedy past
neglect in power sector investment and provide PLN with the statutory
authority to develop the power sector in a planned, coherent and efficient
manner. The current charter is Presidential Decree No. 18 of 1972 which was
aimed at changing the status of PLN from a department of the then Ministry
of Public Works and Electric Power, to an autonomous entity. The standard
of service of the public electricity supply changed and remarkable progress
ensued. PLN grew in stature and greatly improved its public image; it now



- 12 -
promises to become an effective agency, developing into a strong service-
oriented public utility.
Legal Status and Responsibilities
2.02      PLN is an autonomous public enterprise (Perum) and carries out its
objectives within the national development program in accordance with Govern-
ment policies. In practice, the Minister for Mining and Energy determines
policy and exercises overall control of its activities. He is assisted in
making decisions on policy matters by an advisory board consisting of the
Ministers of Finance, Industry, the Chairman of the National Planning Agency
(BAPPENAS) and by his Director General of Power.
2.03      PLN is statutorily responsible for the construction and operation
of power facilities throughout the country, preparing power development plans,
conducting research activities in the field of electric power and entering
into contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity. PLN's investment
plans and tariffs are subject to Government approval as are bid evaluations
and contract awards.
Organization
2.04      PLN is organized and functions as a modern public utility.  The
board is statutorily bound to have a President Director and at least two
other directors. Government has agreed with the Bank that it will ensure
that the position of President Director of PLN is filled by someone with
adequate qualifications and experience. Currently, the board comprises the
President Director and five others; all are executive directors and each heads
a department in the head office - planning, operations, construction, finance
and administration. In the field, there are 15 regional (wilayah) offices
with a total of about 100 branches. Regions are responsible for minor, and
the construction department is responsible for major construction. PLN's
organization chart is shown in Annex 4.
Management
2.05      PLN continues to develop into a well organized power utility pro-
gressively improving its procedures and operations. Planning in Java is now
well established for generation. Transmission and distribution planning in
Java and overall planning outside Java, are also being improved; results
should become apparent during the next few years. In view of the size of the
country and the utility, the Wilayahs (regions) should have greater involve-
ment in long-term planning and responsibility for the achievement of PLN's
operational goals but the process will take time.  PLN has initiated steps to
train regional staff in overall planning and financial management which when
completed, will enable the regions to prepare long-term plans and financial
forecasts and be responsible as entrepreneurial managers, for the operational
performance of their regions and branches.



- 13 -
Manpower and Training
2.06      PLN now has a total of about 29,000 staff of which about 19,000 are
on the permanent payroll; 1,200 (4.2%) are university and college graduates;
6,300 (22%) are high school graduates. A steady improvement in the proportion
of graduate and high school staff has occurred in recent years. Difficulty is
encountered in obtaining technical manpower in sufficient numbers; PLN
sponsors 30-40 scholarships annually at technical universities and 70-80
university graduates and 40/50 college graduates are recruited each year, to
overcome the problem.
2.07      Six training schools are run by PLN throughout the country to pro-
vide vocational courses for the staff; about 1,100 attend the various courses
each year. Staff members are sent abroad for advanced and other training not
available in Indonesia. Project oriented training, particularly in foreign
financed projects, is also provided. Numbers trained and the courses given
are not yet geared to provide adequate staff of all the categories required by
comprehensive manpower planning but PLN will move closer to this goal in
conjunction with the overall development of regional planning during the next
two years.
2.08      PLN does not have adequate training facilities for the operation and
maintenance staff for steam power stations. About 40 people have been trained
in the USA with the assistance of Black and Veatch International (BVI), the
Project Consultants for the Muara Karang steam station. A similar training
program is also being arranged for the operation and maintenance staff for
Suralaya and the EHV projects. As a long-term policy it is necessary to set
up a thermal station training school with more sophisticated facilities such
as a training simulator. Provision is being made in the proposed project for
such a training center (para. 3.21).
Research
2.09      PLN has established a power research institute which includes a high
voltage testing laboratory. The institute, which conducts applied research in
power associated areas, has a staff of 278, including 87 graduates.
Accounting and Audit
2.10      Accounting is based on a system introduced by consultants (SOFRELEC)
in the early 1970s and is generally well operated. Because of the relatively
short period of operating experience, certain areas (asset and inventory
accounting) still require improvement. The system is based on two sets of
books - operations and construction, with separate annual accounts being made
up for each and then consolidated at head office.
2.11      The Directorate General of State Financial Supervision has been
accepted by the Bank as PLN's auditors. PLN has also employed S.A Parman



- 14 -
(the Indonesian associates of Cooper's and Lybrand, Australian International
Accountants) on a one time basis to carry out an audit for FY79 so that PLN
and the Bank could benefit from the views of a private auditor. Audit
reports produced by the Directorate have been accepted by the Bank in the
past.
Insurance
2.12      PLN takes out insurance only for assets and hazards such as motor
vehicles, that it is statutorily obliged to cover and for transit and marine
insurance on equipment and materials being transported. Fire and other
hazards are self insured. In view of the geographical spread of PLN's assets
any loss would be insignificant compared to overall assets and operations;
this procedure is therefore considered satisfactory.
Present Facilities
2.13      Until the early seventies, PLN's expansion was severely restricted
because of the lack of foreign exchange in the country. A crash program was
undertaken at that time which resulted in gas turbines being installed,
currently about 34% of the total capacity. PLN suffered major breakdowns
in generating plant and gas turbines were seen as the only means of pro-
viding generating plant quickly. Installed capacity at end FY79 is shown
below:
Type of plant                 MW         _
Hydro                          471      21.3
Steam                         550       24.9
Gas turbines                   749      33.9
Diesel                         439      19.9
Total               2,209      100.0
2.14      The imbalance in plant will be corrected with the commissioning of
1,000 MW of new steam capacity L by 1982 and PLN's planning is now based on
the least cost program of system development for Java and similar programs are
being developed for the grids located in the other islands.
2.15      PLN operates about 3,800 km of transmission lines at 70 and 150 kV
and 40,000 km of distribution lines, the bulk of which are in Java.  About
2,000 km of 150 kV transmission under construction, are scheduled for
completion by 1982. Java will have a fully interconnected grid at 150 kV by
1981 and a 500 kV system is also proposed (see para. 3.17); demand in the
other islands is not yet sufficient to justify island wide grids and some time
must elapse before such grids are feasible.

Performance Under Earlier Bank Operations
2.16      The Bank has provided US$636 million for power generation/distribu-
tion facilities around Jakarta and in West and Central Java. Three distribu-
tion projects (Credits 165 and 334, and Loan 1259-IND) for the rehabilitation
and expansion of the distribution facilities in the greater Jakarta area and
five power generation projects (Credit 399, and Loans 1127-IND, 1365-IND,
1513-IND and 1708-IND) for West Java and Central Java were undertaken to help
PLN expand the Java network. Past loans and credits also provided funds for
various consulting services such as the large management consulting effort of
SOFRELEC, the Java System Development Study undertaken by PCR, and feasibility
studies of thermal, hydroelectric, transmission and distribution projects.
2.17      PLN's performance in implementing these projects has been uneven but
is now improving. The earlier distribution projects (Credits 165 and 334-IND)
were completed about two years behind schedule. A completion report on these
two projects was issued in November 1979. Construction of the first three 100
MW units at the Muara Karang thermal station (Credit 399 and Loan 1127-IND)
has fallen behind schedule by about two years. Cost overruns resulting from
OPEC oil price increases and the consequent time consuming problems in raising
the necessary additional funds, a prerequisite for PLN to be able to award the
affected supply contracts, were the main reasons for the delays in the first
two units. The first and second generating units were commissioned in
January/March 1979. The third unit was commissioned in August of 1979.
Construction of the fourth and fifth units is 3/4 months behind schedule.
Loan 1708-IND for Suralaya phase one became effective in November 1979.
Tenders for major equipment were issued in April 1979.
3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Power Market
3.01      Several attempts have been made in recent years to prepare a
usable demand forecast for Indonesia. This has been difficult because of
low consumption levels and the background of public power supply which
covered a fraction of the total market. Furthermore, the severe restrictions
on PLN's ability to provide supply, including financial, management and
technical constraints, made PLN's past record of sales an unreliable base
for future projections. In 1973, a consultant, Chas. T. Main of the USA,
applied an indirect method of using growth probabilities in selected
sensitive economic sectors and their probable impact on other sectors. A
more direct detailed assessment of the underlying demand in Java was made
during 1974-76 by PCR of the UK as a part of the Bank-financed comprehensive
Java System Development Study (Credit 399-IND). This study quantified the
effects of restrictions on supply during peak hours, low voltage, self-
generation and PLN's waiting lists. There have been no similar comprehen-
sive demand surveys for the other islands.



- 16 -
3.02      Realizing that PLN's sales would not immediately rise to the
levels of the underlying demand estimated by PCR in Java and that a certain
portion of this market will continue to be met by captive installations for
some time, PCR also determined what it considered realistic targets of sales
on which PLN could base its future development program. These are substan-
tially lower than the underlying high market forecast, but of the same order
of magnitude as independent macro estimates which used per capita GNP
projections./1 These studies show that PLN's future sales, in the short
and medium term, will depend entirely on the rate at which PLN is capable of
satisfying an increasing proportion of the existing demand, whereas in the
long term, sales are expected to reflect more closely the growth of the
power market based on the overall level of economic development.
3.03      In 1976, PLN and the Bank accepted the PCR low forecast as a
reasonable basis for planning PLN's long-term development program. Based on
this, a comprehensive, optimized program of generation and transmission
expansion was prepared by PCR. It was felt, however, that this program should
be jointly reviewed by PLN and the Bank and modified annually to ensure that
in the short- and medum-term, it is consistent with PLN's actual development
of generation, transmission and distribution facilities, and with the growth
of sales. The latest such forecast of PLN's sales is indicated in Annex 5.
It is about 15% lower than PCR's low forecast for 1985, but catches up with it
by about 1990. Accordingly, the average growth rate between FY79-85 is
expected to be about 21% per year while PLN increases its share of the total
market from about 60% in FY79 to about 80% in FY85; thereafter growth is
expected to gradually decline to about 15% per year. During FY79 PLN's sales
in Java increased by about 22% over the preceding year, which is in line with
the forecasts.
Load Growth and Consumer Connection Program
3.04      PLN has recently developed and is now actively implementing a
connection program consistent with its improved capability as would be seen
from the results given in Table 3.1 below. Figures in parenthesis indicate
growth over the previous year.

3.05      PLN exceeded the consumer connection program target in FY78 and
FY79. The acceleration in the consumer connection program has been
reflected in the sales of FY78-79; sales in FY80 are expected to increase by
24% over FY79.
Access to Electricity
3.06      The per capita consumption of electricity in Indonesia is still
extremely low at about 45 kWh (FY78) compared to 570 kWh in Malaysia, 250 kWh
in the Philippines and 250 kWh in Thailand.  Indonesia's population has low
access to electricity; only about 6% of the households are connected. The
degree of electrification in different regions varies, being about 9.6% in
Java, 4.3% in Sumatra, 5.0% in Kalimantan, 4.2% in Sulawesi, 4.6% in West
Irian, and 2 to 3% in Other Islands.
Development Program
3.07      PLN follows the practice of preparing a long-range development
plan covering a time span of ten years embracing the projected requirements of
generation, transmission, distribution and other facilities. The latest
plan finalized in July 1978, covered the development period FY78 to FY87.
Investment requirements based on this plan were revised in 1979 to include
the effect of devaluation in November 1978. A time slice of the program for
the period FY80-84 has been incorporated in the country's Third Five-Year
Development Plan (Repelita III). In the past, least cost investment
programs for generation, transmission and distribution were planned with the
help of the consultants. PLN has recently developed in-house capability for
carrying out least cost generation planning studies with computer modelling
(WASP program) which is utilized for review and updating the generation plan
in Java.

3.08      Java accounts for 63% of the population of the country (85 million
out of 135 million) and 80% of electricity sales of PLN in FY79 (3,459 GWh
out of 4,287 GWh). Of the total installed generating capacity of 2,209 MW
in the country, 1,547 MW (70%) was in Java. In FY87, the proposed installed
capacity in Java would be 4,609 14W (62.7%) against the total of 7,349 MW and
the sales of electricity would be 16,157 GWh, about 82% out of the total
projected sales of 19,740 GWh; Java continues to be the centerpiece of the
power development plan of Indonesia.
3.09      Detailed engineering studies have been carried out to devise the
optimal development strategy for the power system in Java and the least cost
path has been identified. The plan has been formulated to achieve the
following objectives: (a) optimize resource utilization by substituting use
of oil by coal, hydro and geothermal resources for power generation and by
reducing the use of fuel inefficient installations; (b) realize economies of
scale by larger sized installations; (c) achieve operational economy by
coordinating the utilization of plants through interconnected operations;
and (d) provide acceptable standards of reliability of supply. The develop-
ment plan for areas outside Java requires further review as except in a few
areas (Sulawesi and Bali) the demand forecasts are not based on detailed
surveys and generation planning is not oriented to utilize indigenous energy
resources optimally.  Outside Java there appears to be an excessive reliance
on diesel installations, and plant utilization targets are low. PLN has
commenced a review of the investment plan outside Java to incorporate
realistic load forecasts, introduce resource orientation and improve
capacity utilization.
Overview of the Plan
3.10     The energy sales forecasts and the generating capacity requirements
are summarized in the following tables:

Project Description
3.14      The project comprises (a) the installation of the second 400 MW
generating set (Unit No.2) at Suralaya in West Java and coal handling and ash
disposal facilities for both units, (b) construction of the 500 kV transmis-
sion network from Suralaya to Semarang in Central Java with 500 kV substations
at Suralaya, Jakarta, Bandung and Semarang, (c) provision of a simulator for
the training of operating staff, (d) establishment of a Java integrated con-
trol center at Jakarta, and (e) consulting services and training. It repre-
sents the second phase of the first stage of the Suralaya power scheme planned
to utilize a coal production of about 2.5 million tons p.a. from Bukit Asam in
Sumatra; the first phase was covered by Loan 1708-IND of 1979.
Suralaya Power Plant
3.15      The Suralaya power plant will ultimately have an installed capacity
of 3,100 MW consisting of four generating sets of 400 MW and three sets of 500
MW, using coal as fuel. The scheme was identified by the comprehensive Java
development study financed through Credit 399-IND and carried out by PCR of
UK. The site was chosen by PLN and fully investigated and confirmed by the
consultants, MONENCO of Canada, as part of the project feasibility study
financed by Loan 1127-IND.
3.16      The first stage of development consists of the installation of
two 400 MW dual fired (coal and oil) thermal generating sets, facilities for
coal and oil reception, handling and storage, ash disposal, cooling seawater
intake and discharge facilities, fresh water supply and associated works.
The implementation of the first phase, consisting of the first unit and
infrastructure such as site development, access roads, housing colony,
construction facilities, has already commenced. The second phase now
proposed includes construction of the second 400 MWl unit, as well as the
complete coal handling and ash disposal equipment for both generating sets.
The basic cost of the Unit No. 2 extension is $215.9 million ($540 per kW)
and the total cost including contingencies is $281.8 million ($702 per kW),
including the foreign exchange cost of $205.8 million. The cost estimate
for Suralaya first stage development is given in Annex 7 and that for the
Unit No. 2 extension (Phase II) is given in Annex 8.
Associated EHV Transmission
3.17      At present three major regional power systems exist in Java, serving
the Western, Central and Eastern regions. They are proposed to be inter-
connected by the 150 kV transmission network by 1981 to provide limited power
transfer capability. The 150 kV system would be inadequate to integrate
large sized power stations now being implemented, including Suralaya. MM of
the U.K. were commissioned to carry out detailed studies to establish the
concept, select the voltage and recommend the configuration of an Extra High
Voltage (EHV) network for phased development through FY95. Funds were



- 21 -
provided under Loan 1365-IND for this purpose. An interim report was
submitted in April 1979 and the final report in August 1979. The main
conclusions of the study are that (a) the EHV network to Bandung should be
commissioned at the same time as Suralaya Unit No. 1, in January 1984, (b)
the voltage of the grid should be 500 kV and (c) the EHV network should
extend to Semarang in Central Java. Without the EHV network the Suralaya
power cannot be utilized, hence the timely completion of the EHV project is
critical.
3.18      The scope of the EHV network envisaged in the first stage is as
follows (see map attached):

Semarang (Ungaran)                               250  MVA
3.19      The total cost of the first stage /1 including the control center
(para. 3.20) is estimated to be US$419.0 million, of which the foreign
exchange requirement would be US$239.0 million. The detailed cost estimate
is given in Annex 9.
Control Center
3.20      It is proposed to establish a Java control center located in
Jakarta to permit integrated operation of the Java grid. The center will be
provided with communications, mimic displays, and an on-line data acquisition
system to monitor and control operation of power plants and the EHV network.
The center will monitor and coordinate the operation of all major generating
facilities and EHV in the West, Central and East Java regions to achieve
/1 Subsequent stages will extend the EHV network to Surabaya in East Java.



- 22 -
significant reduction in operating costs and improvement in the reliability
of supply. PLN is already implementing the establishment of regional control
centers with French assistance - one each for the West, Central and East Java
systems.  The basic cost of the control center is estimated at US$12.8
million with a foreign exchange component of US$11.6 million.
Training Simulator
3.21      As a part of the Suralaya project, it is proposed to acquire a trai-
ning simulator with which thermal plant operators can be trained.  This
simulator will duplicate the control panels and operating characteristics of
the Suralaya units by computer. The training panels would appear and
respond in a manner identical to the control panels in the Suralaya Thermal
Station. Attempts will be made to commission the simulator prior to the
commissioning of Unit No. 1 at Suralaya. A provision of $4.7 million has
been made in the cost estimate for Suralaya Unit No. 2. The facility is
considered extremely important to train the operating staff for Suralaya and
other thermal power plants in Indonesia where it is difficult to obtain
trained personnel.
Cost Estimates
3.22      A summary of the project cost is given in Table 3.5  (details in

- 23 -
3.23      The cost estimate for the Suralaya project was prepared for PLN by
MONENCO - the consultant appointed in October 1978 for detailed engineering
and supervision of construction. It is based on (a) price quotations obtained
by MONENCO from a number of likely suppliers and (b) experience on similar
projects in I-'onesia and elsewhere. The estimate has been prepared on the
basis of contracts for goods and works with a detailed breakdown into
quantities and unit rates where applicable. Base prices are at end 1979
levels and are net of customs duties. Physical contingencies are provided
at 10% on civil works and about 3.5% on equipment, which are adequate. Price
contingencies are calculated (a) for foreign exchange costs at 10% for 1979,
9% for 1980, 8% for 1981 and at 7% p.a. thereafter, and (b) for local costs at
25% in 1979, 15% in 1980 and 1981 and 10% p.a. thereafter.
3.24      The cost estimate for the EHV system was prepared for PLN by MM.
It is based on prevailing international prices for equipment and the con-
sultants' experience with similar projects elsewhere. The estimate pro-
vides 7.5% for physical contingencies and for price contingencies on the same
basis as that given in para. 3.23.

Loan Amount
3.26      The proposed loan of US$253 million will be used to finance the
foreign exchange costs of the following:
(a) Suralaya Unit No. 2 - (i) Steam Generator & Auxiliairies
(ii) Turbine Generator & Auxiliairies
(iii) Coal Handling Equipment
(iv) Simulator
(b) 500 KV Transmission Line Sections
(i) Bandung-Cirebon
(ii) Cirebon-Semarang
(c) Java System Control Center
(d) Consulting Services and Training
The 500 kV transmission lines from Suralaya to Jakarta and Bandung and the
four 500 kV substations will be financed by ADB and Government funds.
Procurement
3.27      Procurement of equipment to be financed under the loan would be
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with the
Bank guidelines. Indonesian equipment manufacturers are unlikely to be able
to participate, but if they tender for some items, a 15% margin of preference
on the cif bid price, or the prevailing duties, if lower, will be applicable
for purposes of bid evaluation. Procurement of equipment for the transmission
lines and substations financed by ADB will follow their guidelines. No
contracts will be awarded before Board approval of the proposed loan.
Disbursement
3.28      The Bank loan will be disbursed against the following items:
(a) equipment - 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported
goods, 95% /1 of the ex-factory cost for locally manufactured
goods and 65% of the total expenditures for imported goods
procured locally; and
(b)  consultants' services and training - 100% of foreign
expenditures.
No disbursements will be made for expenditures prior to loan signing. The
estimated schedule of disbursement is given in Annex 10.
/1 All percentages represent prices net of taxes.

Implementation, Engineering and Construction
3.29      PLN is responsible for implementing the project and has appointed
project managers for each of the Suralaya and EHV projects. Their Director
(Planning) has overall responsibility for the implementation of S-!ralaya and
the associated transmission project in the head office. He will parti-
cularly coordinate and secure action on financing, progress of engineering
and procurement.
3.30      MONENCO are responsible for engineering, design and construc-
tion supervision of the Suralaya power station. MONENCO was selected by PLN
in consultation with the Bank. The contract was signed in October 1978 and
the first phase of work - preparation of designs, bidding documents and
assistance to PLN in evaluating bids - is now in progress. Bids for the main
equipment which were issued in April 1979, were received in September 1979. A
letter of intent for the Turbine Generator Contract was issued in January
1980; that for the Steam Generator is scheduled in March 1980.
3.31      Land required for the Suralaya project was acquired in 1978 and
the resettlement of displaced people has been completed; construction of the
preliminary civil works is in progress. A detailed program of construction
has been prepared on the basis that the work would be divided into 15 main
contracts. The implementation program is summarized in Annex 11.
3.32      The cost of engineering services for Suralaya including design,
procurement, construction supervision, commissioning and initial operation
of the plant is expected to be about US$18.5 million, for a total input of
about 3,150 man-months over the period FY79-85, consisting of 2,540
expatraite man-months and 610 man months of local technicians and supporting
staff. The average man-month cost is $5,580 (including salaries, costs,
fees, international and local travel and subsistence); the average expatriate
man-month cost is $6,500 and the local man-month cost is $3,400. The man-
month rates are subject to escalation to compensate for inflation, based on
indices specified in the contract. In addition, the consultants will also
organize the training of PLN staff in design, construction, operation and
maintenance of thermal power plants. The cost of this training is estimated
to be US$380,000.
3.33      The design and construction supervision for the 500 kV lines and
substations will be carried out by MM. Although the contract for the first
phase of the work of feasibility and engineering was signed in February
1979, MM had commenced work from October 1978; their interim feasibility
report was submitted in April 1979. Detailed engineering was completed
in January 1980; and bid documents are due to be issued in April 1980.
3.34      The consulting engineering contract with MM (para 3.33) has been
extended to include aerial survey, detailed design, specifications, procure-
ment, construction supervision, testing and commissioning of lines at an



- 26 -
estimated cost of US$5 million. They will provide a total of about 1,300
man-months up to 1984, consisting of about 500 expatriate man-months and
800 man-months of local technicians and support staff (from a local consulting
company, ENCONA), particularly for survey and construction supervision. The
average man-month cost is $3,800 (including salary, costs, fees, international
travel and subsistence); the average local man-month cost is about $1,000 and
the average expatraite man-month cost is $8,400. The man-month rates are
subject to escalation to compensate for inflation, based on indices specified
in the contract. In addition, the consultants will also organize the training
of PLN staff in design, construction, operation and maintenance of EHV lines.
The cost of training is estimated to be US$1.5 million; detailed proposals are
being worked out.
3.35      The implementation schedule for the 500 kV lines and substations
is given in Annex 12. It is expected that the contract award for the trans-
mission line construction will take place by December 1980, allowing three
years to complete construction. To achieve this tight schedule, alert
project management will be necessary, including avoidance of procedural
delays in government approvals (paras. 3.36 and 3.37).
Contract Approval
3.36      Approval of contracts and the issue of the relevant letters of
credit have taken a long time on several critical occasions in the past. Even
after approval, several months elapsed before letters of credit are issued.
Bank review of these problems was held in Jakarta in June 1979. Simplifica-
tion in the procedures has been introduced by a decree of the Minister of
Finance in September 1979 on which actual experience is still to be gained.
There may be stil scope for further improvements and the issue will continue
to be monitored.
3.37      Presidential Decree No. 14 of March 1979 introduced a new procedure
for the award of local contracts by all government agencies. In the case of
PLN, all contracts exceeding Rp 100 million (US$160,000) are approved by the
Director General Power of the Ministry of Mines and Energy and those exceeding
Rp 500 million (US$800,000) are approved by the Minister. The decree makes it
mandatory for PLN to complete tender evaluation and recommendations within two
weeks from bid opening, otherwise rebidding is required. No time limit is set
for the approval procedure. The decree restricts the freedom earlier enjoyed
by PLN to finalize local contracts without reference to the Government. The
matter was discussed with PLN and the Government officials at negotiations
who have indicated that they intend to ensure that the operation of the decree
does not cause delays in project implementation. The Ministry will make
efforts to ensure that rebidding is not required in cases when evaluation
cannot be completed in the stipulated time. Also the time for the approval
procedure will normally be kept within two weeks. This issue will be
monitored and, if necessary, pursued with the Government during the Bank
review of the implementation problems.

Land Acquisition for EHV
3.38      Acquisition of land for the construction of transmission lines in
Indonesia takes long periods of time and construction cannot begin until
compensation i ,ues are settled. Construction of over 600 km of 500 kV lines
cannot be completed in three years (para. 3.35) unless the land rights are
acquired with greater speed than in the past. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that Government and PLN will take all steps necessary to
complete land acquisition by March 1981. A high level committee under the
Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Administrative Reforms and the
Deputy Chairman of BAPPENAS has been appointed by the Government to coordinate
the land acquisition problems in various projects.
Ecology
3.39      Environmental considerations have been carefully considered by
MONENCO and PLN in choosing the Suralaya site for the first power station in
Java which will utilize coal. The site is located in a remote corner of the
West Java coast, the nearest settled area being a small town (MERAK), some 10
km away. The station location and design features to deal with stack emission
and ash disposal, reduce the environmental impact to a minimum. Indonesia has
not laid down environmental standards but PLN is following United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standards for the design of this
thermal power station. The stack (200 m high) has been designed to keep
emissions within these limits when the power station operates on Indonesian
coal which has a low sulphur content (0.5%). Ash from the station will be
conveyed to an adjoining dump area, where the natural configuration permits
good drainage. There will be no detrimental effect on the local ecological
system.
3.40      The construction of the 500 kV lines and substations would also be
carried out with due consideration for the ecological factors. The route will
be selected to cause minimum dislocation to existing developments. Also
substation sites have been located outside populated areas, particularly near
Jakarta and Bandung. Internationally accepted safety practices will be used
in the design and construction of the lines. No serious ecological problems
are expected in the transmission line construction.
4. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Performance
4.01      PLN's energy sales rose from 1,893 GWh in 1972 /1 to 4,287 GWh for
FY79 about 15% p.a. growth on average. Over the same period revenues rose
from Rp 20 billion (US$32 million)/2 to Rp 118 billion (US$189 million), an
/1 Fiscal year-end changed from December 31, to March 31 in FY75.
/2 At post devaluation (November 1978) exchange rate of Rp 625 = US$1.00.

annual growth rate of 35%; the average tariff per kWh sold increased from
Rp 8.98 (USo1.4) in FY72 to Rp 27.4 (US4.4) in FY79 (a total of 205%).
During the six years from 1972, operating costs rose from Rp 26 billion (US$42
million) to Rp 114 billion (US$182 million), or at an average annual rate of
28%. Operating income was negative until FY77 when the financial recovery
plan that had been agreed with the Bank in the early 1970s, that revenues
should cover costs for FY79, was fulfilled.
4.02      It was agreed under Loan 1708-IND that for the three year period
ending FY86 and each year thereafter, PLN would produce funds from internal
sources equivalent to not less than 30% of the capital expenditures over the
same period. During the period before FY86 PLN is expected to exert its best
endeavors inter alia by reducing system losses, operating expenditures and
increasing tariff levels (see para. 4.03), to reach interim targets which are
the subject of an understanding between Government and the Bank after review
of progress during the processing of each power project. The target agreed
for Loan 1708-IND for the periods ending in FY80 and FY81 is 12%. This figure
was in fact reached for the three-year period which ended in FY79 when a 21%
contribution to construction was achieved. The targets are expected to be met
for FY80 and 81. PLN's financial position was sound at end FY79, the current
ratio was 4.1 and the debt/equity ratio was 7/93. A summary of the FY79
balance sheet is given below:

4.03      The efficiency of PLN's operations requires further improvement.
System losses averaged about 23% for the whole of Indonesia for FY79, down
from 24% for FY78, varying from about 18% for Jakarta to about 30% in some
areas. The high system losses arise from distribution systems that still
require rehabilitation, inadequate metering and billing systems and theft
also plays a role. PLN's management is aware of all these problems and is
actively addressing them. A targeted loss reduction program is in operation
and steps are being taken to reduce theft. PLN has also instituted training
programs for regional staff to put them in a position to prepare and
supervise plans to improve the operational efficiency of their regions.
Under these plans the regions will forecast GWh sales and revenues,
operating costs and the rehabilitation investments necessary to improve the
earning power of the assets used for operations. These plans are expected
to culminate by FY82 in fixing performance targets for each region. The
two-year preparation period is required in view of the need for training,
the placing of the required staff and the computer hardware and software
that may be required; future Bank operations should include funds to help
provide the equipment and materials PLN will require to implement these
measures.
4.04      GOI has provided PLN with the funds required to finance the foreign
and local cost of projects that have their foreign costs financed from abroad,
mainly in the form of equity./l Funds for expenditures that do not enjoy
assistance from abroad are funded from PLN's internal cash generation, a
system that tends to unbalance the development program. GOI policy is to
raise the foreign funds for state enterprise projects and onlend or pass
these funds as equity, bearing any exchange risk involved. Local funds are
also provided as equity. PLN's future funds have been assumed to be provided
from GOI as 50% borrowing and 50% equity for foreign costs except for projects
financed from sources such as IBRD and ADB that require the loans passed to
PLN to be on the same terms and conditions as received by Government; and 100%
equity for local costs, for planned projects as described above; distribution,
administration and other nonproject expenditures are assumed to come from
PLN's internal sources.
4.05      Funds required for capital expenditure projects that are not
financed under the 'DIP" method (about 25% of total capital expenditures for
FY79 - Rp 73 billion or US$117 million) and for increases in working
capital, are found from PLN's internal cash generation.  Availability of
adequate internal cash generation is subject to the timing and size of
increases in tariff levels and to assure that funds available are adequate,
PLN tends to be conservative in both financial planning and the magnitude of
requested tariff increases. When such endeavors fail, PLN is forced to cut
distribution capital expenditures, and cannot pursue a development program
that balances the provision of generation, transmission and distribution
facilities. PLN may be short of funds over the next few years based on the
current financial forecasts. During negotiations Government stated that
/1 Commonly called the 'DIP" method.



- 30 -
"DIP" would be increased to cover any funds shortages that might arise in
future.
4.06      Historical income statements, funds flow statements and balance
sheets are shown in Annex 13, financial forecasts in Annex 14 and the assump-
tions incorporated in them in Annex 15.
Future Position
4.07      The additional generation, transmission and distribution capacity
that PLN expects to provide through FY87 will cause the asset base to expand
11 times at constant prices over the next nine years.  Expenditures at current
prices required to meet the construction program are estimated at Rp 9,845
billion (US$15.7 billion) including interest during construction. GOI plans
to borrow about Rp 5,823 billion (US$9.3 billion) or 59% overseas to cover
foreign costs; Rp 2,697 billion (US$4.3 billion), about 27%, would come from
PLN's internal cash generation; and the balance of Rp 1,325 billion (US$2.1
billion), about 14%, would come from GOI's internal sources. The above
assumes that tariffs would be so fixed and other necessary steps taken, to
self-finance, on average 30% for FY86 and thereafter, of the average of the
test year and the preceeding two years' construction expenditures, with
interim targets based on the current review (see para. 4.02) of 12% for the
three year periods ending in FY80 through 82, 20% for the three year periods
ending in FY83 and 84, and 25% for the three year period ending in FY85.
PLN's financing plan, based on these assumptions and GOI/PLN financing
described in para. 4.04 is as follows:

4.08      Currently, PLN's earnings covenant provides for self-generation of
30% for the three-year period FY84-86 and thereafter, with targets of 12%



- 31 -
for the three year periods ending in FY80 and FY81, 18% for the three year
periods ending FY82-83, and 25% for the periods ending in FY84 and FY85.
PLN has made some changes in phasing the development program, and the
forecast prenared immediately after the devaluation of November 15, 1978
included alowances much higher than were required to offset the effect of
the devaluation and inflation. These two major factors enabled PLN to
generate larger internal funds than estimated. As a result in FY79, PLN
produced a 29.1% annual contribution to construction as against the 6%
forecast. The major increase arose from improved cash generation rather
than reduced capital expenditure and the former contributed all but 3% of the
increase in the percentage self generation. Before the presentation of Loan
1708-IND to the Executive Directors in May 1979, the Minister of Mines and
Energy informed the Bank that the Government had in principle approved an
increase in PLN's tariffs by 58% and that this increase would be implemented
not later than March 31, 1980. A decree is expected to be signed shortly to
implement from April 1, 1980 a tariff increase of 38% which would give an
average price per kWh to PLN's consumers of Rp 38.0 (US6.1) a high figure in
view of the price of PLN's fuel being about 50% of international levels. GOI
is of the view that it cannot increase publicly owned PLN's tariffs to a
greater extent because of the antiinflationary campaign currently being waged
to achieve the objectives of the devaluation. In light of the improved FY79
financial position, the 38% tariff increase would enable PLN to meet the
previously agreed target of 12% for FY80 and 81, with no additonal tariff
increase for FY81 (begins April 1, 1980). However, target percentages for
FY82 and after would change (para. 4.09).
4.09      Since PLN is to provide from internal resources the contributions
to investments proposed in para. 4.08, average tariff levels per kwh and the %
increases required to achieve them are as follows:
Current Prices            Constant FY80 Prices

It was agreed during negotiations that the current covenant of 30% for the
three year period ending FY86 would continue, with interim targets of 12% for



- 32 -
the three-year period ending in each year FY80 through 82, 20% for the three-
year period ending in FY83 and 84, and 25% for the three-year period ending
in FY85.
Future Operating Results
4.10      The financial forecasts are based on overall figures that have
been estimated: for Java, based on the energy and demands that the plant
and facilities estimated to be available are capable of generating, trans-
mitting and distributing to consumers; for outside Java, figures are rough
estimates of likely demand, GWh sales and capital and operating expenditures
for each region. On that basis energy sales are estimated to increase from
4,287 GWh in FY79 to 19,740 GWh in FY87, an average annual growth rate of
21%. Based on the earnings targets detailed in para. 4.08, energy revenues
are forecast to increase from Rp 117 billion (US$187 million) in FY79 to Rp
1,520 billion (US$2,432 million) in FY87, an average annual growth rate of
38%. Operating expenses are forecast to grow from Rp 114 billion (US$182
million) to Rp 1,161 billion (US$1,858 million) by FY87 after escalation at
an annual average of 10%, for FY81 through FY83 and about 8% thereafter, with
depreciation based on assets revalued from FY79, giving an annual growth rate
of 37.0%.
4.11      A downward trend in the operating ratio from 97% for FY79 to 74%
by FY87 indicates the improved financial condition over the forecast period.
PLN's high cost continues to be projected through FY87 as indicated by the
fact that tariffs in 1980 constant prices revealed in para. 4.09 remain
constant over the forecast period after FY82. Over the next ten years
decreases in tariffs in real terms should be expected given the economies of
scale that will ensue and the improvement in the efficiency of PLN's
operations that management is expected to bring about.
4.12      Rates of return (ROR) on net fixed assets in operation revalued
from FY79 are estimated to vary from -14.0% for FY80 to 7.2% for FY87. The
high negative ROR for FY80 is caused by the tariff increase of 38% applying
only from the beginning of FY81; for FY81 which includes the tariff increase
for the full year, the ROR is negative (-3.9%) largely because gross assets
are estimated to grow at about 40% before the asset revaluation at about 10%
p.a. and because tariffs are lagging behind costs but catch up by FY82. For
FY82 and thereafter RORs are about 6%-7% but it is expected that these rates
will be exceeded in view of the expected improvement in operational efficiency
mentioned in para. 4.11.
Revaluation of Assets
4.13      Agreement was reached during negotiations of Loan 1708-IND that
PLN revalue its net fixed assets, and consumers contributions, annually on the
basis of the Gross Domestic Investment Deflator as calculated by the Bureau of



- 33 -
Statistics, on the understanding that the revaluations need not be
incorporated in PLN's books. It was agreed to continue this provision for
the proposed loan.
Debt Control
4.14       Government currently assumes the exchange risk on all foreign debt
borrowed to finance state enterprises and this situation is assumed to con-
tinue throughout the forecast period. PLN's current debt control test
provides: (a) for the Bank to be consulted on borrowing if net revenues of the
12 month period or the fiscal year prior to the incurrence of debt, is less
than 1.3 times maximum future debt service; and (b) a debt equity ratio of not
more than 60/40 to ensure reasonable borrowing levels. These tests are
continued for the proposed loan.
Current Position
4.15       The current ratio has varied in the past from 17.7 to 4.1, and for
FY79 it was 4.1, a healthy liquidity position; for FY80-87 it is expected to
exceed 1.9 which is satisfactory. Consumers receivables, which were about
three months billing at end FY79, have been projected to reduce progressively
to two months billing (para. 4.16).
4.16       In the past the total of unpaid GOI bills was not substantial but in
the last two years the position has deteriorated. Outstanding electricity
bills for some Government departments and agencies were about 1.5 years in
arrears at end FY79. Existing loan agreements include a provision that GOI
bills will be paid promptly and that funds to pay such bills will be made
available to departments by the 15th day of the month in which the bill is
due. The existing provision was not being implemented effectively. But
PLN has made substantial progress in collecting the outstanding arrears since
the appraisal mission, the worst offending department having reduced its
overdue bills from 403 to 262 days outstanding and all government overdue
accounts had reduced from an average of 228 to 147 days of billing. An
interdepartmental task force has been formed to improve matters further.
During negotiations it was agreed that GOI outstanding accounts will be
reduced to not more than two months billing by March 31, 1982.
4.17       Inventories of Rp 50 billion in current assets, and Rp 18 billion
of spares in gross plant, were high at end FY79, aggregating to about 13% of
gross plant on a historical basis. Current asset inventories were about 9%
of gross plant for FY79 and are forecast to reduce to 1.5% of revalued gross
plant by FY87.
Corporation Tax
4.18       PLN is subject to income tax at the rate of 45% of net income but it
has applied for tax exemption to the Ministry of Finance which has indicated
that the exemption is likely to be granted and PLN awaits formal notification.
Consequently, the financial projections do not assume liability to income tax.



- 34 -
Subsidiary Loan
4.19      As in previous operations, the Government has agreed to relend the
proceeds of the proposed Loan to PLN on terms equivalent to those of the Bank
loan under a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to the Bank. In addition,
the Government will bear the foreign exchange risk and finance interest and
commitment charges during the grace period which is in line with financing
practices in the country. Signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement is a
condition of Loan effectiveness.
5. JUSTIFICATION
Demand
5.01      Forecast of electricity demand in Java (Annex 6) indicates that
the available generating capacity based on additions under implementation
through 1984/85 would be inadequate to meet both the energy and the peak
load requirements in 1985/86. The energy capability of the system in
1984/85 would be only 15,700 GWH against a projected demand of 17,332 GWH in
1985-86 (Annex 6). Also the installed capacity in 1984/85 would be 3329 MW
against a peak generation requirement of 2910 MW in FY86, which provides a
capacity reserve margin of only 14.4%. System operation with a reliability
index (loss of load probability) of one day in one year demands a reserve
margin of about 25%. Therefore, augmentation of the generating capacity in
the Java system is required by adding baseload capacity by the beginning of
1985 (Annex 16).
Least Cost Solution
5.02      A comprehensive Java System Development Study carried out for PLN
by PCR of the United Kingdom with Bank assistance (Credit 399-IND),
recommended a least cost development sequence of generation expansion for
discount rates up to 15%, which is still valid with the currently accepted
load forecasts. These are about 15% lower than the PCR low forecasts for the
year 1985. Augmentation of the Suralaya thermal power station located in West
Java of which the first 400 NW unit is already committed for commissioning in
January 1984 (Loan 1708-IND), is the next step in the development program.
Studies carried out by PCR and MONENCO have evaluated the implications of
employing unit sizes ranging from 300 MW to 500 MW; these show negligible
differences in economy. MONENCO recommended a unit size of 400 MW, which PLN
has accepted; the decision is appropriate.
5.03      The breakeven price of coal for the plant at Suralaya corresponding
to the international price of oil at US$13.5 per bbl was at $37.0 per ton
including the extra capital, operation and maintenance cost of the coal fired
plant compared to an oil fired plant. With the current oil prices at about
US$24 per bbl, the breakeven cost of coal would be considerably higher



- 35 -
($65 per ton). The engineering work for the Bukit Asam Coal project is now
in progress. The indications are that the economic price of coal delivered
to Suralaya would work out in the range of $40 per metric ton, providing
ample justification of coal burning in this power plant.
5.04      A scheme which has about the same order of merit as the Suralaya
project is the 700 MW Saguling hydro electric project in West Java currently
in an advanced stage of investigation. However, with a firm energy potential
of only 1,580 GWh, it is a peaking station. Its development period precludes
commissioning earlier than FY86. PLN is currently carrying out detailed
engineering of the project with the help of Japanese consultants and has
included it in its FY 1981 program.
5.05      The PCR studies (para 5.02) also recommended establishment of an
island wide EHV transmission system to permit (a) reliable and economic
operation of PLN's facilities in Java and (b) planning the future expansion
of PLN's supply capacity in Java to take advantage of diversity of demand
between regions and economies of scale. Further detailed studies were
carried out by MM of the U.K. (para 3.17) with Bank assistance (loan
1365-IND). They have recommended selection of 500 kV as the optimal voltage
of the grid, which PLN has accepted. The other feasible voltage for
development is 400 kV, which could be lower in capital cost by about 2%, but
is not favoured because of the many advantages of selecting the higher
voltage including the extra flexibility for system operations, improved
reliability of operation and lower requirements of way leave, particularly in
urban areas like Jakarta, where land is scarce. 500 kV becomes a cheaper
alternative when transmission losses are taken into account. In view of
these considerations, the decision to select 500 kV is appropriate.
5.06      tM recommended that the EHV network should be developed from
Suralaya to Semarang in central Java in the first stage to be completed
by 1984 (para 3.17). This will result in full integration of the regional
power systems of the West and the Central Java regions, permitting coor-
dination of plant maintenance schedules, sharing of reserves, merit order
loading of thermal units and improved reliability. Without the EHV inter-
connection between the West and the Central Java systems, the projected
demand in the Western region cannot be met with acceptable reliability
standards. Substantial savings in fuel costs will be achieved in the period
1984-86 by permitting baseload operation of the 800 14W Suralaya generating
capacity using coal as fuel in preference to the use of petroleum fuels at
power stations in Central Java. These benefits provide sufficient justifi-
cation for the interconnection of the West and the Central Java systems by
an EHV line. PLN has accepted these recommendations. Annex 16 shows the
anticipated pattern of the utilization of plants in Java in FY86.
Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR)
5.07      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is the discount rate
which equalizes the economic costs and benefits attributable to the project.



- 36 -
The IERR has been calculated for units 1 and 2 of Suralaya and the associated
EHV transmission network as the entire project is essentially integral; the
separation being for financing reasons. The benefits are the incremental
revenue from energy sales at an average tariff of Rp 38.0 per kWh which will
be the average PLN tariff in FY81.  On this basis the IERR is 12%./l   The
IERR was tested for sensitivity to changes in the capital and fuel costs. If
the project cost rises by 10%, the IERR would be 11.2%; if the fuel costs are
10% above the assumed level of $40 per ton of coal, the IERR would be 11.6%
(Annex 18). This is a minimum measure of benefits because in using tariff
revenue only for the benefits, the consumer surplus is ignored. As the IERR
is above the opportunity cost of capital in Indonesia (10%), the project is
economically justified.
Risks
5.08      There are no risks of an engineering nature as there are no inherent
uncertainties in this type of work. The risk of delays in project implementa-
tion may arise mainly due to possible delay in land acquisition for
construction of the EHV lines. Assurances were received from PLN and the
Government to avoid such delay (para. 3.38).
5.09      If coal from Bukit Asam is not available for the power plant by
January 1984, it will be necessary to use fuel oil in the plant temporarily.
Such an eventuality would reduce the economic benefit from the plant.
However, the project is justified on meeting power demand and would be so
justified based on the plant being oil burning also.
6. AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
6.01      The following agreements were reached during negotiations:
(a) Government will progressively phase out oil subsidies but
compensate for any excess of coal prices over fuel oil prices in
1984, if necessary (para. 1.29);
(b) land for 500 KV lines will be acquired by March 1981 (para. 3.38);
(c) PLN will be provided with sufficient funds to carry out a
balanced development program (para. 4.05);
(d) existing earnings covenant will continue at 30% for FY86 and
thereafter, with interim targets of 12% for FY80 through 82, and
20% for FY83 and 84 and 25% for FY85 (para. 4.08);
(e) assets will be revalued (para. 4.13);
(f) existing debt control tests will continue (para. 4.14);
/1  With the current coal cost of $23 per ton, the IERR would be 15%.

(g) outstanding electricity bills of GOI will be brought within
two months billing by March 31, 1982 (para. 4.16); and
(h) GOI will onlend the loan proceeds under a subsidiary loan agree-
ment, satisfactory to the Bank, with signing as a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan (para. 4.19).
6.02      The project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$253 million
for a period of 20 years including 5 years of grace.

Assumptions in the Financial Forecasts
Revenues
1.        Revenues have been forecast assuming a 38% increase in tariff
levels on April 1, 1980. For the remainder of the period through FY87
they are forecast at the levels required to generate over the test year and
the two preceding years 12% for FY80 through FY82, 20% for FY83 and FY84,
25% for FY85 and 30% thereafter of the same three years' construction
expenditures.
Fuel
2.        Fuel has been priced as follows, escalated at 10% each year for
FY81 onwards:
1979 Price Level                  _Rp
Coal (per kg)                      14.4
Residual oil (per liter)           33.0
Industrial diesel (per liter)    33.0
High speed diesel (per liter)    37.3
Gas (per KWh)                      11.0
Operating Expenses
3.        Operating expenses are based on FY80 costs as estimated by PLN
for personnel, operating, maintenance, and administration and are escalated
at the following rates %:
Year        81      82     83      84     85     86      87

Capital Expenditures
5.        Capital expenditures are based on the expenditures needed to meet
the least cost program of: generation and transmission development for Java;
distribution expenditure for Java and generation, transmission and distri-
bution for other areas as estimated at 1979 prices by PLN. Expenditures
other than those for Java are not yet based on demand forecasts but will be
so based in the near future.  Escalation has been based on the rates in
para. 4.
Borrowings and Equity
6.        Borrowings have been assumed at 50% of the foreign costs included
in construction expenditures except for loans which lending institutions
such as IBRD and ADB require to be passed to PLN in their entirety. The
assumed average terms of the loans are 19 years including four years grace
at 9% p.a.

/a  Includes full cost of Suralaya units 1 and 2, associated EHV and trans-
mission and distribution costs.
lb Includes foreign and local costs.
/c At 2% of capital cost for the thermal plant and 1% of capital cost for
Transmission Lines.
/d At $40 per metric ton of coal with a calorfic value of 5,500 kcal/kg
(9,900 BTU/lb).
/e Benefits are worked out with the following assumptions:
(i) Average tariff per KWH sold = Rp. 38.0 (US cents 6.1).
(ii)  Generation at 70% plant factor up to year 2000 (15 years), at 60%
plant factor for the next 10 years and at 50% plant factor for last 5
years.
(iii)  The energy sale is assumed as 80% of the gross generation.
The IERR is 12.25% for the base case detailed above. The sensitivity of
the IERR for various factors is as below:
IERR (%)
Capital cost + 10%            11.15
