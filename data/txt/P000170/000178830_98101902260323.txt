REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
FOR A FISHERIES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Burundi for the equivalent of US$6.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Fisheries Development Project.
The Government will relend about US$2.0 million of the credit proceeds to the
National Economic Development Bank (BNDE) at 4 percent per annum for a term
of 15 years including a grace period of 5 years. BNDE will relend these
funds to the Regional Development Society at 8-1/2 percent interest per
annum for 10 years for the purpose of project facilities and at 6 percent
per annum for 3-6 years for credits to fishermen. The Abu DhabL Fund for Arab
Economic Development will participate in financing the project with a Loan of
Dh 4 million (US$1.0 million equivalent) on terms and conditions to be nego-
tiated with the Government of Burundi.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic report on Burundi (504a - Bu) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on January 14, 1975. This was followed by an economic
memorandum (885a-BU) distributed on October 24, 1975. Country diata are pro-
vided in Annex I. Burundi is one of the 25 least developed countries as
defined by the United Nations.
3.        Burundi remains one of the poorest of the least developed countries,
with a per capita income estimated at US$92 in 1974. Over the past five years
GDP grew by no more than 2 percent annually in real terms. Of a population
of 3.5 million only 115,000 are in wage employment; the remainder depend
mainly on subsistence agriculture. The agricultural labor force is largely
untrained, and the level of enrollment in formal education is one of the
lowest in Africa.
4.        The economy is dominated by the agricultural sector.    Food crops
account for over half of GDP; other crops, of which coffee remains by far
the most important, account for a further 10 percent. In 1974 coffee pro-
duction reached a record of about 28,000 tons, 35 percent higher than in the
preceding year. The large harvest combined with a markedly higher producer
price resulted in a 62 percent increase in farmer incomes derived from coffee,
with consequent multiplier effects in both industry and services.
5.        Burundi has become increasingly dependent on coffee for foreign
exchange earnings; its share in total exports rose from 79 percent in 1965
to 84 percent in 1974. Owing to external marketing and transport delays, a
quarter of the 1974 crop was exported only in early 1975. The value of im-
ports on the other hand rose 36 percent in 1974, and, consequently, foreign

exchange reserves fell sharply. The trend was reversed during the first
four months of 1975 as delayed coffee payments were received, while at the
same time imports fell to a level nearly 40 percent below that of the second
half of 1974. By December 1975 reserves stood at a level equivalent to six
months of merchandise imports. Rising import prices, combined with increased
internal demand, caused a record 23 percent jump in the cost of living index
for low income urban families during the year ended March 1975.
6.        The level of investment has remained consistently low, averaging
only 8 percent of GDP over the last five years. Domestic savings have
amounted to only 5 percent of GDP over the same period, approximately equal
to net capital inflows. Close to half of total gross capital formation was
financed by external aid.
7.        Due to high coffee prices, government revenues in 1974 were 14 per-
cent above the level attained in 1973, while current expenditures grew at only
9 percent. Thus in 1974, the Government was able to finance a 70 percent
increase in its investment budget.
8.        Burundi faces a formidable set of disadvantages, excessive depend-
ence on a single export (coffee) for foreign exchange, long and inefficient
transport links for external trade, rudimentary infrastructure, and a largely
untrained labor force. In the past, civil strife has disrupted development and
diverted resources. Further, the terms of trade have deteriorated 40 percent
since 1970. There are, however, some encouraging indications. Internal order
has been restored and a new planning organization created. Improvements are
being made in financial administration, and a number of promising agricul-
tural projects are under preparation. Substantial nickel deposits have been
found and may be brought into production over the next ten years.
9.        At present the Government lacks a coherent overall development
strategy. This is in part due to the low priority accorded planning in the
past. As a first step in addressing this problem, the Government has trans-
ferred responsibility for national planning to a new "Bureau Technique
d'Etudes" (BTE). To make the new planning organization more effective, IDA
is assisting in strengthening of its staffing. A strong planning capa-
bility would enable the Government to take the lead in initiating new projects
and in coordinating external aid within the context of a well defined develop-
ment plan.
10.       The short term prospects for the economy are favorable.    Although
coffee production in 1975 fell considerably from the record level achieved in
1974, prices have risen sharply owing to frost damage to Brazil's coffee trees.
Coffee production is expected to recover in 1976. In the longer term , if the
Government focuses on development and strengthens its administration, it may
achieve slow growth instead of stagnation. If nickel mining proves feasible,
the prospects over the next ten years would be transformed. Although such a
development appears technically possible, the commercial viability of nickel
mining has yet to be proved.

11.       Disbursements: of official development assistance amounted to US$24.8
million in 1974. Belgium contributed about 26 percent, and UN agencies, IDA
and the European Development Fund another 42 percent. Technical assistance
accounted for about US$12 million, while the aid contribution to public
sector projects reached. about US$10.8 million in addition to program aid of
some US$2.0 million, In the 1970-74 period, total foreign capital inflows
amounted to about US$109 million, of which US$105 million were in grant form.
On December 31, 1974, Eurundi's external medium and long-term debt amounted
to about US$8.0 million excluding undisbursed amounts. Of this the Bank and
IDA together hold 57 pErcent. Debt service averaged 2.9 percent of export
earnings during 1972/74, with the Bank Group receiving 41 percent of service
payments. By 1980, the Bank Group will probable continue to hold a high
proportion of debt and debt service, if most other aid is given on grant
terms. N6twithstanding the low debt service ratio, the country is not able
to finance any borrowirLg on commercial terms, as its absolute capacity to
service external debt is limited by the size and fluctuations (due to depend-
ence on coffee) of its export earnings. External aid should finance a high
proportion of total prcject costs, including local expenditure, and should
be on grant or near grant terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BURUNDI
12.       In 1957, the Bank lent US$4.8 million to the Belgian Trust Territory
of Rwanda-Urundi for the improvement of the Bujumbura-Muranvya road and the
expansion of the lake port of Bujumbura. The loan, guaranteed by Belgium,
was fully disbursed at independence in 1962 and is being repaid by Burundi
with Belgian assistance.   The last payment is due in 1977.
13.       Since independence, six credits have been made to Burundi, totaling
US$13.2 million. The first credit for US$1.1 million, was made in March 1966
for the rehabilitation and extension of Bujumbura's water supply system. A
credit of US$1.8 million was made in April, 1969 for the improvement of coffee
production by smallholdiers, followed by a second credit of US$5.2 million
approved in November, 1.975. A credit of US$380,000, made in June 1970, helped
finance the detailed engineering of the Bujumbura-Nyanza Lac road and a highway
maintenance study.   This study led to the fourth credit, of US$5 million, for
a highway maintenance project signed in March 1974. A Technical Assistance
Credit of US$1.5 million (Credit 613-BU) was made in March 1976 to help
strengthen planning, statistical services and project preparation.     No Bank
loans have been made since independence.
14.       The Water Supply Project (Credit 85-BU) was completed in March 1973.
While the project did not meet all objectives, Bujumbura was provided with an
ample and safe water supply. Implementation of the First Coffee Improvement
Project (Credit 147-BU') was hampered by frequent delays in the delivery of
construction materials:, the civil disturbances in 1972 and management problems.
The first coffee washing station started operating in 1973 and the remaining
three only in 1975. The project is now virtually completed. The Second Coffee



- 4 -
Project (Credit 593-BU) will provide 110,000 smallholder coffee farmers wiLh
instruction in better cultivation techniques and with inputs such as ferti-
lizers, insecticides, and tools. The project will also expand the facilities
for processing coffee. The Highway Maintenance Project (Credit 467-BU) has
commenced satisfactorily. The project consultants took up their duties in
Burundi at the end of 1974, orders have been placed for the maintenance
equipment, and a survey of training needs has been completed. Annex II
contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of February 29, 1976 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
15.       The future lending program will be aimed primarily at increasing
agricultural productivity, thereby improving the nutrition and living stand-
ards of the impoverished rural population. Consistent with the Government's
emphasis on rural development, a comprehensive reform of the education system
has been initiated. A basic education project in support of this reform has
been prepared with assistance from UNESCO and was appraised in February-March,
1976. We also intend to continue assistance for expanding and improving the
road network, a prerequisite for rural development, as well as Burundi's
efforts in improving planning, project preparation and project implementa-
tion. Also, we will continue to include project management and technical
expertise in project lending.
PART III - THE FISHERIES SUB-SECTOR
16.       Fishing is the principal economic activity along the Burundi shore
of Lake Tanganyika (about 150 km). Currently, fishing contributes less than
one percent to total GDP, and represents a relatively small sub-sector of the
economy; however, it is capable of significant expansion. Fresh fish is
much sought after in Burundi, and dried fish is commonly consumed in most
parts of the country. Per capita fish consumption has declined significantly
as a result of the loss of fishing boats and the flight of fishermen and
their families during the civil strife which took place in 1972. An FAO/UNDP
study shows that per capita fish consumption in Burundi is low compared with
neighboring countries.
17.       Lake Tanganyika offers the most important fisheries resources in
Burundi. Total production of fish from the 2,000 km2 of Burundi waters in
Lake Tanganyika (1/16 of the total surface of the lake) was estimated at
about 15,400 tons in 1971. Following the 1972 civil strife, production
dropped to about 6,400 tons and 1974 production was estimated at about 9,500
tons of which small sardine-like fish, known as ndagala, accounted for more
than 80 percent. Research is currently underway, under an FAO/UNDP project,
to determine the potential for fisheries production; results to date indicate
that a sustainable level of production of at least 25,000 tons per annum
for Burundi is possible and suggests that the real potential may be substan-
tially higher.



- 5 -
18.       Three distinct groups of fishermen, characterized locaLly as indus-
trial, artisanal and traditional, fish Lake Tanganyika waters. The indust-
rial fisheries date from the mid-1950's and consist of 18 purse seine units
owned by Greek nationals. These units employ between 25-35 fishermen each,
and their catch totals about 5,000-6,000 tons a year. Artisanal fishing
was first developed in the late 1950's when catamarans, equipped with nylon
liftnets, were introduced by the fisheries service of the Ministry of Agri-
culture and Livestock (see paragraph 23). This technique which is practiced
with 4-5 fishermen per boat, proved highly successful and was adopted rapidly
by traditional fishermen all along the lake shore. The traditional fishermen
use single canoes and scoopnets; they catch approximately 4-5 tons per boat a
year. This group now numbers about 700 canoes (down from a maximum of 1,600
canoes in 1966); its importance is declining as traditional fishermen pro-
gressively adopt the techniques and equipment of the artisanal fishermen.
Marketing and Processin.S
19.       About 35 percent of the total catch is retailed fresh In Bujumbura
and the remainder is cocnsumed near the lakeshore or is dried for resale in
the interior. Industrial fishing units are required to wholesale their total
catch in the Bujumbura Central Market, and most of their catch is retailed
fresh there, although some small portion is transported short distances for
resale. Traditional and artisanal fishermen sell their surplus to traders
at the principal landing beaches, where most fish is dried for wholesale in
Bujumbura and subsequeni:ly sold throughout Burundi. Most is sold in Bujum-
bura and Bubanza provinces; supplies to other provinces are irregular and
limited.
20.       Sun-drying, the traditional preservation technique for ndagala,
is carried out by fishermen and their families and by middlemen. Dried fish
keep about one month, and are subject to insect damage and decay. The FAO/
UNDP project (see para. 21 below) has introduced preservation and packaging
techniques that preserve fish for up to six months. The FAO/UNDP project
staff are also experimenting with fresh fish marketing. Trials of export
of frozen luxury fish products have yielded promising results.
The FAO/UNDP Fisheries Projects
21.       FAO/UNDP have aided Burundi fisheries development since 1970. An
initial project (1971-73) carried out research on fish stocks, catch levels,
and processing and marketing. The objective was to produce a management plan
for fisheries resources in Lake Tanganyika. The project included a small
development component for artisanal fisheries which was subsequently recast
as a larger program to rehabilitate artisanal fishing. When this project was
completed, two new projects were approved, one for research and the other for
development. The former is providing the basis for more accurate estimates of
fishing potential in Lake Tanganyika. It has identified potential problems
in fisheries development, notably pollution of the lake, and will continue to
monitor pollution levels. A future regional research program for the lake,



- 6 -
including Burundi, Zaire, Tanzania and possibly Zambia, is currently being
discussed, and the UNDP and the Swedish International Development Agency have
agreed to consider financing such a program.
22.       The development project (1974-76, total cost US$890,000) is assist-
ing the Government in rehabilitating the artisanal fisheries sector. It has
provided fishing equipment, three small processing centers, training, institu-
tional development and technical assistance. Two fishing centers have been
established and a third center should be constructed in 1976. Each center
includes 30-50 fishing units, which are metal-hulled catamarans and trimarans,
powered by small outboard motors. The Regional Development Society for
Fisheries (RDS), a parastatal organization, recently created with UNDP/FAO
assistance, owns these boats and allocates them to fishermen under a hire-
purchase scheme. The centers also include storage facilities for fishing
equipment, offices, housing for staff, and a simple fish processing plant.
The project is progressing quite well, particularly on the technical level.
The principal problems to date relate to the development of management capa-
bility and the efficiency of extension services, and to the training of
counterpart staff. There have also been persistent problems with shortages
of materials and delays in procuring equipment and supplies from overseas.
Institutions
23.       Institutions for the promotion and regulation of fishing and related
processing and marketing activities have very limited staff, and are heavily
dependent on the FAO/UNDP project for staff, technical assistance, materials
and equipment. Responsibility for government fishing programs rests with the
Fisheries Service in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock; its activities
for the most part have been limited to the project activities of the FAO/UNDP.
The Government is in the process of staffing the RDS which will assume prin-
cipal responsibility for all aspects of fisheries development in Burundi while
the Ministry would keep responsibility for the formulation of policies, the
provision of technical assistance, extension services, training, and research
activities. RDS is to be run along commercial lines, and is expected to be
financially viable. Its initial capital was subscribed by the Government with
funds provided by the FAO/UNDP.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Fisheries Development Project
Burundi" (No. 977a-BU) is being circulated separately. A credit and project
summary is provided in Annex III; a map of the project area is attached as
Annex IV.
25.       The project was prepared by Bank Group Staff, in cooperation with
the Government of Burundi and staff of the FAO/UNDP fisheries projects in
Burundi. Preparation was based on research and experimental work under the
FAO/UNDP fisheries projects. The project will continue and expand the



- 7 -
FAO/UNDP fisheries development activities, which the UNDP intends to term-
inate by the end of 1976. The project was appraised in September/October,
1975. Negotiations for the proposed IDA credit were held in Washington in
March 1976. The Burundi delegation was led by H.E. Pierre Bigayimpunzi,
Minister of Agriculture and Livestock. A delegation from the Abu Dhabi Fund
for Arab Economic Development consisting of Mr. Al Nowais, Deputy Director,
and Dr. El Alfi also participated to discuss cofinancing arrangements.
The Project Area
26.       The project area includes the Burundi waters of Lake Tanganyika
and the lake shore plain (see Annex IV map). The estimated rural population
of the area is about 100,000 people.
27.       Fishing dominates the economy of the project area, although farming
is also important,and most fishermen are also farmers.    Fishing takes place
all along the lake shore; however, most boats are concentrated near about
10 principal landing beaches. There are perhaps 2,500 full-time fishermen,
with an additional 450 employed on Greek-owned purse seine units. Agriculture
in the region is mixed; the lake plain supplies much of the produce marketed
in and around Bujumbura; export crops, notably coffee, cotton and oil palm are
also grown. The principal food crops are beans, cassava, bananas, swamp rice,
and palm oil. The potential for development of both food and export crops is
good.
Project Description
28.       The proposed project is a comprehensive fisheries deveLopment
program designed (a) to provide the technical assistance and tra[ning, and
the fishing equipment, materials and basic services necessary to significantly
increase the productivity and incomes of approximately 3,000 low income
traditional and artisanal fishermen (about 1,500 are presently employed and
another 1,500 will be new fishermen) and their families, (b) to expand and
improve fish preservation methods, and (c) to improve marketing facilities and
extend them throughout Burundi. The proposed project also includes preparation
of a comprehensive rural development plan for and the initiation of pilot
development activities in the Lake Tanganyika coastal region. In order to
provide the above services and facilities, the project includes the following
components:
(a)  Fishing Equipment and Materials
A wide range of materials such as fishing boats, motors, and
equipment (e.g., nets, lamps, rope, anchors) for artisanal
fisheries wilL be provided to fishermen on a credit basis or
sold for cash. Materials will be provided for an estimated
600 units of which about 250 are already operating, many
without adequate equipment. The project will also procure
and operate f:Lve catamaran purse seine units at each of five
fishing centers (see paragraph (b) below) on an experimental



-8-
basis. These units will combine techniques of the artisanal
and industrial fisheries, thus affording smallscale fisher-
men the opportunity to learn more sophisticated fishing
techniques.
(b) Fishing Centers and Fishing Stations
Five fishing centers (three of which have been partially
developed by the FAO/UNDP project) and five fishing stations
will be developed at the principal landing beaches on the lake
shore. Each center will include facilities for storage of
fishing gear and provision of services to fishermen, depots for
sale of fishing equipment and supplies, and a processing plant
to produce smoked fish. The stations will be similar to fishing
centers, except that processing plants will not be provided.
(c)  Fish Marketing
Marketing facilities will be improved through the construction
and equipment of a main storage depot in Bujumbura and four
smaller depots in principal marketing centers in the interior.
Transportation will also be improved. The principal marketing
effort will be the improvement of collection, storage, and
marketing for dried fish and development of an effective market-
ing system for dried smoked ndagala produced by project fishing
centers. In addition, a small freezer cold storage unit would be
established to aid in pilot export operations. The RDS will manage
the fish marketing activities; initially it will rely on existing
marketing channels and will engage in direct marketing activities
in the interior of Burundi only after studies have demonstrated
the viability of such operations. RDS will prepare marketing
studies prior to construction of each of the new fishing centers or
stations.
(d)  Fisheries Extension Service
The project will train and equip an extension staff and
provide necessary equipment, offices and staff housing.
The extension service will provide counsel and training to
fishermen on improved fishing techniques, assistance in
securing equipment and supplies, and advice on preservation
techniques. The service should reach an estimated 3,000
fishermen at full development; it will have a staff of about
10 extension agents.
(e)  Regional Development Society Headquarters
Physical investment will include office facilities in
Bujumbura, a garage and workshop, office equipment, furni-
ture and supplies, vehicles and storage facilities.



- 9 -
(f) Coastal Region Development Activities
This component: includes the preparation of an integrated
rural development plan for the region and the implementation
of pilot development activities. The plan preparation has
two stages: 11) the identification of priority development
activities, and (2) data collection, field studies, and
preparation of the development program. Following the
first stage and IDA approval of plans, pilot activities will
be initiated. These activities are likely to include
strengthening of extension services, provision of agricul-
tural inputs (including selected seeds, tools and small
livestock), village processing facilities such as flour mills
and oil presses and development of social infrastructure and
community installations.
(g) Technical Assistance, Training, Studies
The project will provide technical assistance and training to
assist the Regional Development Society in the execution of the
project and in. the development of technical and managerial
competence in fishing and in fish preservation and marketing.
Technical assistance will include a specialist for each of the
following areas: fisheries development and extension, fish
processing, fish marketing, and management and administration.
The appointment of the specialist for management and administ-
ration and his counterpart will be a condition of credit effect-
iveness. (See' Section 6.01 (f) of the draft Development
Credit Agreement.) An additional specialist for technical
and mechanical activities would be provided if the RDS
undertakes major force account works or boat building.
The National Economic Development Bank (Banque Nationale
de Developpement Economique, BNDE) would employ a technical
advisor to enable it to assist RDS in financial management.
In addition, consulting services will be provided to carry
out the regional development study, marketing studies,
project preparation, and a study of pollution in Lake
Tanganyika.
Project Execution
29.       The RDS, under the supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock and with the technical assistance described above,will be execut-
ing agency for those activities related to fishing,i.e., provision of
materials and equipment, fish processing and marketing, fisheries extension,
and its own institutional development. The execution of the project will in
large measure depend on the senior staff appointed to the RDS and the tech-
nical assistance provided under the project. The BNDE, which part-
icipated in project preparation, will have an active role in project im-
plementation. It will act as an intermediary in channeling credit proceeds to



- 10 -
the RDS and it will supervise the credit program for fishermen, and assist the
RDS in developing proper management procedures and accounting systems. The
Bureau Technique d'Etudes will be responsible for coastal region development
planning; pilot programs will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture
and Livestock. The executing agencies will obtain IDA approval for terms of
reference for studies and technical assistance and will consult with IDA on the
appointment of technicians and counterparts, with qualifications and experience
satisfactory to IDA (see Section 3.02 of the draft Development Credit Agreement
and Section 2.04 of the draft Project Agreement).
Cost Estimates
30.       Total project cost including contingencies is estimated at US$8.4
million equivalent, excluding taxes and duties of about US$0.1 million. The
proposed IDA credit of US$6.0 million will finance 86 percent of the foreign
exchange costs (US$4.8 million) and 40 percent of the local costs (US$1.1
million), or about 71 percent of project costs net of taxes and duties. The
Abu Dhabi Fund will participate in the financing with a loan of Dh 4 million
(US$1.0 million equivalent) to the Government of Burundi. Terms and condi-
tions are still to be negotiated but it is expected that the loan will carry
an interest of not more than 3 percent and will be repayable over a period
between 10-20 years including a grace period of about 5 years. The Abu
Dhabi Fund loan, jointly with the IDA Credit, will finance materials, equip-
ment and vehicles provided under the project. The loan will finance 11
percent of total project cost net of taxes and duties including 14 percent of
foreign exchange cost and 7 percent of local cost. Total external financing
will thus amount to 82 percent of total project costs net of taxes. Effective-
ness of the Abu Dhabi Fund Loan Agreement will be a condition of Credit effec-
tiveness (see Section 6.01 (d) of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Financing Plan
31.       Financing of project costs would be shared as follows:

32.       Retroactive financing from February 1, 1976 of up to US$150,000
is recommended to cover the cost of employment of key project staff and
preliminary project implementation. The Government will establish an account
equivalent to US$100,000 for RDS to ensure that funds are available to finance



project investments. The establishment of this account will be a condition
of credit effectiveness (see Section 6.01 (e) of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
Channeling of Credit Proceeds and Re-Lending Terms
33.       The Government will onlend part of the credit proceeds and the
proceeds from the Abu Dhabi Fund loan (totaling about US$3.0 million) to
the BNDE at 4 percent per annum for a term of 15 years including a grace
period of 5 years. BNDE, in turn, will relend these funds to the RDS
which will utilize them (i) to construct and equip project facilities
such as fishing centers, fishing stations, and experimental purse seine
units and (ii) to purchase fishing boats and equipment that will be sold
to fishermen for cash or on credit. Sub-loans to the RDS for project facil-
ities will be for 10 years and carry an interest rate of 8-1/2 percent per
annum. Sub-loans to RDS for credit to fishermen for the purchase of fishing
boats and equipment will be at 6 percent per annum for 3-6 years. Credit to
fishermen will be at 10 percent per annum for periods varying bet:ween between
3 and 6 years. To be eligible for credit, fishermen will be selected on the
basis of criteria satisfactory to IDA. Loan contracts will be made following
a model contract acceptable to IDA (Section 2.10 (a) of the draft Project
Agreement). Funds repaid by RDS to BNDE would be reutilized for fisheries
development following investment plans to be agreed upon annually between
BNDE and IDA. The conclusion of subsidiary loan agreements satisfactory to
IDA between the Government and the BNDE and between the BNDE and RDS will be
a condition of credit effectiveness (see Section 6.01 (b) and (c) of the draft
Development Credit Agreement).
34.       Funds for fisheries extension services and for coastal region
development activities will be transferred directly to the RDS, the Min-
istry of Agriculture and Livestock, and the Bureau Technique d'Etudes as
appropriate. Funds for technical assistance, studies and training will be
administered for the Government by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
and the Bureau Technique d'Etudes.
Procurement
35.       Fishing equipment (outboard motors, lamps, nets, etc) and fish
processing equipment (US$0.8 million) will be purchased on the basis of
price quotations, solicited after advertising in an internationaL fishing
journal and notification of embassies in Bujumbura. Vehicles and other
equipment will be procured on the basis of price quotations from local
suppliers offering adequate guarantees of service and spare parts. Fish-
ing boats (US$0.7 million) will be manufactured locally. Civil works
(US$0.38 million), which are too small to attract international contrac-
tors, will be carried out by force account or by local contractors fol-
lowing local competitive bidding. Consultant services (US$0.4 million)
and technical services (US$1.5 million) will be procured in accordance
with Bank/IDA guidelines.



- 12-
F. Disbursements
36.       Proceeds of the credit will be disbursed over five years on the
following basis:
(a) 56 percent of the foreign exchange costs or 48 percent of
the total cost of fishing equipment and materials, plant
equipment, vehicles, and supplies; the Abu Dhabi Fund will
simultaneously disburse 44 percent of the foreign exchange
costs or 37 percent of the total costs for these goods;
(b) 90 percent of the total cost: of RDS civil works, of
operating costs for RDS fisheries extension and
fishermen training and for local training, and regional
development activities;
(c) 100 percent of the foreign exchange costs or 90 percent
of total costs for technical assistance, studies and
overseas training.
Disbursements will be fully documented; disbursements under (b) will be
made against certificates of expenditure, the documentation for which will
be retained by the borrower and made available for inspection by IDA during
the course of project supervision missions. Disbursements for the construc-
tion and equipping of fishing centers or stations will only be made after the
specialists for the fish processing and marketing divisions of RDS and their
counterparts have been appointed and for each individual center or station
after individual marketing plans have been approved by IDA. (See paragraphs
4(b) and 4(c) of Schedule 1 to the draft Development Credit Agreement.) In
addition, no disbursements will be made for any regional development activity
until the Association has been provided with a plan for such activity. Any
funds remaining in the credit account on completion of the project will be
used for project related activities.
Environmental considerations
37.       The project itself creates no environmental problems; however Lake
Tanganyika is particularly susceptible to pollution. Recent studies have
indicated an accumulation of chemicals in fish, although in quantities well
below recognized danger levels. However, investigation of the causes, origins
and severity of pollution has been inadequate to assess the gravity and magni-
tude of the problem or indicate possible remedial actions. In order to remedy
these shortcomings, the project will include a study, supplemental to the
UNDP research project, comprising: (i) additional basic research on pollution,
and (ii) a report to advise the Government and international agencies on the
magnitude of the problem and to recommend control programs and future research.

Benefits
38.       At full development (in year six), the project should increase
fish production by about 10,000 tons as compared to the present production
of about 9,500 tons per year. The economic rate of return of the project
is estimated to be 20 percent over 20 years. Benefits would flow to some
3,000 fishermen (including about 1,500 fishermen presently employed) who
will earn between $300 and $600 a year of net cash income over and above
fish retained for consumption, and to a broad range of the population who
will be able to obtain an additional source of protein at a relatively low
price. Additional jobs will be created for about 1,500 new artisanal fish-
ermen, and for about 200 employees in the RDS fishing centers and stations
and the five RDS fishing units. About 300 people will be employed in the
construction of the project.
39.       The financiaL rate of return for the RDS on its commercial opera-
tions should be about L5 percent. By year six, it is expected that RDS
should be earning substantial profits.
Risks
40.       The proposed project involves some significant risks, namely:
(i) because of management and technical problems the project might fail
to meet physical objectives; (ii) services to fishermen might decline or
lapse following the investment period; (iii) unfavorable fish prices or
higher than expected operating costs might cause the RDS to operate at a
loss and might reduce Lncentives to fishermen to increase production.
These first two risks have been dealt with by inputs of technical assis-
tance and training for project execution and institutional development.
The third risk is inherent to fisheries production,but is somewhat compen-
sated by the high rate of return to investment by fishermen. Overall,the
project offers good prospects for yielding substantial financial and eco-
nomic benefits for Burundi, notably to small-scale fishermen, and for im-
proving nutrition. It represents one of the best investment opportunities
available at this time in Burundi.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Burundi and the Association, the draft Project Agreement among IDA, RDS,
and BNDE, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V,
Section 1 (d) of the A2rticles of Agreement of the Association, and the text
of a draft Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
42.       Features of the draft Development Credit and Project Agreements
of special interest are referred to in paragraphs 28(g), 29, 30, 32, 33
and 36. In particular, the following special conditions of credit effec-
tiveness are provided (see Section 6.01 of the draft Development: Credit
Agreement):



- 14 -
(a)  the execution and effectiveness of the Loan Agreement between
the Abu Dhabi Fund and the Government;
(b)  the conclusion of subsidiary loan agreements between the
Government and BNDE, and BNDE and RDS;
(c)  the establishment of a Government fund in the amount of
US$100,000 to cover RDS investment expenditures; and
(d)  the appointment of a specialist and his counterpart for
the management and administration division of RDS.
43.       Also, the draft Development Credit Agreement (see paragraphs 4(b)
and 4(c) of the draft Development Credit Agreement) provides for the follow-
ing special conditions of disbursement:
(i)  no disbursements shall be made for the development of
fishing stations or centers until the specialists and
theiT counterparts for the fish processing and market-
ing divisions of the RDS have been appointed; disburse-
ments for each individual station or center shall be
made only after individual marketing plans have been
approved by IDA;
(ii)  no disbursements shall be made for any regional develop-
ment activity until the Borrower has furnished the
Association with a plan for such activity, satisfactory
to the Association.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
45.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C. Projects in Execution 1/
Credit No. 467-BU    Highway Maintenance Project:   US$5.0 million of
March 27, 1974; Effective Date: August 22, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The Highway Maintenance Project is the first phase of a long-term
program to establish an efficient highway maintenance organization. The
project consists of the purchase of maintenance equipment, spare parts, fuel
and construction materials, the construction of a workshop and consultant
services for technical assistance and training, a study on the development of
the road sector and a feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Ngozi-
Muyinga-Kobero Road (106 km). The project is co-financed by the UNDP (US$1.05
million), Germany (US$1.33 million) and Belgium (US$400,000). Execution of
the project is generally satisfactory. The consultants responsible for tech-
nical assistance (financed by UNDE') started their work in October 1974. Pro-
curement of equipment is underway to mechanize maintenance units being estab-
lished under the project. The construction of a workshop in Bujumbura (fi-
nanced by Germany) has been completed. The road studies for which the Govern-
ment has signed a contract with consultants are expected to start shortly.
Credit No. 593-BU     Second Coffee Improvement Project:   US$5.2 million
of December 5, 1975; Effective Date: estimated for
March 31, 1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
Since the project is a continuation of the first Coffee Improve-
ment Project (US$1.8 million Credit No. 147-BU of April 11, 1969), it is being
implemented by the institutions and staff responsible for the first project.
As a result the project is staffed, with the exception of several new posi-
tions, and is proceeding satisfactorily. The project will be cofinanced by
IDA and the Kuwait Fund (US$1.2 million equivalent) on a parallel basis. As
formalities regarding conditions of credit effectiveness including the effect-
iveness of the Kuwait Fund Loan, have not yet been completed, the terminal
date for effectiveness has been postponed from March 31 to May 28, 1976. In
addition, during negotiations between the Kuwait Fund and the Government of
Burundi in January 1976, the project was somewhat modified in that the Kuwait
Fund agreed to finance the construction of 10 coffee washing stations (against
four as previously envisaged). The coffee research component, which was initially
to be financed by the Kuwait Fund, is now expected to be carried out with
assistance from Belgium.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

675           8.5         100
The IDA credit of US$6.0 and the Abu Dhabi Fund loan of
US$1.0 million will finance foreign exchange costs
(US$5.7 million ) and a portion of local costs, or about
82 percent of project costs net of taxes. About US$2.0
of the proceeds of the IDA Credit and the proceeds of
the Abu Dhabi Fund Loan will be channeled by Government
to RDS through BNDE. The remainder will be administered
directly by government agencies. Retroactive financing
in the amount of US$150,000 is recommended to cover
the project expenses from February 1,1976.
Procurement
Arrangements:        Fishing equipment (outboard motors, lamps, nets,
etc) and fish processing equipment (US$0.8 million)
will be purchased on the basis of price quotations
solicited after international advertising in an
international fishing journal and notification
to embassies in Bujumbura. Vehicles and other
equipment will be procured on the basis of price
quotations from local suppliers offering adequate
guarantees of service and spare parts. Fishing boats
(US$0.7 million) will be manufactured locally. Civil
works (US$0.38 million) which are too small to attract
international contractors, will be carried out by
force account or by local contractors following local
competitive bidding. Consultant services (US$0.4
million) and technical services (US$1.5 million) will be
procured in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines.
Proceeds of the IDA Credit and the Abu Dhabi Fund Loan
for fishing equipment and materials, plant equipment,
vehicles and supplies will be simultaneously disbursed
in the proportion of 56 percent and 44 percent, res-
pectively, of the foreign exchange cost or 48 percent
and 37 percent, respectively, of the total costs for
these goods.
