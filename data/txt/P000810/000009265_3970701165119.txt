CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower               : Republic of The Gambia
Beneficiary            : Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC)
Credit Amount         :SDR 6.3 million (US$7.0 million)
Terms                  :Standard
Cofinancing            :ADF (US$4.0 m), IDB (US$4.0 m), and
EDF/EEC (US$2.6 m)
Relending Terms        :Government will onlend full amount of
US$7.0 million at 8.5Z interest per annum repayable
over 20 years including 5 years grace period.
Project Description   :The project will (a) expand the water supply
facilities in the Greater Banjul area;
(b) rehabilitate and expand public water supplies
in seven provincial urban areas; (c) improve the
electricity supply distribution system in Greater
Banjul; and (d) assist GUC to become a financially
viable public utility and to improve service to its
existing and new customers.
Project Benefits        The project will provide and/or improve, directly
and Risks             or indirectly, the water supply to 295,000 people
in Greater Banjul and to 25,000 people in seven
provincial urban areas as well as improve the
reliability of electricity supplies for 47,000
people in Banjul. The project will help the
principal sector institution, GUC, develop as a
commercially oriented public utility. This will be
achieved by improved financial performance and the
institutionalization of training across its
departments and at all levels of operation. The
main risks are if there is an interruption in the
technical assistance program currently being
undertaken with German financing and if the Gambian
Government intervenes in GUC's routine affairs or
withholds approval of timely tariff increases.
Steps are being taken to minimize these risks: the
Gambian Government has requested the German
Government to continue the on-going technical
assistance; and assurances were obtained during
negotiations on the composition of GUC's Board to
make it more resistant to political pressure and to
ensure that tariffs are approved in a timely
manner.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.01      Largely due to rapid population growth, water and electricity
demand in urban centers throughout The Gambia has increased rapidly in
recent years. To meet this demand, the Government of the Republic of The
Gambia requested the Bank's assistance in 1983 to finance a water supply
project which had been prepared by consultants under Islamic Development
Bank (ID8) financing. The main focus was intended to be Greater Banjul
(comprising Banjul, the Kombos and Brikana), the major urban area, but
breakdowns in several of the provincial urban water supply systems led to
the inclusion of a rehabilitation component for these systems based on a
study carried out by a Bank consultant. The benefits derived from the
electricity distribution component in the Energy Credit (CR.1187-GM of
November 1981) led to a request for further rehabilitation work and
augmentation of the electricity distribution system in Greater Banjul.
1.02      The project, therefore, comprises three main physical components
- Greater Banjul water supply expansion, provincial urban centers water
supply rehabilitation, and Greater Banjul electricity supply reinforcement
and rehabilitation. The project will be implemented by the Gambia
Utilities Corporation (GUC), which provides water and electricity services
to urban centers in The Gambia. Working capital for GUC has also been
included to facilitate bulk purchases of fuel oil; this should result in
considerable cost savings and provide a breathing space for the Government
and GUC in obtaining foreign exchange for fuel. The project would also
provide technical assistance to complement the ongoing institutional
strengthening of GUC being carried out under the Federal Republic of
Germany (FRG) financing through Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit
(GTZ).
1.03     Although other donors are involved in GUC's activities, IDA can
play a significant role, not only by providing needed physical facilities
to meet water demand and to improve power supply distribution, but also by
assisting with aid co-ordination in the sector.
II. WATER SUPPLY, SANITATION AND ELECTRICITY SECTORS
A. Sector Overview
2.01      Development of potable water supply, sanitation and electricity
supply in The Gambia is described in Annexes 2-1 to 2-3. With a seven-
month dry season, the provision of an adequate water supply is perceived by



-2-
the population of The Gambia (697,000 in 1983) as a high priority.
Groundwater is generally available in sufficient quantities ard is the
supply source for all potable water supplies in the country.
2.02      Relying exclusively on imported fuel oil, electric power
generation is confined to the urban areas. Demand has rapidly increased
and exceeds firm generation capacity.
2.03      Water and electricity supplies have been characterized by a lack
of consistent planning and development. In 1985 about 252 and 65Z of the
cash cost of producing each gallon of water and unit of electricity,
respectively, was attributable to the cost of fuel oil which had to be
purchased with foreign exchange. With an economy of limited foreign
exchange earning potential, it is essential that appropriate tariff
policies be adopted to ensure that water and electricity are used
efficiently.
2.04      The proposed project, in addition to providing urgently needed
expansion and rehabilitation of physical facilities, has been formulated to
complement other technical assistance (para 1.02) in order to continue the
improvement in the institutional aspects of the provision of water and
electricity in The Gambia.
B. Sector Organization and the Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC)
2.05      The Gambia Utilities Corporation (GUC), the principal
organization in the sector, was created by an Act of Parliament in 1972 for
the generation, transmission, supply and distribution of electricity as
well as the provision, distribution and conservation of the supply of water
for public, domestic and industrial purposes. In 1983 responsibilities for
sewerage and sewage disposal were legally added to its portfolio. GUC also
operates a small bottled gas activity. GUC was created out of a department
of its present parent Ministry, the Ministry of Works and Communications
(MWC). The Ministry of Water Resources and Environment (MWRE) is
responsible for agricultural water needs and rural domestic water supplies,
met mainly through wells and boreholes. Sanitation in rural areas is the
responsibility of the Ministry of Local Government and Lands (MLGL) through
its Community Development Department. The basic sector framework is
appropriate for The Gambia.
2.06      GUC is governed by a Board of Directors, but the Minister of
Works and Communications is entitled to give the Board written directions
of a general nature as to the discharge of its functions in relation to
matters which affect the public interest.  The Minister of Works and
Communications, in consultation with or on the approval of the Minister of
Finance, is also responsible for all major financial policy decisions and
there is often reference to the Cabinet on sensitive issues such as
proposals for staff redundancy and tariff increases. The Board comprises



- 3 -
seven persons plus the Managing Director of GUC. The GIUC Act of 1972
specifies that membership should cover a wide spectrum of interests and
experience to represent industrial and domestic consumers and should draw
on public utility, financial and administrative skills. In fact, the
members of the present Board are all civil servants from either Government
departments or parastatals. During credit negotiations, the Government
agreed to amend the composition of the Board in accordance with the 1972
Act by June 30, 1986 (para 6.01 (a)(i)). Meetings of the Board are held at
least quarterly to consider matters of policy. The Managing Director, who
is appointed by the Minister of Works and Communications, is GUC's chief
executive having responsibility over all acts and proceedings of the
Corporation and its staff. Because of GUC's poor performance in the past,
there was a perceived need for Government intervention in operational
matters, but as GUC's performance has improved, Government interference has
decreased.
2.07      Organizationally, GUC has six main divisions/departments
reporting to the Managing Director - the three operating divisions for
Water, Electricity and Sewerage plus the Finance, Sales (Commercial), and
Personnel Departments (Annex 2-4). The Internal Auditor and Transportation
Manager also report directly to the Managing Director. Operationally, the
Electricity and Water Divisions are both split between Greater Banjul and
provincial operations. The present organizational structure is
appropriate.
C.  Water Supply Facilities and Levels of Service
2.08      GUC operates reticulated water supply systems in Greater Banjul
and The Gambia's seven provincial urban centers and acts as agent for the
Government in the operation of the water supply systems of six health
centers in outlying areas. The supply source for all urban water supplies
is groundwater. Private hand-dug wells have met a large part of the demand
in the past, but, due to such factors as rapid urbanization and drought
conditions, the yield from these relatively shallow wells has decreased and
there has been an increasing reliance on GUC's systems. In the Greater
Banjul area about half the population of 212,000 is supplied by GUC from
three borehole fields in the Banjul peninsula developed between 1958 and
1979 with a total yield of 15,900 m3 per day. In the area there are also
two small systems each with production in the range of 450 to 650 m3 per
day. As they are only capable of meeting a fraction (less than 25%) of the
water demand in the two urban areas they serve, Yundum/Lamin and Brikama,
there is considerable unmet demand in these areas. Each of the seven
provincial urban water supply systems has its own supply source (borehole)
and distribution system. The yield from each of the boreholes is capable
of supplying additional consumers. At present only about half of each
provincial center's population is being served (Annex 2-1, para 4). The
boreholes which only supply the health centers also have spare capacity.

2.09      Following the development of the third borehole field in 1979.
GUC was able to provide a 24-hour per day supply in the Greater Banjul area
up to 1984. However, since then increasingly severe water restrictions
have been imposed during the dry season (November to May) due to
accelerating demand (see chart of water demand and production capacity in
Annex 2-5). While the groundwater is generally of excellent
bacteriological quality, groundwater throughout the country is aggressive
to varying degrees, and iron and manganese are sometimes a problem.
Treatment, aeration at one treatment plant and lime dosing at the other, is
carried out to reduce the acidity of the water in the Greater Banjul
system. The supply from several of the provincial urban systems has been
unreliable partly due to pipelines which fail due to the corrosive nature
of the water but also breakdowns in power generators.
2.10      In late 1984, 410 (or somewhat more than 6%) of the 6,420
individual connections to the GUC water supply systems were in the
provinces. About half of the population supplied in the urban areas (or
28% of their total population) is supplied through standpipes. All
supplies, including standpipes, are metered. Although there are certain
aspects of metering which need upgrading, GUC has an adequate number of
installed meters and records to provide a comprehensive picture of present
and past water usage. With the exception of some fully plumbed premises in
the Fajara area, the per capita consumption and other uses of water are not
excessive. Consequently, it is not possible to defer construction of the
project by adoption of conservation measures.
2.11      In the rural areas, the traditional domestic supply source has
been hand dug wells. Usually unlined, these wells are a major health risk
and often run dry during the dry season. Over the last ten years, several
hundred wells, lined and dug to an adequate depth, and boreholes have been
financed by several donor agencies to provide a reliable supply to over 60%
of the 1,000 or so villages with populations greater than 100 people in
The Gambia. These rural water supply programs are continuing, but the
issue of maintenance has not yet been dealt with satisfactorily.
2.12      The GUC operated water supply systems and rural water supply are
described in more detail in Annex 2-1.
D. Sanitation Facilities and Levels of Service
2.13      The only piped sewerage system in the country serves six tourist
hotels in the Bakau/Fajara area and was financed by the IDA assisted
Tourism and Infrastructure Project (CR.602-GM of December 1975). Sewage is
pumped to oxidation ponds which treat the sewage at low cost. Foul waste
disposal in Banjul city and the other urban areas is through a mixture of
collection of waste through a "pail" system, septic tanks and pit latrines.
The Government is concerned about the public health dangers and nuisance
arising from the present mixing of drainage and septic tank discharges and



has commenced construction of a piped sewerage system (financed by the
African Development Fund (ADF), the Federal Republic of Germany through
Kreditanstalt flr Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the European Development Fund
(EDF)) covering the whole of the city and with an ocean outfall.
Legislation has been enacted requiring each premise in the city to be
connected to the water supply and sewerage system, and a revolving fund
(financed by EDF) will be established to assist customers in financing the
connections. Nonetheless, the rate at which premises will be connected is
uncerta'n.
2.14      Sanitation in the rural areas comprises a few septic tanks, a
large number of pit latrines and defecation in the open. Odor and fly free
ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines have been introduced as pilot
projects in several villages. MLGL is currently preparing a demonstration
program to introduce health education and community participation through
rehabilitation of wells and construction of VIP latrines at 50 schools
throughout the country. More details on the sanitation sector are provided
in Annex 2-2.
E. Electricity Supply Facilities and Levels of Service
2.15      The energy sector of The Gambia was reviewed in 1983 as part of
the UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Assessment Program (Report No.4743-GM of
November 1983). Production of electricity is based on imported diesel.
GUC operates three power stations in Greater Banjul. The newest and main
power station at Kotu was commissioned in 1981 and expanded in 1984. It is
equipped with three generating sets which have a total capacity of 12.8 MW.
Firm capacity is 6.8 MW. The former main power station at Half Die has one
generating set with a capacity of 0.5 MW, but it is now only used in
emergencies. The Brikama station has two generating sets with a combined
capacity of 0.7 MW. The electricity production and distribution facilities
for Greater Banjul are described more fully in Annex 2-3. In the
provinces, GUC operates small generating plants similar to the ones in
Brikama to supply six provincial centers and four of the government-owned
health centers. Many of the sets are over ten years old. As a result,
frequent and lengthy breakdowns were common until a rehabilitation program
was undertaken in 1984 by the UK Overseas Development Agency (ODA).
2.16      Until the Kotu Power Station was completed in 1981, irregular
load shedding was frequent and caused many customer complaints. Since
then, the expansion of installed capacity has enabled a regular pattern of
load shedding to be established when required. GUC now supplies
electricity countrywide through about 11,900 connections. Of these,
approximately 1,600 connections are in the provinces and 10,300 in Greater
Banjul of which again about 5,000 are in Banjul city. Greater Banjul
electricity sales account for 95% of GUC's electricity revenues. Peak hour
electricity demand in Greater Banjul is 8.5 MW. Because of overloaded



- 6 -
distribution lines and transformers, GUC operates a very restrictive policy
on new connections. Many potential customers, who are awaiting
connections, would in total add a further 1.65 MW to demand. GUC has
started to rehabilitate parts of its distribution system under IDA
(para 2.26) and KfW (US$0.8 million) financing.
F. Operation and Maintenance
2.17      Better operation and maintenance of both its water and power
supply systems have improved the reliability of GUC's supplies in recent
years in the Greater Banjul area, particularly since the commissioning of
Kotu Power Station in 1981. Prior to this, there were major breakdowns,
partiLA.arly in the power supply, caused by a major explosion in 1977 at
Half Die, lack of financing for spare parts, inadequately trained staff and
poor maintenance procedures. The technical assistance experts of GTZ and
KfW (para 1.02) have contributed significantly to this improvement, and
operation and maintenance systems are now in place for the major water and
power plants.
2.18      There is a general lack of tools and equipment for the repair of
burst water mains and service connections and the carrying out of simple
mechanical jobs. Pipes and materials for mains extensions and new service
connections are bought on an ad hoc basis from local suppliers, which
causes GUC to pay considerably more than if purchased in bulk.
Unaccounted-for water is relatively low at 202 of the water produced, but
provision of leakage detection meters on the outlets of all storage tanks
would enable GUC to monitor the performance of its distribution system more
closely and perhaps reduce the percentage still further.
2.19      Problems of inadequate operation and maintenance of water and
power supply equipment in the provincial urban centers have been
particularly acute due to lack of predominantly imported spare parts and
the relative remote location of the centers (para 2.15). Rehabilitation of
the power generation units in 1984 under ODA financing also improved water
supply, as the units provide the power for the borehole pumps.
2.20      The Water Supply Division of GUC does not have adequate office
accommodation or store facilities either in the Greater Banjul area or in
the provinces. Communication equipment, particularly essential for work in
the provinces is presentlv being upgraded under GTZ assistance. About half
of the Water Supply Division's vehicles are more than five years old and
need to be replaced.
G. Manpower and Training
2.21      GUC employs approximately 600 permanent and 400 temporary staff.
The majority of the permanent staff are employed in the Electricity
Division (360), with Water (90), Transport (50), Administration and Finance



(100) accounting for the remainder. Most of the "temporary" workers have
been employed for many years, and their functions and cost are to be
re-!iewed as part of a 1985 Government directive to take measures, including
streamlining staff, to reduce costs.
2.22      Manpower planning and personnel management are ineffective.  A
?ersonnel Department has been functioning for about two years with the
P sonnel Manager also responsible for training, but little or no progress
1.rs been made to identify and implement effective personnel policies. Job
'escriptions are incomplete or non-existent for the various positions
within the organization. There is a need to hire, assign and promote
employees on the basis of qualifications and requirements of the job.
2.23      Despite an overall favorable job market, it is reported to be
difficult to recruit qualified candidates because of low salaries and the
general adverse attitude of educated youth toward starting in lower level
positions. Despite these difficulties, qualified counterparts have been
provided to the GTZ and KfW financed expatriates. The German financed
technical assistance has been working well since commencement in 1981/82.
The strategy followed has been to start out with an expatriate expert in a
line position and local staff member as deputy, followed by the local staff
being counterpart and then a final phase during which the local staff is in
the line position with the expatriate in the role of advisor. A total of
eight expatriates has been financed by GTZ and KfW-the Managing Director
of GUC, four senior staff in the Electricity Division and three senior
staff in the Water Supply Division. These expatriates are mainly
specialists concerned with the teclinical side of GUC's operations. The
technical assistance is now entering its final phase, and in three
positions local staff have already taken over the line positions.
2.24      Functional illiteracy is a major constraint to improving the
efficiency and productive output of GUC employees. Indications are that
approximately 50% of the supervisory staff (including foremen, assistant
superintendents, and a few superintendents) and 90% of the lower level
staff (including skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers) are
illiterate. This shortcoming affects all aspects of the management and
operation of the utility, and is a severe constraint on staff training and
upgrading acLivities. Both the Government and GUC are aware of the need to
improve literacy, and the first of a series of Government-sponsored
literacy courses for GUC staff is underway.
2.25      Training operations are primarily conducted through technical
assistance provided by GTZ at the work station and at the Gambia Technical
Training Institute (7TTI). While on-the-job training of counterparts has
been successful, training of other staff within GUC is not clearly defined
or organized and is not implemented or evaluated on a task-by-task basis.
In addition to in-house training, five power station superintendents are
attending a one-year training program in Germany, while released time
courses have been conducted for linesmen and pump operators at GTTI.

H. The Bank's Involvement in the Water Supply and Power Sectors
2.26      The Bank has not previously participated specifically in a water
supply project in The Gambia and has only recently become involved in the
power sector. The initial involvement of IDA with GUC was under the
Tourism and Infrastructure Project (CR.602-GM of December 1975), which was
completed in 1982. That project successfully installed a sewerage system
to serve the newly developed tourism area at Kotu, provided technical
assistance to support the Managing Director of GUC following a complete
breakdown of power supplies, and helped to restore the supply in 1979 and
1980. More recently GUC has been the e ecuting agency for the power
component of the SDR 1.3 million Energy Credit (CR.1187-GM of November
1981) under which IDA is financing transformers, cable and spare parts with
which GUC has begun rehabilitation of the Banjul electricity transmission
and distribution system. Reduced line losses are already in evidence from
this assistance and the rehabilitation component of the project has been
completed close to che original expectations. To reduce the present gap
between water supply and demand, a borehole rehabilitation component for
the Sukuta borehole field which will increase the water supply capacity for
the Greater Banjul area from 17,000 to 21,100 m3 per day has been included
in the Urban Management and Development Project (CR.1443-GM of February
1984). IDA is committed to contribute US$11.5 million to the project which
is proceeding well.
2.27      The Bank's strategy in The Gambia focuses on assisting the
country in developing a macroeconomic policy framework that would lead to
sustainable growth and supporting projects aimed at maintaining and
rehabilitating key economic, physical and social infrastructure. The
proposed project is consistent with this strategy. As indicated above
(para 2.09), there is an urgent need to rehabilitate and extend the water
supply system in Greater Banjul and the provincial urban centers where
water sLortages occur frequently. In 1983, the Government asked the Bank
to assist in the preparation of the proposed project, which is included in
the country's current Development Plan (1981/82 - 1985/86). Water and
electricity supply operdtions under GUC have become more efficient during
the Development Plan period largely due to KfW and GTZ financed technical
assistance and IDA financed spare parts. GUC's financial performance has
been very poor, mainly as a result of low tariffs. The Corporation is also
overstaffed, particularly at the semi-skilled and unskilled worker level,
while there is a shortage of aualified mid-level staff. The proposed
project would address the above issues. It would assist GUC in preparing a
manpower development plan, streamlining the workforce and implementing an
intensive training program. In addition, under a Special Project
Preparation Facility (SPPF), consultants have recently been recruited to
assist the National Investment Board (the oversight agency for the Public
Enterprise sector) in consolidating public enterprise, economic and
financial information. The consultants will also assist three key public
enterprises, of which GUC is one, in preparing comprehensive enterprise



- 9 -
rehabilitation plans and draft performance contracts. The performance
contract for GUC will set out objectives and performance targets for GUC
including the administrative procedures for affecting tariff changes, and
would define the mutual responsibilities of Government and GUC. The
proposed project has been designed to consolidate and complement the
continuing effort to improve the performance of one of the key public
enterprises.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
3.01      The main objectives of the proposed project are:
(a)  To prov±de an essential service to the people of Greater
Banjul by increasing water supplies in areas of suppressed
demand and expanding the public water supply system;
(b)  To provide improved water supply service in seven provincial
urban centers by rehabilitation and limited expansion of the
existing systems;
(c)  To reduce line losses through the reinforcement and
rehabilitation of the electricity distribution system in
Greater Banjul; and
Cd)  To assist GUC in achieving financial viability through
improved operational efficiency and financial management by
Ci) implementing tariffs for water and electricity which
will permit GUC to initially achieve full cost recovery and
ultimately a reasonable rate of return on fixed assets;
Cii) designing and implementing a system of human resources
management (including training) within GUC which will enable
GUC to utilize staff resources effectively; and
(iii) providing working capital support to GUC for the
purchase of about a nine-month supply of diesel fuel.
B. Project Description
3.02      The project will expand the water supply system of the Greater
Banjul area by about 60Z from 21,100 to 33,800 m3 per day which will enable
an increasing percentage of the population to be provided with potable
water - from 51% of the 1983 population (212,377) to 86% of the projected



- 10 -
1993 population (343,000). Although ti.ere will be a substantial increase
in the percentage of population having access to safe public water supply,
the composition of the supply pattern will remain very much the same with
about 50% of the population served relying on public standpipes, 40% on
shared yard taps and 10% on individual connections.
3.03      In the provinces, the project will rehabilitate and expand the
water supply systems in the seven provincial urban centers (Farafenni,
Basse, Georgetown, Bansang, Mansakonko, Kerewan and Barra-Kanuma) to meet
projected demand up to 1995 in six of the centers and 1990 in Kerewan.  The
share of the population supplied is projected to increase from 56% of the
1983 population (21,000) to 90% of the projected 1993 population (28,000).
3.04      Rehabilitation and reinforcement of the Banjul electricity
distribution will enable CUC to provide a considerably more reliable
electricity supply, while at the same time allowing GUC to decrease its
electricity distribution system line losses from the present 18% to about
15%. Provision of funds for a nine-month supply of diesel fuel for GUC, in
conjunction with recent and planned tariff increases, will enable GUC to
accumulate funds for future bulk purchases of diesel fuel at advantageous
prices.
3.05      The project will provide 48 man-months of technical asuistance to
assist GUC in upgrading its institutional capability in manpower
development, management accounting (including cost accounting), and
internal audit as well as to introduce systems for improved electrical and
mechanical maintenance in the provincial center systeus. The terms of
reference for these technical assistance experts have neen reviewed with
GUC's management. The project will also finance implementation of training
programs, provision of operational equipment and depot facilities.
3.06      A more detailed description of the project components is
presented in Annex 3-1, and a complete description and justification for
the project including the approach adopted to ensure that project
objectives would be met in a cost efficient manner are presented in
Annex 3-2. Manpower development and training, forming part of the project,
are detailed in Annex 3-3.
C. Project Costs and Financing
3.07      The estimated total cost of the project, net of taxes, is
US$19.4 million equivalent. The estimated foreign cost component is
US$15.1 million, representing 78% of total cost. Cost estimates are in
January 1986 prices. Estimated rates of inflation on foreign costs have
been applied to both foreign and local costs. This assumes that the
exchange rate will be adjusted for variation between foreign and local
rates of inflation. The project will be financed by IDA (US$7.0 million);
ADF (US$4.0 million); IDB (US$4.0 million); EDF (US$2.6 million); and the



- 11 -
Government or, preferably, GUC (US$1.8 million) (para 4.11). The IDA
Credit will be made available to the Government which will onlend the
credit proceeds to GUC for 20 years including five years of grace at 8.5%
per annum. Execution of the onlending agreement between the Government and
GUC, satisfactory to IDA, will be a condition of credit effectiveness
(para 6.02 (a)). Because of GUC's relatively weak financial position, IDA
would not object to the Government's passing on to GUC other project
financing on the terms accorded by the co-financiers. Execution of lending
agreements with all co-financiers will also be a condition of credit
effectiveness (para 6.02 (b)). Detailed cost estimates and the financing
plan together with major assumptions are shown in Annex 3-4.
D. Project Implementation and Present Status of Project
3.08      Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of GUC,
assisted by qualified consultants. There is adequate professional
experience within GUC to provide the necessary overall control. Project
co-ordination would be assigned initially (for a period of 12 months) to
the GTZ financed water supply advisor, assisted by a qualified Gambian
engineer, who will subsequently assume full responsibility.
3.09      Land requirements are minimal and, as all land is owned by the
Government, no difficulties are expected in the acquisition of land and
rights of way. No structures have to be built in congested areas. Project
design for the Greater Banjul water supply expansion is based on a
feasibility study completed in 1984 and financed by IDB. Proposals for the
selection of consultants to carry out detailed design, which will be
financed under CR.1443-GM, are being evaluated. It is expected that the
consultant will start work in July 1986 and that the detailed design,
including bid documents, will be completed by July 1987. Award of
equipment and material contracts should be made by July 1988. The supply
source works and transmission pipelines are expected to be completed with
installation of the distribution pipelines and service connections
continuing through substantial project completion forecast for June 1993.
The project design for the provincial centers water supply rehabilitation
and the Banjul electricity distribution reinforcement is based on studies
cœrried out by a Bank consultant and GUC, respectively. Because both of
these components are straightforward, no delays in procurement or
implementation are expected. The implementation schedule for the whole
project is given in Annex 3-5. The implementation period for this project
is estimated at seven years, based on the country profile for The Gambia.
It is, however, possible that the implementation period could be reduced to
five years. This would result in project costs being reduced by about 6%,
from US$19.4 million to US$18.1 million. While costs would be incurred
earlier, the flow of benefits would also begin more quickly. Thus, impact
on the projected internal financial rates of return (IFRR) for the project
would be minimal (para 5.06).

3,11      Goods and civil works procured with IDA financing will be under
contracts awarded in accordance with Bank procedures, on the basis of
international competitive bidding, local competitive bidding or
international shopping, except where otherwise agreed with IDA. Under IDA
financed contracts, goods manufactured locally would be given a preference
margin of up to 15% or the applicable customs duty, whichever is less,
while eligible domestic contractors will be given a 7.5% preference margin.
With the exception of the consultant services and technical assistance
directly related to the provincial water systems which will be procured
under EDF procedures, technical assistance and consultancy services will be
procured in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. All other co-financed
goods and services are expected to follow procurement procedures applicable
to the specific sources of financing.  Procurement decisions for goods
whose estimated costs exceed US$100,000 equivalent and for civil works



- 13 -
whose estimated costs exceed US$200,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA's
prior review. Government intends to exempt all project procurement from
taxes and transfer payments.
F. Disbursements
3.12      The project is expected to be substantially completed by June 30,
1993 and the proposed credit closing date is June 30, 1994. The IDA Credit
would be disbursed on the following basis.

Total                         7.00
The estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 3-6; it is
based on the country profile for The Gambia. Disbursement of the component
for working capital to finance about a nine-month supply of diesel fuel
would be contingent upon GUC's having established a procedure acceptable to
the Association for continuing economical bulk purchasing of fuel and
lubricating oil (para 6.03).
3.13      No disbursement applications less than US$30,000 will be accepted
by IDA. IDA would make an initial advance of US$220,000 to a Special
Account (revolving fund) in foreign exchange to be established on terms and
conditions acceptable to IDA. Amounts advanced to this account will be
used to finance small expenditures and amounts withdrawn for payment of
eligible expenditures would be replenished by IDA subject to submissio-. of
satisfactory documentation. A counterpart fund account will be established



- 14 -
as a condition of credit effectiveness (para 6.02 (c)). To be established
with an initial contribution of D 750,000 from GUC, the account will be
replenished when the balance falls below D 150,000.
G. Project Reporting and Auditing
3.14      The project co-ordinator (pars 3.08) will prepare comprehensive
progress reports, whose format and timing will be agreed with IDA. on the
various project components. Auditors acceptable to IDA will be employed to
ensure GUC's continued adherence to good accounting policies and practices.
Audit reports will be made available for review by IDA six mouths after the
end of GUC's fiscal year. The Special Account (para 3.13) will also be
audited annually.
IV. GUC FINANCES
A. Past Financial Performance
4.01      Primarily because of low tariffs, GUC's revenue generation has
not been sufficient to cover even cash operating expenses. As a result of
continued operating losses, GUC's capital has been eroded, and at times
GUC's short-term liabilities have exceeded current assets.  While there are
financial benefits to be realized from improvements in GUC's operating
efficiency, especially reducing electricity line losses and excess
staffing, GUC's financial performance is most sensitive to the price of
diesel fuel (gas oil), which accounted for approximately 55% of GUC's cash
operating expenses in FY85. Annexes 4-1 and 4-2 set out GUC's actual
(audited) financial statements for FY83-FY84, estimates for FY85-FY86,
financial projections and underlying assumptions for FY87 through FY94.
4.02      Increases in GUC's non-fuel costs have generally corresponded to
increases in production and inflation. The large increases in FY84 and
FY85 operating costs are primarily due to the effect of the 25% devaluation
of the Dalasi in February 1984 and the strength of the US dollar in which
the cost of diesel fuel is denominated. While electricity generation
increased only 3% in FY84, fuel costs increased by 28%. The following
table summarizes GUC's results of operations and financial position for the
period FY83-FY86.

B. Tariffs
4.03      GUC's current tariff structure is presented in Annex 4-3.
GUC's tariffs reflect a 30% across-the-board increase for both water and
electricity which went into effect on January 1, 1985, as well as the
most recent increases of 15% for water and 6% for electricity which went
into effect on january 1, 1986. This last increase is part of a
three-year phased program of tariff increases approved by the Government
in November 1985 and designed to enable GUC to achieve full cost
recovery. In fact, at the current level of petroleum prices, GUC's
electricity tariff should have more than achieved full cost recovery.
However, on January 20, 1986, the Government took a decision to de-link
the overvalued Dalasi from the pound sterling (it had been artificially
maintained at a level of D 5.00 121.00) and to allow the exchange rate
to be set by the open market. Since January 1986, the Dalasi has



- 16 -
depreciated by about 10OZ. Although the substantial decline in
petroleum prices mitigates the effect of the devaluation, GUC's tariffs
will require further adjustment. In anticipation of this situation, in
its Economic Recovery Program approved in July 1985, the Government
provided for tariff adjustments to pass through to consumers increased
operating costs for those inputs denominated in foreign exchange.
Implementation of appropriate tariff adjustments will be a condition of
credit effectiveness (para 6.02 (d)).
4.04      GUC has historically suffered from delays in obtaining timely
approval of its tariff proposals. The 1972 Act prescribes that tariff
proposals are to be approved by the Minister of Works and Communications
who is required to obtain the agreement of the Hinister of Finance, but
in practice cabinet approval is required to effect tariff increases.
GUC's performance contract (para 2.27) will, inter alia, establish the
administrative procedures to be followed for effecting tariff changes.
In addition, during negotiations assurances were obtained that any
consents and approvals required in relation to GUC's tariff increases
would be given within 45 days after approval by GUC's Board of Directors
(para 6.01 (a)(ii)).
4.05      As noted earlier (para 2.13), construction of a major sewerage
system for the city of Banjul, financed by ADF, EDF and Germany on soft
terms at an estimated cost of US$10.0 million equivalent, has commenced.
The resident population in the city has limited ability to pay for the
scheme because, as the population of Greater Banjul has grown, the
relatively wealthier residents have tended to move to suburban areas
such as Serekunda and Fajara. Hence, many of the population who will be
served by the new sewerage scheme represent the urban segment with the
least ability to pay. Improvement in sewage disposal in the densely
populated Banjul urban area will have a beneficial impact on public
health, but in order to reduce the financial burden on GUC, during
negotiations agreement was reached that:
(a) the Government would renegotiate on-lending terms with
ADF in order to transfer the assets of the new
sewerage system as an equity contribution to GUC's
Sewerage Division (para 6.01 (a)(iii));
(b) the Government would provide subsidies to the extent that
cash operating expenses 1/ exceed revenues from sewerage
1/   Total operating expenses excluding depreciation.



- 17 -
charges generated from the operation of the system 2/,
but that such operating subsidies would be eliminated by
the time the connection program is completed
(para 6.01 (a)(iv)); and
(c) severage charges would be limited to the amount necessary
to cover cash expenses for operation and maintenance of
the system, since in the short to medium term no
expansion of the system will be required
(para 6.01 (b)(i)).
C. Sensitivity to Petroleum Prices
4.06      GUC's operations are dominated by the Electricity Division,
which currently accounts for 65% of connections and over 75% of sales.
In FY85 the cost of gas oil represented about 65Z of the Electricity
Division's and 50% of GUC's total cash operating costs. All fuel is
imported. When sufficient foreign exchange is available, GUC can
purchase fuel at world market prices. More often because of funding
constraints (i.e., lack of foreign exchange), GUC is forced to buy fuel
in rather small quantities at very high prices. GUC also pays internal
handling charges, but is exempt from import duties. Since GUC has no
real alternative to thermal generation, GUC's financial performance will
remain particularly sensitive to petroleum prices. To reduce the degree
of sensitivity, GUC intends to install a 6-8 MW 2-stroke generator
operating on heavy fuel oil, which is estimated to result in substantial
savings (about 40%) on fuel costs per unit produced over 4-stroke
generators operating on diesel oil. In November 1985, the Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA) appraised a project to provide
such a generator. If approved, the Danish Government would provide
grant funding for the project. It is anticipated that the grant
agreement could be signed by summer 1986 and that the contract could be
awarded by the end of 1986. The financial projections presented in
Annex 4-1 are based on the assumption that GUC will commence generation
of its baseload with heavy fuel in FY89. If this is not possible, a
substantial electricity tariff increase 'j5% versus no increase as now
projected) would be required in FY89 for GUC to maintain financial
viability.
2/   This is compatible with the ADF's requirement that the Government
cover the operating deficits of the new sewerage system.



- 18 -
D. Capitalization
4.07      As previously mentioned (para 4.01), GUC's capital has been
substantially eroded as a result of its poor operating performance.
However, in conjunction with the 30% across-the-board tariff increase
effective January 1, 1985, the Government agreed to convert to equity
the debt as of June 30, 1984 owed by GUC to Government for debt service
and fuel oil purchases after offsetting amounts owed by Government to
reimburse GUC for provincial centers' operating losses and to pay its
water charges. GUC still has substantial accrued interest obligations
due to the Government which were not dealt with at the time the debt
offset was effected. Conversion to equity of overdue interest payable
(equivalent to US$2.6 million) is a condition of credit effectiveness
(para 6.02 (e)). After this, in conjunction with adequate tariffs, GUC
should be in a position to deal responsibly with its financial
obligations to the Government and other creditors.
E. Billing and Collection
4.08      GUC operates under a policy of universal metering and, with
some few exceptions, all premises are metered, alt'ough a substantial
number of meters are faulty. All standpipes are metered and the local
government body concerned is responsible for payment. If a meter is
faulty, the consumer is billed on the basis of the highest reading of
the previous three months. Except for quarterly billings of the central
and local governments, customers are billed monthly. Bill preparation
and posting of cash is carried out utilizing outdated bookkeeping
machines. Billing often suffers delays as a result of power cuts and
frequent machine breakdowns which take a long time to repair. In
conjunction with their on-going technical assistance program, GTZ will
provide funds for an automated billing and accounts receivable system,
which will not only improve the timeliness of billing and reduce the
level of manual input required to operate the system, but which will
also allow GUC to easily extract meaningful information from the data
base. GTZ will also provide technical assistance to implement the new
system. Over the last two years GUC has succeeded in fully collecting
its current billings and has even achieved a slight reduction in
arrears. It is anticipated that the new billing and accounts receivable
system, in conjunction with continuing emphasis on improving
collections, should enable GUC to reduce receivables from the current
four months equivalent sales to about two months sales by FY90.
F.   Accounts and Audit
4.09      GUC maintains a manual accrual basis accounting system with
separate income and expense accounts for each of the operating
divisions. Comprehensive financial statements are produced quarterly.
GUC's annual accounts have been independently audited since inception
(1972) by the same international firm of acceontants (Pannell Kerr
Forster) and there have been no qualifications, although the management



- 19 -
letters have highlighted several accounting system weaknesses. Assets
were valued in 1972 and have been periodically revalued using
appropriate local and international indexes since that date. On the
whole, GUC's financial accounting and reporting systems are adequate.
Because there is no professionally qualified Gambian accountant on its
staff, GUC has for the past seven years employed an expatriate chartered
accountant as financial advisor to the Managing Director. To ensure
that GUC's financial accounting capability does not deteriorate, during
negotiations assurances were obtained that GUC will at all times retain
in its employ at least one chartered or equivalently qualified
accountant (para 6.01 (b)(ii)). GUC's management accounting and
internal control, however, need to be strengthened. To this end, the
proposed project will provide 24 man-months of technical assistance and
training in management accounting and internal audit.
G.   Financing Plan
4.10      GUC's financing plan for the project period FY87-FY93 is as
follows:

The capital outlay includes US$7.7 million needed to finance investments
in a heavy fuel generator. Funding would be provided by a grant from
DANIDA to the Government and passed on to GUC as equity. US$8.0 million
for other works represent surplus cash expected to build up during the
later years of project implementation, part of which could be used to
commence Stage I Phase II of the Greater Banjul water supply expansion.
4.11      Under the above projected financing plan, GUC should be able
to provide the equivalent of US$1.8 million of local counterpart funds
required for the proposed project from internal cash generation. GUC's
actual ability to meet the counterpart fund requirements is primarily
dependent on the timely implementation of appropriate tariff increases.
H.   Future Financial Performance
4.12      One of the principal objectives of the project is for GUC to
achieve full cost recovery 3/ on both water and electricity by FY89 and
increasing positive rates of return thereafter. To this end, the
Project Agreement specifies that GUC should achieve a positive rate of
return from FY89, with increasing rates of return on annually revalued
net fixed assets to reach by FY93 a minimum of 3% for water supply and
8% for electricity (para 6.01 (b)(iii)) 4/.
4.13      Detailed financial projections and the assumptions, including
electricity and water tariffs, on which they are based are presented in
Annexes 4-1 and 4-2 and are summarized below:
3/   Total operating expenses including depreciation, which exceeds debt
service requirements.
4/   The rate of return covenant for sewerage set forth under the Energy
Credit (CR.1187-GM of November 1981) which requires an 8% rate of
return on net fixed assets will prevail until the program for domestic
connections to the new system hds been completed (para 4.05).

I. Cash Flow Impact cn Government
4.14      It is evident that GUC's developing and sustaining financial
viability will also considerably benefit the Government, which in the
past has had to support GUC financially. The improvement in GUC's
financial performance envisaged under the proposed project would
decrease and ultimately eliminate the financial drain of GUC on the
Government. The projected impact of the proposed project and associated
conditionalities on the Government are summarized below:

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Project Benefits, Poverty Impact and Affordability
5.01      A more detailed analysis dealing with the project's benefits,
the economic analysis, the economic rates of return and related
sensitivity analysis, and tariff structure and affordability is
presented in Annex 5.



- 23 -
5.02      The proposed project would improve the availability and
reliability of water supply in Greater Banjul and seven provincial urban
centers and of electricity in Greater Banjul.
5.03      By increasing access to safe water, the water supply components
would yield health and productivity benefits to residents in Greater Banjul
and in seven provincial centers where waterborne diseases account for about
8Z of reported morbidity. About 45% of the water components' beneficiaries
have incomes at or below the urban property threshold. Alternatively, when
measured in terms of project benefits accruing to the poor, the percentage
of water consumed by the urban poor is about 36% of total incremental water
produced by the project.
5.04      A survey of urban household income was carried out in April 1985
as part of project preparation activities in order to ascertain the ability
of consumers to pay for water services. The results of the survey indicate
that current water tariffs are affordable. Future water tariff increases
will be set in consultation with IDA (para 6.01 (b)(iii)) and particular
attention will be paid to the structure to assure affordability. During
project preparation GUC's domestic connection policy was reviewed; the
issue is complex and will be the subject of discussions during project
implementation.
5.05       The electricity component consists of rehabilitating and
reinforcing the distribution network in Greater Banjul with a consequent
reduction in power line losses from the current level of about 18% to about
15%. Without this component, the system would continue to degrade and
losses would increase over current levels. -ae primary benefits of the
upgrading would be to The Gambia's economy through an increase in the
percentage of power generated available for productive use. Other major
benefits would be improved quality of life and increased productivity for
residents who would derive direct and indirect benefits from more reliable
electricity services. Indirect benefits also include a positive impact on
tourism, a major potential source of foreign exchange in The Gambia.
5.06      Internal financial rates of return were calculated for each of
the project's three main physical components. Expected incremental
revenues accruing to GUC were used as a proxy for minimum economic
benefits, and costs include all incremental capital and recurrent costs.
The internal financial rates of return (IFRR) so calculated are as follows:
Greater Banjul water supply. 11%; provincial centers water supply, 7%; and
Greater Banjul electricity rehabilitation, 19%. Although the 7% IFRR for
the provincial centers water supply component is less than the 10% assumed
cost of capital, the methodology adopted for calculating IFRRs - i.e.,
using incremental revenues as a proxy for benefits - does not capture the
economic benefits arising from improvements in health and time savings nor
the consumers' surplus. In view of this, the IFRR iB considered
acceptable.

B. Project Risks
5.07      The proposed project represents the first major Bank/IDA
operation in the water supply sector in The Gambia and a continuation of
its involvement, albeit in a relatively small way, in the electricity
sector. The executing agency, GUC, is at present managing its technical
operations in a satisfactory manner, but it still relies on expatriate
technical assistance. Local staff have begun to fill management positions,
and under the project a manpower evaluation, development and training
program will be implemented. While GUC will probably remain vulnerable to
the occasional loss of qualified staff and the significant effect they may
have on its operations (particularly because of the relatively small size
of its trained staff), the manpower development plan should reduce this
risk. Technically, the water supply and electricity components are
straightforward and involve little risk. The project is not expected to
produce any environmental risks. A study undertaken to assess the risks of
pollution to the Greater Banjul aquifer concluded that the aquifer is not
currently being affected by saline intrusion or infiltration of sewage but
should be monitored closely. The project includes a study to carry out the
required monitoring.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION
A. Agreements
6.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from:
(a) Government of The Gambia that it will:
(i)    reconstitute the GUC's Board of Directors in
accordance with the GUC Act of 1972 by June 30,
1986 (para 2.06);
(ii)   provide any consents and approvals required for
tariff increases to become effective within 45
days after approval by GUC's Board (para 4.04);
(iii) renegotiate on-lending terms with ADF in order to
transfer the assets of the new Banjul sewerage
system as an equity contribution to GUC
(para 4.05 (a)); and
(iv)   provide sewerage subsidies to the extent that cash
operating expenses exceed cash generated from the
operation of the Banjul sewerage system, but
eliminate operating subsidies by the time the
connection program is completed (para 4.05 (b)).



- 25 -
(b) Gambia Utilities Corporation that it will:
(i)    limit sewerage charges to the amount necessary tc
cover the cash costs of operating and maintaining
the system (para 4.05 (c));
(ii)   retain at all times in its employ at least one
chartered or equivalently qualified accountant
(para 4.09); and
(iii)  manage its operations and set tariffs, in
consultation with IDA, so as to achieve full cost
recovery for water supply and electricity by FY89
and thereafter to achieve positive rates of return
on revalued net fixed assets, increasing to 3% for
water supply and 8% for electricity by FY93
(paras ;.12 and 5.04).
B. Conditions of Credit Effectiveness
6.02      The following conditions of credit effectiveness were agreed
upon during negotiations:
(a) execution by the Government and GUC of an agreement,
acceptable to IDA, for onlending IDA funds (para 3.07);
(b) execution of lending agreements with all co-financiers
(para 3.07);
(c) establishment of a counterpart fund account with an
initial deposit of D 750,000 for the project (para 3.13);
(d) adJustment of water and electricity tariffs to effect a
pass-through of increased operating costs related to
devaluation of the Dalasi (para 4.03); and
(e)  conversion to equity of overdue interest ow,  by GUC to
the Government (para 4.07).
C. Condition of Disbursement
6.03      As a condition of disbursement for the US$2.0 million
equivalent working capital component (para 3.12), it was agreed that GUC
would establish a plan for accumulating funds to continue bulk
purchasing arrangements for gas oil.



- 26 -
D. Recommendation
6.04      Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the proposed
project would be suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 6.3 million
(US$7.0 million) at the prevailing terms and conditions.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
A. Background
1.        The Gambia has two seasons - rainy and dry.  The rainy season is
usually of about five to six months' duration, from May to October, during
vhich average rainfall is 1,115 mm in the Greater Banjul area. During the
dry season little or no rain falls. Although rainfall since 1968 has been
less than average, rainfall since 1977 has been considerably less than
average. The three years 1980-1982 have been the three driest years on
record, with average rainfall of only 720 mm per annum.
2.        A sand aquifer underlies the whole of The Gambia.  At a
relatively shallow depth of 20 to 30 m, its yield is sufficient for potable
water supply. While the groundwater is of excellent bacteriological
quality; it is often corrosive, and in some locations iron and manganese
cause problems. Because of the drought, it is reported that groundwater
levels throughout the country have dropped in the last few years by an
average of 5 m below the previous lowest levels. In the Greater Banjul
area, the aquifer water level is dropping about 1 m per year. A study in
1984/85 (financed under CR.1443-GN) reviewed the risk of pollution and
saline intrusion and concluded that if reasonable precautions are taken
with respect to the location of boreholes and the quantities abstracted,
there would be no significant risk. Located close to the shoreline, the
Fajara borehole field is the most exposed to the possibility of saline
intrusion. The study concluded that there is no risk of saline intrusion
for the Sukuta and Wellingara borehole fields. In the case of the Fajara
field, pumping from the borehole most likely to be affected has been
reduced in line with the study's recommendations.
B. Urban Water Supply Systems
3.        All urban water supply systems are the responsibility of GUC.
Aside from the systems in the Greater Banjul area, seven provincial urban
centers have piped water supply systems and six health centers are also
served (locations shorn on IBRD Map No. 19167R).
4.          As shown in the following table, the Greater Banjul system
dominates GUC's activities.

a/ Full capacity cannot be used because of lack of distribution capability.
C. Supply Sources
5.        Development of the Greater Banjul water supply system started
in 1916 with provision of piped water from a stream near Abuko in the
Banjul peninsula to supply Fajara/Bakau and Banjul city. The first
boreholes were drilled about 1950 with one borehole at Half Die (in
Banjul city) and four shallower boreholes in Kombo St. Mary. The Abuko
stream supply was abandoned by 1960 because the supply source had a
relatively low yield and was of poor quality water. The associated
distribution network of 5 in. dia cast iron mains laid in Banjul is now
approaching the end of its useful life, and about 3,000 m of
distribution pipelines in the city need to be relaid.
6.        To meet increasing demand from the city and the rapid
urbanization of the adjacent part of the Banjul peninsula, the first
major development of groundwater occurred between 1958 and 1966 at
Fajara, presently supplying 5,450 m9 per day from five boreholes.



- 29 -
ANNEX 2-1
Page 3 of 10
Following this development, the five 1950 boreholes were shut down
because of relatively low yield. Subsequent developments were: the
Sukuta borehole field in 1969, 1977, and 1984 comprising five boreholes 1/
with a reliable yield of 6,800 m3 per day and the Wellingara borehole
field in 1979 comprising five boreholes with a reliable yield of
7,750 m3 per day. Despite this rapid development of supply sources,
the Greater Banjul area has since 1984 suffered from supply re-
strictions because demand is greater than supply capability (see
Annex 2-5 for Forecast of Water Demand and Production Capacity).
7.        In addition to the above-mentioned three major borehole
fields which supply a single system, two small self-contained systems
have been constructed, one at Brikama and the other at Yundum. The
supply source for the Brikama system is a borehole drilled in 1965
whose yield is 650 m3 per day. While three relatively small boreholes
have been drilled in the area of the Yundum, only one drilled in 1979
is operational and has a yield of 450 m3 per day. The yield of both
supply sources is grossly insufficient to meet demand.
8.        Each of the supply sources for the seven provincial urban
centers and six health centers comprises a borehole whose yield is as
shown in the table in para 4 above. With the exception of the Kerewan
borehole, all supply sources are capable of meeting projected demand up
to at least 1995. The supply capability of the Kerewan borehole will
meet projected demand up to 1990.
D. Treatment
9.        Groundwater in The Gambia is acidic and in some areas highly
corrosive with pH values between four and six. However, while causing
corrosion of certain types of pipes and fittings, the acidity is not a
health hazard. Water from the Bansang borehole has the additional
problem of a high iron content which is again not a health hazard but
is aesthetically unpleasing and causes staining of clothes. Provided
boreholes are constructed to exclude surface and shallow groundwater,
the bacteriological quality is excellent. Of the GUC supply sources
only the water from the Fajara, Sukuta and Wellingara borehole fields
is treated to reduce corrosivity. Aeration of the Fajara water is
carried out in a treatment works located close to the borehole field.
Treatment appears satisfactory even though the lime dosing plant is
defective and has not worked for several years. Water from the Sukuta
and Wellingara borehole fields is pumped to a treatment plant at
Serekunda where the water is treated by the addition of lime. The lack
1/   Three of these boreholes (11A, 12A and 17) have been rehabilitated
under CR.1443-GM, the Urban Management and Development Project.



- 30 -
ANNEX 2-1
Page 4 of 10
of treatment and the use of pipes and fittings which are susceptible to
corrosion for the provincial urban centers water supply systems have
led to major problems in the distribution systems, particularly those
of Basse, Georgetown and Mansakonko. The additional safeguard of
chlorination to disinfect the treated water is carried out at the
Fajara and Serekunda treatment works. To provide time for the chlorine
to act, there are contact tanks at both works. The contact tank at the
Serekunda works needs to be increased in size.
E. Distribution Systems
10.       To pump treated water to supply, pumping stations are located
at each of the Fajara (rated capacity 5,500 m3 per day) and Serekunda
treatment works (rated capacity to Serekunda high level - 6,200 m9n per
day and to the Mile 2 pumping station - 5,000 m9 per day).
11.       The hydraulic arrangement of all the systems, excluding the
supply for Banjul city, is that the water is pumped from the supply
source and/or treatment works to elevated steel storage tank(s) whose
top water levels are 15 to 20 a above ground level. The elevated tanks
are located at FP.jara (1,350 ml) and Serekunda (450 ms).  The
Latrikunda tank (450 is) is an additional storage tank within the
Se+ekunda distribution system. The distribution pipeline networks are
supplied from the storage tanks. This arrangement, which results in a
lower and less variable pressure in the distribution system and
consumer fittings than a system which pumps directly to the consumer,
is considered to be the major reason for the low unaccounted-for water.
The supply for Banjul is from the pumping station at Serekunda which
pumps water to the 4,500 m3 ground level tanks at the Mile 2 pumping
station. At that pumping station, booster pumps (rated capacity
9,120 mg per day), pump water to the Albion elevated storage tanks
(1,350 mi) in Banjul city.
12.       For the Greater Banjul, area, the six elevated steel storage
tanks (in four locations) have a total capacity of 3,600 ms. This
capacity is equivalent to about four hours' maximum water demand. In
addition, there is a total of 6,600 mi additional storage in ground
level tanks at Fajara, Serekunda, and the Mile 2 pumping station. The
total storage, equivalent to 12 hours mnxiinu  day demand, is adequate
except in the Kombo St. Mary area. For their limited distribution
systems, the elevated storage at Brikana (450 ma) and Yundum (180 mi)
is adequate.
13.       At each of Bansang, Farafenni, Kerewan and Barre-Kanuma
centers, the present 450 mi provided in elevated steel storage tanks is
adequate for present and future demand. However, the storage at
Mansakonko (60 mi), Georgetown (80m') and Basse (80m') is not adequate
to enable the systems to be operated in the most economic manner.



- 31 -
ANNEX 2-1
Page 5 of 10
14.       With the elevated storage tanks being located at the borehole
site, there are no transmission pipelines in the provincial systems.
In the Greater Banjul system, transmission pipelines have been laid in
conjunction with the expansion of the supply source works in 1958, 1969
and 1977. The old transmission pipelines from the boreholes drilled in
1950 and the surface water supply to Fajara and Banjul city (para 5)
have been abandoned. The present 200-300 mm transmission pipelines
have a total length of 42 km. Pipe materials are asbestos cement and
PVC and the pipelines appear to be in satisfactory condition. Because
of restrictions in the carrying capacity of the single 300 mm dia raw
water pipeline from the Sukuta and Wellingara borehole fields to the
Serekunda treatment works, a duplicate 300 mm dia pipeline has been
provided under CR.1443-GM, but the carrying capacity of the
transmission pipeline from the works to the Mile 2 pumping station is
still inadequate.
15.       Distribution pipelines with a total length of 92 km have been
laid, largely by GUC, in the Greater Banjul and provincial urban areas.
The sizes vary between 200 mm and 75 mm dia. The first pipes were laid
in 1916, but over 85% have been laid in the last 40 years. With almost
half the population supplied receiving their water through standpipes,
the coverage in urban areas with distribution pipelines, except for
Banjul city, is not extensive. In Banjul city the distribution system
coverage is extensive but consists largely of 5 in. dia pipes, many of
which were laid in the 1940s.
F. Consumers
16.       All service connections are metered.  GUC lays service
connections by direct labor, and consumers are billed the actual cost
of the connection and the meter. About 75% of the connections are
15 an dia, 20Z are 20 -m dia and 5Z are 25 mm dia and above.
17.       At the end of 1984, there were about 6,420 water supply
connections throughout the country of which about 410 were in the
provinces. Of the 6,010 connections in the Greater Banjul area about
802 (4,828) are to domestic consumers, 6Z (335) are to commercial
consumers, 8% (451) are to central government and 6% (386) to local
government. Of the 386 local government connections, about 210 were
metered standpipes which are charged to the local government. Further
statistical analyses of customer categories, units sold and sales
revenue are shown in the Attachment to this Annex.
G. Operation and Maintenance Aspects
18.       Of the Greater Banjul supply sources, the 1958 Fajara
borehole field, treatment works and pumping station are the oldest.
With some upgrading of electrical and mechanical equipment, the Fajara
vorks and the other boreholes, treatment works and pumping stations
wit:iin the Greater Banjul water supply system are considered



- 32 -
ANNEX 2-1
Page 6 of 10
operationally satisfactory. A new standby diesel generator is needed
at the Mile 2 pumping station.
19.       In the provincial areas, the systems were constructed between
1965 and 1983. The electrical and mechanical equipment has been well
maintained, but because of unreliable power supplies, five of the
provincial urban systems need new standby diesel generators. The
borehole sites need to be upgraded and fenced. Meters are also
required to measure the output from all the supply sources.
20.       The condition of the elevated storage tanks is satisfactory
throughout the country with the exception of Georgetown where the
foundation has failed. However, the capacity of storage needs to be
increased in the Kombo St. Mary area and in Mansakonko, Georgetown and
Basse.
21.       With the exception of the 5 in. dia cast iron pipes laid in
Banjul city during the period 1916 to 1940, the water supply
distribution system in the Greater Banjul area appears to be in
reasonable condition. It is estimated that about 3,000 m of the 5 in.
dia pipe in Banjul city need to be relaid. A large percentage of the
sluice valves throughout the area do not work and should be replaced.
Waste detection meters need to be installed on the outlets from the
elevated storage tanks.
22.       Due to the corrosiveness of the groundwater, the distribution
systems at Basse, Georgetown and Mansakonko are leaking very badly and
need to be completely replaced. A total of 2.9 km of 150 mm dia and
6.2 km of 100 mm dia pipe needs replacing.
23.       The ability of GUC's Water Division to operate and maintain
its water supply systems is constrained for several reasons. In the
Greater Banjul area the existing Water Division depot at Serekunda does
not have adequate office accommodation or store facilities. At present
there is no depot outside of the Greater Banjul area, and an inordinat'
amount of time, effort and fuel is spent in transporting materials and
equipment for the provincial water supply systems. The Water Division
has at present two cars, nine pick-ups and two trucks. Of these
vehicles, six are non-diesel, are more than five years old and need to
be replaced immediately.
24.       Repair of water mains and service connections and carrying
out of simple mechanical jobs is made extremely difficult because the
Water Supply Division has never had a comprehensive set of tools and
repair equipment. GTZ is presently financing the most urgently
required tools and equipment. There is a lack of materials to carry
out repairs to mains and service connections and GUC staff often have
to improvise.



- 33 -
ANNEX 2-1
Page 7 of 10
25.       The pipes for minor extensions and meters for replacement and
new connections are ordered on an ad hoc basis and materials for
service cornections are bought from local merchants at much higher
prices as compared to the price if purchased in bulk.
H. Unaccounted-for Water
26.       Based on an analysis of meter records for four months in
1982, unaccounted-for water as a percentage of water produced for the
four supply zones of the Greater Banjul system was found to be Banjul
city - 6%; Kombo St. Mary - 27%; Brikama 23.5%; and Yundum - 30% with
an average of 20%. This percentage is extremely low for a system such
as that operated by GUC. The main reason for the low percentage is the
low and relatively consistent pressure within the distribution system
(para 11), but other contributing factors are that consumers with
non-working meters are billed on the basis of the highest three
previous meter readings and that there is a minimum charge for a
separate connection whether or not the volume of water equivalent to
the charge is used.
I. Bacteriological and Chemical Analysis
27.       The Department of Water Resources of the Ministry of Water
Resources and Environment has a laboratory at Abuko. Staffed with a
qualified bacteriologist and two qualified chemists, the laboratory
carried out bacteriological and chemical sampling and testing of water
for GUC up to October 1984. No testing has been carried out since then
because GUC has not been able to provide transport and the consumables
used in the testing have not been available. With some upgrading of
equipment and provision of consumables, the laboratory would be able to
carry out the necessary tests to effectively monitor the quality of
water supplied by GUC.
J. Rural Water Supply
28.       Throughout The Gambia the traditional supply source has been
hand dug wells. Unlined, with water drawn by bucket, the wells are
health hazards and a large number of the wells have run dry during the
recent drought. There has been considerable activity in providing
rural communities with adequate water supply. The Government agency
responsible for rural water supply, the Department of Water Resources
in the Ministry of Water Resources and Environment, has received
considerable assistance for the provision of rural rater supplies in
terms of financing and technical assistance from the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations International Children's
Emergency Fund (UNICEF), United Nations Capital Development Fund
(UNCDF), United Nations International Fund for Social and Technical
Development (UNIFSTD), European Economic Community (EEC), Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG) and the Saudi Fund. Several non-government

organizations (NGOs) have been active in the rural water sector including
Caritas and the Catholic Relief Services. The Caritas rural water supply
program, which also includes wells for water supply to gardens, has been
on-going since 1978 and is substantial. In order to provide sufficient
point supply sources, wells and boreholes so that most of the rural
population in the country have access to a potable water supply, it is
estimated that abnut 3,350 point supply sources are required. However, the
immediate target is to reach the majority of the rural population who live
in the 1,000 or so rural settlements with population greater than 100
people. Achievements to date are shown in the table on page 34. The
majority of the wells and boreholes provided under the programs shown in
the table have been successful insofar as care has been taken to make the
wells and boreholes deep enough, the wells are lined to exclude surface
water, and the many of the wells and boreholes are fitted with handpumps,
although the problem of ensuring that operation and maintenance are carried
out efficiently has not been resolved.
29.       In addition to the above programs the Government has applied to
UNDP and UNICEF for funds to continue the rural water supply program
through 1989; the Government has also applied to FRG to extend their
program into a second stage. Hence, it appears that the progress made in
providing a large part of the rural population with a potable water supply
will continue.
30.       Particularly promising have been the results from the two pilot
projects comprising solar powered pumps for rural water supplies, both of
which have been running for over a year with no problems. One of the pilot
projects is located at the villige of Kaiaf, close to Mansakonko and was
financed by UNDP. The other one was financed by the Saudi Fund, installed
under contract by GTZ and is located close to Serekunda. These two
installations were reviewed during preparation of the "Solar Photovoltaic
Applications in the Health and Telecommunications Sectors Pre-Investment
Report" of March 1985 - Activity Completion Report No.032/85 2/. The
report concluded that while solar power for water pumping was relatively
capital intensive it merited further study and recommended that the
feasibility of solar power for the potable water supply for health centers
sbould be the subject of a separate consultant study.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
SANITATION SECTOR
1.        Provision, operation and maintenance of sewerage in urban
areas is the responsibility of GUC. However, the only operational piped
sewerage system in the country has been provided to serve six tourist
hotels in the Bakau/Fajara area and was financed under CR.602-GM, the
Tourism and Infrastructure Project. Comprising a sewer to collect
sewage from the hotels and a pumping station to transfer the sewage to
waste stabilization (oxidation) ponds for treatment, the system works
well for a relatively low cost in capital and operating terms.
2.        Foul waste disposal in Banjul city and other urban areas is
through a mixture of collection by a "pail" system, septic tanks and pit
latrines. Leachate from the septic tanks and pit latrines discharges
into the ground, or, in the case of septic tanks in Banjul city, the
drainage acts as a surrogate for a sewerage system. The Government is
concerned about the health hazard and nuisance from the present
sanitation system in Banjul city and is undertaking a project comprising
a piped sewerage system covering the whole city, improving two of the
city's major drains, and rehabilitating the major drainage pumping
station. The major components of the sewerage system are: a sewage
collection system with a sewer pipe laid in almost all streets; 4.6 km
of 600 mm to 250 mm dia main collector sewers; two pumping stations and
a 1.8 km long sea outfall (0.6 km on shore, 1.2 km offshore). The major
contract for the works is proceeding. Of the total cost of the project,
estimated to be about US$10.0 million, the African Development rund
(ADF), Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the European Development
Fund (EDF) will provide about US$8.35 million with the Government
providing the remaining financing.
3.        Legislation has been enacted requiring each premise in the
city to be connected to the water supply and sewerage systems. A survey
has established that there are 2,100 structures within Banjul city that
need to be connected. Of these, about 800 have existing water supply
connections. The estimated cost of a sewer and water connection is
D 2,300 and for a sewer connection alone, D 1,400. Although EDF and the
Government will jointly finance a D 5.0 million revolving fund to enable
1,800 domestic premises to pay for the connections over several years,
the rate at which premises will be connected is uncertain.

4.        In the rural a:reas, traditional sanitation is at best by
elementary pit latrine, but in most villages people simply resort to the
fields. The agency responsible for rural sanitation is the Department
of Community Development in the Ministry of Local Government and Lands.
As part of the Government's response to the International Water Supply
and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990), a water and sanitation working group
was formed within the Department in 1980. The Group is
inter-departmental and also includes representatives from NGOs and has a
small number of staff for implementation of projects. To date a pilot
project covering seven villages has been implemented. The project
included community participation, health education, construction of
ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines and rehabilitation of existing
wells. While successful, the pilot project has shown that because of
the heavy software inputs required, it is not feasible to expand the
pilot project countrywide. A different approach is now being tried.
The working group is preparing a project based on rehabilitation of
wells and construction of VIP latrines at 50 schools. This
demonstration project intends to use community nurses for health
education and the establishment of health committees in villages to
promote the construction and use of VIP latrines.
5.        Another pilot project in a village in the Greater Banjul area
comprises the digging of five wells and construction of seven VIP
latrines. It was partly financed by the International Development
Reference Center and implemented by The School of Public Health of The
Gambia College and has demonstrated that VIP latrines will be used if
available.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
ELECTRICITY SECTOR
A. Background
1.        Because The Gambia is generally flat with only a few hills, which
rise to less than 50 m, there is no major hydroelectric potential. There
is only limited potential for wind power near the coast, but the climate of
The Gambia has considerable potential for solar power. In 1983, the Bank
reviewed the energy sector 1/ and pointed out the potential for tapping
solar energy, particularly for water heating and air conditioning. Since
then, a project which is considered viable has been prepared comprising the
retrofitting of diesel and electric hot water heating systems with solar
water heating at five major tourist hotels 2/. In 1984 solar powered pumps
for water supply were installed in two villlages in The Gambia and the
initial results a:e very promising (Anne 2-1, para 30).
2.        The energy used in agriculture and certain service sector
activities is almost entirely wood based, which has substantially accounted
for the depletion of former forest areas. Nearly all rural households cook
with wood or charcoal substitutes, since the use of charcoal was banned in
1980. The used of bottled gas which is imported in bulk from Senegal then
bottled for sale by GUC is increasing. However, petroleum dominates the
energy sector. Imported petroleum products have increased from about
35.6 million liters in 1976 to 50.0 million liters in 1983/84. GUC has
been the principal user accounting for about 11.7 million liters in 1983/84
(about 23Z) for the generation of electricity.
B. Electricity Generation Facilities.
3.        In Greater Banjul, GUC operates three power stations at Kotu,
Half Die and Brikama.  Kotu, a new power station commissioned in 1981, was

financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB). It is located about 17 km
from Banjul, close to the tourist area and the rapidly expanding Kombos
area. Kotu has had two 3.4 MW diesel generators since 1981, and generating
capacity was recently expanded to 12.8 MW by the addition of a 6.0 MW
diesel generator, which was commissioned in December 1984 and financed by
the Japanese Government. Firm capacity is, therefore, 6.8 MW.
4.        Until Kotu Power Station was commissioned, the Half Die Power
Station located at the tip of Banjul city on the estuary was the main
source of electricity supply. After a generator explosion in 1977
destroyed one generator and severely damaged two others, GUC limped from
crisis to crisis in electricity generation with a series of major repairs
and use of small capacity high speed generators. Half Die is presently
equipped with one O.8 MW generator purchased in 1980 during the crisis. It
is presently capable of producing only about half its rated output and is
only used in emergencies or for peak lopping. It is controlled from Kotu.
5.        The Brikama urban area is supplied independently from the Brikama
Power Station. It serves a limited area of Brikama using two 352.2 kVA
diesel generators. GUC would like to extend its present 11 kV transmission
line from Yundum to Brikama so that further economies of scale can be
achieved through more intensive operation from Kotu.
6.        In the provinces, GUC operates small dIesel generating plants,
similar to the ones in Brikama, at the six power stations located in the
provincial centers of Mansakonko, Farafenni, Georgetcwn, Basse, Kerewan and
Bansang. Many of the plants are over ten years old and have experienced
frequent breakdowns for extended periods of time, due to the lack of spare
parts and ineffective operation and maintenance. The ODA made funds
available in 1984 for the procurement of urgently needed spare parts and
assisted GUC in a successful rehabilitation program for these power
stations. GUC also operates, on behalf of Government, small diesel
generating sets at four health centers located in Bwiam, Yarobawal, Fatoto
and Kudang.
C. Electricity Transmission and Distribution
7.        The power distribution component in CR.1187-GM has helped to
optimize distribution from Kotu and Half Die by procuring equipment and
spare parts which have enabled GUC to enhance transformer capacity, reduce
the load on some cireuits, improve safety at some sub-stations and limit
the worst voltage fluctuations. However, the damage caused to overhead
cables in Banjul during the attempted coup d'etat in July 1981 plus the
increasing number of connections and consumer demand continue to overload
the electricity distribution system which in Banjul city has been mostly in
place for over 30 years.



- 41 -
ANNEX 2-3
Page 3 of 4
8.        GUC has a peak hour demand of 8.5 MW and operates a very
selective new consumer connection policy because of the condition of the
distribution system. Many potential customers await connections including
several large ones, which would in total add a further 1.65 MW to demand.
Reinforcement and rehabilitation of the Banjul electricity distribution
system and parts of the systems elsewhere in Greater Banjul are urgently
required to satisfy these demands and to reduce liLe losses from the
present 18%.
9.        There are presently about 11,900 connections throughout the
country of which about 1,600 are in the provinces. Of the 10,300
connections in Greater Banjul, nearly 5,000 are in Banjul city. About 95%
of GUC's electricity revenues are generated in Greater Banjul. About 84%
of the connections are domestic supplies which account for 34Z of the sales
revenue. Only 10 of the connections are commercial supplies, including
the tourist hotels, but these account for 432 of revenue. Further
statistical analyses of customer categories, units sold and sales revenues
are shown in the Attachment to this Annex.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Background Studies and Selection Criteria
1.        To meet increasing water supply demand in the Greater Banjul
area, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), at the request of the Government,
in 1982 funded consultants, Lewin Fryer & Partners of the UK, to prepare a
feasibility study of staged development of the water supply systems in the
area up to the year 2000. Upon review of the consultant's proposals, it
was decided that the proposed first stage investment, Stage I, which would
meet demand throughout the area up to 1993, would involve too large an
investment. Principally by restricting the area of supply to areas of high
population density but retaining the design year of 1993, Stage I has been
split into two phases, the first stage of which forms the basis of the
proposed project and is consistent with the identified expansion of the
Greater Banjul water a-upply system up to the year 2000. The consultant's
final report for Stage I Phase I was completed in July 1984.
2.        A staff consultant, employed by the Bank, prepared a report in
mid-1984 which assesses the existing water supply systems of seven
provincial urban centers and six health centers operated by GUC. While the
water supply to health centers was found, in general, to be satisfactory.
the report concluded that the most cost effective approach to improving the
present unsatisfactory supplies to the provincial centers would be to
rehabilitate the existing systems and provide distribution system expansion
up to the capacity of the available yield from existing borehole supply
sources. The component in the proposed project for the seven provincial
centers water supply follows this arproach with the exception of Bansang
where a new supply source may be required.
3.        The electricity component comprises the proposed reinforcement
and rehabilitation of the Greater Banjul electricity system. The scope has
been identified in reports prepared by the GUC staff, assisted by technical
assistance experts provided under GTZ funding. The rehabilitation
proposals are consistent with GUC's long-term program for provision of
power in the Greater Banjul area and it is estimated that the proposed
component would enable GUC to reduce its present power distribution
operating losses from 18% of the power supplied to about 15Z and to improve
the overall power supply situation in the Greater Banjul area.

4.        The technical assistance, training and administration components,
provided under the proposed project to assist GUC in its institutional
development, have been identified by GUC with the assistance of Bank staff.
The proposed inputs represent the experience gained in implementing the GTZ
financed technical assistance and an assessment of the required manpower
inputs to, manuge effectively the programed expansion of GUC's operations.
B. Great.r Banjul Stage I Phase I Water Supply Expansion
5.        Projected Water Supply Demand.  The consultant, Levin Fryer &
Partners, prepared water supply demand projections up to the year 2000. In
preparing the projections, the consultant took into account population,
demand from domestic, commercial (with a specific analysis of hotel demand)
and government consumers, unaccounted-for water and maximum day demand.
6.        Population.  Population projections were prepared for the four
areas of the Greater Banjul area, namely, Banjul city, Kombo St. Mary,
Kombo North and Brikama, each of which has different population growth
characteristics. The consultant's approach was to project natural growth
based on past demographic data using a conservative approach of declining
fertility and making allowance for immigration based on the growth
potential of an area. Using 1973 as the base, the consultant's projections
for 1983 were very close to the 1983 census data published at the end of
the study. The consultant adopted a similar approach in projecting the
1993 population. During the period 1973 to 1983, the population of the
area had grown at an average rate of 6.5% per annum. With the exception of
Banjul city, where growth is constrained due to its peninsular location, a
natural growth rate of 2.852 per annum was taken for 1983 to 1993 with net
immigration as follows: Brikama - 1,500 per annum (p.a.) in 1983 to 1989
and 2,000 p.a. in 1990 to 1993; Kombo North - 4.000 p.a. in 1983 gradually
decreasing to 1,500 p.a. by 1993; and Kombo St. Mary - 500 p.a. in 1983
gradually increasing to 2,500 p.a. by 1993.

7.        Domestic Demand.  In the Greater Banjul area the consultant's
analysis of meter records showed three distinct types of domestic
consumers - i.e., standpipes, shared yard taps or individual
connections. Also, by analyzing census data pertaining to the number of
persons in different types of households, the consumption of the three
different types of domestic consumers was fixed. There were some
variations among the four areas, but generally standpipe consumption was
31 to 41 lcd; yard taps, 55 to 60 lcd; and individual connections, 147
to 500 lcd. By a review of the housing characteristics of an area and
projecting how the area would develop to reach the projected population
for 1993, and assuming that the rate of change from private wells to
standpipes would continue, the numbers of different consumers were
established. Domestic consumption has been increasing by an average of
2.2% per annum, but the projections assume that pricing policies will
restrict consumption to 1985 levels and, in the case of individual
connections, will reduce the highest per capita consumption from 545 to
345 lcd.
8.        High Conmtion (Comercial/Hotel) Consumers and Goverment.
A conservative approach has been taken for non-domestic consumers in
that it was assumed that pricing policies will hold consumption at
present levels up to 1993 with the exception of hotels where a 30%
increase from 1983 to 1993 has been projected.
9.        Unaccounted-for Water.  It has been assumed that by fitting
waste detection meters on the outlet from all storage tanks and the
establishment of waste detection programs by the GTZ financed expatriate
distribution engineer that unaccounted-for water can be maintained at
its present relatively low level of 202.
10.       Maximum Day to Average Day Rates.  An analysis of GUC's
records of water supplied shows that the maximum day demand is about
8.7Z higher than the average day demand. This factor was used in
establishing maximm day demand up to 1993 from which the capacity of
the supply sources was determined. A comparison of actual maximum day
demand in 1983 and projected maximum day demand in 1993 is shown in the
following table:

11.       Supply Sources to Meet Projected Demand.  Development of a
borehole field at Yundum is a logical next step in the sequential
development of the groundwater aquifer of the Banjul peninsula. Also
the transmission pipeline from the well field to the existing major
urban area has to pass through areas undergoing rapid urbanization. A
consultant (Howard Humphries of the UK) carried out a comprehensive
study of the Banjul aquifer in 1978 and the consultant Lewin Fryer in
1983 carried out an independent study of the aquifer taking into account
data up to 1983. The 1978 study recommended that the next groundwater
development should be based on either Sukuta South or Yundum and the
1983 stuidy concluded that for hydrogeological, engineering and economic
reasons the next development should be at Yundum. Sufficient data are
known about the aquifer in the Yundum area as, in 1978, a test borehole
was drilled and tested in the area, and there is an existing borehole
which supplies the Yundum/Lamin area. The location of the proposed
field has been chosen so that the proposed abstraction of 10,400 m3 rer
day from the aquifer in the Yundum area should have no effect on the
adjacent borehole field at Wellingara. It is expected that seven
boreholes and six observation holes will need to be drilled under the
project. Transmission pipelines will transfer raw water to the
treatment plant located in the well field.

ANNEX 3-2
Page 5 of 13
12.       For Brikama, the most cost-effective arrangement for meeting a
large part of the Brikama demand at minimum cost will be adopted by
retaining the existing 650 m9 per day borehole and providing a new
2,300 m9 per day borehole located about 1 km from the existing
production borehole.
13.       Treatment Works.  Treatment of the water from the Yundum
borehole field to rectify the acidity of the water is required. The
treatment would be relatively simple, aeration and dosing with lime.
After treatment the watf.: would be disinfected with chlorine in a ground
level contact tank at the treatment works. An additional 900 m3 ground
level tank will be provided at the existing Serekunda treatment works to
ersure sufficient contact time of the disinfecting chlorination and new
14,500 m9 per day pumps will replace the existing pumps.
14.       The locations of boreholes and treatment plant have been
selected after an analysis of alternative locations to determine the
most cost-effective solution wMio' also fits in with the identified
staged development of the Greater Banjul water supply up to the year
2000. Overhead 11 kV oover lines will be laid from the existing GUC
power transmission sys.em to the eight borehole sites and to the Yundum
treatment works.
15.       Transmission Pipelines.  The route of the 400 mm to 300 mm dia
transmission pipeline from the Yundum treatment to supply has been
selected to enable high density population areas along the route
(including the Yundum, Bundung, Kotu, Sukuta, Kanifing and Serekunda
areas) to be supplied and the diameter has been selected on the basis of
a present value analysis of alternative diameters. To reduce pumping
costs, a new 300 mm dia 11 km pumping main will be laid from the
existing Serekunda treatment works to the Mile 2 pumping station.
16.       The transmission pipelines will supply directly to the
elevated storage tanks throughout the supply area. To enable peak hour
demand to be met efficiently, rew storage tanks will be provided with a
total capacity of 3,150 m3 in addition to the existing elevated storage
of 3,730 m3. The total storage of 11,380 m3 (elevated 6,880 mn; ground
level 4,500 ms) is equivalent to about eight hours of the maximum day
demand in 1993 of 33,800 m3 per day. This is acceptable. Location of
the tanks is shown on the IBRD map No. 19168. At the Mile 2 pumping
station, new pumps will replace the existing units which are now
inefficient and not of the required duty.
17.       Distribution Pipelines.  About 49 km of distribution pipelines
between 250 mm and 50 mm dia will be provided in the Kombo North, Kombo
St. Mary and Banjul c'ty areas to enable the water being provided under
the project to be supplied to areas of high demand. These areas are
shown on the IBRD Map No. 19168R.

18.       Brikama.  For the supply to BrUkama, the new borehole
(para 12) vill supply via a raw water transmission pipeline to the
existing 450 m9 elevated storage tank and a new 315 us elevated steel
storage tank to be located adjacent to the existing tank. About 5 km of
distribution pipelines will be laid to supply the new development to the
south of the town where at present there is no distribution system. The
existing borehole water is not particularly aggressive but, as a
precaution, corrosion-resistant materials will be used for all the new
works.
19.       Service Connections.  It is estimated that 6,000 new
connections, including meters, will be required to distribute the water
from the Greater Banjul system when the Yundum supply source has been
completed. Of these, about 3,000 will be inastlled under the project.
The remainder will be installed by GUC under their existing procedures
at the current rate of 300 per annum during the period 1985 to 1995 (the
demand projections in the financial analysis are Dased on these
projected rates of installation of service connections).
20.       Consultant Services - Supervision.  About 42 man-months of
professional consultant services, together with technician, office and
support services are required to supervise the project implementation,
including assistance to GUC in the award of bids and the commissioning
of the project works. Preparation of Stage I Phase II. The proposed
project will meet demand up to 1993. Assuming a five-year construction
period for the next phase of expansion, Stage I Phase II, if GUC is to
avoid future water supply restrictions, construction should start on
Phase II in 1988. A provision for 30 man-months of consultant services
including support facilities has been included in the project to prepare
the detailed design of the next phase of expansion. Aquifer Study.
There is a need to continue evaluation and monitoring of the aquifer in
the Greater Banjul area, and four man-months of consultant services are
included in the project for this task.
C. Provincial Urban Centers Water Supply Systems Rehabilitation
21.       Projected Water Supply Demand.  Utilizing preliminary data
from the 1983 census, the Bank financed consultant calculated
populations in the seven provincial urban centers up to the year 2000.
These projections are shown in para 24. It is est.mated that the
population during the period 1973 to 1983 grew at the rate of 2.8Z per
annum in Mansakonko, Georgetown and Bansang and at slightly less than
this rate in Farafenni, Kerewau and Bara-Kanuma. From the information
available, it appears that the centers will continue to grow at the same
rate as in the past, and the population projections for the project are
based on this assumption.

ANNEX 3-2
Page 7 of 13
22.       By projecting the growth of the seven provincial urban
centers, the distribution system layouts which would supply the maximum
number of persons (through a mixture of mostly standpipes with some
separate connections) were determined. In general, the number of
persons using an individual connection appears to be about 10 and for a
standpipe, 200.
23.       Consumption patterns for different types of consumers, i.e.,
individual connections, standpipe and commercial/other were calculated
on the basis of limited meter records cross checked with data on general
consumption patterns for West Africa. Projections assume water usage of
100 lcd through individual connections and 36 lcd for a standpipe.
Commercial and other consumption was assumed to be about 20Z of the
water supplied, which is usual for small urban communities. Leakage and
wastage were assumed to be 40% of the water supplied to take into
account the difficulty of control of remote systems. The ratio of
maximum day demand to average day demand was assumed to be 1.2.
24.       Utilizing the above data, the water demand projections for the
seven provincial urban centers were calculated as shown in the following
table:

ANNEX 3-2
Page 9 of 13
25.       Supply Sources to Meet Projected Demand.  As shown in the
table above, the supply capacity of the boreholes in six of the
provincial centers is capable of meeting demand for several years past
1995. However, 1995 was chosen as the design year, resulting in systems
which will meet demand for several years after commissioning, but which
are still affordable. In the case of the seventh center, Kerewan, 1990
was chosen as the design year, as the borehole supply source is only
capable of meeting demand up to that year.
26.       Treatment.  The aggressive water from the boreholes in Basse,
Georgetown and Mansakonko could be treated, but it is more cost
effective and the systems are easier to operate if the alternative of
using corrosion-resistant materials throughout the systems is adopted.
No treatment will be provided to raw water in six of the centers. In
Bansang, the exception, the present borehole produces water with a high
iron content. The relative costs and merits of the supply
possibilities, comprising: providing treatment to the water from the
existing borehole; drilling a new borehole; or providing a surface water
supply with treatment; will be reviewed in detail by the design
consultant.
27.       Storage.  Elevated steel storage tanks of 450 ms capacity will
be provided in each of the three centers, Mansakonko, Georgetown and
Basse. In Georgetown, the existing elevated steel storage tank has
foundation problems and will be demolished. The storage capacity
provided, about one day's supply, although larger than Greater Banjul's
is not excessive considering the probable delays, due to the remoteness
of the centers, in rectifying any supply source interruption.
28.       Diesel Generators.  GUC does not generate electricity in
Kerewan, and a diesel generator to meet the power demand of the water
supply source works to 1990 will be provided. Standby diesel generators
will be provided in the other six centers.
29.       Distribution Pipelines.  In four of the centers, Mansakonko,
Georgetown, Basse and Farafenni, a total of about 3.6 km of 150 mm dia
and about 6.2 km of 100 mm dia of existing defective pipelines will be
replaced by non-corrosive pipelines. To meet demand up to 1995 in six
of the centers and in Kerewan up to 1990, a total of about 0.3 km of
150 mm dia and 20.0 km of 100 mm dia of non-corrosive new pipelines will
be provided.
30.       Service Connections.  As shown in the above table, an
additional 380 individual connections and 154 new standpipes will be
provided which will enable demand to be met up to 1995 in six centers
and to 1990 in the case of Kerewan.

D. Banjul Electricity Distribution System Reinforcement
31.       Projected Electricity Demand.  GUC has prepared electricity
demand projections up to 1989 from which the size of the project
components has been determined. The demand projections were developed
by extrapolating the past increase in electricity demand with allowances
made for present load shedding and applications waiting for electricity
supply - over 500 in the Banjul area and over 1,000 in the Komboa.
Taking into account this suppressed demand, it is estimated that
following the comissioning of the new 6.0 MW generator at Kotu, demand
would have grown by 15 to 20% in 1985. However, the load shedding which
has been introduced to reduce fuel oil consumption has reduced the
increase in electricity demand to 5% in 1985.
32.       Electricity Distribution System Reinforcement.  The existing
overloaded ring circuit for the city comprising a 11 kV 25 mm2
underground copper cable will be reinforced with 30 km of 11 kV 150 mm2
underground aluminum cable. Several of the overloaded sub-stations fed
from the ring circuit whose size presently ranges from 50 kVA to 500 kVA
have recently been replaced by GUC and the remaining overloaded
sub-stations will be replaced under the project by about nine
standardized 11 kV/400 V distribution unit package sub-stations with
500 kVA transformers. The operating cost of six of these units in the
Kombos area has been found to be very low. A four-wire overhead
distribution system of a total length of 215 km of 70 mm2, 100 mm2 and
150 mm2 wire will replace that part of the existing secondary system
which is more than 30 years old. It is expected that the above
reinforcement and rehabilitation measures would enable GUC's electricity
line losses to be reduced from the present 18% to about 15Z.
33.       Metering.  In order to ensure that metering is carried out
effectively for new electricity connections over the next four years,
about 500 three phase 230/400 V meters and about 2,500 single phase
230 V kWh meters will be provided, together with two pick-up vehicles to
be used by the meter readers.
E. Reinforcement of GUC's Operations
34.       Manpower Development.  A comprehensive program of manpower
development will be implemented to upgrade GUC's staff capability to
operate and maintain both existing physical facilities and those to be
provided under the project. The manpower development component of the
proposed project will complement the ongoing GTZ financed technical
assistance which adopts the approach of temporarily filling specific
positions in GUC until local counterparts have sufficient expertise to
take over responsibility for these functions. The emphasis is one of
assisting in the management of GUC, while at the same time transferring
skills and knowledge to local staff in order to progressively lead to
full localization of GUC.



- 58 -
ANNEX 3-2
Page 11 of 13
35.       The project will provide a total of 48 man-months of technical
assistance over a four-year period (see implementation schedule in the
Attachment to this Annex), of which 12 will be in the area of manpower
development and training. The expert will review GUC's operations,
determine staffing requirements and prepare detailed position
descriptions. The expert will also conduct a complete manpower audit,
review recruitment and retirement policies, and identify suitable
sources of training. Subsequently, the expert would assist GUC in
implementing the manpower development program, including the recruitment
and retirement of staff. Further background and details on the program
are presented at Annex 3-3.
36.       To assist GUC in commissioning, operation and maintenance of
the upgraded water supply systems in the seven provincial urban centers,
12 man-months of technical assistance will be provided for an expert in
the operation and maintenance of water supply electrical and mechanical
equipment. This also will complement the GTZ financed program which has
focused on the Greater Banjul operations. The initial responsibility of
the expert will be to provide on-the-job training to GUC staff to ensure
that the commissioning of the seven rehabilitated systems is implemented
efficiently. Subsequently, the expert will be responsible for the
implementation of effective operation and maintenance procedures
covering all of the Water Supply Division's operations in the provinces
and assistance to the manpower development and training specialist in
the ident'fication of appropriate training programs.
37.       Alth3ugh GUC's financial accounting capability is sufficient
%para 4.09), there is need to develop a management accounting system and
to increase the effectiveness of the internal audit section. For this
purpose, two personal computers and a total of 24 man-months of
technical assistance will be financed under the project. A management
accounting expert will be responsible for developing a management
accounting and reporting system and training his counterpart to become
fully proficient in operating the system. He will also review current
procedures and recommend improvements in the areas of stores and
purchasing, both of which are recognized by GUC management as being
poorly controlled and needing improvement. An internal audit expert
will completely review and revise GUC's internal audit programs and
procedures to ensure that GUC's internal audit section contributes
effectively to the enhancement of internal control. In conjunction with
the manpower development specialist, he will also identify relevant
local training opportunities and conduct training sessions to improve
the professional capability of GUC's internal audit staff.
38.       Operational Equipment Upgrading. The project will provide
certain materials that are used on a day-to-day basis. This will not
only result in significant savings compared with buying on an ad hoc
basis, but will also enable GUC to systematically program its
activities. The major items to be provided under this component are
discussed below.

39.       Materials for Operation and Maintenance.  In order to assist
GUC in upgrading its operation and maintenance of the Greater Banjul
distribution system, the following equipment and materials will be
provided: 7.0 km of 150 am to 50 mm dia pipelines and associated
fittings; hydrants; repair couplings and collars; sluice and air valves;
8.5 km of 20 mm to 50 mm service connection pipelines and associated
fittings; water meters and fittings.
40.       Replacement of Defective Sluice Valves.  For efficient control
of the distribution system and to enable leakage detection programs to
be implemented all defective sluice valves will be replaced. About 155
valves are required in 75 mm to 250 mm dia.
41.       Tools and Communication Equipment.  Sufficient tools and
equipment such as: pipe cutters, trench pumps, lighting sets for
emergency works, wrenches, and sockets will be provided to enable GUC
staff to carry out their duties in an efficient manner. In the Greater
Banjul &rea, a radio communication system is being established under GTZ
financing. In the provinces base stations for the radio communication
system will be established at Bansang, Basse and Farafenni and vehicles
for the provinces will be equipped with mobile units.
42.       Vehicles.  In the Greater Banjul area, all Water Division
vehicles older than five years old will be replaced. Of the present
fleet of 13 vehicles, seven need to be replaced immediately. To improve
efficiency of meter reading in the Greater Banjul area, two additional
pick-ups will be provided. For the provincial urban center water supply
systems, the project will provide two pick-up trucks and one 7-ton
truck.
43.       Depot Facilities.  A new depot for the Water Division within
the Greater Banjul area will provide 400 m2 of building space for office
and stores, complete with furnishings, fittings and a fenced store.
In view of the travel distances involved, the most satisfactory
arrangement for operational back-up to the provincial water supply
systems is to have 170 m2 of building area comprising offices, stores
and workshops with accommodation at Bansang and 40 m2 of building area
comprising offices and stores at Farafenni.

MANPOWER DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING
A .  *nCroductlon
1.       AA  evidenced by continued technical assistance and reliance on
.iutfude expertise in management, supervision, accounting and technical
unmc Clor.s. the overall manpower capability within GUC is not sufficient to
met the normai requirements of a power and water utility.  Although GUC
hae over 'HA) employees on permanent stacus and over 400 on daily paid
status, the general low level of staff skills and knowledge seriously
rfer!te both the quallty and quantity of work output and the overall
eff1rt.nc-v tof the organization. Th's low level of manpower capability is
the result of many factors and constraints that negatively affect the
r.' rutmtrwt and retention of qualified employees, including:
(a)  ineftecrtve and/or non-existent personnel policies regarding
',b quallfications and assignments, employment incentives,
career advancement, and recruitment;
ivi  the compositior. of the work force which is affected by
overqtaffing at the semI- and unskilled worker levels, and

B. Ob1ectives
2.        The two major objectives of the project's manpower development
component are to efficiently use personnel within the organization and to
achieve job competency at all levels. The first objective involves policy
decisions and management actions, while the second involves the development
and implementation of various in-house and external training programs. The
component objectives needed to achieve efficient use of personnel include
an effective organizational structure, a streamlined workforce, and the
establishment of career advancement guidelines. The component objectives
needed to achieve employee competency include the improvement of managerial
and supervisory capability, the improvement of technical capability, and
the improvement of in-house training capability.
C. Methods and Tasks
3.        Organizational Effectiveness.  To ensure that units within the
organization are properly staffed with respect to numbers, functions, and
qua'lifications, it will be necessary to verify the organizational structure
and unit functions. This will be acccmplished by conducting an
organizational review and manpower audit and establishing detailed job
descriptions for all job positions.
4.        Streamlining the Workforce.  To improve the composition of the
workforce, it will be necessary to effect a gradual reduction of semi- and
unskilled workers to required level, upgrade senior and mid-level staff,
and gradually replace under-qualified mid-level staff who cannot be
upgraded due to illiteracy and other factors. These improvements will be
accomplished through the establishment of retirement incentives, a
temporary freeze on hiring of semi- and unskilled workers, and better
recruitment policies and incentives to attract qualified personnel.
5.        Career Advancement.  To enhance career advancement for qualified
staff and to ensure proper staff placement, it will be necessary to
establish qualification policies and standards for job assignments and
promotions. To encourage staff interest in training and upgrading, it will
also be necessary to establish incentives to reward successful employees in
these areas.
6.        Managerial and Supervisory Capability.  To improve the abilities
of upper and mid-level staff in general management techniques and staff
supervision and the technical knowledge and skills of mid- and lower level
staff, it will be necessary to develop and implement a combination of
(a) in-house training courses and workshops, (b) on-the-job training (OJT)
activities; (c) seminars, workshops, and courses at local training
institutions (Attachment A); and (d) work/study training programs in
cooperation with similar power and water utilities outside the country.



- 63 -
ANNEX 3-3
Page 3 of 6
This work will be closely integrated, and technically based upon, the
organizational structure, job descriptions, and manpower audit to be
performed under the project.
7.        Development of Training Capability.  To improve GUC's training
capability and coordination with external training institutions, it will be
necessary to strengthen the training function of the Personnel Department
through the establishment of a training committee and budget and the
training of selected senior and mid-level staff in in-house training
techniques. It will also be necessary to increase participation with local
training Institutions through the establishment of Joint training
committees and the development of specific courses and programs designed to
improve job competency. Twinning arrangements with compatible power and
water utilities outside the country with emphasis on training and the

IN-COUNTRY TRAINING CAPABILITY
Local training capability that can be utilized to meet GUC's
training needs exists within the following inst'tutions:
(a) The Gambia Technical Training Institute (GTTI) was established in
1983 with financial support from the World Bank (CR.792-GM of April
1978). Enrollment for the 1983-84 school year included over 400
students in various full- and part-time programs. Successful
completion of many of these programs leads to recognition by the
London City Guilds. Apart from full time students who enter from
the education sector, a major emphasis is placed on upgrading
workers in supervisory, technical, and commercial job categories on
a released time basis. In this regard, there is close support and
coordination, under the direction of the Vice President's Office
with the various government ministries and agencies participating
in the prog am. Institute policies are determined by a Board of
Governors which includes a representative from the GUC.
(b)  The Management Development Institute (MDI) was established with
funding from the World Bank (CR.792-GK of April 1978), and has been
in operation for one year. It is administered much the same as
GTTI, through participation of the various ministries and under the
direction of the Vice President's Office. The Institute's mandate
is to train middle and upper level management personnel (grade
levels 10-21) in:
(i)   general management;
(ii) financial management and auditing;
(iii) personnel management; and
(iv) project management.
All courses in these areas are custom designed to meet
specifically identified training needs and requirements for the
various ministries and agencies using the institution. Average
tuition costs are about 200 to 250 Dalasis per trainee/week.
Technical assistance is being provided to train local
counterparts in the various teaching disciplines and management
of the school. In addition, the Irish Management Institute is

ANNUE 3-3

presently conducting a study of financial management training
needs within The Gambia whi1ch will form the basis for future
financial management programs at MDI.
(c) The Mechanical Engineering Division (MED) of the Public Works
Department (PWD) in the Ministry of Works and Communication (MWC)
is presently constructing a mechanical workshop adjacent to the
Kotu Power Station with funding and technical assistance provided
by USAID. A training program for diesel and heavy equipment
mechanics is being implemented in temporary training facilities,
and will be transferred to a permanent training center at the
Kotu workshop. Discussions with MED and PWD staff indicate that
this facility could be used to train GUC personnel in diesel
operation, repair, and maintenance in addition to some
specialized craft training.
(d) The Non-Formal Training Division of the Ministry of Education has
been established to assist the various ministries and other
organizations with literacy training. Assistance is provided
upon request for the development of functional literacy training
programs that can be implemented in-house. This includes the
training of senior and mid-level staff as instructors, the
development of courses and course materials, and follow-up
assistance during implementation.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
PROJECT COST SUMMARY
Major Assumptions
1.        Cost estimates are based on recent purchases, suppliers'
quotations, and the consultants' feasibility study. The majority of the
civil works are relatively straightforward construction activities such as
trenching, laying of pipes and construction of concrete and steel tanks.
Estimates for these works are based on recent contracts in The Gambia and
prices provided by contractors in other West Africa countries. Costs of
technical assistance and consultants including fees, subsistence and travel
are based on recent experience in The Gambia.
2.        Physical contingencies of 10% for all components of the project
have been included to allow for increases in quantities. Price
contingencies have been estimated at 7.2% in 1986, 6.8Z in 1987 and 1988,
7.0% in 1989, 7.1% in 1990, and 4.0% in 1991 through 1993 for both foreign
and local expenditures.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR GUC FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. General
1.        In January 1986 the Government of The Gambia abandoned the system
of a fixed rate of exchange for the Dalasi to the pound sterling
(D 5.00 = L1.00) and adopted a market-based system for foreign exchange.
Because the new system is still experiencing some difficulties in
implementation, it is difficult to predict at what level the rate of
exchange will finally equilibrate. For this reason, financial projections
have been prepared in terms of US dollars and international rates of
inflation have been applied to both locally procured and imported inputs.
Under its Economic Recovery Program, the Government has taken a policy
decision that tariffs will be adjusted as necessary to pass through the
effects of devaluation of the Dalasi.
B. Income Statement
2.        Projected revenues from electricity sales reflect the following
tariff increases:
6% - January 1, 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1992
The level of consumption is assumed to increase at the rate of 5% Der year,
slightly higher than the rate of population growth. GUC intends to
commission a heavy fuel generator in FY89 to meet its baseload
requirements, and this is reflected in the financial projections.
3.        Projected revenues from water sales reflect the fol.owinf, tariff
increases:
15% - january 1, 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989
5% - January 1, 1990 and 1991
4% - July 1, 1993
Projected water demand will be fully met in 1992 with the commissioning of
the Yundum supply source works for the Greater Banjul system.
4.        Sewerage charges after FY88. at which time the expanded Banjul
sewerage scheme is expected to be operational, are projected to be set so



- 78 -
ANNEX 4-2
Page 2 of 3
as to enable GUC to meet only the cash operating costs of the Sewerage
Division in order not to impose an excessive burden on the relatively poor
users of the system in Banjul.
5.        Revenues from the sale of bottled gas are projected to increase
at the rate of inflation.
6.        Fuel and lube oil costs are projected to incre&st. with production
at the international rate of inflation. A base rate of US$0.20/1 of gas
oil has been assumed for FY87.
7.        Electricity supplied to the Water Division is assumed to be
charged at the average tariff rate in effect. Revenue and expenses related
to electricity supplied to the Water Division have been eliminated in
consolidation.
8.        Maintenance charges are projected to increase at approximately
twice the rate of inflation in order to ameliorate the current situation in
which maintenance is inadequate.
9.        Depreciation is calculated as a fixed percentage (based on the
weighted average useful lives) of revalued net fixed assets in operation.
10.       Personnel. other, and overhead expense are assumed to remain
fixed in real terms despite GUC's expanded operating responsibilities as a
result of increased operating efficiency and are assumed to increase only
at the rate of inflation.
11.       Reimbursement of provincial centers operating losses - Provincial
centers operations account for less than 10% of total GUC operations.
Although the Government is theoretically obligated to reimburse GUC for the
operating losses of the provincial centers, actual payments have never been
made (arrears were liquidated, however, during the recent debt offset
exercise). In view of the Government's current difficult financial
situation and past performance, for the purpose of the financial
projections. it has been assumed that any future operating losses accruing
to the provincial centers would be covered by implicit cross-subsidization
from Greater Banjul operations.
12.       Electricity system losses comprise power house consumption and
line losses. Although line losses are expected to decrease from the
current level of 18% to 15% during the project period, power house
consumption is expected to increase from 5% to 9% because of the higher
consumption from both the recently commissioned 6.0 MW generator and the
new heavy fuel generator expected to be commissioned in 1988. Therefore,
non-revenue production remains fairly constant during the projection
period.

ANNEX 4-2
Page 3 of 3
C. Balance Sheet
13.       Fixed assets are assumed to be revalued annually, increasing in
value at the rate of international inflation. Major investments to be
undertaken during the projection period include installation of a heavy
fuel generator, the proposed water and electricity project and the Banjul
sewerage scheme. It is assumed that construction of Phase II of the Banjul
water supply expansion will commence in FY91.
14.       Trade accounts receivable are expected to decline from four
months sales in FY85 to approximately two months sales by FY93 as a result
of GUC's continuing emphasis on improving collections. Miscellaneous
accounts receivable consist mostly of amounts receivable for loans made to
GUC employees and should decline substantially in relation to the total
level of GUC's activities.
15.       Inventories are assumed to increase as a result of GUC's expanded
level of operations and inflation.
16.       Government equity and funding reflects the results of the debt
offsetting exercise between the Government and GUC effected as of end FY84,
and assumes the transfer of the Banjul sewerage project and heavy fuel
generator debt-free to GUC and US$2.6 million equivalent overdue interest
payable assumed to be forgiven in FY86.
17.       Reserves are projected to increase only as a result of
revaluation of fixed assets.
18.       Long-term debt *]ecreases in FY84 as a result of the debt
offsetting exercise (see para 16 above) and thereafter increases as
disbursements are made on the proposed water and electricity project.
19.       Accruals and trade payables reflect approximately D 10 million of
fuel purchases in FY85 paid for by the Government. It is anticipated that
GUC would be able to liquidate this liability only gradually over time, but
that payables would eventually be reduced to a reasonable level of 30-60
days cash operating costs.

THE GAMBIA
WATER AND ELECTRICITY PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Project Justification
1.        The proposed project is expected to make an important
contribution towards the quality of life in The Gambia. While the three
major project components will yield significant economic benefits at the
lowest possible investment costs, they will also yield considerable
indirect benefits. Through the reduction of water shortages, cessation
of intermittent supplies and greater access to safe water, an important
indirect benefit will be improvement to the health status of residents
in Greater Banjul and seven provincial urban centers. It is reported
that waterborne diseases account for 8Z of reported morbidity and 25Z of
reported child mortality. Without the project, overpumping would lower
the water table significantly in the Greater Banjul area, causing
boreholes to run dry and, more importantly, saline intrusion into the
groundwater aquifer. This would drastically limit access to safe water
and have serious health impacts. Economic losses would also result, as
people would be forced to carry water for long distances with
considerable time costs.
2.        The electricity component will yield significant economic
benefits by increasing the percentage of power generated which is
available for productive use. Improved electricity service in Greater
Banjul is also expected to indirectly impact the tourism industry, an
important potential source of foreign exchange in The Gambia. Without
the project, more frequent system interruptions and increased line
losses would reduce the quality of electricity services to unacceptable
levels. Consequently, many customers would be compelled to purchase and
operate individual generators. Not only would this solution be
inefficient, but it would consume scarce foreign exchange resources as
well.
3.        Another significant indirect benefit of the project will be
the strengthening of GUC through technical assistance, training and
policies intended to assist GUC to: (a) overcome its short-term
operational and financial problems and to improve service to its
customers; (b) develop GUC into a more efficient and financially viable
institution in the longer term; and (c) to restore autonomy to GUC to
enable it to operate in a more commercial manner properly accountable to
Government.

ANNEX 5
Page 2 of 12
B. Least Cost Solution
4.        Greater BanJul Water Supply - This component will develop
groundwater sources and distribution capacity to meet water demand in a
large part of the Greater Banjul area up to the year 1993. The proposed
supply source development exploits the aquifer at the nearest feasible
point to the centers of demand. The only possible alternatives to the
proposed supply source would be:
(a) development of the aquifer at a greater distance from the
service area with attendant increased delivery costs; or
(b) the desalinization and treatment of water from The Gambia
river requiring unaffordable construction and operating
costs.
The size of the transmission pipelines has been selected based on a
present value analysis of capital and pumping costs and the layout of
the distribution system expansion has been selected to provide an
adequate supply to consumers at minimum cost. The arrangement of
supplying storage tanks from transmission pipelines has been retained,
as the resultant relatively low but consistent pressures at the
consumers' connections is considered the major reason for the lower than
average unaccounted-for water.
5.        Provincial Centers Water Supply - This component is the least
cost solution to improving water supply service by rehabilitating, in
six of the seven centers, existing water supply sources which can be
done at a fraction of the cost of providing a new supply source. In the
seventh center, an economic analysis will determine whether to proceed
with a surface water supply from the adjacent river with treatment or
groundwater with treatment. Expansion of distribution systems, in all
seven centers will be carried out to supply the most densely populated
areas to utilize some of the spare capacity of the supply sources.
6.        Greater Banjul Electricity - Not only is the existing
electricity distribution system overloaded, leading to increasing
unreliability of supply and regular load shedding, but there are also
considerable line losses. The component is the least cost solution to
rectify the present unsatisfactory and uneconomic situation.
C. Avrerage Incremental Cost
7.        The Average Incremental Cost (AIC) approximates the long run
marginal cost of producing an additional unit of output. In principle,
the average billing price per unit of output, a proxy for the consumer's



- 83 -
ANNEX 5
Page 3 of 12
perceived value of benefits, should be at least equivalent to the AIC,
the economic costs of the investment.
8.        Water Supply - Because The Gambia has a unified water tariff
for the entire country, the following calculations are based on the
combined figures for both the Greater Banjul and the provincial water
components. The AIC per 1,000 gallons of water sold has been calculated
at US$1.76. Under the proposed program of increases to water tariffs
(para 4.03), it is expected that by 1989 the average real tariff I/ per
1,000 gallons billed, US$1.77, would be equal to the AIC and thus be
considered fully satisfactory. A comparison of current tariff levels in
The Gambia and other West African countries based on data available at
the time of appraisal is presented in Attachment t; the average water
tariff in The Gambia is well below the mean of other reported tariffs.
9.        Electricity - The AIC per kWh of electricity sold has been
calculated at US$.11. Based on the electricity rate adjustments needed
to achieve satisfactory financial performance (see Annex 4-2), the
average real tariff 1/ per kWh billed will reach US$.19 in 1986. Thus,
consumers' willingness to pay far exceeds the marginal cost of the
incremental production, thereby justifying the investment. Average
electricity tariff levels in selected West African countries are listed
in Attachment B, which shows that the average electricity tariff in The
Gambia falls in the middle of the range for the countries pr ented.
D. Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
10.       Internal financial rates of return (IFRR) were calculated
separately for the Greater Banjul Water Supply. Provincial Centers Water
Supply and Banjul Electricity components taking into account the costs
and benefits of each component 2/. Using the cost and benefit streams
detailed in Attachments C-E, the internal financial rates of return for
the three components are calculated to be as follows:
1/   Expressed in 1986 prices.
2/   Costs include incremental capital and recurrent costs.
Benefits are based on revenues generated by taking the highest
real tariff as a minimum measure of consumer willingness to
pay; this assumption is justified because suppressed demand
will exist even after the project is completed (Annex 3-2).

These rates can only be considered as indicative given the limitations
inherent in the use of project revenues as a proxy for project benefits.
This caveat notwithstanding, the IFRRs compare favorably with the
opportunity cost of capital in the country of 1OX.
11.       The following table shows that the viability of each component
will not be significantly undermined even if benefits derived from
tariffs are reduced by 10% or costs increased by 10%. Attachment F
presents detailed analyses of the sensitivity of the IFRRs.

3. Benefits decrease by 10%              9           6             17
E. Consumer Ability to Pay
12.       A survey of 400 urban households was conducted by the
Statistics Department of the Ministry of Economic Planning and
Industrial Development in early 1985. It indicates a median monthly
household income level of D 350. The urban income distribution curve
shows that 45% of urban households fall below the estimated urban



- 85 -
ANNEX 5
Page 5 of 12
poverty threshold of D 312 3/. However, for at least a decade, about
one-half of the urban population including all of those urban poor
supplied by the public system will continue to take water from public
standpipes at no charge 4/. Thus, the affordability issue will concern
only the upper 502 income group. In the typical situation of two
households sharing one yard tap and using 45 lcd the total monthly
consumption amounts to 5,100 gallons. At present the tariff for the
monthly bill would be D 17.7, representing 2.5Z of their total income
(2 x 350 - D 700); this figure is below the affordability limit.
13.       While water tariffs are affordable, it appears that GUC's
individual connection charges may be unaffordable to many potential
customers. A GUC customer must pay the initial cost of materials and
labor to install a service connection; these costs typically range from
D 500-D 1,200. Moreover, due to widespread default under GUC's deferred
payment plan for connections, GUC now requires payment in advance. A
rule of thumb for affordable connection charges indicates that
one-month's income is the maximum reasonable allocation. Families
earning an average of D350 per month (see para 12 above) are therefore
unlikely to be able to afford a private connection. However, since two
or three families usually share a connection, these charges are split
and become more bearable. Nonetheless, GUC's connection policy will be
reviewed under the project to explore ways to increase the affordability
of water service connections.
3/   The urban poverty threshold was estimated in accordance with OPW 2.07
guidelines:
- per capita GNP in 1985: D 870
- urban poverty level per capital (40% of 1.25 x CUP/capita) = D 435
- monthly income per family: (435 x 8.6)/12 = D 312
4/   The present cost recovery mechanism for standpipe consumption
involves GUC billing the local governments. The revenue
collection and financial management capabilities of local
governments are being improved through technical assistance
provided under the Urban Management and Development Project
(CR.1443-GK). The average cost of water to the local
governments amount to D 8.3 (US$1.20 equivalent) per consumer
each year (assuming a daily consumption of 30 lcd) and is
recoveraole through the unified property tax.  This
arrangement is cousidered to be the most efficient recovery
mechanism, and no further modifications are recommended.

ANNEX 5
Page 6 of 12
F. Tariff Structure
14.       A review of GUC's tariffs (Annex 4-3) suggests that
modifications in the present water tariff structure are desirable,
particularly in view of planr.ad tariff increases. The re-alignment of
the exchange rate of the Dalasi make them even more challenging,
specifically on the assumption that households income will not increase
accordingly. Until personal incomes rise the current minimum water
charge should be increased at a slower pace than the average tariff.
Compensation should be provided by higher volume customers having
greater ability to pay and particularly the tourism industry, the
revenues of which are not sensitive to exchange rate adjustments. The
tariff schedule should be more stepped and more steeply progressive.
Refinements in the tariff structure will be addressed in discussions
with GUC early in project implementation.
