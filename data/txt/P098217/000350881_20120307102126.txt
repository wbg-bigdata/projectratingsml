1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     The Education System Realignment and Strengthening Program was the second
phase of a planned three-phase Adaptable Program Loan (APL) to support the
Government’s reform in education sector. The Financing Agreement supporting the
second phase of the APL was signed on November 17, 2006 and became effective on
January 30, 2007. The Project was financed by an IDA Credit in the amount of SDR
10.2 million (US$ 15 million equivalent), complemented by a Japanese PHRD grant in
the amount of US$ 4.95 million and Government funding in the amount of US$ 3.78
million for a total of US$ 23.73 million.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.     The years of transition since 1991, when Georgia declared independence from the
Soviet Union, were marked by civil conflict, lack of macroeconomic discipline, and a
slow pace of structural reforms, all of which contributed to growing corruption. Upon
taking office in January 2004, after the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003, the new
Government moved decisively to curb corruption and improve Georgia’s development
prospects. Economic performance following the Rose Revolution was encouraging:
GDP growth continued to be robust at 9.3 percent in 2005 and inflation was under control.
The Government took bold steps to underpin growth through strong mechanisms of
accountability and transparency, ensuring that the population benefited from these
reforms by improving education, among others. Notwithstanding these achievements,
poverty remained at around 35 percent of the population and the delivery of public
services required significant improvement.

3.      In 2001, given the scope and pace of education reforms, the Georgian
Government and the World Bank chose a three-phase, 12-year Adaptable Program Loan
(APL) as an instrument for ensuring achievement of the operation’s development
objectives and of the long-term sustainability of education reforms. The APL focused on
realigning and strengthening of primary and secondary education, addressing
inefficiencies, inequities, and weak governance and management capacities. The three
phases were set out as follows:

      APL 1 (2001- 2007): Addressing institutional framework for the effective
       realignment of the education system objectives and a more efficient use of its
       resources.
      APL 2 (2006 - 2009): Supporting new institutional and policy framework to
       increase efficiency and quality in primary and general secondary education.
      APL 3 (est. 2009 - 2013): Supporting consolidation and extension of reforms
       nationwide and addressing external efficiency issues.

4.      The first phase of the APL supported the following education reforms: (i)
introducing a national system for assessment and examinations, including new
centralized university entrance examinations; (ii) establishing an outcomes-based national
curriculum framework; (iii) investing significantly in the in-service training of the
teaching force in modern and innovative pedagogical methods; (iv) designing and


                                            1
implementing a per-capita financing system; (v) improving teacher pay conditions; and
(vi) planning for school optimization based on a system of school networks.

5.      During the successful implementation of APL 1, education became an essential
pillar of the Georgian development strategy called Economic Development and Poverty
Reduction Program – supported by a Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSP). In
August 2006, the Government set out a major reform program to bring the Georgian
education system in line with European standards. This included an improved Education
Management Information System (EMIS), the eradication of corruption at all levels of
the education system, and a transition to a new system of education financing. It also
included the establishment of a quality assurance system at all levels of the education
system and efforts to improve the school infrastructure and management. The PRSP was
extended in October 2006 and brought important improvements for the education sector,
such as participation for the first time in international benchmarking exercises, Trends in
International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Progress in International
Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS); improved student assessments and school accreditation;
and fine-tuning the per capita financing to make education financing more efficient in the
future.

6.      At the same time, a number of critical challenges remained in the sector.
Expenditure in education in Georgia was about 2.8 percent of GDP, which was low
compared to the regional average of approximately 4 percent. This limited funding
resulted in multiple constraints across the education sector, but the impact was most
visible in the deteriorated physical condition of many schools, which impeded teaching
and learning. Of immediate importance, the Government needed to address two
challenges: (i) school building infrastructure, and (ii) the need for structural reforms to
meet the demands of a market economy and a democratic society. These challenges
needed to be achieved through modernization of the curricula and assessment methods;
teacher education in line with new pedagogical approaches; optimization of schools and
increase of the student-teacher ratio; and an overall financing strategy for the education
sector.

7.     The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) approved in October 2005, established
the goals of improving efficiency of public resources, building the foundations of growth
and employment, and strengthening human development as important elements to
support the economic development of Georgia. The CPS recognized that insufficient
resources for education at both the national and the local levels prevented adequate
investments in quality improvements in this sector. As a result, the CPS envisaged the
Education APL 2 as an essential element in providing these quality improvements.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.     The overall Program (2001-2013) objective was to improve the quality and
relevance of primary and secondary school learning outcomes to better prepare students
to meet the demands of a market economy and a participatory society. This objective
was to be fully achieved by the end of the three-phase Program. The achievement of the
Program overall objective was to be measured by the following performance indicators:

     Share of consolidated budget for education allocated to primary and general
      secondary levels increased to 60 percent.
     Resources transferred to schools are used in a more efficient, equitable and
      transparent manner.
     Professional qualifications and composition of teaching force meets reform needs.
     Utilization of school buildings reflects more efficient use of space.
     Student learning outcomes in higher order cognitive skills, as measured by exams
      and assessment scores, reflect satisfactory performance.
     International benchmarking of learning outcomes are used.

9.     The PDO of the APL 2 was to increase the quality and efficiency of primary
and secondary education in Georgia through the implementation of the institutional
and policy framework developed under the APL 1, as well as the reconstruction of
schools in dire physical condition. The key performance indicators of the APL 2
focused on quality and efficiency, as follows:

Quality indicators
  1. National share of teachers introducing more active pedagogical practices in the
       classrooms increased from 10 to 70 percent.
  2. Percentage of children learning according to the improved national curriculum
       increased from 2 to 70 percent.
  3. Percentage of teachers certified according to new standards increased from zero to
       20 percent.
  4. Percentage of children studying in the 38 schools identified as in emergency
       conditions (including the 7 schools to be reconstructed by IDA) to be in safe and
       improved learning environments increased from 30 to 100 percent.

Efficiency indicators
     1. Percentage of schools having autonomy in managing resources related to the
        teaching and learning process through per capita financing as the sole source of
        public funding and accountable to the appropriate authorities for the use of those
        resources increased from 75 percent to 100 percent.
     2. The national average pupil to teacher ratio increased from 12/1 to 16/1, and
        specific policies for such ratios for urban, rural and mountainous areas adopted.
     3. All schools in charge of the maintenance budget and their staff adequately trained.
        Regulatory framework which shall clearly delineate between local and national
        Governments’ responsibilities for school maintenance and capital repair in place
        by July 2008.

10.    All but one of the trigger indicators from APL 1 to APL 2 were met.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

11.      There were no revisions to the PDOs and the key indicators.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     Broadly, all 550,492 students in primary and general secondary education were
seen as beneficiaries of more efficient education services as a result of institutional
strengthening activities, and improved teaching and learning in primary and general
secondary education.

13.    Additional beneficiaries include educational agencies created under the APL 1
such as the National Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC), and the Teacher
Professional Development Center (TPDC), all of which continued to benefit from the
capacity development activities under APL2.

14.    Direct beneficiaries from investments in rehabilitated schools include the 7,562
students attending the improved schools supported under the Project. Other beneficiaries
comprise teachers participating in teacher development programs, including the 6.4
percent of all teachers who successfully completed the teacher certification process under
APL 2.

1.5 Original Components

15.      The Project included the following components:

16.     Component 1: Improving the Pedagogical Environment (US$ 7.20 million or 30
percent of total project cost). The objective of this component was to support changes in
curriculum content, teaching methodology, student assessment, initial teacher education
and continued teacher professional development, building on the institutional and policy
frameworks supported by the APL 1. The component had the following two sub-
components:

      Subcomponent 1A: National Curriculum and Student Assessment System
      Development (US$ 5.58 million). The objective of this sub-component was to
      improve the teaching content and methodologies in line with the national curriculum
      framework; to establish a system of student assessment so as to identify difficulties in
      student learning and develop targeted programs accordingly; and to assist Initial
      Teacher Education institutions to adapt their programs to take into account the
      changes in teaching standards, the national curriculum, and student assessment
      methodologies.

      Subcomponent 1B: Professional Development of Teachers (US$ 1.62 million). The
      objective of this sub-component was to improve the qualifications of teachers through
      the development and implementation of a teacher professional development system.




                                               5
17.    Component 2: Improving the Physical Learning Environment (US$ 13.95
million or 59 percent of total project cost)

18.     The objective of this component was to improve the physical learning
environment in schools in emergency conditions to complement the investments on
improving the quality of the pedagogical learning environment, and to demonstrate how
the efficiency of the school network could be improved through the adoption of more
efficient school building standards and through school consolidations.

19.    Component 3: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$ 2.58
million or 11 percent of total project cost)

20.    The objective of this component was to finance institutional support to the
Ministry of Education and Science (MoES), Project Coordination Unit (PCU), Municipal
Development Fund (MDF), NCAC, and TPDC regarding project related operations,
including procurement, financial management, audits and project monitoring and
evaluation.

1.6 Revised Components

21.    There was no revision of components during project implementation.

1.7 Other significant changes

22.    While there were no changes in design, scope, scale of the Project and
implementation arrangements, there were two amendments to the financing agreement
and two to the PHRD agreement as follows:

23.    Amendments to the Financing Agreement: Both IDA Financing Agreement
and co-financing PHRD Grant (TF057515) were amended twice, to allow extensions with
a cumulative effect of 20 months. The main reasons for the extensions were to make up
for implementation delays.

      (a) The first extension, from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010, was
          needed to allow completion of construction of two schools and to support the
          Borrower with key education reform activities under the related PHRD Grant
          (TF057515) including the roll out of in-service teacher training, curriculum
          reforms, and textbook translations for minority languages.

      (b) The second extension, from December 31, 2010 till August 31st, 2011, was
          granted in order to allow for the completion of the remaining project activities
          financed by the PHRD, particularly the completion of national assessments in
          grade four Mathematics and Georgian Language and Literature, strengthening
          of the existing teacher professional development opportunities, and finalization
          of teacher professional development framework.

24.    Borrower Contribution to Project Financing: Counterpart financing at
appraisal was estimated at US$ 3.8 million or 15.9 percent of total project costs. By
                                            6
project closing, Government counterpart contribution totaled US$ 3.23 million or 90
percent of the originally planned.

25.     Exchange Rate Fluctuation: Exchange rate fluctuation involving the local
currency (GEL), the US dollar and SDR was significant. Overall, estimated gains
resulting from exchange rate fluctuation was approximately US$ 1.1 million. The
additional resources were used to cover increases in construction costs.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26.     Project design was consistent with Government’s policies and the objectives
from the start. Education was an essential pillar of the Georgian development strategy.
As noted earlier, the 2005 PRSP provided the policy dialogue framework to support the
Government’s education reform and supported the infrastructure and technical assistance
envisaged under the Project. The 2006 PRSP committed Georgia to participate for the
first time in international benchmarking exercises (TIMSS and PIRLS), to improve
student assessments and to fine-tune the per capita financing to make education financing
more efficient in the future. Consistently, project design provided for the necessary
technical and infrastructure support to support these goals.

27.     Project design was coordinated well by the Government with other development
partners. By appraisal, several development partners, such as the United States Agency
for International Development (USAID), UN agencies (UNICEF, UNDP), the Japanese
Government, and the TEMPUS Program financed by European Union were supporting
the development of the education sector through bilateral agreements. This partnership
was fostered through their cooperation to adopt a joint comprehensive education strategy
needed to make Georgia eligible for the Education for All - Fast Track Initiative
(EFA - FTI). The EFA FTI partnership formed in Georgia helped to create a solid
ground for Government and donors’ cooperation, ensuring complementarity of activities
and avoiding duplication of efforts during project design.

28.    Project design was in line with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) - endorsed by the Board in October 2005. The Project was a key feature of the
CPS, which established goals of improving efficiency of public resources, building the
foundations of growth and employment, and strengthening human development.

29.     Project design incorporated lessons learned from Bank experiences in other
countries of the region. The Bank-financed Education Reform Project in Romania
(P008784) and the Latvia Education Improvement Project (P049172) both showed that it
was possible to strengthen the institutional competency of public agencies through
intensive training, a clear communication strategy, and provision of high-level technical
assistance. These lessons were incorporated into project design.

30.    The instrument choice – an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) –was adequate to
respond to Government’s sector strategy needs. The choice of instrument provided a
longer term framework for implementing reforms in the sector, as well as predictable
longer-term financing and support by the Bank. It also allowed for lessons from the
                                           7
earlier phase to be incorporated into the APL 2. For instance, the strong support for
teacher training under the Project as well as the bottom-up approach to teacher
development activities emerged from lessons of APL 1, which demonstrated that teacher
training was pivotal to bringing changes into the classroom and the bottom-up approach
facilitated teachers, pupils’ and parents’ buy-in.

31.     Project design was underpinned by analytical work undertaken by the Bank
using administrative and statistical information gathered at several levels of
governance. Project preparation relied extensively on educational and financial MoES
data drawn from EMIS 2004, as well as data from the Georgia Statistics Bureau. Another
source of information that contributed to the design of Component II was the 2005
Municipal Reconstruction Program. Scholars’ papers were used to substantiate the case
for further investments in school infrastructure. Bank analytical research, such as
Accommodating Human Capital Development in Georgia (2004), and Georgia: Poverty
Profile (2003), were other sources of information that fed the background analysis.

32.    Project risks, rated overall as moderate at appraisal, were properly identified
and adequate mitigation measures were incorporated in the Project. For example:
     In order to address the risk of political shifts resulting in changes in priorities,
       project design was flexible enough to be adapted to changing circumstances.
     ?he likelihood of insufficient motivation of MDF to make education a priority
       area was also addressed. MDF was provided an overhead budget from project
       resources, which was performance-based.
     Fiduciary risks were addressed by ensuring an appropriate complaints-handling
       mechanism; adjusting procurement thresholds; enhancing the disclosure and
       transparency of project-related information; and ensuring appropriate financial
       reporting and external audit capacity.

33.    Notwithstanding the solid preparatory work, project design had one
shortcoming that ended up compromising the full achievement of the Project’s
Development Objective: it failed to fully address some of the underlying causes for the
increase in student-teacher ratio in Georgia. For instance:

    The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) explained the expected demographic
      dynamics of Georgia, especially the decrease in school age population. However,
      project design foresaw only two measures to address this: school consolidation
      and full implementation and adjustments of the per-capita financing. While these
      measures worked well in highly populated areas, they did not yield the same
      results in the isolated, low density areas, where neither option was acceptable for
      a number of reasons, including lack of motivation and incentives to close a school,
      or a weak infrastructure which does not allow for students’ transportation into
      another one. It is the ICR team’s opinion that, while there was a good analysis of
      the problem, there was insufficient attention paid to dealing with the socio-
      political reasons for keeping small schools open; therefore, other policy options
      for improving efficiency and performance in small, remote schools were not
      explored.



                                            8
    Another over-looked factor affecting the student-teacher ratio was the increase in
      the teaching force. A deeper analysis of this phenomenon shows that key reasons
      for it included: (1) the curriculum reform and introduction of the additional
      classes, such as Information Communication Technology (ICT), dance, etc.,
      caused an increase in the number of required subject teachers, and (2) the lack of
      any incentives for teachers to retire, given that there was no mandatory retirement
      age, and pensions were low relative to salaries. The Project supported the teacher
      certification process that could potentially have impacted the student to teacher
      ratio, but certification becomes mandatory only by the end of 2014 and large
      teacher turnovers, if any, could not have been expected until that time.

2.2 Implementation

34.    Overall, project implementation went smoothly, challenges were overcome, and
most outcomes were achieved. Positive factors that influenced project achievements
include:

      Broad reforms in Public Finance Management (PFM) of Georgia created a
       conducive environment for better performance of government agencies, including
       those responsible for project implementation.
      The Project benefitted from experience and knowledge of the human resources
       engaged under APL 1. The PCU responsible for implementing the first phase of
       the Program (APL 1) – a separate legal entity subordinated to the MoES –
       continued to handle the financial management of the Project until the APL I
       closed (June 30, 2007). The NCAC and the TPDC - agencies subordinated to the
       MoES (legally, managerially, and financially) - had the institutional mandate to
       implement specific programs. The agencies were established in the first quarter
       of 2006 and were staffed with fiduciary and other personnel required for carrying
       out their core functions.
      With the closure of the APL 1, the financial management staff of the PCU was
       mainstreamed into the two agencies, thus ensuring continuity and retention of
       qualified staff while moving away from using separate project implementation
       units. Additionally, those agencies were supported legally to perform fiduciary
       tasks on the use of Credit funds and project activities through individual
       agreements with the MoES. The NCAC and TPDC were responsible for
       implementing Component 1: Improving the Pedagogical Environment
       (Subcomponents 1A: Development of National Curriculum and Student
       Assessment System and 1B: Professional Development of Teachers). They were
       also responsible for monitoring the outcome and their intermediate indicators, and
       furnishing the Bank bi-annual progress reports on the status of the project
       implementation.
      The Project benefitted from strong cooperation with the Municipal Development
       Fund (MDF) which is a specialized government agency for public civil works, to
       carry out the financial management functions of the school reconstruction
       program (Component 2: Improving the Physical Learning Environment), and to
       be responsible for financial management and reporting to the MoES, the MoF and
       the Bank. In addition to the fiduciary responsibilities mentioned above, MDF was
       able to capitalize on its technical expertise and experience in working with other

                                           9
       development partners, thus contributing to the smooth implementation of
       Component 2. Throughout the Project, the MDF was in charge of procurement
       and supervision of civil works; consequently, all schools were constructed in an
       effective and efficient manner, and the quality of the buildings was satisfactory.

35.    During implementation, two key events created challenges for the Project.
Following the August 2008 conflict 160,000 people were internally displaced. This
diverted the Government’s focus from routine activities, including those associated with
the Project. In addition, the conflict resulted in increased cost for civil works, as the
demand for construction materials increased with the need for post-conflict
reconstruction. For this reason, one company which had won two bids for project-
financed schools construction could not complete the works within the agreed price.
Therefore works were interrupted until contracts were cancelled and new bidding
processes were launched, causing significant delays in project implementation.

36.     The second challenge was that several re-organizations took place within MoES
and the two other educational agencies – NCAC and the TPDC - which affected the pace
of project implementation. Activities assigned to the two institutions were mostly to be
financed by the PHRD. Both credit-funded and PHRD-funded activities suffered delays
necessitating extension of the closing date twice.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

37.     Design. The PAD included a comprehensive set of outcome and intermediate
indicators, which reflected well project objectives. The PCU established under the APL
1 would monitor and report systematically on them through the bi-annual progress reports,
for as long as APL 1 and 2 would overlap. Implementing Agencies would then take over
the task. This design also sought to measure project impact so as to inform decision
making for additional education policy reforms. Important testing and measuring
instruments for students and teachers were planned so that enough information would be
produced to measure the impact of the Project. The Education Management Information
System (EMIS), developed under the APL 1, was planned to provide data for school
consolidation, use of per-capita financing system, etc.

38.     Implementation.     The Project’s M&E activities and framework were
implemented as planned. The Project benefited from M&E capacities gained by MoES
during the implementation of the APL 1, and by using the PCU, which helped during
transition from Phase one to Phase two. Later PCU functions for M&E became
integrated into the NCAC, which maintained the overall project monitoring functions.
The subordinated implementing agencies (TPDC, NCAC, and MDF) furnished to the
Bank bi-annual progress reports on the status of project implementation and reported on
the outputs and outcomes status. The reports were prepared in a satisfactory manner.




                                           10
39.    In addition to the testing instruments for teachers and students that were
developed successfully, the following assessments carried out under the Project
supported project monitoring: (i) the Classroom Observation Research (NCAC); and (ii)
evaluation of teacher professional development programs such as Teacher Induction Pilot
Program, Teach for Georgia Pilot Program, and Teacher Voucher Program by TPDC.

40.     Utilization. A disappointing aspect of the M&E system established under the
Program was that the Government did not use it sufficiently. For example, the first phase
of the Program financed the introduction of a national EMIS system. Yet reports
generated by the EMIS were not published on a yearly basis as planned, nor were the
results readily available to key stakeholder groups. Further, there is little evidence that
the results of the national and international student assessments were used by policy
makers and other education professionals for further analysis and policy making.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental safeguards

41.    The Project was classified as a Category B operation. An Environmental
Management Framework (EMF) was developed for the construction of the new schools
and was published on the MDF’s website in English and Georgian. Its enforcement in
the course of project implementation by MDF for ensuring environmental compliance
was considered satisfactory throughout implementation.

Fiduciary arrangements

42.   Three agencies were in charge of fiduciary arrangements for the Project:
Municipal Development Fund (MDF), National Curriculum and Assessment Center
(NCAC), and Teacher Professional Development Center (TPDC).        Throughout
implementation, their performance was found satisfactory.

43.     The NCAC and the TPDC were equipped with the institutional mandate to
implement relevant programs, and were staffed with fiduciary and other staff required for
carrying out their core functions, including financial management staff of the PCU of the
APL 1. As noted above, the MoES reached an agreement with the MDF for carrying out
the financial management and procurement function of the school reconstruction program
(Components 2 and 3 of the project).

44.    Audit reports: The annual audited project financial statements were received on
time and were found unqualified by the auditors. The audit report of 2009 mentioned
some irregularities regarding an un-recovered advance to a NCAC deceased staff and a
payment done by Treasury but not accounted at NCAC books. However, those issues
were addressed and did not recur.




                                            11
45.    Internal reporting: The Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) were generally
produced on time and of satisfactory quality. Each implementing agency produced its
own semi-annual IFRs for the components under their management. These reports were
acceptable to the Bank.

46.    Disbursement: Disbursements generally worked as planned, with some delays
due to the August 2008 conflict, as noted above. An undisbursed balance of amount of
US$ 9,458 was canceled after the end of the grace period for reconciliation of accounting.

47.    Procurement: Agencies responsible for procurement under the Project, i.e. the
PIU (at the beginning), MDF, NCAC, and TPDC showed satisfactory procurement
performance. No significant challenges or delays were encountered in the procurement
procedures.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

48.      Next Steps: The Georgian Government continues to have education as one of its
priorities. The MoES adopted the Strategy for the Development of Education (2010-
2015), which covers all levels of education, with an emphasis on general secondary
education. Some of the new initiatives include, among others: improvements in English
proficiency and ITC literacy in primary education, and introduction of school leaving
exams at the end of secondary school. The Bank’s team provided advice to the MoES in
the course of preparation of their strategy, including suggesting areas for further analysis,
and approaches for translating the strategy into an implementation plan with timelines
and estimated budgets.

49.     Despite the fact that the Bank committed to a 12-year partnership to support the
reforms in the education sector via a three-phased APL, the Georgian Government does
not envisage a third phase of the APL at this time. There are two key reasons behind the
Government’s decision. First, given the global economic crisis, the Government has
decided to focus Bank resources on supporting regional development efforts and
infrastructure improvements, as agreed in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
Georgia for FY10-13 (48918 - GE). Second, the Government is expected to benefit from
a large grant from the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), estimated around US$
100 million, likely to be focused on education and training.

50.     Nonetheless, as part of its analytical work in Georgia, the Bank will prepare a
series of policy notes in 2012 to assess progress to date in both basic and higher
education, and to identify remaining gaps in the sector in order provide recommendations
for further strengthening of the education system. The Bank also aims to continue its
active role in the donor coordination teams to enhance the synergies between the various
donor programs and to avoid duplication of effort.

51.     Sustainability: Sustainability of key project achievements is likely. First, the
Government’s commitment to the education reform has remained steady, as demonstrated
by its continuous budget allocation for the staffing and future programs of the NCAC and
the TPDC to continue modernization efforts. Second, the Project supported building

                                             12
institutional capacity within the MoES and its key agencies so that they would be able to
sustain and further expand modernization efforts.

52.      At the same time, the ICR team notes that the relatively young institutions
established to support the education modernization agenda are still evolving, with
continued challenges both in the coordination among themselves and their interactions
with the public. The changing mandates of these institutions raise concerns about the
fragility of sustaining the capacity built during the first two phases of this APL, and of
their activities in support of the ongoing reforms. These new challenges must be
carefully addressed by the Government, which should focus on sustaining progress made
thus far and ensuring further institutional development and consolidation.

53.     Further, there is a clear risk that human resource capacity would be lost with
staffing changes resulting from the institutional ones mentioned above. For example,
NCAC competencies on curriculum development, implementation and monitoring have
been transferred to MoES; assessment competencies are being transferred to the newly
created National Center for Educational Quality Enhancement (NCEQE). At the time of
writing of this report, few of the NCAC staff trained and experienced in either curriculum
reform or in assessments had been transferred to the new entities.

54.     Maintenance: Maintenance costs and implications for the recurrent budget of the
education sector have been factored in the per-capita financing formula, so that schools
have an adequate level of resources and autonomy to conduct the task. While the initial
allocations did not fully cover utility costs, resulting in a significant number of schools
needing additional budget allocations to cover their running costs, the most recent
revision of the per capita financing formula should have taken care of these gaps.

55.    In order to ensure the sustainability of the civil works investments for
construction and rehabilitation, a School Maintenance Manual was developed, and a
regulatory framework to delineate the national and local responsibilities for capital

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

56.     The Development Objective of the Project was to improve the quality and
efficiency in primary and secondary education in Georgia through the implementation of
the institutional and policy framework developed under APL 1, as well as reconstruction
of schools in dire physical condition.

57.    The ICR team concluded that the Project was relevant at the time of design and
remains relevant today. Likewise, its implementation remained on track, responding to
the key issues identified at the design, and responding to sector priorities, as highlighted
below:

      Project design was consistent with the education goals of the PRSP (2006) and
       the Country Assistance Strategy of 2005 (CAS). The PRSP supported a major
       reform program to bring the Georgian education system in line with the European
                                            13
           standards, with priorities such as establishing a quality assurance system at all
           levels of education, and increasing efforts to improve school infrastructure and
           management. The CAS focused on strengthening human capital and recognized
           that insufficient resources at both the national and local levels for education
           prevented adequate investments in quality improvements.

          ?he PDO continues to be highly relevant as (i) improving the quality of primary
           and secondary education continues to be at the core of the Government’s reform
           agenda; (ii) supporting improvements in school learning environment through
           curriculum and teacher reforms are pre-requisites to improve learning; and (iii)
           fixing schools in emergency conditions is not only a Government priority but a
           matter of ensuring student and staff safety.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

58.        The ICR team assesses the outcome of this Project as Moderately Satisfactory.

59.   A set of eight Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and eight Intermediate
Outcome Indicators were designed to monitor progress towards the achievement of the
PDO. Below, this document discusses the achievements of outcome indicators.

Improving Quality

60.   Outcome Indicator 1: 70 percent of teachers introducing more active
pedagogical practices in the classrooms.

61.     Achieved - The Classroom Observation Research carried out by the NCAC in
2011 provides evidence that this target has been met, as the majority of teachers were
using new methodologies in their classes and demonstrating positive attitudes towards the
new practices. According to this research, 71.4 percent of Georgian teachers are able to
apply at least one active instruction methodology. Table 2 below presents application of
different teaching methodologies by teachers.

62.     The further positive shift in teachers’ attitudes to active teaching and learning
over the last few years can be demonstrated by comparing the results of the Evaluation of
the Ilia Chavchavadze Program in Reforming and Strengthening Georgia’s Schools
(PADECO, 2007), carried out as part of the APL 1 of this Program, and the above
Classroom Observation Research (NCAC, 2011)1. According to the table below, teachers
in 2007 were still strongly clinging to traditional attitudes regarding concepts of
individual work (versus group work), that teaching should be centered around correct
answers and presentation of facts, and that the teachers’ role should be to provide


1
  Both evaluations used similar teacher survey forms, which asked six items to learn more about teachers’ attitudes towards active
learning. In order to get accurate response to questions where teachers might suspect the “right? answers are those in congruence with
the newer methods, these questions were worded so that the answer assumes that the traditional methods are the “right? response.




                                                                 14
feedback so students could improve. In contrast, the evidence from the recent survey
suggests that an increasing number of teachers have accepted and started to prioritize
innovative teaching methodologies that are focused on promoting active learning.

63.     In line with the assumption that an effective teacher training system is essential to
diversify provision of teacher training, a decentralized teacher training system was
designed and implemented with project funds. TPDC developed guidelines and standards
for the accreditation of teachers’ continued professional development programs. There
were 172 such programs accredited by the MoES and the provision of teacher in-service
training was outsourced to private providers. All accredited training providers were
eligible to get financing from the state voucher program.

64.     Despite the achievement of this outcome, the ICR team noted that the new in-
service teacher training model designed and implemented as part of the Project was not
sustained. As the quality of some of the accredited programs was questioned, in 2010 the
function of in-service teacher training provision was shifted to the Teacher Professional
Development Center (TPDC) and the state voucher program to accredited providers was
discontinued. The insufficient alternative funding for teacher training in addition to
discontinuation of the vouchers’ system discouraged both high and low quality providers
from remaining in this market, and contributed to the re-centralization of teacher training
with TPDC as the key provider. Further efforts and commitment are needed to learn
from the implementation experience of the decentralized provision of in-service teacher
education, and how to build quality assurance mechanisms for an effective diversified
teacher training program.

65.    Outcome Indicator 2: 70 percent of children learning according to the improved
national curriculum.

66.    Exceeded - The National Curriculum and Assessment Center (NCAC) piloted and
gradually implemented the new national curriculum developed under the first phase of


                                                     15
        the Program in all schools across the country, except for grade six in Georgian schools
        and grades five and six in minority schools2. This process took place between 2006-2009,
        as originally envisaged. The curriculum implementation involved curriculum-based
        trainings for about 25,000 teachers and 2,000 school principals.

        67.     By the time the Project closed, 90 percent of children in Georgia were learning
        according to the new national curriculum. Further changes/revisions were introduced in
        the curriculum framework in 2010, which is being implemented in primary grades (1 to
        6) in all schools from 2011-2012 academic years and in basic and secondary grades (7 to
        12) from 2012-2013 academic years.

        68.    Outcome Indicator 3: 20 percent of teachers certified according to new
        standards and trained according to new standards.

        69.    Not Achieved - As part of the Project, both professional standards and subject
        standards have been successfully developed and adopted by MoES (Decree No. 1014 as
        of November 21, 2008) for the teachers of primary, basic and secondary education levels.
        The standards are easily accessible through the Center’s website at www.tpdc.ge.

        70.    The new standards for teachers as well as the new national curriculum framework
        provided the foundation for the design and implementation of the teacher certification
        system. The Teacher Certification Charter was adopted by MoES decree No. 1101 dated
        December 12, 2009.

        71.      The first set of teacher certification examinations in professional skills and
        selected subjects (Georgian Language & Literature, Math and Foreign Languages) took
        place in July 2010. The examinations were administered by the NEC in the Tbilisi
        Technical University and 12 other examination centers across the country. To be
        certified, teachers had to pass both the subject and professional skills examinations. A
        total of 9,906 teachers participated in the process in 2010, out of which 11 percent were
        certified after passing both the subject and professional skills examinations. In July 2011,
        the number of teacher certification examinations was expanded to include Biology,
        Geography, Physics, Chemistry, History and Civic Education. About 23,519 teachers
        took the examinations in 2011, out of which 15.4 percent were certified (see detailed
        statistics in the table below).

72.     Despite important progress achieved in designing and launching the
implementation of the teacher certification process in the country, as of today only 6.4
percent of the total teaching cohort has been certified, far below the intended 20 percent
indicator. A key reason for not achieving this indicator was the Government’s decision
to postpone the launch of teacher certification examinations to 2010, as opposed to 2008
as initially planned. Further, certification will only become mandatory by the end of
2014 according to the law on Secondary Education, which explains the relatively low
participation rates of teachers in the initial two years. It is expected that all teachers will
participate in the process by the end of 2014. Another reason is that, among those who
actually took the examinations, less than 15 percent were able to pass both tests in order
to be certified.

73.    Outcome Indicator 4: 100 percent of children currently studying in the 38
schools identified as in emergency conditions will be in safe and improved learning
environments.

74.     Achieved - By project closing, the physical learning environment in 35 schools
identified as in emergency conditions had been rehabilitated and refurnished and the
rehabilitation of the remaining three schools is almost completed. The seven IDA-
financed schools either replaced existing schools that were structurally unsafe or built
schools for students previously accommodated in educationally inappropriate places. In
parallel, the Government provided financial support for the rehabilitation/reconstruction
of 31 schools.

75.     The quality of the seven schools constructed with IDA financing has been found
satisfactory. These schools have been designed to accommodate innovations introduced
in the curriculum, including modern classrooms tailored for interactive teaching and
learning, libraries, well-equipped gyms and recreation zones for meetings, group work
and discussions, access for children and adults with disabilities, and other provisions to
ensure inclusive education. The Government decided to hold a design contest for the
new school construction rather than applying a standard design to all schools. In
hindsight this decision presented efficiency issues, in terms of design and construction
cost.

76.     Another observation regarding these schools is that they were super-dimensioned,
therefore having utility costs significantly higher than in average school. The Project was
designed with an understanding that each of these schools would provide for a
consolidation of two or more other existing schools and the Ministry would provide a
school bus to them to facilitate this process. Nonetheless, currently only two schools out
of the seven serve the intended number of students: (i) Borjomi School No.3, which was
merged with the two neighboring schools, and (ii) Village Digomi School, which was
able to attract more students who previously used to go to Tbilisi schools. In the
remaining five schools, the envisaged school consolidation has not happened yet, and the
new schools serve fewer students than originally envisaged. At the same time, the new
school facilities offer well equipped classrooms, gym, and recreation zones that could
potentially offer facilities for extra curricula activities as well as for tailored vocational
programs, but currently the facilities are not used at the full capacity. It is hoped that the
                                              17
Government encourages more effective utilization of the new physical resources
available to better serve the broader objectives of providing better quality of schooling.

Improving Efficiency

77.     Outcome Indicator 5: 100 percent of schools having autonomy in managing
resources related to the teaching and learning process through the per capita financing as
the sole source of public funding and accountable to the appropriate authorities in the use
of those resources.

78.     Not Achieved - Finance and governance reforms carried out in the education
sector in 2005 made all public schools autonomous and accountable to the authorities for
the use of funds. The first phase of the Program supported the design and
implementation of the per capita financing formula in general education institutions
across the country in 2005. Notwithstanding important transparency and efficiency
improvements following the new funding scheme, the financing formula required further
adjustments especially for small rural schools, which were unable to fully cover their
costs under the new system. Throughout 2011, the Government implemented further
changes to the financing system for general secondary education. Based on information
provided by MoES, as a result of these changes and improvements, the number of schools
carrying a deficit decreased from 1,400 in 2010 to only 167 deficit schools in 2011. The
remaining 167 schools – which represent 7% of schools 3 - share the same set of
characteristics, they either have more than one school building under their jurisdiction or
more than one language of instruction (mostly in minority schools), which increases their
costs. Further changes are planned to the financing formula for December 2012 to
address the needs of these schools as well.

79.    Outcome Indicator 6: The national average student/teacher ratio increased to
16/1, with specific ratios for urban, rural and mountainous areas.

80.     Not Achieved - The national student to teacher ratio is currently 10/1, a
deterioration from the 12/1 baseline.

81.     Various reforms undertaken by the Government, such as the per-capita financing
and school autonomy supported under the APL 1, provided incentives for the reduction of
the teaching cadre and the consolidation of schools, particularly in urban settings, where
more than 1,000 schools were consolidated between 2005 and 2011. Nonetheless, these
reforms did not prove sufficient to reduce the national average student-teacher ratio and
this indicator was the only trigger under the APL 1 that was not met.

82.     As discussed earlier, a key factor behind the low student-teacher ratio was the
geographic differences in Georgia, which has many schools in high-mountain regions
with less than 100 students. For this reason, at the time of project preparation it was
agreed that the Government would elaborate a strategy to increase the student-teacher
ratio based on specific ratios for urban, rural and mountain areas. However, no specific

    The total number of schools decreased between 2005 and 2011.


                                                         18
actions were taken to address the problem. At the same time, the public resistance to
school closures in remote villages was high, as schools are often the only visible public
building in these communities, and frequently the only employment opportunity for the
villagers; moreover, harsh winters make it difficult to transport students to schools to
nearby villages. Furthermore, as the education budget gradually increased in the last two
years, the pressure to rationalize schools and increase the student-teacher ratio has
decreased.

83.     Overall, the ICR team’s assessment as to why the Project was not able to attain
this outcome involves a combination of factors. First, the interventions supported by the
Project were limited in their potential impact on the performance indicator. Second,
stakeholders’ resistance to closures was under-estimated and, therefore, not appropriately
mitigated. Third, in terms of the overall size of the teaching force, the changes to the
national curriculum framework of 2010 resulted in the need to hire additional teachers
with the introduction of new mandatory subject areas (English and ICT) as well as other
new topics (i.e. Civil Defense and Safety; World Culture; Dance Classes), which the
existing teachers were not qualified to teach. Further, as already mentioned, there is no
mandatory retirement age for teachers, and due to low pensions teachers have little
incentive to leave the teaching force. Finally, demographic changes mean that the
student population in Georgia is shrinking, as Table 4 shows. Combined, these factors
inevitably lead to an average decrease in the student-teacher ratio, which requires
alternative measures to be addressed.

84.     Outcome Indicator 7: 100 percent of schools in charge of maintenance budget
and staff adequately trained.

85.     Achieved - All schools in Georgia are in charge of their maintenance budget
according to the law on Secondary Education. Routine school maintenance is financed
from the overall school budget allocated on the basis of a per capita financing formula,
whereas capital expenditures are financed either by the state or local government budget.
The Project financed the elaboration of the manual “Improving Schools Physical
Learning Environment? to support the development of new approaches to maintenance
policy, planning and management in schools, as a complementary strategy in improving
and sustaining their physical environment. The manual was published and distributed by
MoES in May 2008. The Project also financed training in school maintenance for all
Education Resource Centers, which eventually trained schools under their jurisdiction.
Finally, in 2010, the Project also supported the development of a human resource
management manual for schools and a manual for “School Sanitation Maintenance.?

                                           19
Training modules were prepared on the basis of these documents. About 500 school
principals were trained in August 2011.

86.    Outcome Indicator 8: Regulatory framework in place which shall clearly
delineate between local and national Governments’ responsibilities for school
maintenance and capital repair.

87.     Achieved - The respective amendment was made in the law on Secondary
Education in 2006, according to which the responsibility for capital repair lies with the
state and or/local self-government.

88.    Finally, it should be noted that there were four triggers for the third phase of the
APL, as listed in Table 5 below. All of those triggers were met but, due to reasons
explained earlier, the Government has decided not to proceed with APL 3.

3.3 Efficiency
89.      The ICR team reviewed two aspects of efficiency when preparing this document -
efficiency linked to sector management, and efficiency resulting from improved
education quality. The overall conclusion is that there is insufficient evidence to
determine if the Project had a positive impact on sector efficiency. It should be noted,
however, that the Project did significantly contribute to setting the stage for greater
reforms normally linked to a more efficient education sector, as evidenced in other
countries. This was done both by promoting decentralization and accountability at the
institutional level, and by establishing education data collection and monitoring systems,
including the EMIS, to enable informed decision-making. Finally, Georgia now has its
own national student assessment system and participates in TIMSS, PIRLS, PISA thus
giving stakeholders a strong sense of how its students are performing.

90.    In terms of sector management, the Project’s Development Objective itself
included addressing efficiency gains in the sector, to be achieved through the
                                                   20
decentralization of resources and decision-making to the school level, and by increasing
the student-teacher ratio. As already discussed, by project completion, per capita
financing was implemented in 100% of schools and they were given autonomy and
training to manage their resources; as indicator 5 shows, 93 percent of all schools are not
only managing their resources without any deficits. The formula has promoted
transparency in the allocation of resources. Further, the per capita formula benefited
from adjustments to make it more responsive to the different realities of schools (location,
size, etc.). Additionally, a regulatory framework was put in place clearly specifying
rights and responsibilities of the different levels of Government as far as school
maintenance and capital repair. While it is too soon to determine if and what type of
efficiency gains these changes will lead to, there is recognition that increasing school
autonomy, when accompanied by greater accountability, often results in efficiency gains
(Bruns, Filmer and Patrinos, 2011). In the case of Georgia, the Project was implemented
in a context where governance enhancements were taking place throughout the
Government, including in the education sector. Thus, the ICR team anticipates that the
combination of greater overall governance and decentralization in the education sector is
likely have a positive impact on efficiency.

91.     At the same time, as already mentioned, a key measurement of efficiency under
the Project was its impact to increase the student-teacher ratio, which, at project closing,
had only further deteriorated. While there was a 10 percent reduction in the number of
schools during project implementation, it still fell short of its rationalization target;
further, some of the schools that were replaced under the Project are still operating below
their capacity. The ICR team presented some explanations for the Project’s inability to
successfully achieve this indicator and, on this account, it is clear that the Project failed to
increase sector efficiency.

92.     In terms of quality improvement, the Project financed important school and
classroom inputs aimed at positively affecting learning. Reduction in drop out and
repetition rates would be signs of more efficient use of resources. More importantly,
improved student performance is also another element of system efficiency, basically
showing that education investments are getting better “returns.? Unfortunately, the
available data on the student performance presents comparison and attribution issues so
they are, at best, an indicator of progress. The 2010 National Assessment Report for 4th
graders in Mathematics and Georgian shows a seven percent point increase in the number
of students able to correctly answer test items, as compared to 2004 data. Once TIMSS
2010 results become available, one will have a comparison with TIMSS 2007, both
enabling to determine if Georgian students are performing better in both absolute and
relative terms.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.    The Project’s overall outcome rating is assessed as Moderately Satisfactory based
on its important achievements, including meeting and/or exceeding five out of eight
outcome indicators. The Project was highly relevant at the time of its design and
remained so during implementation as it was able to reinforce strategic reforms by
supporting large-scale implementation of innovations planned and implemented under the
                                           21
APL 1. At the same time, two important outcomes fell short of expectations: (i) the
Project did not have a positive impact on increasing the student-teacher ratio; and (ii) a
significant percentage of teachers were not certified by its completion.        The third
indicator, 100 percent of schools having autonomy in managing resources related to the
teaching and learning process through the per capita financing as the sole source of
public funding, was partially achieved.

94.    Quality improvements carried out under the Project that are directly benefiting
students include:

      nation-wide implementation of the new national curriculum, which is currently
       benefiting 90 percent of Georgian students;
      teacher development and new teaching and learning materials distributed to
       schools;
      development of standards for teacher competencies, teacher certification and new
       teacher professional development framework;
      design of teacher certification mechanisms, including supporting the technical and
       legal frameworks, and implementation of certification examinations nation-wide
       for the last two years;
      creation of solid technical capacity in the National Curriculum and Assessment
       Center as well as the Teachers Professional Development Center;
      construction and rehabilitation of schools in emergency conditions in remote and
       rural areas, replacing unsafe structures; and
      development of school maintenance policies and training of school administrators
       in maintenance issues.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

95.    As part of the preparation of the Project, a Rapid Social Assessment (RSA) was
conducted. The overall objective of the RSA was to ensure that reforms intended to
increase access to and quality of education, particularly for the poor, did not result in
unintended negative consequences, and to assist the Project to maximize its positive
impact. The RSA highlighted the need to encourage more community participation, to
enhance awareness about education reforms, and to focus more attention on the deprived
communities. Subsequently, concrete steps were made regarding the use of financing
formula for remote schools (called deficit schools) to address their specific challenges.
Furthermore, the Project targeted the schools in poorer areas, also the ones most in need
of rehabilitation, and looked carefully at the safety of schools, and at the issues of
absenteeism and drop-out due to poor school conditions. Thus, the ICR team feels that
the Project correctly ensured that students from poorer backgrounds were key project
beneficiaries. It should be noted that there were no specific gender aspects highlighted
under the RSA that required a specific focus under the Project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

96.    The Project contributed to strengthening technical capacity within the sector
through extensive training of the core staff in the National Curriculum and Assessment
                                            22
Center and the Teacher Professional Development Center. Strong technical capacities
were built in the areas of curriculum, pedagogy, assessment of learning outcomes and
textbook evaluation, which remain highly important and relevant for the management of
the education sector in the long run.

97.     The Project supported a major shift from ad-hoc teacher training towards the
design of system-wide teacher polices, such as the development of professional and
subject standards for teachers, the new professional development framework for teachers,
mechanisms for the accreditation of teacher training programs and teacher certification
system, all of which have been institutionalized in the Education legislation and are
playing an important role in regulating the teaching profession. Despite this important
progress, designing a sustainable and effective in-service teacher training system still
remains a challenge. As stated earlier, although the Project supported outsourcing of
teacher trainings to private providers for two years, the public funding for this purpose
was discontinued by the MoES due to the initial perception of low quality of the training
programs. This decision resulted in discouragement of both high and low quality
providers and decline of the supply side, which in turn contributed to re-centralization of
teacher training with the MoES as the key provider.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

None

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
None

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

98.     The risk that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) would not be
maintained is rated as Moderate. The achievements of the APL 1 and 2 are encouraging,
with solid institutional development in the field of curriculum development, teachers’
qualification and certification, and national assessments and examinations. Furthermore,
the “National Education Strategy Development Paper? (2010-2015) shows the
Government’s commitment to building a strategic vision for education reforms in the
coming years, beyond the modernization agenda achieved so far. At the same time, the
next set of reforms is expected to be implemented in a volatile economic environment
given the unfolding Euro zone crisis. The National Education Strategy Paper stipulates
objectives but until the moment this ICR was written, it did not offer a concrete action
plan and financing framework. Without these elements, both the sequencing of priority
policy measures and the appropriate budget planning for the financing of the Strategy
will not be possible, especially if there are budget constraints arising from a global
financial crisis.

99.     Another risk relates to the lack of sustainability of the teacher training reform,
discussed above; a centralized system – as evolved for the moment - may not sustain the
results with the Outcome 1: teachers introducing more active pedagogical practices in
the classrooms. Finally, as noted earlier, some of the institutional capacity developed
under the Project, including the new institutions created in the sector, are still “young?
                                            23
and fragile, thus they will require continued support to satisfactorily deliver on their
mandate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

100. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry is rated as Moderately Satisfactory
for reasons elaborated below.

101. The Bank understood well the evolving political economy of the country, the
rapidly reforming Georgia’s institutions, and the country’s education needs. The Bank
worked closely with the MoES to identify key sector issues, define a strategy for best
addressing those issues, and design appropriate interventions. The Bank took into
consideration lessons learned from other Bank-supported projects in the South Caucasus,
from the implementation of education projects, as well as the work of other development
partners in the country. The planning and design of activities was particularly carefully
done and reflects the detailed discussions with the client at appraisal, good knowledge of
the country’s education issues, especially regarding the infrastructure challenges. The
Bank also took into consideration other donor operations in the sector, avoiding any
potential overlaps (UNICEF, UNDP, GIZ, USAID, Open Society Institute, etc.).

102. Nevertheless, an important shortcoming of the Project design relates to
insufficient policy advice and measures proposed to encourage the decline of
teacher/students’ ratio. As explained in Section 2.1 of this report, while project design
incorporated the demographic changes affecting the school-age population, it did not
offer a deeper analysis of the impact that such a phenomenon would have on class size in
isolated areas, where school consolidation is not an option. As such, it missed the
opportunity to discuss with the Government alternative strategies to overcome this
challenge, including the possibility of introducing a multi-grade teaching for under-
populated schools. Furthermore, project design did not provide enough analysis on the
reasons behind high teacher retention rates in the system, including the absence of a
mandatory retirement age for teachers, the low pensions, or the impact on teacher
numbers of the curriculum reforms and additional subjects.

(b) Quality of Supervision

103. Overall, the quality of supervision of this project earned a Satisfactory rating by
the ICR team due to reasons featured below.

104. The Project was monitored regularly during and between missions. The team
developed a strong relationship with the various agencies and was proactive in
anticipating and helping resolve issues that arose. The skills mix in the team was the
right one, allowing for fiduciary support to the Government, as well as technical expertise
advanced by experienced Bank education staff and consultants.


                                            24
105. The team prepared informative aide-memoires that provided guidance to the
Government on areas needing attention while keeping management informed of the
Project’s progress and challenges.

106. The Project benefited from the leadership of three experienced task team leaders
(TTLs) from preparation to closing, and the ICR team noted no important transition
issues. Each TTL contributed positively to the Project, from solid project design to an
excellent spirit of cooperation with the client, which ultimately resulted in the
achievement of the majority of development objectives. The FM and procurement team
participated in the supervision of fiduciary aspects of the Project, and provided on-the-
spot advice for emerging issues. The project benefitted from having staff located in
country office, who were supported the Government to ensure punctual responses to
Project challenges.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

107. Based on the “Harmonized Evaluation Criteria for ICR and OED Evaluations?
overall Bank performance for this Project is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. A fruitful
partnership with the Borrower led to smooth technical and institutional collaboration
during the preparation and implementation stages. A positive working climate was
fostered with the client, which contributed to achieving or exceeding most of the Project
objectives. However, as noted previously, issues in relation to rationalization of the use of
the teaching force and school buildings in a country with significant decreasing students’
number were not fully addressed in project design. Furthermore, the design did not
provide enough analysis on the reasons behind high teacher retention rates in the system,
and on the impact of the curriculum reforms in teacher numbers. Therefore, two out of
eight outcome indicators were not achieved.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

108. The Government’s performance during project preparation and implementation is
rated as Satisfactory. The Government showed ownership and commitment to project
objectives throughout implementation. More importantly, the Government adopted and
endorsed all needed policy instruments for the establishment of the educational agencies
and provided the necessary resources for their operation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

109. Overall, the MoES’s and all involved agencies implementation performance are
rated as Satisfactory for the following reasons:

      MoES’ level of commitment was high, notwithstanding changes in leadership and
       management, or events such as the August 2008 conflict. MoES showed strong
       will to reform its institutions and managed to establish or strengthen specialized
       agencies so as to ensure management effectiveness. Furthermore, a sector
       strategy was adopted. The only shortcoming noted relates to an underestimation
       of risks associated with frequent changes in newly established institutions and
                                             25
       policies (such as teacher training) which may pose a threat to sustainability of
       reforms in the sector.

      MDF showed very strong performance in conducting activities related to school
       constructions. Its technical expertise and experience significantly contributed to
       the success of the infrastructure investments. Their fiduciary performance was
       also strong, as shown by the unqualified audit reports and smooth procurement
       procedures. The progress reports were also accurate and prepared in a timely
       manner.

      NCAC and TPDC were also efficient Project implementing agencies. Their
       fiduciary performance, technical engagement and reporting were satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

110. The overall Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory. The Borrower was
actively involved in project participation, maintained a focus on the reform activities, and
provided active and productive political commitment towards the achievement of the
PDOs. The MoES and its agencies showed efficient performance in all aspects of Project
implementation. They gained considerable technical capacity, making sure a critical
mass of technical expertise remains in place to further education excellence in Georgia.

6. Lessons Learned

111. A strong governance agenda goes hand in hand with the modernization and
sector reforms. The Project was implemented during a period where reforms in public
finance, procurement and anti-corruption measures were ongoing, the majority of them
supported by World Bank financed operations. Such reforms indirectly supported project
implementation as they strengthened governance in the education sector.

112. Sustainability issues need to be anticipated and addressed carefully given the
fact that planned phase three of the Project will no longer be implemented. In this
Project, while the APL 1 and 2 achieved significant results and most Program objectives
were achieved, the Program agenda remains unfinished. Government had the intention to
address under an APL 3 the objectives of extending reforms nation-wide, consolidating
gains under the first two phases, and tackling external efficiency challenges. While the
ICR team remains optimistic that the Government will carry forward the reform agenda
on its own, there is always a concern that reform gains will not be secured in a
sustainable manner in the long-term. For example, the ICR team observed that the
relatively young institutions established to support the education modernization agenda
are still evolving, with continued challenges both in their coordination among themselves
and their interactions with the public.




                                            26
The changing mandates of these institutions also calls in question the sustainability both
of their capacities built during the first two phases of this APL, and of their activities in
support of the ongoing reforms. These new challenges to be addressed by the
Government should focus on sustaining progress made thus far and ensuring further
institutional development and consolidation of reforms. The Bank, too, can play a role as
part of its overall partnership strategy and analytical work in the sector, even without
ongoing operations.

113. From the technical perspective, the Adaptable Program Loans (APL) is a
good instrument to support longer-term reforms; from the political perspective they
often lack appeal. This APL was supposed to be the second of a three-phased program,
to be implemented over 10 years. Whereas at the time of design this seemed the optimal
instrument to support a long-term education reform and provide reassurance to the
Government of the Bank’s commitment to it, by the time the second phase was wrapping
up the Government was not interested in pursuing a third phase as it wanted to focus the
Bank’s support in other sectors.

114. Demographic trends are important considerations when designing education
projects. ECA countries are undergoing dramatic demographic transitions, affecting
especially the education sector. These events will have profound effects in the mid- to
long-term. The Georgian student population will shrink dramatically, and the same can
be observed from many other ECA countries (as highlighted in the recent World Bank
study Skills, Not Just Diplomas, launched in 2011). The strategic agenda for education,
including the use of human and financial resources, the choice of curriculum, the quality
assurance measures, the attention to both efficiency and relevance, among others, need to
be seen through a demographic lens.

115. Projects that support school rationalization need to have strong mitigation
measures built into its design. A follow-up lesson to the one above is that education
projects that seek to close down schools need to consider the difficulties of rationalizing a
school network and should built into projects appropriate mitigation measures to gain
support from stakeholders and also avoid hurting certain groups.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

Annex 2. Outputs by Component


The Project achieved the following outputs under its components:

Component 1: Improving the Pedagogical Environment (total actual cost US$ 5.23
million)

This component aimed to support changes in curriculum content, teaching methodology,
student assessment, initial teacher education and continued teacher professional
development, building on the institutional and policy framework supported by APL 1.
By Project completion, this component was considered Moderately Satisfactory as it had
achieved most of its outputs with modest shortcomings and albeit with some delays.

     Subcomponent 1A:         National Curriculum and Student Assessment System
     Development.

National Curriculum Implementation

The Project supported building institutional capacity of the National Curriculum and
Assessment Center (NCAC) through financing a wide spectrum of professional
development opportunities for the core staff of the Center and creating technical capacity
in key domains, such as curriculum reform and national assessments. NCAC was
established as a public legal entity under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and
Science in April 2006 by the MES Decree 357 with an institutional mandate to (i) design,
pilot and implement national curriculum; (ii) carry out national assessments of student
learning achievement; and (c) evaluate the compliance of textbooks with the national
curriculum requirements. The NCAC’s administrative management system was ISO
certified in 2007 to ensure continuous improvement of the Center’s procedures.

The curriculum reform process supported by the Project resulted in the staged piloting
and nation-wide implementation of the new curriculum in almost all grades (except for
grades six in Georgian schools and grades five and six in minority schools) of Georgia’s
general education institutions throughout 2006-2009. The curriculum implementation
process was coupled with the development of new textbooks, translation of the new
textbooks into minority languages (Russian, Armenian and Azeri) and training of
teachers and school principals. As part of the process, about 25,000 teachers and 2,000
school principals received training around the new curriculum concepts and
implementation strategies.

Further changes were introduced to the national curriculum architecture by the
Government in 2010. Namely, the following main changes were introduced: (a) the
content of study was enhanced by establishing a 60 percent core mandatory curriculum in
the body of current Humanities curricula while 80 percent of the same was determined in
the case of Sciences; (b) several new subjects were added to the Teaching Plan; (c) the
timetable of teaching sciences (each subject – Physics, Chemistry and Biology) was
amended at the secondary education level (grade 8 and above); (d) the division of the
school year changed from trimester to semester. Despite these changes, the general
curriculum framework, philosophy and underlying architecture remains the same as they
                                           29
were back in 2006. To support implementation of the modified curriculum, the NCAC
developed methodological guidelines for all subject groups in grades one to six (Georgian,
Mathematics, Natural Sciences, English Language, Music, Sport, Information and
Communication Technologies), inclusive education, teaching methodologies for age five
students, administrative guide and guide for improving the Physical Learning
Environment. The relevant teacher training modules were also designed. About 8,000
teachers and 500 school administrators and members of Education Resource Centers
were trained in the summer of 2011 for the implementation of the modified grade one to
six curriculum in the academic year 2011-2012.

The NCAC was also responsible for the evaluation and accreditation of school textbooks.
Throughout 2005-2007, the Center accredited 167 new textbooks for Georgian schools.
Further changes were made by the Government to textbook evaluation system throughout
2010/2011, namely: (a) publishing houses are requested to produce a series of textbooks
for grades one to six versus providing textbooks for one grade only; (b) the content of the
textbooks/series of textbooks are required to exceed 90 percent of determined barriers of
maximum sum points by the evaluation process; (c) in order to prevent abuse of prices,
the copyright of all textbooks is determined to be a joint venture between the Ministry
and Publishing Houses. In 2011, NCAC approved textbooks for grades 1 to 6.

National Assessments

A National Assessment framework has been put in place and adequate technical capacity
for conducting sample-based assessments has been developed within NCAC through the
support of experts from CITO and ETS. The Project supported development and
implementation of 4th and 9th grade national assessments of student academic
achievement in the selected subjects (Georgian Language and Literature and
Mathematics). The national assessment in Georgian Language and Literature of grade
nine students took place in June 2009 with 5,977 students participating from about 231
schools across Georgia. In June 2010, a national assessment in Mathematics for grade
nine students was also conducted. More than 6,000 students participated from 232
schools. Both assessment reports are publicly available through NCAC’s website. In
2010-2011, the 4th grade national assessments in the same subjects were also carried out
by NCAC and assessment reports finalized.

Supporting Materials

Throughout the Project, a wide-range of support materials were developed and distributed
to Georgia’s schools to enhance teaching and learning process.
Ten videos, “Student Centered Teaching,? were developed by the NCAC to demonstrate
effective examples of student focused teaching, active learning methodology, teacher
collaboration, assessment and skills needed for inclusive education. These short films
were made in Georgian schools to serve as an additional resource to support teachers. A
monthly bulletin, “Dialogi,? was published by NCAC in which teachers received
feedback on questions and issues they faced in every day work. The Center also
developed a web-based version of the bulletin. The magazine was provided to all schools
free of charge. Selected textbooks and professional literature around teaching profession
was translated from English into Georgian to support professional development of
teachers. A total of 67 books were translated.

     Subcomponent 1B: Professional Development of Teachers

Development of teacher standards including dissemination of teacher materials,
organizing workshops and conferences

The Teacher Professional Development Center (TPDC) was established as a public legal
entity in July, 2006 (MoES decree No. 714) with a mandate to develop professional
standards for teachers, to create teacher registration system, to design teacher certification
process, and to support continuous professional development of teachers in Georgia.

The Professional Standards as well as Subject Standards for teachers have been
successfully developed under the Project and adopted by the Ministry of Education and
Science in November, 2008 (Decree No. 1014). The standards are easily accessible
through the Center’s website at www.tpdc.ge. The standards were elaborated in close
consultation with teachers across the country, through meetings and workshops organized
by TPDC. The Center also developed Teachers’ Professional Code of Ethics in close
consultation with the NGOs and Consultative Board composed of education stakeholders.
In 2010, work was launched for further revisiting teacher standards in order to
accommodate changes introduced in the national curriculum framework. In parallel,
Georgian as a Second Language Standard, Special Needs Teacher Standard and
Vocational Teacher Standards were finalized. School Principal Standards were also
developed by TPDC with the Project and USAID support. The Center also prepared
Inductee Standards in 2011.

The development and dissemination of professional materials and resources for teachers
was also supported by the Project. Namely, TPDC developed a three-volume manual for
teachers including theories of development and learning, teaching and assessment and
professional and learning environment. In 2010, TPDC developed and distributed
methodological videos on six effective methods of teaching literacy. In 2011, TPDC
continued its work on literacy issues and developed the second volume of the
methodological video resource “Effective Methods of Reading,? which comprises of five
additional methods of teaching reading and comprehension. The Center also issued the
magazine “The Teacher? covering a wide-range of interesting topics, developments and
discussions around the teaching profession. A limited number of education digital
resources were also developed for different subject groups: Primary Education,
Mathematics, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Georgian Language and Literature and
Foreign Languages.

Development and implementation of teacher certification process

The new professional standards of teachers and national curriculum provided the basis for
the development of the teacher certification process. The Teacher Certification Charter
was adopted by decree No. 1101 of the Minister of Education and Science dated
December 4, 2009. The Charter defines the administrative procedures and rules for
conducting secondary school teacher certification. Amendments were made to the law on
Education to define types of teacher certificates to be issued to certified teachers. The
law mandates all teachers to be certified by the end of 2014. The first set of teacher
certification examinations in Professional Skills and selected subjects (Georgian
Language & Literature, Math and Foreign Languages) took place in July 13-23, 2010.
The examinations were administered by the National Examination Center in Tbilisi
Technical University and 12 other examination centers across the country. A total of 9,
906 teachers participated in the process in 2010, out of which 11 percent was certified. In
July, 2011, the number of teacher certification examinations was expanded to include
Biology, Geography, Physics, Chemistry, History and Civic Education. An additional
23,519 teachers took the examinations in 2011, out of which, 15.4 percent was certified.
Throughout 2010-2011, 6.4 percent of the total teaching cohort has been certified. The
detailed certification statistics are as follows:

The Teacher Professional Development Scheme was elaborated by the TPDC in 2011.
To be accepted into the scheme, teachers need to be certified through the National
Certification exams first. According to the scheme, three teacher categories are defined:
(a) Certified Teacher (these will need 21 credits and are automatically granted
                                           32
certification once passing both certification exams); (b) Teacher of First Category
(another 32 credits); (c) Teacher of Highest Category (another 42 credits). To reflect
provisions of the new Teacher Professional Development Scheme, an amendment was
made to the Law on General Education. According to the change, two options are
available for teacher certificate renewal: teachers can apply to the professional
development scheme and choose to accumulate professional development credits (by i.e.
participating in the conferences and workshops, contributing to textbook development,
acting as mentors, etc.) or take the certification exams every eight years.

Development of accreditation mechanisms for both Initial Teacher Education (ITE)
and Continued Professional Development (CPD) programs

TPDC developed accreditation guidelines and standards for the teacher continued
professional development programs. In 2009, 172 such programs were accredited by the
Ministry and provision of teacher in-service training was outsourced to private providers.
However, the quality of accredited programs was questioned. In 2010, the function of in-
service teacher training provision was placed in TPDC and the state teacher training
voucher program to fund training providers was discontinued.

The draft standards for the accreditation of initial teacher education programs were
developed by TPDC in close collaboration with the National Education Accreditation
Center (NEA), higher education institutions, TUNING program representatives and other
foreign experts. Amendments were made to the law on Education in 2009, according to
which a teacher pre-service training program was introduced in addition to the existing
teacher pre-service preparation academic programs, which includes B.A. and M.A.
programs. The new teacher training program duration is one-year and envisages 60
credits.

Establishment of a registration system for teachers, teacher-candidates, and training
programs

The Teacher Registration Management Information System was finalized by the TPDC in
2009 incorporating data on all existing teachers of general education institutions in
Georgia (currently 71,000). The database was used for teacher registration for
certification examinations.

Teacher Induction Pilot Program

The Law on General Education requires all new teachers to go through one year
induction period. New teachers are coupled with mentors, an experienced and qualified
teacher in the school to support their professional development and learning. With
Project’s support, the Teacher Induction pilot project was successfully carried out for two
subsequent academic years, 2008-2009 and 2009-2010. TPDC has provided training for
mentor teachers and inductees, as well as conducted surveys to improve project
implementation. In July 2009, the center hosted European Seminar “Mentor Teachers –
Innovative Approaches? in the framework of “Pestalotzi Program? with the support of the
European Council. Ten Georgian and ten foreign mentors, inductees, education experts
and teachers participated in the event. The seminar aimed to discuss ways to further
develop an effective induction system for new teachers in Georgia. As part of the pilot, a
                                            33
draft inductee manual and a mentor’s manual were developed. According to TPDC’s
monitoring data, 90 percent of mentors and 98 percent of novice teachers evaluated the
implementation of the program as successful.

Since 2010-2011 the Teacher Induction pilot has been reformed as a state program which
comprised 84 mentors and 210 inductees and was implemented in 10 major cities. The
state program has been gradually expanding. In 2011-2012 academic year 180 mentors
and 496 inductee teachers are involved in the program.

Teacher Voucher Program

In parallel with the state teacher training voucher program implemented in 2009-2010,
the Project supported teacher professional development vouchers in two areas: (1)
Literacy in Primary Grades and (2) Georgian as a Second Language (GSL). Each
voucher covered three credits for the literacy program and six credits for GSL program
(one credit amounts to 15 contact hours and has a fixed cost of 50 GEL). The eligible
training providers were determined based on the competition for programs in literacy and
Georgian as a Second Language. By the end of December, 2010, 2,163 teachers had used
the special voucher to finance their chosen training program in Literacy for primary
grades. Around 440 teachers of primary grades were trained in 2011. A total of 239
vouchers were given for the GSL program.

Teach for Georgia Pilot Program

Teach for Georgia was designed by TPDC to support schools in remote areas in attracting
and retaining qualified teachers in those subject areas for which they had shortage. Teach
for Georgia was launched in March 2009 with the Project’s support. As part of the
program, 43 teachers were recruited competitively and sent to public schools in Kvemo
Kartli, Kakheti, Dusheti, Samtskhe Javakheti, Adjara, Racha, Lechkumi and Svaneti.
According to the monitoring report (2009) for “Teach for Georgia,? 79 percent of school
principals and teachers, 83 percent of students, 77 percent of parents, and 64 percent of
the recruited teachers, have evaluated the program positively. The program was
successfully taken over by the Government and continued in 2010 with the state budget
support.

Teacher Vacancy Web-page

A teacher vacancy web-site (www.pedagogi.ge ) was designed as part of the Project to
post regular information on the existing teacher vacancies across the country and support
easy access to such information for the teachers.
Teacher Trainings

In line with the policy shifts described above, an important focus of TPDC’s work has
become the provision of teacher training. Country-wide training in professional skills
and core disciplines were carried out in March-May, 2010. A total of 3,591 teachers have
been trained in professional skills and about 2,000 teachers in various disciplines this
year. The trainings were also provided to about 14, 079 teachers in Information and
Communication Technologies.

                                           34
Component 2: Improving the Physical Learning Environment (total cost US$ 13.95
million)

This component aimed to improve the physical learning environment in about seven
schools in emergency conditions to complement the investments on improving the quality
of the pedagogical learning environment. By Project completion, this component was
considered Satisfactory as it had fully achieved its outputs.

The Project supported the construction of seven new schools in Georgia in parallel with
the state program financing the construction of the 31 new schools in emergency
conditions. The component was implemented by the Municipal Development Fund
(MDF) under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and Science. All seven
schools supported by the Project are fully functional and serves a total of about 3,066
students. The furniture and equipment for the schools as well as access to utilities was
provided by the Government in a timely manner. The new schools have modern
classrooms tailored for interactive teaching and learning, libraries, well equipped gyms
and recreation zones for meetings, group work and discussions, access for children and
adults with disabilities, and other provisions to ensure inclusive education. The detailed
list of project supported schools is as follows:

The Project also supported elaboration of the manual “Improving Schools’ Physical
Learning Environment? to support the development of new approach to maintenance
policy, planning and management in schools. The manual was published by the Ministry
of Education and Science in May 2008 and distributed to all schools. The Project
financed training in school maintenance policy for all Education Resource Centers, which
eventually trained schools under their jurisdiction. In 2010, the Project also supported
development of HR management manual for schools and the manual for School
Sanitation Maintenance. Training modules were prepared on the basis of these
documents. About 500 school principals were trained in August, 2011.

Component 3: Project Management (total cost US$ 2.58 million)

This component was designed to provide institutional support to the Ministry of
Education and Science, the Project Coordination Unit, the Municipal Development Fund,
the National Curriculum and Assessment Center and the Teacher Professional

Development Center. By Project completion, the achievements of this component were
considered Moderately Satisfactory.

The Ministry of Education and Science was responsible for overseeing the project
implementation. The project was implemented by the three autonomous institutions,
namely, the component one was implemented by the Teacher Professional Development
Center and the National Curriculum and Assessment Center. The component two of the
project was carried out by the Municipal Development Fund.

2.     To support reform initiatives the World Bank and the Government of Georgia
have signed the agreement to allocate long-term credit for Education System
Realignment and Strengthening Program. The first phase of the Adaptable Program Loan
(APL#1) was launched in 2001 and its broad goals were to improve the quality and
relevance of general secondary students learning outcomes to better prepare them to meet
the demands of the market economy and the democratic society. The first phase of the
Program was planned to support 1) the development of the policy and institutional
framework required for an effective realignment of the system objectives, and 2)
development of capacity to meet those new objectives and manage physical, financial and
human resources more equitably, efficiently and effectively.

3.       The APL #1 supported the Government’s aim to introduce a broad agenda for
change and to address structural, quality and financing reforms which have been
institutionalized into new legislation. These efforts comprise development of a new
national curriculum framework as well as subject curricula for grades 1 to 12.

4.     The Development Objective of APL #2 was to enhance the policy elaborated
within APL#1, increase the quality and efficiency of primary and secondary education in
Georgia through the implementation of the institutional and policy framework developed
under APL #1, as well as the reconstruction of schools in dire physical conditions.

7.      The project was designed to be implemented in three phases. The first phase of
the program, now complete, began to develop the policy and institutional framework
required for an effective realignment of the system, develop its capacity to meet those
new objectives and manage its physical, financial and human resources equitably,
efficiently and effectively.

APL #2 included three main components:

8.      Improving the Pedagogical Environment (total cost US$ 7.20 million). The
objective of this component is to support changes in curriculum content, teaching
methodology, student assessment, initial teacher education and continued teacher
professional development, building on the institutional and policy frameworks supported
by APL #l.

9.      The component comprised of two subcomponents: Subcomponent 1A: National
Curriculum and Student Assessment System Development (total cost US$ 3,850 million)
– subcomponent coordinated by the National Curriculum and Assessment Center
(NCAC) and Subcomponent 1B: Professional Development of Teachers (total cost
US$ 1.1 million) implemented by the National Center of Teacher Professional
Development (TPDC). The objective of this subcomponent was to improve teacher
qualifications through the establishment and implementation of a teacher professional
development system by TPDC, founded in August 2006. This subcomponent was aimed
to develop the capacity of the TPDC in terms of the managerial and technical capacity of
the staff; develop standards for teachers including the dissemination of materials, and
organizing of workshops and conferences; develop and conduct certification for both the
existing and the future teaching force; develop accreditation mechanisms for both ITE
and CPD programs; and establish a registration system for teachers, teacher-candidates,
and training programs. For these purposes, the project (including financing from the
Government, Credit and Grant) financed technical assistance; training; publication and
dissemination of materials; a limited amount of goods and works; and the operations of
the TPDC. The Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia (MES) was responsible for
the policy decisions and overall monitoring and evaluation of the TPDC; and the TPDC
was responsible for the implementation of the TPDC program.

10.    Improving the Physical Learning Environment (total cost US$ 13.95 million) was
aimed at improving physical learning environment in about eight schools in emergency
conditions to complement investments on improving quality of the pedagogical learning
environment. The component was implemented by the Municipal Development Fund
(MDF) and coordinated by MES.

11.     Project Management (total cost of US$ 2.58 million). The objective of the
component was to provide institutional support to MES, PCU, MDF, NCAC and TPDC
related to the operations, audits, project monitoring and evaluation.




                                          43
Component 1: Improving the Pedagogical Environment

Subcomponent 1A: National Curriculum and Student Assessment System Development

12.    The component carried out piloting and implementation of the new curriculum
designed as part of phase one of the project in all grades (except for grade six) across the
country including in minority schools.

13.     The project was launched in 2007: one of the key activities of the project was
piloting and implementation of the National Curriculum gradually in all grades across the
country including minority schools. For 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 academic years
National Curriculum was implemented in all grades except 6. The minority schools were
one year behind in implementing the curriculum, because of the need for the translation
of the textbooks into their languages –Russian, Armenian and Azerbaijan.

14.    Since 2007 for successful implementation of National Curriculum NCAC
conducted curriculum-based trainings for teachers and school principles. At the end of
2009 about more than 90% of schools was teaching with new curriculum except 6th
grade of Georgian schools and except 5th and 6th grades of minority schools.

15.     About more than 60% of teachers received trainings in a new system of formative
assessment of student; more than 60% of newly elected principals were trained
throughout of Georgia. The purpose of the trainings was popularization of the National
Curriculum among the society and professional development of the newly elected
directors. Totally, approximately 25 000 teachers were involved in training-courses.

16.    The national curriculum for 2011-2016 was further amended at the end of 2009
and during 2010 on the basis of full revision of original version and will be introduced in
primary grades (1 to 6) for 2011-2016 academic year. It has been modified with the goal
of reaching further enhanced, modernized and output oriented education system. New
national curriculum with the possibilities for sustainable system and strategic
development will ensure flexibility of educational process, relevance to modern
challenges and acquiring high-quality education.

17.     About 150 experts participated in revision of the National Curriculum:
representatives of various academic circles, higher education institutions and public
school teachers and psychologists along with NCAC experts.

18.    Each subject program was discussed by the Methodic Council. Each subject
program was reviewed before approval. Following changes were made In New National
Curriculum - 2011-2016:

          Structure of the document was changed and was brought in compliance with
           the structure of normative document. It includes five parts, each of which
           includes chapters, articles, paragraphs and subparagraphs;
          All subject programs, outcomes and indicators were revised;



                                            44
         Mandatory topics were defined in the content of subject curricula that
          represent 60%-80% of the content depending on the subject specifics,
          identifying mandatory topics to support stability of the educational process;
         Due to the school entrance age reduced to 5 years, some changes were made

          curriculum defined specific issues regarding functioning of schools with
          different status;
         Academic assessment system was modified in the following ways:
          - Students’ academic success is assessed according to five levels instead of
              four;
          - Grade completion minimum was established;
          - Assessment regulations in case of student absences with different reasons
              were improved.
         Curriculum was developed for Abkhazian Language and Literature;
         New mandatory subjects were introduced: Information and Communication
          Technologies in I, V and VI grades; English language (the first foreign
          language from the I grade); Civil Protection and Security/life-skills (one
          semester modules for IV, VIII and XII grades).
         National curriculum includes a plan for introducing new subjects that were
          piloted in 2010-2011 (“World culture?, “Georgian dance? and other).
         Changes was made to organizing teaching of natural sciences:
          - In 7th grade, before students start studying separate natural science
              subjects as independent disciplines, a special subject “Fundamentals of
              natural sciences? are taught.
          - All three natural science subjects (biology, physics and chemistry) will be
              taught concurrently from 8th grade for 4 years (will be implemented from
              2012-2013 academic year);
          - The main component – research – was defined in natural sciences.
         Organization system for elective subject was changed: instead of choosing
          subject from XI and XII grades, students can choose elective subjects from X
          grade. New National Curriculum offers about 40 elective subjects. The
          number of elective courses has been increased with the goal to respond
          adequately to diverse interests and requirements of individual students. By
          personally selecting desired subjects, students will be given an opportunity to
          develop a clearer vision of his/her interests and future profession.

19.   New National Curriculum will be translated into Russian, Armenian and

textbook approval have also been identified: the size of textbooks, quality of paper, and
size of script. Textbook/series of textbook should get over 90% (content) of determined
barriers of maximum sum points in order to ensure high quality of textbooks.

30.     In 2011 NCAC will announce new textbook competition for mandatory and
elective subjects on basic and secondary stages. This process will be finished in 2012.

31.     National Assessment: NCAC elaborated the system of National Assessment. It
means the elaboration of the framework and instrument of the assessment, establishment
of the assessment group within the NCAC. For this purpose, the NCAC collaborated with
the Dutch organization CITO (International - Institute for Educational Measurement) for
several years and with USA based organization “ETS Global Institute.?

32.    National Assessment is a wide scale research with a goal to assess the quality of
general education in the country, predict components of educational process based on
data and plan activities aimed at improvement of educational process considering the
problems revealed by research.

33.    As a diagnostic research, national assessment is based on national curriculum,
while the latter is based on general education national goals.

34.     Study outcomes have a crucial importance for improving national curriculum,
assessing student progress in the country, developing recommendations for teachers,
students, school principals and textbook authors. Research outcomes provide a scientific
basis for planning general education policy.

35.      On June 4, 2009 NCAC conducted National Assessment in Georgian Language
and Literature in IX grade; In total 5 977 9th graders of 231 schools from 12 regions (64
district) of Georgia participated in the national assessment of Georgian language. The
final report was prepared where the quantitative and qualitative analyses are presented as
well as the recommendations for all stakeholders. In April 2010, NCAC made
presentation about the assessment outcomes for teachers and experts who participated in
test creation and data analysis process at different stages. Presentation was held in Tbilisi,
Telavi, Kutaisi and Batumi for teachers and academia, professors, school teachers and
education experts. Totally, more than 300 teachers and experts attended.

36.    In 2010 National Assessment in Mathematics in IX grade was conducted. About
6000 students from 232 schools of Georgia participated in the assessment. NCAC held
presentations about the assessment outcomes in Telavi, Zugdidi and Batumi for teachers
and education experts. The aim of such meetings is not only to introduce assessment
outcomes, but to listen to teachers' opinions, notes, that will be duly reflected in National
                                             47
Curriculum. In 2011 NCAC conducted National Assessment in Mathematics and
Georgian in IV grade. Data is processed currently.

37.     Schools Physical Environment Maintenance Policy Training: The main goal of
the Component is the improvement of the physical learning environment of Public
Schools in Georgia.
38.     In 2007 School Physical Environment Maintenance Manual was elaborated and
published. All resource centers were trained according to the manual. After this, they
delivered the similar trainings to school principals of their districts.

39.    In 2010 the following draft manuals were elaborated under the project:
            HR management
            Manual for School Sanitation Maintenance

40.     At the end of the second phase, on the basis of elaborated document, school
maintenance manual was edited and adopted to the needs of Georgian public schools,
training modules were prepared. About 500 Directors/Representatives of schools of
Georgia were trained according to them in August, 2011.

41.     Project for the translation of professional literature for teachers: NCAC
translated professional literature from English into Georgian aimed at Teacher
development. It covers different topics and directions such as: teaching strategies,
performance assessment, classroom management strategies, discipline in the classroom,
second language acquisition and other topics. In total 67 books were translated.

Subcomponent 1B: Professional Development of Teachers

42.     Within the scope of the APL #2 project Subcomponent 1B., Professional
Development of Teachers TPDC has planned and implemented the myriads of activities
and initiatives to enhance the professional development of teachers.

43.     Teacher certification and Teacher Professional Development Financial Support
Program: Teacher certification is a tool for the state to recognize teachers’ qualification
and support teachers’ professional development. According to APL#2 End-of-program
indicators, it was initially planned to have 5% of teachers certified countrywide in 2008,
while 20% were supposed to be certified by 2009. The implementation of the certification
process was not launched until 2010 due to a range of substantial reasons. One of the
main arguments for the postponement was lack of state-assisted Teacher Professional
Development Programs. Therefore, the MES aimed to form strong system for short-term
and long-term TPD programs. Consequently, implementation of the teacher professional
development (TPD) voucher financing program started in 2009. This program gave an
opportunity to teachers to self-assess their background, select teacher professional
development accredited program(s) in accordance to their needs and interests and attend
the courses in the total amount of 4 credits free of charge. Two credits from the total of
four were meant for trainings in a respective subject area, while the other two credits
were for financing the professional skills development programs. Depending on the
professional needs, teachers were allowed to use all four credits for getting the training
only in subject area or professional skills development. Teacher Professional
Development Center entered into an agreement with 19 implementing service providers
                                             48
with their accredited TPD programs. All of these service providers offer 138 training
modules in total. At the planning stage, one of the serious concerns was the inclusion of
all regions of Georgia by teacher professional development programs, especially the
mountainous regions of Georgia. Several meetings had been arranged with the service
providers to determine their outreach before signing the agreement. Identification of the
outreach capacity allowed a wider distribution of TPD programs. Consequently, trainings
had been organized in all regions of Georgia. By the end of the year 2010 more than 20
000 teachers have participated in the professional development programs.

44.     In 2011, based on the results of the monitoring of the quality of trainings carried
out by the private provider companies, it was decided to pause the voucher financing
program. Due to formation of a new administrative structure within TPDC, department of
Certification and Teacher trainings, teacher professional development training programs
have been in-sourced within TPDC. Department was assigned to conduct not only
subject-based trainings in Math, Georgian Language and Literature, Physics, Chemistry,
Biology, Geography, History, Russian, English, but also in trainings for primary grades
teachers and programs for Professional development skills.

45.     In addition to the TPD training programs, MES has devoted much attention to the
improvement of the legislative base for the certification process, as it was expected that
certification regulations reflect the Georgian realities and the goals and procedures set
under the regulations are achievable by the majority of teachers.

46.      In 2009 the Center made significant steps towards the development of the
certification regulations. Draft version of the certification statute had been developed
after a number of certification models had been reviewed and analyzed, as well as based
on the consultations of foreign experts and research findings. It was also essential that
the educational specialists were actively involved in the process of refining the statute.
For that purpose, the workshops were organized with the representatives of the National
Curriculum and Assessment Center as well as National Examinations Center. In addition
to that, field visits had been organized to all regions of Georgia.

47.     Teacher certification statute had been approved on December 4, 2009. The statute
stipulates the rules and procedures for acquiring and renewing teacher certificates. The
first certification exams were carried out in July, 2010. More than 23,000 teachers had
registered for the second teacher certification exams in summer 2011. The certification
system is fully functional and certification process will be continued in the years to come.
According to Georgian legislation, all teachers should be certified by 2014.

48.    In addition to the certification process, the National Center for Teacher
Professional Development (TPDC) has elaborated Teacher Professional Development
Framework, which is aimed to facilitate formation of the system for teacher career
growth. The teacher professional development scheme was finalized in 2011.
Simultaneously, TPDC has launched school principal certification process in 2011.

49.    Teacher Standards: Teacher professional standard in Georgia was first developed
and introduced in 2008. This document represents the set of professional knowledge,
pedagogical skills and responsibilities, which shall be met by all teachers. In 2009
Teachers Professional Standard was translated in Russian, Armenian and Azerbaijani
                                          49
languages and distributed to respective schools, Educational Resource Centers and other
interested stakeholders. In 2010 the school principal standard has been completed and in
May, 2011 the final version of teacher induction standard has been worked out.

50.      Initial Teacher Education Programs: According to the amendments to the Law on
Higher Education (2009) new Initial Teacher Training Program had been introduced
aside of Bachelor and Master academic teacher education programs. According to the law
“Initial Teacher Training Program offers 60 credits and is delivered for no less than one
academic year?.

51.     Teacher Professional Development Center developed the standard for the Initial
Teacher Training Programs, which will be used as a guide both for setting up respective
programs and their accreditation. The standard will clearly define the main criteria for
assessing quality of such programs as well as the targets that have to necessarily be
satisfied in order to obtain the accreditation. For this purpose, TPDC collaborated with
the National Accreditation Center, target universities, the TUNING program specialists
and the international expert. In addition, special trainings and consultations will be held
for target universities and accreditation experts. It was estimated that for 2011-12
academic year several universities would offer accredited programs to students interested
in entering a teaching profession.

52.     Novice Teacher Induction: According to the law on General Education, after
receiving a relevant academic qualification, a teacher shall go through an induction
period and pass a teacher certification exam to ensure that his/her knowledge and skills
are compatible with the teachers’ professional standard. Under the Georgian law on
General Education, an inductee is a person, who teaches temporarily at a comprehensive
school in order to acquire a teacher’s status. Teacher’s professional success very much
relies on the experience gained in the first years of work at school. In addition, during the
first years of teaching, a teacher faces a widest range of challenges. That is why it is
important that the new, young teachers get the help of experienced, highly qualified
teachers, mentors. A mentor is a qualified and experienced teacher, who expresses
readiness to assist an inductee in developing pedagogical skills, demonstrating abilities
and obtaining positive experience. Apart from that, an induction program helps the
teachers to professionally connect with their peers.

53.     In 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 academic years, through TPDC initiative, two-year
pilot project of teacher probation was implemented. The goals of the project are:

          to regulate the process of entering teacher’s profession, as well as establish
           and develop legislative and institutional base for the probation system;
          to support inductee/beginner teacher’s professional development and
           employment;
          to popularize teaching profession;
          to utilize authority, knowledge and skills of experienced teachers.

54.     Within the pilot teacher probation project, 100 inductees and 58 mentors were
selected through a competition in 36 different districts in Georgia, including 2 public
schools in the rural areas. The first stage of the project was implemented in 2008-2009.

                                             50
28 mentors (from 24 Tbilisi and regional schools) and 48 inductees participated in it. In
order to improve the efficiency of the project, mentors and the inductees were trained,
school visits and participant opinion polls.
55.    Due to successful implementation of a pilot program, the novice teachers'
induction program has been approved as a state program in 2010. Currently 142 mentors
and 212 inductees in 6 regions of the country are involved in the program.

56.    Teacher Training in Information and Communication Technologies: To ensure a
learning environment that is compatible with modern standards and requirements, it is
necessary to deliver training programs for teachers in modern technologies. The main
goal of the trainings is to equip the teachers with practical skills on how to integrate the
ICT in everyday teaching. The goals of the program are:

          to improve teacher qualification through trainings in Information and
           Communication technologies;
          to improve the learning environment through creation and application of
           Georgian educational and electronic resources.

57.     To achieve these goals, the following trainings had been developed and
organized: Basic training in information and communication technologies as well as the
second level trainings: “Integrating Information and Communication Technologies in the
teaching process? and Schools trainings in information management system. Since 2009,
a total of 5126 teachers attended trainings for the basic level, whereas 6657 teachers
attended second level trainings. By the end of 2011 it is planned to have a total of 7422
teachers trained on basic level and 14300 teachers – on the second level.

58.     Teacher Registration Management Information System: According to the
Georgian Law on “General Education?, in 2008-2009 the Teacher Professional
Development Center developed and introduced web technology based Teacher
Registration Management Information System, which records information about
registered teachers’ personal identification, qualification, professional development,
among other topics.

59.    Successful implementation of the state programs in terms of teacher insurance,
improvement of social status or qualifications, teacher certification system and other
relevant factors requires accurate and updated information about the teachers currently
employed at schools or qualified specialists who are willing to become teachers.

60.     Teacher registration management information system is one of the unprecedented
projects. It allows all Education Resource Centers (ERC), public schools and registered
teachers to enter search or update data in the system via internet. Entering certain part of
information will be the responsibility of the schools, while the information about a
teacher’s certification will be provided by the National Examination Center; Data on
teacher’s professional development will be contributed by the accredited programs, who
issue certificates. Each educator will have an opportunity to check personal data and
make updates and additions as needed using the school computer lab or the Education
Resource Center. Therefore, the system will offer teachers simple and convenient form of
registration for the certification exams.
                                             51
61.     The system can automatically generate registered teachers’ resumes, which then
can be printed. The system also includes several forms of analytical reports, which allows
users to see statistical or analytical information from different viewpoints, e.g., number
and distribution of teachers according to different categories (region, district, age, sex,
subject and etc); the system can generate report sorting the teachers by the accredited
training courses they have attended.

62.    The registration system will help the Teacher Professional Development Center to
determine the number of teachers entering the profession, identify what are the
challenges that teachers are facing in different regions of the country and plan the
interventions accordingly.

63.     Inclusive Education at Teacher Professional Development Center: The Center
started to work on the Inclusive Education issues in July 2009. The need for initiating this
direction was based on the fact that for the last several years, the process of introducing
inclusive education is being actively promoted in Georgia and children with special needs
are enrolled in regular comprehensive schools. Unfortunately, the number of schools that
are equipped with such facilities and human resources that are indispensible for
supporting the special needs of children is very limited. Boarding schools in Georgia are
facing a lot of challenges, which is reflected in both the quality of life of children with
special needs and their education.

64.     The main goal of this direction is to support/promote establishment of inclusive
education in Georgia. Specifically (1) developing the standards for Special Education
Teachers; (2) supporting the increase in knowledge and skills of teachers at public
schools about inclusive education; (3) supporting the establishment of public schools
specializing in the special needs education.

65.     Teach for Georgia: Many schools in the rural and mountainous regions of
Georgia are in a difficult situation in which they are unable to find and maintain qualified
staff. Current statistical data verify that 14% of the teachers have not received higher
education. Therefore, in many cases, pedagogues who are not specialists of the subject
they teach, conduct the educational process. In some remote regions, schools even cannot
find teachers for certain subject areas. Positions posted on the web portal created by the
Teachers Professional Development Center for teachers’ vacancy announcements
(www.pedagogi.ge) are unfilled for months; this also attest the challenges in teacher
recruitment.

66.      Existing situation leads to the decline of the quality of learning. The situation is
especially challenging in the mountainous regions. According to the survey about the
necessary and expected number of teachers, the biggest deficit in teacher numbers were
shown in the districts of Mestia, Kazbegi, Dusheti, Tsalka, Dmanisi, Tetritskaro, Khulo
and Shuakhevi, Akhalkalaki, Borjomi, Oni, Dedoflistskaro. Number of teachers in these
districts is currently 30-60% lower than needed.

67.     The main goal of the project is to attract and maintain qualified staff in the
schools with staffing challenges; this should eventually lead to the improvement of
quality in teaching and learning. Apart from that, the project also supports popularization
of the teaching profession; incentivizing qualified specialists to engage in teaching
                                            52
profession and involvement of energetic and motivated young professionals in learning
process. Currently, 66 consultant-teachers, who attended intensive trainings in
pedagogical skills and ICT are involved in the program.

68.     Providing Supplementary Resources for Teachers: The main goal for this
direction is to create, translate, prepare and distribute educational books and other
supplementary resources to teachers which will help them to effectively run the learning
process. The first step made in this direction was the development of supplementary
three-volume manual for teachers which are: 1. theories of development and learning; 2.
Teaching and assessment; 3. Professional and learning environment). This manual is
based on the Teacher Professional Standard and contains issues, which are combined in
teacher professional standard and are relatively new for teachers.

69.    In compliance with the requirements set in the Teacher Professional Standard, the
Center continued to develop additional resources for teachers after publishing the above
book. In 2009 several textbooks written by the international educational organizations
were translated and distributed to schools there. All of the manuals are based on the
findings of international research and analysis of teacher's professional experience.

70.    In 2010, TPDC has developed, produced and distributed the first ever methodical
videos on 6 effective methods of reading.

71.    In addition to professional manuals and textbooks, TPDC publishes a Teacher
Magazine-a professional magazine which provides teachers with the practical
information on modern methods of teaching and ways to apply them in the classroom,
reforms and news in the education sector and etc. The magazine is distributed free of
charge to all schools and educational resource centers and in 2011 its subscribers reached
as much as 13,000.

III.   Achievement of Project Objectives and Rating of Key Performance
       Indicators

72.    The final objective of the project was to effectively realign the system objectives
and the policy and management capacity to improve the quality and relevance of learning
outcomes and better prepare students to meet the demands of a market economy and
democratic society. The end-of-program Indicator were the following:

b)      National Center of Teacher Professional Development (TPDC) aims not only to
maintain operation of ongoing programs and retain achieved goals, but also has a strong
capacity to strengthen existing statute and plans to expand scope of its activities. MES in
coordination with TPDC plans to create network of so called Teacher's Houses. With a
goal of further supporting teacher professional development, Teacher’s Houses will be
opened in Tbilisi and in about 4 more cities of Georgia. From 2011 Educators, teachers
and school principals will meet one another at the Teacher’s House and exchange
information related to the learning process. There teachers will be able to receive advice
on professional development, plan their career, improve skills and knowledge in
particular subject. The Teacher’s House will host conferences and workshops, meetings
                                             55
with Georgian and foreign experts and open lesson. At the same time, teachers will have
a possibility of sharing experience with his/her colleagues, mastering the latest
technologies used in the learning process and modern methods of teaching.

Functions of the Teacher’s House are as follows:
         Providing consultations to the teachers and school principals on issues
            related to professional development;
         Cooperation with universities;
         Announcement and financing various competitions
         Training of provider companies

principals themselves.

Component 2: Improving the Physical Learning Environment

Objectives and components

73.     The Municipal Development Fund of Georgia was implementing the second
component of the project that envisages improvement of Physical Learning Environment.
The second component of the project envisaged construction of the new 7 schools. Under
the credit agreement for construction of schools were allocated USD 14 mln and for
operational costs – USD 850 thousand. After the conducted biddings the contract price
for construction of schools has amounted to GEL 29.3 mln. Taking into consideration the
deficit of funds, formed at the time of completion of the schools’ construction, during the
Supervisory Mission of the World Bank has been decided that the Ministry of Education
and Science of Georgia (MES) contributed GEL 10 mln (originally envisaged was 10 mln,
                                            56
out of which 5.8 was disbursed). During the life of the project all audit reports were clean
in all material aspects.

74.    MES conducted survey of the 80 schools in emergency condition, in need of full
reconstruction and with more than 300 pupils with at least one school nearby, which can
be merged with new school. Following seven schools were identified and their
construction is completed:

1. Vilage Dighomi Public School (Tbilisi ) (students #1080)
2. Village Vaziani Public School (Gardabani) (students #360)
3. Village Chkhari Public School (Terjola) (students #600)
4. Village Jugaani Public School (Sighnaghi) (students #400)
5. #3 Public School of Borjomi (Borjomi) (students #720)
6. Village Tadzrisi Public School (Borjomi) (students #400)
7. Village Gavazi Public School (Kvareli) (students #600)

75.      The proper information may be seen on the following internet site of the MDFG:
(www.mdf.org.ge). All bid announcements have been transparently placed in the online
versions of UNDB and “dgMarket? as well as on the MDFG said web page and in a local
newspaper ("24 Saati" /24 Hours/). The project was under the increased public awareness
(PR programs including inaugurations, press releases, interviews with mass media, site
visits, etc.). All projects opening ceremonies were been attended by the President of
Georgia and the government, who very highly evaluated the completed new school
facilities (infrastructure component).

76.      In the project areas, the main outcome has been reached and there are no children
studying in school buildings that are determined to be in structurally unsafe or in
educationally inappropriate buildings. More than 500 persons were employed in the
implementation and construction process. It should be mentioned that local economic
activities were increased and developed. The Ministry of Education and Science, with
the support of the Education Infrastructure Agency, was able to address many of the
utility concerns in the new schools and actions in resolving with respect to access to
water in several schools.

IV.    Bank and Borrower performance

      Bank: IDA’s supervision missions visited Georgia regularly (quarterly or twice a
       year) to assess progress in the implementation of the project and the supervision
       team acted always diligently to smooth out implementation problems and timely
       presenting the supervision reports. Based on the above, the Bank’s performance is
       rated as highly satisfactory.
      Borrower: The Borrower was actively engaged in project preparation and
       contributed to shape the physical component of the project. The government was
       always open to discussions with IDA on various issues. No delays with co-
       financing have been occurred from Borrower’s side. Based on the above, the
       Borrower’s performance is rated as highly satisfactory.


                                            57
      Implementing Agency: The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) and the staff were
       following the agreed procedures, project implementation plan, and supervision
       missions’ recommendations. Based on the above, the Fund’s performance is rated
       as highly satisfactory.

IV. Lessons Learned

77.     The design and implementation of the project offers following considerations that
might be useful in shaping future projects of this nature. The experience under the
project, including the findings of World Bank supervision missions, etc. are valuable and
received positive evaluation and is regarded as a successful project. Sustainable project
development requires engagement by community members as well as by local
governments (participation), the services provided by external agencies have to be
relevant, the output has to be satisfactory, and adequate operations and maintenance
arrangements need to be in place. Community participation requires intensive interaction
between the PIU, the participating community and the local authority before, during and
for some time after project implementation. Nevertheless below are presented some
lessons learned during the project implementation:

      The MDF acquired relevant experience and expertise for managing a large-scale
       infrastructure program and now is responsible for implemented bigger projects
       funded by the WB and also other donors.

      The contractors would need to follow strictly the agreed contract obligations (as
       described, in several cases the contracts with the contractors were cancelled, the
       agreed implementation plan was not followed, etc. and a new contractor had to be
       hired for completing the project implementation) and the beneficiaries and
       municipal governments would need to understand the importance of rigorous
       operation and maintenance of project facilities after hand-over.
