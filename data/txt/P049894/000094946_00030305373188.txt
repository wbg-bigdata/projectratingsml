A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective: (see Annex 1)
To test and demonstrate a model of health care delivery based on primary care and per capita resource
allocation as a means of improving service delivery and the quality of care in the Republic of Tajikistan.
2. Key performance indicators: (see Annex 1)
The key performance indicators reflect whether this project improves access to, and use of, high
quality primary health care services in those areas covered by the project (the pilot raions). Specific
performance indicators and targets are as follows:
Indicator                                        Target Value
at end of Project
Percent of the general population in the Pilot Regions with access
to improved quality primary care services by end of Project                90%
Percent of the general population in the Pilot Regions reporting
preventive visits with family health professionals by end of Project       60%
Percent of physicians and primary care nurses using acceptable
primary care approaches and practice guidelines in the Pilot               75%
Regions by end of Project
Percent of total funding within Pilot Regions spent on primary care
services by end of Project                                                 45%
Ratio of per capita funding between highest and lowest funded
regions to be reached by end of Project                                    1.5: 1
Within the context of this project, "primary care services" refers to prevention, health promotion,
family planning, and curative health services provided in medical houses and family medical centers (SVAs).
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project: (see Annex I)
Document number: 1 8075-TJ                   Date of latest CAS discussion: 07/30/98
This project supports the following CAS goals:
(a)    Enhancing critical social services--the CAS includes provision for IDA-supported investments in the
health sector, initially through learning and innovation projects. The focus of the Health Project
would be the rehabilitation and strengthening of primary care.
(b)    Assisting the most vulnerable--while health care is not specifically mentioned in this area of the CAS
strategy, the proposed structure of the Health Project, with its emphasis on primary health care at the
rural community level, should provide improved health services to the poor. In addition, the proposed
household survey will provide important planning information that can be used by other IDA projects
in better targeting their poverty alleviation interventions. The planned follow-up survey and extensive
evaluation should allow the extent of the impact on the poor to be clearly monitored.
(c)    Strengthening institutions--building institutional capacity is a key element of the CAS strategy. This
includes significant training components, designed to enhance the capacity of public agencies.
In addition, the preparation of this project, along with that for education, will greatly improve donor
coordination in both sectors, which is one of the key country program elements in the latest CAS. During the
course of the project preparation, the project team has had close contact with the Asian Development Bank
-2 -



(ADB), UNICEF, WHO, USAID-Abt Associates, and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation
(SDC).
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Currently, the main sector issues include:
(a) Collapse of Funding. Over the period since the declaration of independence by Taj ikistan, per
capita GDP fell to about 42 percent of what it was in 1990. Real wages in 1995 were about 4 percent of their
level in 1990. Since 1995, public spending has also been severely restricted, with total government
expenditures now in the range of about 17 percent of GDP (compared to over 50 percent from 1992-1994). In
the last three years, the health sector has received about 8 percent of the total budget, compared to between 8
and 15 percent from 1990-1994. With current per capita income of about $350 (Bank 1998 Social Statistics,
Atlas method -- GoT calculations show per capita income of US$188), and with public health expenditure
accounting for only about 1.4 percent of GDP, public spending for each member of the population of about 6.1
million is only in the region of about $3. The rate of economic decline has moderated somewhat over the last
three years, and was actually positive in 1997. In 1998, economic growth increased to 5.3 percent, and
inflation was reduced to 2.7 percent. However, due to extreme pressure on the Tajik ruble exchange rate in the
summer of 1999, economic growth in 1999 is expected to be reduced to 3.5 percent. Nevertheless, IMF
medium-term economic projections are quite favorable for Tajikistan.
The current funding approach for most health providers is through the raion or oblast administration,
and is based on a system of budgetary norms related to the number of beds and other factors. The actual
funding levels, however, do not provide the full funding suggested by these norms and are highly variable
between regions. For example, the raion of Varzob has 74 physician positions allocated, but only 31
physicians are actually working in the region. Moreover, the actual distribution of funds appears to ignore
these norms in many cases, with the ratio of actual Ministry of Finance to locally planned funding rangilg
from 47 to 93 percent between different raions, with no apparent underlying rationale for the differences. It
should be noted that while the Ministry of Health is invited to provide its views on the distribution of funds,
the final decisions and actual transfer of funds are made by the Ministry of Finance.
(b) Deterioration of Health Status of the Population. With the collapse of the health information
system, and indeed with most of the other statistical reporting systems as well, it is difficult to be confident in
the accuracy of any of the official data. There is reported (by the Goskomstat -- the state statistical agency) to
be a decline in the national birth rate (from about 39/1,000 in 1989 to 25/1,000 population in 1997 and
21/1,000 in 1998), a fluctuation in the official rate of infant mortality (from 41/1,000 to 47/1,000 population
and back down to 28/1,000 by 1997 and 23/1,000 in 1998) and maternal mortality ratio (from 98/100,000 in
1990 to 65/1,000 in 1997 and 67/100,000 in 1998).
The trends in these rates seem roughly plausible in view of what is known about the increase in
poverty, the impact of the civil war, particularly from 1993-1995, population movements around the country,
and the now dysfunctional state of the health system. But it could well be argued that the rates understate the
real decrease in health status. Fees introduced in the last few years for birth and death registrations may have
also skewed some of the more recent figures.
Some further information on disease patterns is available from the Ministry of Health, and especially
from the Republican Health Statistics Center. The data need to be interpreted in conjunction with the
knowledge of local experts, but the following table provides the leading causes of health services visits:

Rates are given per 1, 000 population
In addition to this, there are particular concerns about the sudden re-emergence of diphtheria since
1993. This prompted a nationwide campaign supported by UNICEF which resulted in declines in the rate
since 1996. There has also been a significant increase in the number of malaria cases between 1993 and 1997,
although there was a 35 percent decline in 1998 over 1997. Tuberculosis persists at high rates, and it is
increasing especially among children and teenagers. Reported cases of AIDS/STD are fairly low, and there is
limited reporting of chronic conditions.
(c) Deterioration of Health Services. At independence, Tajikistan inherited the standard Soviet health
system, which was generally comprehensive but highly centralized and inefficient. There were a large number
of hospitals, hospital beds, doctors, and nurses and medical technicians. The whole population was entitled to
a wide range of services provided by the State, with financing coming from the general state budget, enterprise
budgets, and extra-budgetary funds. Private payments were limited to a few non-essential services, and some
unofficial payments were made to public providers for preferential treatment. However, many protocols and
procedures were out of date, management systems were hierarchical, and consumer choice extremely limited.
In contrast, the health system is now characterized by:
inadequate funds to pay personnel even the minimal salaries which they are supposed to receive;
very limited stocks of medicines and medical supplies (despite some humanitarian and relief support);
a significant loss of staff through emigration and resort to informal sector activities, motivated simply by
the need to survive;
aging facilities and equipment, and many buildings and other infrastructure damaged during the war;
reduced utilization rates (despite a still high average length of stay in hospital of 14 days) and a collapse of
the referral system;
a growing tendency for people to postpone or defer medical care and/or to rely on self-medication; and
a markedly skewed distribution of staff and resources particularly towards the capital city of Dushanbe.
Besides the problems of the health care system itself, the population as a whole suffers from poor
general knowledge and lack of awareness of disease, health and nutrition, with unhealthy diets and lack of
micro-nutrients contributing substantially to the pattern of disease. Many urban dwellers and about 50 percent
of the rural population do not have access to safe drinking water, and there have been severe outbreaks of
typhoid due to the breakdown in the water supply infrastructure.
(d) Weaknesses in Training and Utilization of Medical Personnel. There is a high ratio of doctors
(19.6/1000) and nurses (57.4 /1000) to the population. The majority of doctors "specialize" (8,347 specialists,
and 3,674 unspecialized doctors in 1997). All are poorly trained. Under the Soviet system, doctors qualified
as "theraputists"--who see adults over 14 years--and "pediatricians"--trained to see children under 15 years in
- 4 -



the primary care setting. "Specialists" receive additional training. The theraputists and pediatricians refer a
high proportion of the patients they see to the specialists--as they are limited both in knowledge and
equipment. They could therefore be viewed at this time as "dispatchers" rather than "healers". It is estimated
that, on average, about 25 percent of physician positions remain unfilled, while in rural areas this figure rises
to 40 percent. Inspite of this, their caseload is low -- doctors see as few as five patients per day, rarely seeing
more than twelve.
Potential physicians enter medical school (by examination; one place for eight applicants) from high
school, and choose to specialize as a theraputist, pediatrician, dentist, pharmacist or public health doctor.
After a six year basic training program (first stage), and a one year internship (second stage), the internists and
pediatricians can work in primary care. Those wishing to specialize (and who pass further competitive
examinations) obtain additional hospital based training, and, dependent on duration of the training, achieve
lower or higher specialist grades. Medical training is primarily didactic, based on lectures and a limited
number of (outdated) Russian text books. There is very little clinical or teaching equipment. Medical school
student intake has dropped from 1,000 students in 1990 to 598 in 1998.
The Tajik Medical Institute of Postgraduate Training is a separate institution from the University, and
provides all specialist training. This year, the Rector established the Faculty of Family medicine (which he
now chairs), which is to provide re-training for established therapists and pediatricians. Six teachers have
been appointed. The Rector has visited the Exeter university Faculty of Family Medicine, and will train in
family medicine for four months in St. Petersburg. So far, 47 doctors have been re-trained. The course entails
lectures in 18 different specialties over three months. Again, the Institute has no equipment or textbooks. A
suite of rooms has been prepared for a "model practice", as well as a faculty office with rooms for study. Both
have been refurbished, but stand empty and bare.
Currently, nurses have limited training, are often under-utilized, and are held in low esteem. Feldshers
(roughly equivalent to nurse practitioners) and midwives used to receive up to four years training, and are able
to deliver basic medical care, often unsupervised by doctors (in rural areas). Nurses simply carry out the
orders of the doctor, have few clinical skills, and are given no responsibility. However, starting in 1996, the
training programs were changed in order to reflect the need for more qualified nurses in primary care,
especially in isolated areas without doctors. The existing Medical Vocational Schools were transformed into
Medical Colleges and Medical Schools. Now, nurses will graduate as Bachelor of Accoucheur (midwife) or
Bachelor of Doctor's assistant. They will be trained to carry additional responsibilities, including limited
prescribing. The first cohort will graduate in 2000. This year, 3,005 students were enrolled in medium level
medical educational institutions; 650 in medical colleges and 2,355 in medical schools. Of the total, 130
students living in remote areas were accepted without examination, as there is a need for well trained nurses in
these regions. Nurses who do exceptionally well and graduate with Honors, may transfer to the third year in
the medical university, and train as doctors if they pass the requisite tests.
(e) Weaknesses in the Planning and Implementation of Reforms. To address the situation, the
Government and the Ministry of Health have undertaken some important planning for reforming health
services. In particular, a document on "Health For All" has been compiled, the Ministry of Health has written
a "Program for the Restructuring of the Health Sector" and a new health law (inter alia, allowing for the
establishment of a private medical sector) was passed in 1997. More recently, the Ministry of Health has
started to plan for a major restructuring of primary health care and other services, using funds and expertise
provided by a WHO EURO/ECHO. Furthermore, some positive changes have already been introduced: for
example, the immunization schedule has been amended to follow WHO practice; many midwives have been
trained in family planning; a start has been made in the training of family doctors; the number of new medical
students being trained has been reduced; some facilities have been transformed to be "self-financing", and a
large number of hospital beds have been closed.
- 5-



However, the extent of structural change achieved so far has been very limited. The average length of
stay in hospital is still very high by international standards; there has been little rationalization of facilities (as
opposed to beds within facilities); many of the clinical protocols being used are outdated; there are too many
doctors compared to ancillary health workers, and also an excessive number of different medical specialties;
and, overall, the health care system is largely oriented to curative care and inpatient services.
There are several factors which have constrained the pace of sectoral reform. A major concern is the
lack of incentives for the Ministry of Health to improve its allocation of resources due to the present budgeting
system. Any cost savings that are made are immediately removed from the Ministry budget. For example, the
Ministry of Health has indicated that it has recently closed 30 percent of the pre-independence hospital bed
capacity, resulting in savings of approximately $2 million to the hospital system. Unfortunately, these savings
are not retained in the sector. The budget system, therefore, needs urgent reform. Another constraint has been
a shortage of investment funds available for staff retraining and facilities/service restructuring. A third
constraint is the limited institutional capacity available to implement the new plans and ideas. Also, the
fragmentation of the system between the republican government and the local government (with the latter
responsible for most of the health services and spending) has created additional difficulties for the
implementation of reforms.
Until recently (about two years now), the civil war also significantly affected the potential for reform
activity. Even now, there are parts of the country where travel is hazardous, and implementing reform
activities would be very difficult. Moreover, a recent study on the health system in Tajikistan indicated that 85
FAPs and a variety of hospitals and ambulatory clinics were destroyed or damaged in the war, as well as over
800 ambulances and hospital vehicles and over 1,000 pieces of medical equipment destroyed or stolen.
(f) Weaknesses in the Purchasing and Distribution of Pharmaceuticals. Before independence, Tajik
Farmatsiya was the backbone of a fully centralized drug supply system. It was responsible for procuring,
storing and distributing drugs and medical supplies. The cost of procurement was covered by the Government
and almost all drugs requested were provided. That system has now broken down because of the financial
crisis, and drug procurement to the public sector has become uncertain and unreliable. Today, the drug supply
to the public sector relies up to 30 percent on humanitarian assistance, although it has been much higher in the
immediate post-conflict times.
Drug purchase for the public sector is done through wholesalers. These enterprises supply medical
institutions and public pharmacies with drugs registered in the country, and sell medicines to patients and
private pharmacies (of which there are more than 1,000, but only 100 are officially registered in the MOH).
The commercial activities have generated substantial cash incomes, which have brought about more flexibility
and consistency in drug procurement. This has increased drug availability and reduced gaps in the provision
of medicines. However, the vast majority of drugs purchased are brand-name products. A choice of
approximately 300 drugs is available from wholesalers, who all supply virtually the same range of medicines.
Before independence, Tajikistan had few of the technical elements of quality assurance of drugs, as
the legislation, regulations, registration and licensing of import/exports were managed at the central level in
Moscow. Since then, Tajikistan has started to develop its own drug regulatory system. The rule that only
registered drugs can be imported and sold in pharmacies is not respected in Tajikistan and a number of
unregistered imported drugs are widely available on the market.
Tajikistan has virtually no domestic drug production. A limited number of products are produced by
hospital pharmacies, such as intravenous solutions for use in hospitals, but the production of many other items
has been greatly reduced due to the lack of raw materials. There is also a joint venture between the
Government and an Indian company to produce pharmaceuticals, but the plant is not yet finished. In its draft
policy document, the MOH has indicated that it envisages a pharmaceutical system based on cost-efficient
production of quality agents and their rational distribution, and the finalization of the production plant is given
- 6 -



a very high priority. However, sufficient funds have not been made available by the Government to complete
the project.
A list of essential drugs was officially established in 1994 by ministerial decree. This list has been
revised several times since, but has never been widely used for prescribing and treatment. The intention is to
promote prescribing of essential drugs and to use the list for drug supply in public sector institutions. The
Tajik essential drugs list has been composed taking into account the WHO model list of essential drugs and the
local prescribing habits. The list is presented in generic form. At present, over prescribing and polypharmacy
remain large problems, as well as the unnecessary use of antibiotics and injections. It is well understood in the
MOH that there is an urgent need to revise drug treatment schemes and make them more cost-effective. While
the area of drug policy is obviously one of great importance, it is also one the components of the ongoing
WHO EURO study noted above, and is therefore not addressed by this project. There are also projects
underway by Pharmaciens sans Frontieres to promote rational prescribing practices, and the Aga Khan
Development Network to establish community revolving funds for drug purchasing.
(g) Weaknesses in the Distribution of Resources. While the overall level of resources devoted to
health care are very low by intemational standards, there are also significant differences in the access to
services and the distribution of funds to regions. At the present time, the regions with the highest funding has
2.7 times the funds per capita than the lowest funded region. The ratio of beds per capita between the highest
and lowest bedded regions is over 2: 1, the ratio between the region with the highest number of physicians per
capita and the lowest is 7.1: 1, and between the region with the highest number of nurses is 2.2:1. The overall
ratio of physicians to nurses is approximately 1:3. In terms of health outcomes, there are also great disparities:
the region with the highest maternal mortality rate was almost 3.2 times that of the lowest rate in 1998, and
there is a difference of almost four years between the regions with the highest and lowest life expectancy. In
1998, only 7.3 percent of the births in Dushanbe occurred without qualified obstetrical assistance, compared to
almost 60 percent in the Khatlon oblast. It is clear that the distribution of services and resources is a key
policy area to be addressed.
From the point of view of the Ministry of Health, their reform strategy includes the following principles:
more emphasis should be given to protecting people's health, and the primary health care system should
be strengthened;
the quality and cost-effectiveness of medical care should be improved;
improvements should be made in management skills;
* health care financing should be reformed; and
* innovations in the sector should be encouraged, and there should be constant monitoring and evaluation of
reforms.
This project supports each of these reform principles. A number of other issues also exist on the
Government's reform agenda, including improved health worker compensation, privatization of health
services, improved medical research, and the reform of pharmaceutical policies. The selection of design
objectives and project components reflect a critical need to improve basic health services, as evidenced by the
current health status of the population, present expenditures on health services and the deteriorating physical
plant.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
*  Deteriorating health indicators: Although it is acknowledged that there are factors beyond the reach of
the health system which account for a certain amount of the decline in health status, it is also clear that an
efficient and well functioning health system can have a positive impact on the health of the population. A
number of conditions are directly amenable to health system intervention, including ARI and diarrheal
diseases, communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal mortality and injuries and trauma. A variety of
risk factors can also be addressed through well planned and delivered preventive services, including
- 7 -



smoking, alcohol abuse, and nutrition. The current project focuses on primary health care reform as a
means of improving treatment of these primary conditions and increasing the use of preventive services.
*  Deteriorating health services: A variety of factors account for the poor state of health services in
Tajikistan, as noted above. In addition to the general state of repair of the facilities, the distribution and
function of facilities has not yet been actively addressed. Although one strategy would be to simply
refurbish existing facilities without regard for the types of health services delivered there, doing so would
miss a significant opportunity to improve the long-term viability of the health system in Tajikistan. The
current project seeks to address these issues through the development of service and facility guidelines and
the refurbishment and re-equipment of the facilities in the pilot regions in accordance with these
guidelines. As part of an integrated approach, these guidelines would also be consistent with the reform of
primary care services.
*  Weaknesses in the training of health professionals: Section 2 clearly shows there are significant
weaknesses in current health professional training programs. Through a mixture of a program for
retraining of existing personnel and the development of a comprehensive undergraduate and post-graduate
(CME) training strategy (perhaps implemented through a second health project), the current project seeks
to improve the level of training within the pilot regions and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
i  Disparities in the allocation of resources: This issue is well recognized by the Ministry of Health, and
they are actively seeking approaches to address these disparities. Through the development of institutional
capacity within the Ministry, the current project seeks to address this issue by providing expertise to
develop alternative resource allocation approaches that are appropriate for the situation in Tajikistan.
*  Limited institutional capacity for implementing change: Because of its former status as a Republic
within the Soviet Union, Tajikistan does not have a long history of managing its own health system. In
addition to this, the various pressures upon the health system and the significant changes that have
occurred throughout the system over the last 10 years point to the need for well-developed change
management expertise within the country. Although one option would be to import the talent needed to
effect these changes, the current project seeks to build up this capacity in the country through a mixture of
direct training and having local staff work with world-class experts in a collaborative manner. It is felt that
in this way, it is possible to develop a group of individuals within Tajikistan who will become
"champions" for change and also have the ability to make such changes happen, both at the management
and clinical levels.
Other key elements of the project design strategy include:
*  emphasizing the developmental nature of the project (relatively small and quick, probably with relatively
little conditionality, but with a flexible design and considerable monitoring and evaluation), thereby
maximizing the likelihood of a successful implementation;
*  utilizing information obtained from the design (including the social assessment) and early implementation
of the PPAP, and the design of PAP2;
*  implementing the Health and Education projects in parallel to build upon the successes of each to move
the projects forward more quickly;
*  building on other pilot health projects already funded by other donors and under implementation (e.g., in
Gorno-Badakhshan by the Aga Khan Foundation, and in Khulyab by USAID);
*  working with other donors interested in the health sector (especially the Know-How Fund, ADB, SDC,
UNICEF, GTZ and WHO);
-8 -



* learning from the work of selected international NGOs (such as Relief International, American Red Cross,
and Save the Children-US) who have experience in the health sector in Tajikistan;
* encouraging the counterparts and client to share and learn as much from the health reform experiences of
other countries in the region (especially Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan); and
* making maximum use of a PHRD grant to initiate reforms and start to build up capacity as part of the
project preparation work.
The household and provider surveys and social assessment funded through the project preparation
provides a solid foundation upon which other policy interventions can be considered. For example, the current
estimates of the level of unofficial payments (see Annex 4) are essential pre-requisites before considering the
issues of appropriate levels of official patient cost sharing, health worker remuneration, potential privatization,
or premium-based insurance.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The key focus of this project is to replace current hierarchical, specialty driven approach to health
care with a primary care model. This is accomplished in a number of ways. First, the existing staff in the
two pilot regions will be trained in primary care methods and guidelines. Then, this is supported by the
second component of the project, which seeks to rationalize health facilities and improve infrastructure for
remaining providers, consistent with the primary care approach. As noted above, one of the key problems
with the health system is the norms-based funding system. The project addresses this by exploring
innovative ways of funding health care services, including improved coordination between the Ministry of
Health and the local governments. The key goal of the project is to demonstrate efficacy of these
approaches, and improve the institutional capability to carry out similar reforms throughout Tajikistan. Of
course, one major obstacle will be to persuade stakeholders to commit to these reforms if the approach is
proved to be effective. There are a number of aspects of the project that support overcoming this obstacle,
including the training of key professional leaders who will champion the change process.
3. Benefits and target population:
There are two different target populations and types of benefits, depending on the type of project
component:
*  For the 150,000 people who live in the pilot regions of Varzob and Dangara, the significant benefits of
this project will be improved quality of care, and more widely distributed primary health services,
especially to more rural areas.
*  For the population of Tajikistan as a whole, the key benefits will be the development of a more equitable
funding approach for health services based on need, rather than on historical norms and the existing
distribution of facilities. While all of those requiring health services are likely to benefit; the maximum
benefit will accrue to the poor in rural areas, who are currently underserved. In addition, the
development of an efficient nation-wide cold chain for vaccines will benefit the entire population of
Tajikistan, especially those at risk for communicable diseases.
The specific performance indicators selected for this project are designed to measure these benefits,
especially with respect to the poor. Beyond the receivers of care, health providers will also benefit
significantly through the project, as they will be better trained to make more sound clinical decisions, and
will have the facilities and equipment to support these decisions.
- 10-



Another key benefit of the project will be the development of significant institutional capacity within
both the Ministry of Health and the pilot regions. This capacity is underdeveloped at the present time, since
in Soviet times most of the key decisions were made centrally, and the individual republics had not
developed such a capacity.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The implementation period for this project is 45 months. The executing agency would be the
Ministry of Health, with the responsibility for the rationalization of health services at the regional level
shared between the Ministry and the regional administration. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been
established to manage project implementation and loan administration. The Executive Director of the PIU is
accountable to the Minister of Health. A PHC Steering Committee will be established to oversee the
implementation of PHC reforms and delivery of training. The two pilot regions of Varzob and Dangara
would also be responsible for implementation of the project's investment activities respectively as well as
implementation of policy reforms.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
(a) Pilot limited to one region. Despite its relatively small size, Tajikistan is a land of significant
geographic and demographic variation. It is felt that testing the proposed interventions in only one pilot region
would limit the ability to generalize the results to other regions. The proposed selection of two regions includes
one with a fairly mountainous rural population and significant transportation issues and another with a large
urban population and relatively easy access to outlying villages. This provides a good contrast for comparing the
results of different interventions.
(b) Limited Project Size and Scope. Another option would be to cut down the project further, and only
support the district component or the national component. However, there are important links between the two
of them: the former is necessary to test out on the ground what reforms are possible and realistic; and the latter is
needed to enable replication later. Moreover, it is essential that a strong institutional capacity be developed
within the Ministry of Health to facilitate the later introduction of reforms at the national level.
(c) Eliminate Training Component. While including training as a component of the project adds
complexity, it is felt that the family practice/primary health care approach is fundamental to improvements in
health service delivery. This approach cannot be introduced without substantial training support. This
component creates some important donor linkages that should contribute to the success of this project and any
potential future national project.
(d) Health Promotion and Prevention. A different design would focus on some of the underlying causes
of ill-health, such as ignorance and lack of potable water (especially with the recent typhoid outbreak) which are
largely outside of the health sector. However, there are some initiatives in place (PPAP micro-projects,
Dushanbe water supply) to address water issues, while there are structural problems in the health delivery system
which need to be addressed urgently. Water and sanitation for health facilities will be upgraded as part of the
project activities, and critical immunization issues resulting from gaps in the cold chain will also be addressed.
(e) Primary Health Care Expansion. The Health Sector Note highlighted respiratory, peri-natal, and
infectious and parasitic diseases, as key causes of mortality and morbidity. These types of conditions are well
suited to a primary care approach, which envisions well trained physicians working in "properly equipped
medical facilities, able to deal with patients of all ages, diagnosing and treating a wide range of diseases with
appropriate medication, and referring fewer patients to secondary services." (Know How Fund Report) Any
-I -



expansion of primary health care services beyond these basic services would only be considered once
appropriately trained medical staff and properly equipped and renovated facilities are functioning. Similarly,
focusing only on one or two key diseases (such as TB or malaria) would not provide a sufficient scope of
practice for newly trained primary care physicians to fully embrace the changing paradigm for health services
delivery.
Selection of Pilot Regions
The two pilot regions, Varzob and Dangara were selected from seven potential sites put forward by the
Ministry of Health. A number of selection criteria were evaluated, including the reform-mindedness of the
regional health and municipal administrators, security, the size and population of the region, and whether there
were other development or assistance projects currently being undertaken in the region. The health indicators in
the region were also reviewed. Table 1, below, summarizes these indicators, while Table 2 provides the other
qualitative information that was used to evaluate the pilot regions.

As can be seen from the next table, the two pilot regions that have the highest aggregate average score (with
High=3, Medium=2, and Low=l-) were Varzob and Dangara. Site visits to both of these regions confirmed that they
would be good candidates for pilot regions.

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
(a)    Donor coordination. There has been considerable contact with each of the other agencies working or
planning to work in the health sector in Tajikistan, and some general discussions about the possibility of
working together. Donor coordination workshops and donor information sessions have been held during
previous missions, and ongoing discussions are being held with the Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation, UNICEF, WHO, and the Asian Development Bank to either secure financing as a part of
this project, or ensure coordination between these project activities and those of related projects being
carried out by these agencies. During the project appraisal, approval in principle was received from the
Swiss for funding most of the health financing component of the project, and UNICEF has agreed to
participate in the planning and implementation of the "cold chain" sub-component. Discussions are
continuing with the ADB to coordinate the activities of both projects.
(b)    Concern about costly/outside TA. This is a sensitive issue. There is an obvious need for substantial
outside TA, but steps have been taken to ensure that it is minimized in the direct cost of the proposed
IDA credit. The PHRD and Swiss grants have been used to TA for the project preparation work, and
other outside grant funding will be sought for additional technical assistance requirements. The
participation of the SDC in the health financing component, which is heavily weighted to international
TA, has also helped to reduce the amount of TA to be funded through the Credit. Nevertheless, there is
still a substantial amount of international TA envisioned within the project, as a major goal is to improve
institutional capacity in the Ministry of Health and pilot regions, and outside TA is a key input to this
capacity building. Where outside TA is used, the project generally also includes provision for local
consultants as well, to ensure the transfer of knowledge to these local staff. In addition, a considerable
- 14 -



amount of the project funds are also devoted to management and medical training. During the appraisal
mission, significant emphasis was placed on reducing the reliance on international technical assistance.
While the potential of using bilateral donor financing has obviously helped, the combination of local
experts with international TA has been included to reduce the international component. The result has
been a reduction of international TA as a percent of the IDA financing from 26.2 to 12.3 percent
(currently $662,800).
(c)    Project implementation capacity and staff training in IDA-related procedures. There will be need for
considerable investment in the training of the counterpart staff. Some has been done under the PHRD
grant, and efforts will be made to utilize the expertise being built up in the TASIF (under the PPAP) and
also in other IDA-funded projects in Tajikistan and other countries. The parts of the project devoted to
management training and sector capacity building were thoroughly reviewed during the appraisal
mission, and revised to put increased focus on the training of local staff in the Ministry of Health and the
regional health providers and administration. As part of the project, management training programs in
epidemiology, finance and budget management, planning and management information systems will be
provided to staff in the pilot regions and the Ministry of Health.
(d)   Importance of community involvement. This has been initiated through the social assessment, and will
be extended through the design of the project itself.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
(a)    Preliminary discussions took place with the Government about a possible health project when the future
lending program was reviewed during CAS discussions in early 1996.
(b)    A request for support was made by the Minister of Health to IDA in March 1996.
(c)    The existence of the national plan (put together by the Ministry of Health and WHO) indicates a
substantial interest in reform, along the lines proposed in the IDA project.
(d)    A delegation from Tajikistan participated in the EDI-EC3 regional health seminar in Ashgabat in May
1996, and a wide range of reform ideas were discussed.
(e)    The recently completed Health Sector Note provides a more complete assessment about the depth of
commitment to reform and to the project concept.
(f)    The Faculty of Family Medicine has been recently established at postgraduate institute, and some
doctors have already been trained in family medicine.
(g)    The Prime Minister reiterated his support for this project in June 1998.
(h)    The Minister of Health has appointed an Executive Director and a number of the senior staff in the PIU
have also been hired to manage the PHRD grant and begin the project preparation and implementation
process. This forms the nucleus of what is expected to be a very good implementation team.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
(a)    While there are several other agencies already active in the sector, or potentially interested, the extent of
external support is quite limited so far. WHO and GTZ are only in a position to fund technical
assistance; the USAID program is highly constrained; the AKF program is quite small and limited to
Gorno-Badakhshan; and UNICEF support is primarily for the vaccination program and the distribution
of health kits (although it has also been pursuing iodization of salt and fortification of flour). The ADB
is preparing a major project in the health and education sectors, and the IDA project team is coordinating
- 15 -



closely with the ADB team to ensure compatible approaches. There has already been a considerable
amount of sharing of information. If the approaches can be coordinated, this will not only extend the
benefits of the proposed reforms earlier, it will also provide a larger number of "pilot regions" which can
be used to evaluate results, and limit the requirement for additional IDA funding for follow-up activities.
(b)    IDA has knowledge of, and involvement in, health sectors of all other Central Asian countries, and is,
therefore, in a good position to provide access to comparative experiences.
(c)    IDA is in a very good position to work with the client to develop its capacity to carry out reforms and
improve its strategic policy development capability. Although the current WHO project provides some
of this support, no other agency has indicated possible support in this area.
(d)    There are important links with existing work (PPAP and education projects, etc.) by IDA.
E. Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
E  Cost benefitNPV=US$ million; ERR= %
Z Cost effectiveness
D  Other (specify)
It should be noted from the outset that despite the button highlighted above, what follows is not a cost-
effectiveness analysis, but rather an analysis of the potential sustainability and expandability of the reforms
included in the proposed project, and a summary of the significant health finance and patient payment issues
related to the health sector in Tajikistan that will be addressed through this project.
As noted in other parts of this document, the purpose of this project is to stimulate and support the health
reform process in Tajikistan. This should have the impact of:
* increasing the quality of care;
* improving the efficiency of health services, and assisting the government in increasing spending on health
services in a systematic and sustainable way;
* making patient payments for health services more transparent and equitable (including understandable and
consistent payment criteria), to ensure that access to these services by the poor is protected.
The following types of economic analyses have been carried out as part of the project preparation, or will
be conducted as part of the project monitoring and evaluation:
* Evaluation of fiscal impact of the project;
* Affordability and potential for expansion of the specific region interventions
* Cost-effectiveness of the specific health service interventions developed as part of project
Fiscal sustainability (both from republican and local resources) is a key consideration that is addressed
within the detailed project design. The current level of public expenditure on health services is so low, that even
a modest increase in ongoing health system operating costs may not be sustainable beyond the life of the project.
This issue is addressed by:
l. detailed analysis during project appraisal (see Annex 4)
2. achieving an appropriate balance between one-time development costs and operating costs (see Annex 5)
- 16-



3. obtaining a more complete picture of the total level of expenditure on health care as part of the social
assessment/survey (see Annex 4)
4. exploring alternative sources of sustained funding at the community level, and the appropriate funding
sources for capital and recurring expenses as part of the project (see project Component C -- Annex 2)
5.  including labor adjustment strategies as part of the project to ensure that service rationalization is effective
and sustainable
6. utilizing the process of developing the essential drugs list, supplies list and equipment lists for the pilot
regions to encourage rational prescribing practices and the use of generic alternatives to high-priced name
brand drugs and other products.
The project will explore the potential for charging and cost-sharing, based on perceived improvements in
quality of service and the ability to pay in the pilot regions. The Pilot Poverty Alleviation Project (Credit 29460-
TJ) has already demonstrated a significant willingness by households and local governments to contribute to
projects or activities in the health sector that they feel will be of direct benefit to them. The household survey
also provides important information to assist in developing these aspects of the project, and the key economic
indicators are summarized in the second part of Annex 4 (see Table 2).
Based on the costing used for this project, it is estimated that extending the reforms to the country as a
whole would cost approximately $64 million, if the training is approached in the same way and all remaining
facilities are renovated, refurbished and equipped in the same manner. Of this total, $9.0 million represents
additional, ongoing operating costs, although this would be offset by current expenditures on drugs and
consumable supplies, as well as the cost savings that would accrue as a result of the rationalization of health
facilities. The redistribution of cost sharing could also help off-set some of these costs, as described above.
The $4.4 million estimated for expanding the primary health care training program to all regions may be
reduced somewhat by the use of lower cost training approaches. This will be examined as part of the training
evaluation and the national training strategy.
The largest portion of the total would be $30.7 million for the facility renovation and refurbishment, and
$16.7 million for related equipment. Potential offsets to this would be upgrading that has already been done or is
planned through other projects, such as the ADB and Pilot Poverty Alleviation projects, as well as potential
economies that emerge as a result of the first project. The following table summarizes the estimated costs by
component and expenditure type.

2. Financial (see Annex 5):   NPV=US$ million; FRR = %
The development of improved management information systems for activity and financial reporting by
health facilities and regions is included as a component of the project, as part of the planned improvements in
management information systems generally within the Ministry of Health.
To date, the financial management capacity of the MOH has been limited, which is one of the reasons for
recruiting PIU staff with financial management skills fairly early in the project cycle. A foreign consultant was
been recruited through the PHRD grant to further assist the PIU financial staff by providing additional hands-on
training as assist in setting up the accounting system and procedures for the PIU. It was confirmed at a follow-up
mission in January 2000 that the finance department of the PIU is fully operational with a high level of
capability.
An acceptable financial management system is currently in place. Disbursements will start using
traditional disbursement methods-Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) reimbursements, direct payment, etc.
After the PIU has gained experience with the financial management system and the reporting under project
management reports (PMRs), and provided that an improved financial management system is reviewed and
found satisfactory by IDA, the project may move to PMR-based disbursements.
Disbursements will be made against SOEs for contracts for: goods less than US$100,000 equivalent;
works less than US$100,000 equivalent; consulting firms, training and fellowships costing less than US$50,000
equivalent, individual consultants under contracts costing less than $20,000 equivalent and operating costs as
specified by the Association. This documentation will be made available for the required audit as well as to IDA
supervision mission, and will be retained by the PIU for at least one year after receipt by IDA of the audit report
for the year in which the last disbursement was made. The processing, disbursement and monitoring of the
allocations of the proceeds of the Credit and Borrower counterpart financing will be managed by PIU, in
coordination and consultation with the MOF.
The existing financial management system is completely adequate per Annex 4-B of the LACI
Implementation Handbook. The action plan that was developed during the pre-appraisal mission, and updated
during the appraisal mission, for strengthening the FMS to an acceptable level prior to Board presentation has
been fully implemented.
To facilitate timely project implementation, the Govemment will establish, maintain and operate, under
terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, a special account, denominated in US Dollars, as well as project
account in local currency. The authorized allocation for the special account will initially be US$250,000.
Fiscal Impact:
As shown in Annex 5, the total costs of this project are $6.24 million, with $5.4 million coming from
IDA, $0.3 million from the Swiss govemment and $0.54 million from the counterpart. Of the total, only about 8
percent represents ongoing operating expenses, with the annual ongoing requirement around $23 1,000 per year.
Annex 4 discusses the sustainability of this amount, and the potential avenues for ensuring this sustainability.
3. Technical:
While the training needs related to the primary health care approach are fairly well known in a technical
sense and used widely, there will be a challenge in determining an appropriate pedagogical approach for the
application of this approach to the specific situation in Tajikistan. As part of the project preparation, a primary
health care/training consultant was hired through the Swiss grant to perform this analysis and provide
recommendations. His recommendations were discussed during the appraisal with the Ministry of Health PIU,
and have been included in the project implementation plan (see Component A -- Annex 2).
- 18-



The second key technical issue involves determining appropriate protocols, facilities, equipment,
supplies and pharmaceuticals for each level of health facility. There are several inputs to this issue, including the
provider survey carried out under the PHRD grant, the architectural survey, also included under the PHRD grant,
the primary health care/training consultant report described above, and the Primary Health Care Training
Committee. Again a great deal of the work will be to modify standard approaches to fit the context ofTaj ikistan.
4. Institutional:
a. Executing agencies:
The Ministry of Health has expressed a keen interest in reforming the health sector, and has pursued this
through a variety of approaches. A key contribution of this project will be capacity building at the Ministry of
Health level, as well as in the pilot regions, both in terms of carrying out the project and supporting longer-term
reform.
The funding and administrative relationships between the Ministry of Health and both the Ministry of
Finance and the various local governments will require ongoing dialogue both to ensure the smooth flow of
project funds and other resources, and to address the capitation-based funding approach, which is included in the
project and is a priority of the Ministry of Health. Ongoing dialogue with the Ministry of Finance and local
governments will be required to ensure that the project objectives can be met.
b. Project management:
T he nucleus of a strong project management team has been established within the PIU in the Ministry of
Health. This team has been supported through intemational consultants in organizational analysis and design,
financial management and procurement. Two members from the PIU attended the fifth annual PIU conference in
Sarajevo to both increase their exposure to other health projects and augment their skills in the areas of project
management and implementation. The result should be a fully functional and highly motivated PIU well before
project effectiveness. Study tours are also being planned under the PPF to expose PIU staff to specific areas of
need, such as procurement and financial management.
c. Project Monitoring Strategy:
Annex I contains specific activities, timelines and targets to be used for monitoring the project. Progress
against each of these will be monitored on an ongoing basis through the PMRs and other project reports. These
wi?l be reviewed by IDA staff and discussed during supervision missions, expected at least twice per year.
Required adjustments to the implementation strategy or other corrective action will be agreed during the
supervision missions. A detailed assessment of project progress will be made at the mid-term review, and
specific action plans developed to address outstanding issues.
d. Project Evaluation Strategy:
The goal for preparing the evaluation strategy was not to put into place activities to regularly_monitorthe
progress of the IDA-financed project. Activities and indicators for this purpose are already described above,
although these will be helpful for the Evaluation Strategy.
Rather, the primary goals of the evaluation strategy are to determine:
1.     Whether the desired social and financial-incentive changes will have occurred in the intended target
(pilot region) population by the end of the project, by evaluating:
the effectiveness of each of the individual components of the project: primary health care development,
health facilities rationalization, and health care financing system. (This evaluation can largely be based on
indicators and data sources already identified in Annex 1);
- 19 -



* whether the composite model of health care delivery based on primary care and per capita resource
allocation is effective in meeting the overall objectives, e.g., improving the quality of (primary care),
improving access, etc.
2.    the extent to which these changes can be attributable to the development project in the two regions rather
than to other independent factors (such as general changes in the economic environment, actions of other donors,
changes in policy, etc.);
3.    the extent to which the pilot had unintended direct or indirect impacts, both for the targeted populations
and others;
4.     whether it would be feasible, both technically and financially, to expand the pilot to a wider geographical
area of Tajikistan.
To the extent feasible, the evaluation seeks to highlight what changes occurred as a result of the project
rather than from other concurrent events.
Institutional Arrangements
The project director in the project implementation unit will have core responsibilities for both the
strategic planning and for follow-up of the defined evaluation strategy and for the more specific monitoring and
evaluation of the IDA-financed project.
Indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of the program (which will be measured before and after the
implementation of project interventions):
Given the short time frame and the specific interventions of the project, the strategy is built around
evaluating progress towards indicators of service quality-of-care and service accessibility. While illustrative
indicators are provided in this document, the PIU is continuing to refine both the strategy and the list of
indicators. This work will be finalized before credit effectiveness.
Indicators to measure the impact of the project on health status in the pilot regions will NOT be
measured, as the duration of the project is of an insufficient time period (3 years) to meaningfully measure
impact indicators (such as infant mortality rates, matemal mortality ratios, etc.)
Service Output: Quality-of-Care; Illustrative Indicators:
*  Percentage of service delivery points (SDPs) stocked with specified pharmaceuticals;
*  Percentage of SDPs stocked with specified educational materials;
*  Percentage of clients who are correctly managed for specified conditions;
*  Existence of effective quality assurance mechanisms for specified procedures;
*  Percentage of providers who are technically competent in performing specified screening and diagnosis;
*  Case fatality rate for specific diseases;
*  Quality of care composite indicator. [This is a composite indicator developed by the EVALUATION Project
which collapses information on pharmaceutical availability, client-provider interaction, provider technical
competence, acceptability of services (to clients), and continuity of services into one summary measure].
Accessibility to High-Quality Service; Illustrative Indicators:
*  Percentage of all adults in community knowledgeable about specific preventive and treatment services
offered by different levels of health care system in the region;
*  Percentage of all adults in community who identify "low quality of care" as a significant barrier to seeking
care at local facility;
- 20 -



* Percentage of all adults in community who identify other significant barrier to care (cost of care, distance
from health care center, transportation difficulties, cultural barriers such as language or religious restriction,
etc.);
Methodologies to Address these Issues:
In order to evaluate the concerns raised above, a number of strategies will be employed, as detailed
below. The evaluation will be done for: (a) the two project regions; (b) one or two "comparator regions" that can
be used as control groups (which will not receive the project interventions); and (c) for Tajikistan as a whole.
1.     Actions to be taken before project implementation:
The primary goal is to define baseline values for the set of indicators (to be finalized before
negotiations) which summarize the current standards of quality-of-care in the health facilities (including the
technical competence of the health providers, the availability of needed diagnostic and treatment equipment and
pharmaceuticals, etc.), the accessibility (in terms of geography and economics) of high-quality care, etc.. The
following steps will be taken to define the baseline values:
*  Evaluation of the TLSS (Tajikistan Living Standards Survey) and the provider study already conducted;
*  Identification and evaluation of any additional baseline data already available for: (a) the two project
regions, (b) "comparator regions" and (c) for Tajikistan as a whole. This evaluation will concentrate on the
types of indicators defined above. In addition to the TLSS (Tajikistan Living Standards Survey), this task
will involve identification and evaluation of any other relevant data sources, including administrative
records, clinic records, client surveys (in home), exit interviews (from clinics) with clients, focus groups,
observation, and provider interviews. Sources may include the State Statistical Agency, the Ministry of
Health, the Center for Medical Statistics and Information, the Sanitary and Epidemiological Services, various
medical centers and institutes, the Demographic and Health survey program, international NGOs, and others.
*  Planning for later project evaluation through identification of data collection efforts underway at the time of
baseline. [Note that the project plan calls for follow-up surveys and evaluation]. One goal is to ensure that
all baseline values that are collected will have a follow-up value at the time of project completion for
comparison.
*  Conduct of "situational analyses" (using this or a similar methodology) of health facilities in the two project
regions (and, if feasible, in a control region as well). [The situation analysis is a facility-based survey to
assess the adequacy of the service installations and the quality of care provided to clients. The data
collection involves multiple modules (for instance, surveys with providers and with clients, observation of
providers in counseling sessions, inventory of equipment and supplies)].
*  Identification of data gaps in the available data that would prevent baseline evaluation. [As an example, the
TLSS is weak in terms of data on public knowledge, attitudes, and expectations of the health sector, topics
that are vitally important to understanding how best to increase usage of public facilities. Indicators can be
selected to address this concern, but they will be meaningful only if there is a strategy to address data gaps].
*  If data gaps are evident, a decision will be made before project effectiveness regarding what to do. Potential
solutions include substituting another related indicator for which data is available or conducting new
research in order to obtain baseline values. While the latter might become expensive and time-consuming, a
rapid assessment using focus groups might give the required infornation at low cost. For instance, a
methodology of gauging community perceptions of the quality-of-care in health facilities would be to
randomly select a representative sample of people from the region (some of whom use and some who do not
- 21 -



use public health facilities) for focus group participation. Targeted questions can be used to estimate the
values for the indicators.
Planning for later project evaluation through identification of data collection efforts underway at the time of
baseline. This activity will address how the evaluation will measure change in the value of an indicator at
the time of project completion of a value that had been taken from an ad-hoc source at the time of baseline.
2.     Actions to be taken at project completion:
The primary goal at project completion is to determine whether the impacts intended during project
preparation were accomplished and to judge whether the program should be expanded to a larger geographic
area. The most important step for this analysis is to measure the at-project-completion values for the same set of
indicators that were collected at the time of the baseline. These indicators are expected to summarize the current
standards of quality-of-care in health facilities (including the technical competence of the health providers, the
availability of needed diagnostic and treatment equipment and pharmaceuticals, etc.), the accessibility (in terms
of geography and economics) of high-quality care, etc.. As before, this information will be collected and
evaluated for both the two project regions and for 1-2 regions with comparable characteristics that did not have
the project interventions. The specific steps replicate those described for the baseline:
* Evaluation of any data that had been planned for or identified during project preparation;
* Evaluation of any ad hoc data already available for: (a) the two project regions, (b) "comparator regions"
that can be used as control groups (which will not receive the project interventions), and (c) for Tajikistan as
a whole.
* Repeat conduct of "situational analyses" (using this or a similar methodology) of health facilities in the two
project regions (and ideally, in a control region as well). The goal is to ascertain whether the adequacy of the
service installations and the quality of care provided to clients improved after the IDA-financed intervention.
* Conduct of focus groups, if planned for during project preparation.
o Identification and evaluation of any non-project factors that occurred in the project regions (and in the
control regions) that may have influenced the impact of the project;
* Studies to evaluate whether the project regions fared any differently than the control regions in terms of
project outputs;
* Technical review of whether the pilots are replicable in other parts of Tajikistan;
o Economic analysis to determine whether the expansion of the pilots is financially feasible.
Dissemination of Results:
Two Evaluation Reports will be produced. The first, which will highlight the results of the "before
project implementation" activities, will be submitted to IDA within six months of the project effectiveness date.
The final evaluation report, which will include all "at-project-completion" analyses will be submitted to the IDA
within six months of the project's completion date. This report will be utilized as a foundation for discussions on
whether the interventions of pilot project should be expanded beyond the two pilot regions.

5. Social:
As part of the project preparation work, a household survey was carried out, which included specific
health related questions. In addition, a provider survey was conducted which explored the opinions of those
directly involved in the provision of primary care services. Annex 4 describes some of the results of this survey
with regard to patient cost sharing, health care utilization and health status. As well, a detailed analysis of the
survey results, with specific emphasis on health related issues and including women's health issues, is being
prepared by the consultant engaged under the PHRD grant to assist in conducting the survey. Some of the
preliminary results indicate, for example, that 49 percent of the respondents in Dangara and 32 percent of the
respondents in Varzob rated their own level of poverty as Extremely or Very Poor, compared to 34 percent
nationally. In comparison, average household income was 11,433 Tajk Rubles per month in the overall national
sample, but 9,819 per month in Dangara and just 8,683 per month in Varzob. Between 70 and 80 percent of the
respondents (depending on location) were very concerned about their ability to provide basic necessities in the
next 12 months.
Nationally, just 14 percent of the population have a flush toilet, compared to 6 percent in Dangara, and I
percent in Varzob. Manure provides over 50 percent of the cooking or heating fuel for Dangara, while wood is
the primary energy sources in Varzob. Finally, over 80 percent of the respondents in Dangara reported having 2
or fewer meals per day, although the percentage was much lower both in Varzob (20 percent) and nationally (3 5
percent). Of the meals that were eaten, over 90 percent of the respondents reported eating no chicken, mutton,
lamb or other meats in the week before the survey, and less than 50 percent reported eating beef. These and
other important social indicators will be examined as part of the full analysis of the household survey.
As part of the evaluation plan for the project, this household survey (which was initially funded through
PHRD grant) will be repeated at end of project and the impact of the project will be assessed. Beyond this
survey work, the project is geared toward determining community investment priorities, consistent with primary
health care principles, as outlined in Section 7, below.
An integral part of the project design is an assessment of the community and health human resources
impact of closing health facilities, and the development of both public information and labor adjustment
strategies for dealing with this impact.
6. Environmental assessment:              Environment Category: C
Health projects of this kind are unlikely to have any adverse environmental effects. Category C was
confirmed at the Environmental and Social Consultation meeting, November 16, 1998.
7. Participatory Approach (key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced or may influence;
if participatory approach not used, describe why not applicable):

Local region administrations and health providers will be involved throughout the project in developing
health facility guidelines, and implementation/restructuring plans consistent with those guidelines. A committee
of key stakeholders will be established to provide advice and guidance to the PCU and the Ministry of Health,
generally in the development of these guidelines and plans.
Physician leaders, academic physicians, and practicing physicians in the pilot regions will all be
involved in the proposed Committee for Primary Care Training, which will be established to provide advice and
guidance to the PCU and the Ministry of Health, generally (in consultation with outside experts) in the selection
of disease protocols, the design of the syllabus and the training programs, and other elements related to the
physician training aspects of the project. As with the stakeholder committee, the creation of this committee,
including the terms of reference, was pursued during the appraisal mission, and has been set as a condition for
negotiations.
b. Other key stakeholders:
Strong linkages have been established between the project team and those for both the WHO and ADB
projects. Ongoing discussions have also been held with UNICEF and the Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation, as well as other NGOs. During the appraisal mission, the IDA team formalized the linkages
between these various organizations and the PIU, including the co-financing of the health financing component
with the Swiss, and the involvement of UNICEF in the development of an implementation plan for the "cold
chain" activities.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The long-term sustainability of the reforms introduced by this project depends upon:
*  adequate fiscal resources to maintain refurbished facilities and new equipment, and to ensure an
appropriate inventory of necessary drugs and other medical supplies
*  support by the community and local leaders of the changes in the revised patterns of practice and
standards of care provided by physicians and other health workers
*  the willingness of health professionals to undergo training and implement changes to the way
they practice medicine (change in role from "dispatchers" to "healers")
Section E. I describes the analysis that has been done to assess the sustainability of this
project and potential nation-wide implementation of the approaches described in the project.

FlI 4. The following items are lacking and are discussed under loan conditions (Section G):
The proposed project is the first IDA-funded project in the health sector in Tajikistan. In
October 1998, there was a preliminary mission to review the possibility of designing a LIL to support
reforms in the sector. A decision meeting was held in November 1998 to discuss the Project Concept
Document, and at that time it was decided that the project should proceed as a regular lending operation
rather than a LIL. There was a project preparation mission in March 1998. A Japanese (PHRD) grant
for $252,000 (executed by the TMOH) was signed in January 1999, and since then, consultants have been
assisting the Government in the following areas: social assessment/ household survey, provider survey
(including architectural survey)l, organizational analysis and development, procurement training and
support, financial management training and support. In addition, a further amount of about $100,000
has been provided by the Swiss Government through a trust fund agreement, and this money is being
used to continue with the provision of external assistance in a variety of areas, including further
development of the primary health care training component, and capacity building.

Annex 2: Project Description
TAJIKISTAN: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE
The proposed project would be implemented over three years. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$6.24 million, including contingencies. The project would be financed by an IDA Credit of US$5.4 million, $0.3
million from the Swiss Agency for Cooperation and Development and Government financing of about $0.54 million.
The project has four components, including two pilot regions, Varzob and Dangara which were selected based on
several factors: proximity to Dushanbe; openness to reform of local medical and municipal leadership; security; and
the presence of other projects by other development or relief agencies.
By Component:
Project Component I - US$1.00 million
I. PRIMARY HEALTH CARE DEVELOPMENT
This component would include the development of training programs and retraining of existing primary health
care doctors working within the two pilot regions, which would support implementation of the country's approved
primary health care policy at the service delivery level. The component would build on developments to date in
health training, and attempt to bring the skill levels of existing physicians working in primary care to a common,
basic level for a limited number of interventions reflecting the most common types of medical conditions. Key
aspects of the proposed training program include general practice decision-making, the use of essential drugs,
emergency medical care, guidelines for common medical problems, family planning, health promotion and practice
organization. In addition, owing to the relatively young age structure of the population, the Integrated Management
of Childhood Illness (IMCI) approach will be used to the extent possible. To this end, an IMCI team from
Copenhagen was due to be in Tajikistan in the middle of October, 1999, and the PIU was in contact with that group
to ensure that the IMCI approach is reflected in the primary care physician training. This approach is also included
in the Terms of Reference for consultants examining the training programs and clinical practice guidelines.
A Committee for Primary Care Training is being established to guide the overall reform process and ensure that
the proposed training programs address the specific needs of Tajikistan. It will also be responsible for overseeing
implementation of the staff re-training program. Committee membership would include representatives of the
Ministry of Health, the pilot regions, and the medical colleges and universities.
The component would include the following activities:
(1) Physician Retraining Program Development (US$157.3K). This activity would develop PHC
retraining programs for family physicians and other health professionals in collaboration with the
medical colleges and universities. The work would be undertaken by international consultants, with
specific expertise in primary health care, training and the ECA region, working closely with local
experts. The program would be designed to provide the greatest knowledge and exposure to primary
care philosophy and approaches with a reasonable training period. Course delivery would be through
small class sizes to ensure that the participants emerge with a thorough understanding of the primary care
approach and are able to utilize it in clinical settings. To this end, the development of clinical teaching
facilities will be an integral part of the overall component design. The program instructors will be local
teachers who have obtained additional instruction in primary care approaches, including study tours to
provide first-hand knowledge and experience in these approaches.
Inputs:      International expertise and local knowledge of specific conditions in
Tajikistan, local experts and trainers
Outcome:     A viable clinical training program for primary health care in Tajikistan.
Responsible Unit: MOH; together with Committee
- 37 -



(2) Disease Management Protocols and Treatment Guidelines (US$69.5K). The PHC training program
will include in-depth treatment of a limited number of key disease areas. These would include diseases
or conditions that are particularly prevalent in Tajikistan, and together represent a significant share of the
total burden of disease. This activity will develop specific disease management protocols and treatment
guidelines for these diseases/conditions, which are based on the best information available wor.ldwide,
but adapted to the specific setting (culture, facility capability, available resources, etc.) in Tajikistan and
will ensure that the proposed training addresses the specific circumstances in Tajikistan. Also as part of
the training program, this activity will address both the lack of available diagnostic equipment and the
relatively poor level of diagnostic decision-making for most physicians currently in Tajikistan. The
strategies developed under this activity will be tailored to the types of diagnostic equipment likely to be
available in the refurbished facilities, and will be designed to teach physicians to use this equipment,
together with improvec[ clinical judgement to enhance their overall diagnostic skills. Specific therapeutic
interventions will be covered in the disease management protocols.
Inputs:       International expertise together with local knowledge.
Outcome:      Viable disease management protocols and treatment guidelines that address the specific
needs of Tajikistan.
Responsible Unit: MOH, together with Committee
(3) Production of Teaching Materials (US$68.3K). Once the various training programs have been
elaborated, it is critical to ensure that teaching materials are developed that are suitable to the needs of
Tajikistan, and the instructor are trained on new teaching methods and content. Teaching materials will
have to be in Russian or Tajik, and should be culturally consistent and sensitive wherever possible. They
should also be relatively "low-tech" so they do not require sophisticated training environments to be used
effectively.
Inputs.       International expertise, results from previous components.
Outcome:      Suitable materials to complement the proposed training program
Responsible Unit: MO]H, together with Committee
(4) National Health Sector Human Resources Training Plan (US$126.OK). This activity would develop
an in-depth national training and retraining plan, including detailed undergraduate curriculum. The plan
would be developed in the final phase of the project, and will draw upon the lessons learned from the
above activities. This will include both a plan for extending the in-service training program to all parts of
Tajikistan, including the location of training facilities, timelines, numbers on physicians to be trained and
projected costs. In addition, a Plan will also be required for the training of new physicians in the regular
medical university system, and post-graduate training in primary care. This Plan would include expected
enrollments and the specific curriculum changes required to modify the existing university program to
include primary care concepts and approaches. Also included in this sub-component will an evaluation
of the training program under this loan so that the lessons learned from the first project can be reflected
in the nation-wide plan.
Inputs:       International consulting expertise, local knowledge and experience.
Outcome:      A viable strategy to expand the primary health care approach throughout
Tajikistan.
Responsible Unit: MO]I/PIU, together with Committee
(5) Standards for Family Health Centers (US$46.OK). To ensure compatibility between the training and
facility upgrading components, a needs assessment would be undertaken to determine essential facilities,
equipment and pharmaceutical supplies to support physicians and other personnel practicing using a
primary care approach. To ensure continuity between the training and the subsequent clinical practice,
- 38 -



standard specifications for the facilities, equipment and drugs will be developed, and these will be used
in the training programs, and supplied to the pilot regions through the second component of the project.
These activities need to complement those funded through Component 2A.
Inputs:       International expertise and local knowledge
Outcome:      Workable facility guidelines and equipment/supply lists for both primary care training
and facility redevelopment.
Responsible Unit: MOH/PIU, together with Committee and additional local input
(6) Upgrading Teaching Facilities (US$381.8K). This activity will include the translation of the equipment
specifications into the acquisition and purchase of this equipment, the development of architectural and
engineering drawings for the central and regional training facility refurbishment, and letting the contracts
for the actual refurbishment of these facilities. The upgrading for the central facility should include
provision for the attached ambulatory clinic where the "hands-on" practice will take place.
Inputs:       Renovation, equipping, and furnishing of training facilities
Outcome:      Functional and appropriately equipped national and regional training facilities conducive
to quality training
Responsible Unit: MOH/PIU
(7) Retraining of Physicians and Medical Personnel. (US$141.8K) A selected number of trainers and
support personnel will be recruited and trained in primary care methods and training approaches. These
individuals will likely already be faculty at university medical schools who have a demonstrated interest
in the area. Physicians, midwives, general nurses, and doctor's assistants would be retrained in the two
pilot regions. During the training program, replacement staff will be hired for the pilot regions through
the project, to ensure that the existing level of medical care is not diminished. The training courses will
include a mixture of training in the local regional training facilities, training at the central training
facility, and clinical practice at the clinic adjacent to the central training facility.
Inputs:       Training fees (all inclusive for participants); fees for replacement staff; consumable
supplies for clinical training
Outcome:      Retrained physicians and other medical staff
Responsible Unit: MOH/PLU
Project Component 2 - US$3.64 million
II. HEALTH FACILITIES RATIONALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT
This component involves developing and implementing health system development and service rationalization
plans in the two regions, in consultation with the local regional administration, service providers, and other
stakeholders.
A. Health Services Planning/Restructuring
(1) Pilot Region PHC Facility Plans (US$57.8K). The technical assistance provided through the PHRD
grant has provided initial estimates of facility requirements, and these have been included in the project
costing. This should be viewed as the upper end of what might be available as part of these guidelines.
This process would be managed through the Committee for Primary Care Training, with additional
representation from the pilot regions. Specific issues that need to be addressed include the appropriate
levels of facility and catchment population for each level, the services to be offered at each level of
facility, and the equipment, supplies and drugs required to provide these services. While a great deal of
this has been addressed through the PHRD project preparation activities, it is important to get general
agreement on these guidelines so that there is broad support for the strategy selected.
- 39 -



Inputs:       International expertise and local knowledge
Outcome:      Workable facility guidelines and equipment/supply lists for both primary
care training and facility redevelopment.
Responsible Unit: MOHRPIU, together with Committee and additional local input
(2) Public Information Strategy (US$105.OK). The change to a general practice based primary health care
model represents a significant departure from the current care delivery model. Strategies are required to
increase the acceptance of primary care approaches to health service delivery among the general public.
This activity would finance the development of such a strategy and assist the Ministry of Health and the
region administrations in implementing this strategy.
Inputs:       International expertise and local knowledge
Outcome:      Public knowledge and acceptance of the proposed changes in the
health system.
Responsible Unit: MOH/PIU
(3) Labor Adjustment Strategy (US$84.OK). Health services personnel would be displaced as a result of
facility rationalization and the change in facility roles. These changes will result in a need for existing
staff to find alternative employment, training opportunities and possibly in costs to the government in
severance payments. This activity would fund the development of an overall strategy to address these
issues in the pilot regions, and contribute to some of the costs incurred in this transition. A key output of
this activity will be the collection of comprehensive data on the actual costs.
Inputs:       International expertise, local knowledge of staff displaced as a result of facility
rationalization.
Outcome:      Overall strategy for dealing with labor adjustment, specific staff displacement in pilot
regions dealt with in a compassionate and humane manner.
Responsible Unit: MOH, PIU responsible for data collection
(4) Follow-up Surveys/Evalluation (US$126.0K). Evaluation is a key focus of this project. This activity
will provide funding to repeat the initial survey funded through the PHRD grant (both household and
provider surveys) to examine the changes generated as a result of the project and to provide an
evaluation of the project activities.
Inputs:       International expertise, local staff trained in survey methods as a result of
first survey.
Outcome:      Comparative survey data (before vs. after), and evaluation of the impact of the project.
Responsible Unit: MOH, PIU responsible for data collection
B. Pilot Region Infrastructure Development
(1) Refurbishment of Buildings (US$1,382.2K). This would include architectural and engineering
drawings, the preparation of the necessary tender documents, and letting the tenders for the 84 health
facilities in the two pilot regions. The experience of the TASIF will be utilized to the extent possible in
each of the facets of this activity. As noted above, the SUB or local community hospital appears to serve
no useful role as an inpatient facility, being too small to provide a core of services, and servicing too
small a population base to be a viable inpatient health care provider. It would be proposed that the
regional health facility rationalization plans consider eliminating this level of care and either closing the
facilities or changing their mandates toward outpatient care.

Inputs:       PHRD consultants reports on the current state of pilot region facilities
Outputs:     Appropriate number and distribution of facilities, rationalized and refurbished to a level
that allows retrained PHC physicians to practice in a manner consistent with their
training.
Responsible Unit: MOH/PIU
(2) Emergency Services Improvement (US$406.OK). Ambulance services have greatly deteriorated due to
several factors, mainly the lack of capital investments and the civil war which has left few ambulances
operating in a state of disrepair. This activity would provide limited funding to supply a minimal level of
ambulance services (1-2 ambulances per region, including basic equipment), as an integral part of the
overall primary health care services for regions. The potential for cost-effective improvements to the
communications system will also be investigated, and improvements will be made if possible.
Inputs.      International expertise, local conditions of ambulance service.
Outputs:     Basic level of ambulance service re-established in pilot regions.
Responsible Unit: MOH/PIU
(3) PHC Facilities Equipment and Supplies (US$853.7K). This activity would provide equipment,
supplies, and pharmaceuticals for the project PHC facilities. The sustainability of this funding is
addressed in the economic analysis of the project.
Inputs:       Equip 84 PHC facilities in the pilot regions (number may change depending on
disposition of SUB's).
Outputs:     PHC facilities in pilot regions provide PHC services that meet
international standards
Responsible Unit: MOH/PIU
(4) Vaccination Program (Cold Chain) (US$627.8K). Although funding was provided for this a number
of years ago through the support of intemational relief agencies, the combination of the ongoing conflict
(until fairly recently) and the limited availability of both spare parts and electricity have again raised this
as a substantive issue throughout Tajikistan. UNICEF and others feel that the efficacy of the substantial
amounts of donated vaccines distributed annually is significantly diminished through the lack of
maintenance of an efficient cold chain. As this is a major public health issue for Tajikistan, sufficient
funding has been provided to make significant improvements in the cold chain throughout the country,
including appropriate methods of refrigeration for vaccines from the time they initially arrive in the
country until they are injected into those being immunized. During the appraisal mission, the Ministry of
Health and UNICEF agreed to jointly develop an implementation strategy for this program, and will
participate in the implementation of this strategy.
Inputs:       Local knowledge of deficiencies in current cold chain, equipment provided to address
these deficiencies.
Outputs:      Efficient cold chain throughout Tajikistan, leading to maximum level of vaccine
effectiveness.

III. HEALTH CARE FINANCING SYSTSEM -- POPULATION-BASED FUNDING
This component would develop a methodology for funding health care at the regional level, using a capitation
system adjusted for age, gender and disease incidence, and testing this methodology in the pilot regions. The
methodology would, for this project, be designed for the regional level only, and would not be extended to the

provider payment level (physicians or hospitals/clinics). This component would also explore the appropriate services
zo be covered from the each budget source, including both capital and recurrent expenditures. The majority of the
-ubnds for this component will be provided by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.
This component was developed in more detail during the appraisal mission, based on discussions with the PIU,
-he WHO project group, staff from WHO Copenhagen, the consultant for the WHO (Robin Thompson) and the
-wiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. The current activities include:
(a) utilizing the work already done by the Ministry of Health, Abt Associates (Julian Simidjiski), and the
Ministry of Finance, and in consultation with consultants for the WHO (Robin Thompson) and the
Asian Development Bank'), develop an approach to provide the legal and administrative framework for
the implementation of population-based funding within the health system in Tajikistan;
(b) considering the factors normally used for population-based funding (age, gender, other population
demographics, health status or needs, and deprivation or socio-economic status), develop an initial
model for population-based funding of primary care services, for review by the Ministry of Health and
Finance, representatives of local governments, and various international aid and development agencies
interested in this area (World Bank, WHO, ADB, SDC). This model would consider the issue of an
appropriate client paymenic for primary care services, based on the result of the 1999 household survey
of living standards, and paying particular attention to the appropriate level of payment, if any, for the
lowest 20 percent of the income scale.
(c) for the year 2001 calendar year, develop indicative costs for the application of this funding approach to
primary care services, and compare these to the proposed budgets at the regional level. Based on this
comparison, develop an implementation plan which would move the funding of primary care services to
a population-based approach within a reasonable period of time. Inherent in this approach would be the
identification and costing of primary care services, as distinct from those for secondary and tertiary care.
Inputs:      International expertise, together with local knowledge
Outputs:     A workab:le strategy for introducing population-based funding to Tajikistan.

'V. CAPACITY BUILDING AND P:ROJECT MANAGEMENT
This component would strengthen the management and institutional capacity within the Ministry of Health and
se administration in the pilot regions and hospitals.
Health Sector Management Trainirng
(i) Staff Professional Development (US$235.9K). A key objective of this project would be the
improvement of the management capacity within the health system in Tajikistan. Following the training
program developed as part of the PHRD activities, staff at the central (PIU and Ministry of Health) and
local level (including the pilot regions and others) would be trained in management methods,
epidemiology, cost control, and other related issues.
Inputs.      Staff participation in short courses, workshops, and conferences.
Outputs:     Job performance improved for throughout the health system in the pilot regions and
elsewhere.

B. Health Management Information System
(i) Management Information Systems (US$278.3K). Computerization is virtually non-existent in the
health care system in Tajikistan, and the existing manual systems have largely broken down. The
purpose of this activity would be to establish a minimum level of health management information
systems, in accordance with the implementation plan for the component, including the development of a
training program in information systems.
Inputs:      Technical assistance, hardware, software, training.
Outputs:     Basic level of computerization for the Ministry of Health and the pilot regions.
Responsible Unit: MOH/PIU
C. Project Management (US$709.0K)
(1) Project Management. To prepare the project, a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) has been
established with PHRD financing. This PIU will continue to operate throughout project implementation,
The PIU would be headed by an executive director directly accountable to the Minister of Health. The
PIU would include an Executive Director; Office Manager; Procurement Specialist; and Accountant.
The Credit would finance technical assistance (national and international experts), equipment, and
operating costs of the PIU, including office accommodations.
(2) Project Accounting, Financial Management, and Audits. The PIU will maintain consolidated
accounts for the project and will ensure appropriate accounting of the funds provided. The PIU will be
responsible for preparing Project Management Reports (PMR) on a quarterly basis, and furnish to IDA
not later than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter, a PMR for such period, which: (i) sets forth
actual sources and application of funds for the project, both cumulatively and for the period covered by
the report, and projected sources and applications of funds for the project for the six-month period
following the period covered by the report; (ii) shows separately expenditures financed out of the
proceeds of the credit during the period covered by the report and expenditures proposed to be financed
out of the proceeds of the credit during the six-month period following the period covered by report; (iii)
describes physical progress in project implementation, both cumulatively and for the period covered by
the report, and explains variances between the actual and previously forecast implementation targets; and
(iv) sets forth the status of procurement under the project and expenditures under contracts financed out
of the proceeds of the credit, as at the end of the period covered by the report.
Inputs:      Technical Assistance, Hardware, Software, Training Operating Costs (materials and

Annex 4: Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
TAJIKISTAN: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE
It should be noted from the outset that despite the title of this Annex, what follows is not a cost-effectiveness
analysis, but rather an analysis of the potential sustainability of the proposed project and the significant health
finance and patient payment issues related to the health sector in Tajikistan.
As noted in Section B, public spending on health as a part of GDP is currently at a very low level. Within this,
the level of spending for primary health services is quite minimal. In most primary health facilities, funding is
provided only for salaries and social insurance costs. Drugs, medical supplies and other costs are either provided
through humanitarian assistance or through the patients themselves. The household survey that was completed
as part of the project preparation clearly shows the extent of the patient contribution to health expenditures,
estimated at between 80 and 90 percent of total costs in the pilot regions, and 70 percent nation-wide (the nation-
wide figure includes the cost of the tertiary and republican services).
The survey also shows that between one-third and one-half of those requiring primary health care did not obtain
care, and that a large proportion of those did not seek care due to financial reasons (approximately 40 percent).
This is clearly a major health care and economic issue, since many ailments that are left untreated may lead to
more serious illness, disability and death.
This project has developed an approach that utilizes adequately trained staff, a minimum but appropriate level of
equipment and facilities, and the necessary types and quantities of drugs and medical supplies to provide high
quality primary health services to all residents of the pilot regions. Although cost sharing has not been explicitly
built into the model at the outset, this will be addressed as part of Component C, the development of the
population-based funding approach for health services.
However, to asses the long-term sustainability of the approach being proposed in the absence of patient cost
sharing, the analysis below (Table I) was developed. At the present time, the overall level of health spending in
Tajikistan is approximately $2.50 per capita or 1.5 percent of GDP. However, within the pilot regions it is only
$0.82 per capita. The balance goes to various national programs and tertiary services. There is also a great deal
of variation in the per capita resources provided to various regions.
Health spending as a percent of GDP has been relatively stable over the last several years, as shown in the Table.
Projections by the IMF (IMF Policy Framework Paper, June 18, 1999),suggest real economic and population
growth increase by 6.5 and 1.5 percent respectively through the end of 2002, and inflation at 7.0 percent per
annum. Given this scenario, even a small increase in health spending to 1.6 percent of GDP, should increase
total health spending by almost $2.00 per capita to the end of 2003.
Based on the current distribution of public spending on health care, it is probably appropriate that all of the
increase be directed to primary care services. Thus, if $2.00 per capita was kept for national and tertiary
programs, the amount available for primary care services at the local level would increase to $2.42 per capita.
Although this would not be a huge amount, as the table shows, it would be sufficient to cover the full
incremental cost of the drugs and medical supplies required for the pilot regions ($231,000 from 2003 onwards).
Thus, even with the full coverage of these additional costs by the Ministry budget, it is clear that these costs
would be sustainable over the long run if long as total public funding for health services is brought up to a
minimum level. As noted above, this analysis does not even consider the potential for direct patient participation
in health financing but this will be addressed as part of Component C of the project.

Table 2 below is based on information from the household survey and highlights some of the key issues in this
area. The survey used was a standard LSMS survey, supplemented with additional questions regarding health
status, health care utilization, and out-of-pocket expenditures for health services. A standard sample size of
2,000 randomly selected households throughout Tajikistan was used, and this was supplemented by an additional
400 households in the pilot regions (Varzob and Dangara). The result was 282 households for Dangara and 166
for Varzob, for a total of 448 in the pilot regions, out of 2,400 nationally. Because of the high number of persons
- 46 -



per household (6.6 in Dangara, 8.1 in Varzob), this translated into 1,861 individuals in Dangara and 1,345 in
Varzob, a significant sample size.
The mean household income was significantly lower in both of the pilot regions than for Tajikistan as a whole
(14 percent lower in Dangara and 24 percent lower in Varzob), but expenditures were closer to national levels
(4.4 and  I percent lower respectively). This would tend to indicate a high level of dis-saving in both of the pilot
regions.
Health status in the pilot regions is also lower than average for the country, with 30 percent of those in Dangara
and 37 percent of those in Varzob rating their health status fair, poor, or very poor, compared to just 20 percent
nationally. On the other hand, medical care utilization was lower in both Dangara and Varzob in the two weeks
prior to the survey, compared to the national average. Approximately 36-38 percent of those seeking care
reported paying official charges or gifts for their treatment. The overall annual cost of these payments is
estimated at TR 475 million for the two pilot regions or almost TR 3200 (US$2.0) per capita based on today's
exchange rates.
For hospital services the situation is quite similar. What is striking here is the range and extent of patient
payment: over 96 percent of patients purchase medicines, 70 percent provide food, 30 percent provide other
supplies. Taking into account the mean payment and the prevalence of these payments, it is estimated that over
TR 500 million is paid by the population of the pilot regions for hospital services. Approximately one half of
this total is estimated to be paid to hospitals in the pilot region, while the balance is for hospitals in other regions,
including republican facilities. This is especially prevalent in Varzob, owing to the limited facilities they have
available and their proximity to Dushanbe.
Drugs, both prescription and non-prescription, account for another TR 67 million per year, bringing the total out-
of-pocket payments to over TR 1 billion per year. This accounts for around 4 percent of household expenditure
for the two pilot regions, and 6 percent of household income. The national figures are 5 and 7 percent
respectively, indicating that people in the two pilot regions are better off than the population generally.
The implication is that five-sixths of all health related spending in the two pilot regions is paid directly by the
patients themselves (81 percent in Dangara and 90 percent in Varzob). This analysis clearly highlights the need
for the health financing component of the project to ensure equity in the assessment and payment of these costs,
and provides some insights into the issues and concerns that need to be addressed in that component. This
includes appropriate levels of cost sharing, equitable distribution of cost sharing among individuals across
different income groups, and the need to set specific limits for individual patient charges, rather than the laissez-
faire approach that seems to be used at the present time, which tends to promote inconsistency and corruption.
Another issue arising from this analysis is the true income levels of health professionals in the pilot regions.
Recognizing the truism that "total health expenditures equal total health incomes", it is clear that staff in the pilot
regions are receiving incomes far in excess of the US $2.00 per month they receive from the state budget. The
last section in the table estimates the additional income from patient payments at between US $208 and $457 if
the payments made directly to providers (as opposed to those for food, medicines or supplies), are divided
equally among all staff, and between $343 and $718 if these payments are divided only among professional staff.
The true answer is likely somewhere within this range. It is interesting to note that the average payment in
Varzob appears to be higher than that in Dangara, mostly as a result of the lower staffing levels and higher
vacancies in Varzob. These results open up some interesting issues with regard to civil service reform and
potential changes in average wage levels for government workers.

Summary of benefits and costs:
Significant project benefits will accrue to the residents of the pilot regions, since they will have access to high-
quality, affordable primary health services utilizing the latest in proven health care diagnostic and treatment
methods. While the level of technology will still be fairly low, it will have improved significantly over the
current situation, and should be effective in dealing with the current disease patterns. Beyond this, the health
care providers will benefit from having high quality training, equipment and supplies available to treat and care
for their patients. This will reduce the frustration that is currently felt due to the unavailability of necessary tools
and techniques to adequately treat disease. Finally, the entire country should benefit from the improvements in
the cold chain, which will make the current immunization programs much more effective, and the redesign of the
health financing system, which should ensure that the available funds are appropriately distributed to the
population, and should address the high level of out-of-pocket costs currently paid by patients.
Beyond the costs of the project, the ongoing operating costs for the two pilot regions are around $23 1,000
annually. Section E. I and E.2, as well as the analysrs provided in this Annex, address the sustainability of this
amount. Annex 5 also provides more detail on project costs.

Main Assumptions:
*   The project becomes effective during June, 2000
*   Project expenditures are costed over a four-year period, including approximately 9 months of PPF funding.
The bulk of the expenditures should be completed by June 30, 2003, with a proposed Loan Closing date of
December 31, 2003.
*   Donor financing would be secured and sustained
*   Government contribution to ongoing operating costs are on a sliding scale (20%  for the first $50,000 of IDA
contribution, 55% for the next $83,000 and 75% for everything beyond $83,000), to allow the government to
gradually assume the burden of these ongoing costs. The economic analysis (Annex 4) discussed the
feasibility and long-term sustainability of this approach.

Annex 6: Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
1TAJIKISTAN: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE
Procurement
Civil works and goods under the IDA financed components of this project will be procured in accordance with
the Bank's Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credit published in January 1995 including all
revisions up to January 1999. Contracts for Consulting Services required for the Project will be awarded following
the World Bank Guidelines "Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated January
1997, revised in September 1997 aind January 1999. The project elements, their estimated cost and procurement
methods, are summarized in Table A. Other procurement information, including capability of the implementing
agency, estimated dates for publication of GNP and the Bank's review process is presented in Tables B and C.
1. Goods
Goods (approximately US$1.99 million) consisting of equipment for health care training and for CRH, SVA and
Medical Houses under facility redevelopment/rationalization, drugs for Medical Houses and SVA, "cold chain"
equipment and computers with software for PIU will be grouped to the extent possible and considering project
objectives, in packages sizes that will encourage competitive bidding. The following methods of procurement will
be followed:
(i) International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures will be used for contracts above US$100,000
equivalent for a total amount of US$1.01 million for the procurement of computers and office
equipment, equipmenl for ambulance services and the related radio system, and "cold chain" equipment.
(ii) International Shopping (IS). These procedures will be used for the purchase of equipment for teaching
equipment and equipment for public information center, medical equipment for SES, vehicles for
regional construction supervisors and PIU, as well as PIU office equipment and furniture, estimated to
cost less than US$100,000 per contract for an aggregated amount of US$0.30 million.
(iii)National Shopping (NS). These procedures will be used for contracts up to US$15,000 equivalent to an
aggregate of US$0.17 million, for the purchase consumable and supplies.
(iv) Direct Contracting (])C). Service delivery contract(s), for spare parts and maintenance service for
ambulances, not to exceed US$0.06 million in the aggregate, subject to the approval of the Association
on a case-by-case basis, may be awarded after direct negotiations with only one available service dealer
in the country, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association.

- 54 -



written invitation, with the contract awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. The selection of the short-listed bidders
should be based on an advertisement in the local newspapers and in accordance with satisfactory qualification and
experience. Bank's Regional SBDs and Evaluation forms will be used.
3. Selection Procedures for Consulting Services
Contracts for Consulting Services will be packaged to combine related skills and services, in order to make them
attractive and increase competition as well as to reduce the number of contracts to be managed by the PIU. The
following methods of procurement will be followed:
(i) Quality and Cost-based Selection (QCBS) procedures will be used for contracting consultant services
relating to the review of draft treatment protocols and standards for equipment and drugs, as well as
health sector management training, totally up to an aggregate amount of US$0.47 million.
(ii) Consultant Qualification procedures will be used for contracting architechtural & engineering for an
aggregated amount of US$0.07 million.
(iii)Least Cost Selection procedures will be used for auditing services contracts less than or equal to the
amount of US$60,000 for three years.
(iv) Individual Consultants will be hired in accordance with Section V of the Guidelines. Individual
consultants will be used for small assignments of short term duration such as studies, development of
strategy and plan, supervisors, and follow-up survey and evaluation for an aggregate amount of US$0.3
million. Consultants will be selected based on individual's qualification and with Bank's prior approval.
(v) Single source procedures will be used for study tours, training and others, for an aggregated amount of
US$0.46 million.
4. Operating Costs
Office materials and supplies, communications, and office space rent and the salaries of the Project
Implementation Unit (PIU) staff would be financed under the Credit for the duration of the project (UD$0.41
million).
5. Notification of Business Opportunities
A General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be published in the "Development Business" around the period of
Loan Negotiations and will be annually updated. For Iarge-value consultants contracts, invitation for bids will be
advertised in the Development Business and national gazette, and in the case of NCB, in a major local news paper (in
the national language).
6. Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
Scheduling of Procurement. Procurement of goods and services for the project will be carried out in
accordance with the agreed procurement plan (Table B), which will be updated if necessary and included in the
progress reports for Bank review.
- 55 -



Prior Review
(a) Goods: Prior review of bidding documents, including review of evaluation, recommendation of award and
contract will be conducted for all ICB procedures; and the first two contracts for International Shopping
contracts regardless of their value.
(b) Civil worAs: The first NCB contract and the first minor works contract will be prior-reviewed.
(c) Consulting Services: Terms of reference for all consulting assignments will be subject to prior Bank review.
Request for Proposal (RFP), short lists, terms of condition of contracts as well as evaluation reports and
recommendation for award will be prior reviewed by the Bank for contracts for individual consultants above
US$20,000 and firms above $50,000. All documents and recommendations involving sole source contracting
will be subject to Bank prior review.
After award of contracts, should any material modifications or waiver of terms and conditions of a contract
resulting in an increase or decrease above 15 percent of the original amount, the Bank will reserve the right to prior
review of such modifications (including modifications to contracts for consulting services).
7. Custom Duties and Taxes
It is understood that all goods specifically imported for the project will be exempt from custom duties and taxes.
Foreign technical assistance specialists will be exempt from the Government's normal personal income tax.
8. Action Plan for strengtheninig Agency's Capacity to Implement Project Procurement
It is recommended that the following actions be taken to strengthen the procurement capacity of
the PIU:
(i) Under a TA arrangement, an expatriate procurement specialist has already been
contracted for a period of sKix months or until all the bidding documents are ready to be
released. The contractual arrangements could be made in such a manner that the foreign TA
will not be in Dushanbe for the entire period of the six months at one stretch, but rather spread
out at interval where his/her services would be available during crucial periods of the
procurement cycle. The role of the TA would be to provide on the job training to the
procurement officer/specialist as well as to assist the PIU in preparing the bidding documents
according to Bank guideline and on schedule.
(ii) The procurement staff consisting of a full time procurement specialist and a part time
medical specialist, will be given the opportunity to attend intensive procurement training, by
the end of 1999, such as the one offered in Turin or International Law Institute.
(iii) The project should be subject to the intensified supervision by the Bank. During the first
year of project implementation, there will be at least two supervisions.

Additional Annex No.: 11
Financial Management
TAJIKISTAN: PRIMARY HEALTH CARE
General:
A review of Financial Management System was undertaken to (a) review the presence of the
necessary elements for sound project financial management system such as internal controls, project
accounting, project staffing and audit arrangements; and (b) assess the project's capacity and readiness
for the implementation of LACI.
Project Management and Coordination and Staffing:
The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be directly responsible for financial management
during project life. The MOH (through its Project Working Group, and more recently its PIU) has to
date been responsible for managing the PHRD grant of US$252,000.
The PIU has recruited a full time chief financial officer who has been provided with training by a
foreign consultant under PHRD grant and with TORs satisfactory to IDA. The CFO is responsible for
financial management and control under the PHRD and the project itself and would report to the PIU
Executive Director. Technical assistance is being made available to the PIU in project and financial
management under the PPF and during the first year of project implementation. This would include
training workshops for the PIU and project coordination staff at the local level. In addition, the MOH
and project team will attempt to mobilize additional grant funding from other sources to provide either
ongoing or short-term accounting and financial management expertise within the PIU. To ensure the
appropriate segregation of duties, a second financial officer has also been hired.
The overall budget for the PIU will be approximately $560,000 over the term of the project, of
which the equipment budget will be around $43,000, in addition to the $25,000 that has been allocated
under the PHRD grant. These allocations cover the entire period of project implementation, including
the period of the proposed Project Preparation Facility (PPF). The PIU has received three computers
and other basic office equipment (printer, fax, copier) out of PHRD funds.
Accounting:
A project financial and accounting program has been developed, with support from a contracted
financial management expert, who is currently providing assistance to various PIUs in Tajikistan. Given
the project size and the needs for project oversight and preparation of project documentation such as
PMRs, this will be kept as sdimple as possible. The system as establishes has, inter alia, an accounting
and internal control system with the capacity to record and retrieve in a timely manner, all financial
transactions under the project. The system: (a) records and reports all assets, liabilities, and financial
transactions of the project; and (b) provides reliable financial information for managing and monitoring
project activities. The accoumting system (chart of accounts) is classified by component and category of
expenditure, and is able to capture data by sub-component at the level of individual facilities. It also
reflects the sources of funds Furthermore, it provides information on the receipt and use of funds and is
able to produce financial reports comparing budget with actual expenditures at any given time. The
- 72 -



system as established is capable of providing financial data to measure performance when linked to the
outputs of the project.
Financial Reporting:
Although an acceptable financial management system has been established, disbursements will
start using traditional disbursements methods -- SOEs reimbursements, direct payments, etc. After the
PIU has gained experience with the financial management system and reporting under project
management reports (PMRs), and provided that the financial management system is reviewed and found
capable of handling it, the project will move to PMR-based disbursements. The PIU will maintain
accounts for the Project and will be responsible for preparing Project Management Reports (PMR -- see
Annex 9 of the Project Financial Management Manual) on a quarterly basis, and furnish to IDA not later
than 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter, a PMR for such period, which:
(a) (i) sets forth actual sources and application of funds for the project, both cumulatively and for
the period covered by said report, and projected sources and applications of funds for the project for the
six-month period following the period covered by said report and (ii) shows separately expenditures
financed out of the proceeds of the credit during the period covered by said report and expenditures
proposed to be financed out of the proceeds of the credit during the six-month period following the
period covered by said report;
(b) (i) describes physical progress in project implementation, both cumulatively and for the
period covered by said report, and (ii) explains variances between the actual and previously forecast
implementation targets; and
(c) sets forth the status of procurement under the project and expenditures under contracts
financed out of the proceeds of the credit, as at the end of the period covered by said report.
Project Implementation Manual (PIM):
The Project Implementation Manual (PIM) was discussed during the appraisal mission and again
during negotiations, and should be finalized before effectiveness. It will include the financial
management policy and procedures manual developed during the course of establishing the financial
management system. This manual includes (a) special emphasis on accounting and auditing policies,
standards and internal controls; (b) the role of the financial management systems in project management
and implementation; (c) the accounting arrangements required for project management, the format for
and content of project financial reporting; and (d) the auditing arrangements that will be used during
project implementation.
A uditing:
The PIU will be responsible for ensuring that the financial statement, Special Account, and SOEs
are audited by an independent auditor, acceptable to IDA, in accordance with standards on auditing that
are acceptable to IDA. The annual audit will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines for
Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World Bank (March 1982). The audit
report shall be in a format in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing promulgated by
the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). The audit report will include a separate opinion for
- 73 -



SOEs against which disbursements have been made or are due to be made from the Credit and SOEs
which will be included in the audit report accompanying the financial statements.
The audited financial statements of the special accounts, and SOEs of the preceding fiscal year,
including a separate opinion by the auditor on disbursements made against certified statement of
expenditures, will be sent to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
The audit of the financial statement will include: (a) an assessment of the adequacy of
accounting and internal control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and
ensure safe custody of project-financed assets; (b) a determination as to whether the project
implementing entities have rnaintained adequate documentation on all relevant transactions; and (c)
verification that expenditures submitted to IDA are eligible for financing, and identification of any
ineligible expenditures.
The estimated overall budget for auditing under the project would be around $58,000, which appears to
be reasonable, given the size of the project. Auditing services would be procured on a least-cost basis,
and packaged as a recurring audit, with no requirement for a new engagement letter, except in the
special circumstances. The PIU has already prepared terms of reference and a short list for the audit of
the PHRD funds, these have received No Objection from IDA, and the bidding process has commenced.
Bank FMS staffing and supervision:
The project was reviewed in detail by Bank FMS during appraisal in September 1999, and the
financial management system was reviewed again during a special mission in January, 2000. It is
recommended by the FMS ihat the country environment and implementing agency capacity suggest that
the project not use on PMR-based disbursement at this time. An international financial specialist, who
has been working with several other PIU's in Tajikistan, was also been engaged for this project to assist
with project preparation and the development of the FM system. During project life, an FMS will take
part in supervision missions to monitor the FM of the PIU and ensure compliance with ongoing FM
covenants.
Special Account:
To facilitate timely project implementation, the Government has established, and will maintain
and operate, under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account, denominated in US
Dollars. The minimum amount of the application should be 20 percent of the authorized allocation. The
replenishment applications should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled
bank statements as well as other appropriate supporting documents. A conversion account (USD to
Tajik Rubles) may also be established, as well as separate accounts for Government contributions (USD
and conversion) and other co-financiers.
The Government will be responsible for the appropriate accounting of the funds provided by the
IDA under the Credit, for reporting on the use of these fimds, and for ensuring that audits of the
financial statements or reports are submitted to IDA. A computerized accounting system is being
established at the PIU. Once trained, the Accountants at the PIU would maintain and prepare quarterly
financial reports as part of Project Management Reports.
- 74 -



Accounting software and assessment of Y2K risks:
The accounting and financial consultant retained by under the PHRD grant and the finance staff
have implemented the Tally accounting software system in the other PIUs in which he is working.
Having a number of PlUs in Tajikistan having the same software should provide a nucleus of staff in
Dushanbe who are conversant with the software and capable of supporting each other. Neither
hardware or software purchased under the PHRD grant displayed Y2K compatibility problems.
Conclusion:
Significant progress has been made on the project financial management system and related
documentation, and it now fully satisfies IDA's minimum financial management requirements.
