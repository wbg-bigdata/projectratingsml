T. TILE ECONOMIC SETTING
Introduction
1.01      Peru, the 5ourth largest country in Latin America, has a total
area of 1,280,000 km , divided by the Andes Mountains into three regions
with extreme topographic and climatic contrasts. Along the 3,000 km of
the Pacific coastline, there is a narrow strip of flat and dry land (the
Costa) covering only 11% of the country's total area but containing the
major cities and nearly half of the total population. The Andean Highlands
(the Sierra), above 2,000 meters, cover 26% of the country, are composed of
steep mountain slopes and high valleys, and account for 44% of the country's
population.   East of the Sierra are vast tropical lowlands (the Selva),
covering the remaining 63% of the country but containing only 10% of the
population. The rugged topography limits trade and integration between the
three regions of Peru, and modern economic activity has concentrated in the
Costa. Thus, the main coastal cities account for well over 80% of industrial
activity and commercial bank credit, with the bulk of it concentrated in Lima.
1.02      The natural resource base holds both major opportunities and
constraints to Peru's future development. Vast mineral resources are the
largest asset, and mining will remain the backbone of the economy as a source
of savings and foreign exchange, although it provides little direct employment
and may have, for a period of time, few linkages with the rest of the economy.
A potential resource constraint is the scarcity and poor quality of agricul-
tural lands. The population pressure on agricultural land is high, and the
only new lands that could be brought into production are limited areas in the
upper Selva and, with extensive irrigation and drainage, some valleys in the
Costa. Energy is also a potential constraint. With the current proven oil
reserves the country might become a net oil importer by 1985 if Peru's esti-
mated high probable oil reserves are not explored rapidly and brought into
production. A third potential natural resource problem is water, as the long
term needs of the area west of the Andes will require water transfers from
the eastern side of the mountains at a very high cost.
1.03      As a result of three decades of rapidly falling mortality rates,
Peru's population growth accelerated during the 1930-1960 period. In the
early 1960s, however, birth rates started a gradual fall, mainly caused by
the urbanization process and by improved education. But with declining death
rates, population has continued to grow at about 2.7% p. a., and is currently
estimated at about 17 million. It is expected that population growth will
fall only slightly to about 2.6% p. a., over the next 20 years, unless an
effective demographic policy is adopted. The urban population is increasing
rapidly at 4.5% p. a., and over 4 million people are concentrated in Lima.
Given the structure of Peru's population, the labor force is expected to
grow in excess of 3% per year during the next 20 years.
Major Economic Activities
1.04      During the past 12 years, the Peruvian economy has gone through a
period of rapid growth fueled by expansionary fiscal and credit policies
(1968 to 1976), a serious financial and balance of payments crisis followedl



- 2 -
by a recessionary period (1977 to 1979), and the incipient stages of an
economic recovery (started in late 1979). The cyclical nature of the
economic activity during the 1970s is reflected in the growth of GDP, which
averaged 4.3% p. a. during the 1968-1976 period, dropping to minus 0.3% p. a.
in 1977-78, and recovering to 3.4% p.a. in 1979-80. The sectoral distribution
of economic activity changed substantially during the 1960s and early 1970s
and stabilized after 1976 except for a continuing increase in the share of
mining. At present, the largest contribution to GDP is that of manufacturing,
accounting for about 27% of the total, followed by the commercial sector with
16%, mining (incl. petroleum) with 14%, and agriculture (incl. fishing) with
8%. With slow economic growth and a rapidly growing population (2.7% p. a.),
the country's per capita income virtually stagnated during the late 1970s and
was US$930 in 1980 as compared to US$910 in 1970 (at constant 1980 prices).
The recent economic crisis and the high rate of growth of population have
worsened a traditionally serious unemployment problem, and it is estimated
that 11% of the non-agricultural labor force is currently unemployed and 44%
under-employed. 1/
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR AND SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISE
Background
2.01      After a decrease in industrial output and investment during 1977 and
1978, industrial production recovered slightly (4.1%) in 1979 and grew more
strongly (5.9%) in 1980. Although the most recent sectoral data available
does not lend itself easily to a separate analysis of small versus medium and
large enterprises, it appears that the SSE sector is participating fully in
the current upward trend in economic activity. The recent recovery of the
industrial sector, however, has not yet changed a situation of very low levels
of industrial employment. While manufacturing contributes an estimated 27% of
the country's GDP, total employment in the formal manufacturing sector (firms
with five or more employees registered with the Ministry of Industry) amounts
to about 270,000 jobs, only 5-6% of total employment. Adding an estimated
equal number of jobs in the informal sector, the total contribution to employ-
ment remains in the 10-12% range.
Industrial and Trade Policies
2.02      Prior to 1978 Peru followed the import substitution approach to
industrial development providing high tariff protection -- supplemented by
import prohibitions for a large number of products - generous fiscal incen-
tives, and credit on relatively favorable conditions. Although export
incentives in the form of negotiable export tax credit certificates (CERTEX)
were introduced on a small scale in 1970, industrial development was inward-
oriented and manufactured exports were relatively minor, amounting to some
US$75 million in 1975 or roughly one percent of industrial output. Up to
1/   Earning less than the minimum wage or working less than 35 hours a
week and wishing to work more.



- 3-
1973, tariffs increased steadily. During 1973-79, they remained essentially
unchanged, but were gradually eroded through widespread exemptions and the
overvaluation of the sol during 1968-75/76. Beginning in 1970, tariffs were
gradually replaced by non-tariff barriers including import licensing, pro-
hibitions, state monopolies, and, in particular, the National Register of
Manufactures (RNM). The RNM consisted of a list of industries that was
maintained by the Direction of Industry within the Ministry of Industry
(MITI). Imports competing with goods produced by industries on the RNM were
banned. Out of the 4,600 items in the customs classification, about 40
percent were subject to non-tariff barriers in 1973, and this share had grown
to about 60 percent by early 1979 (inciuding about 1,400 items in the RNM).
V           2.03      A major reorientation of industrial policies took place in connec-
tion with the 1978 Economic Recovery Program, which was supported by a Bank
Program Loan. The complex system of non-tariff protection was dismantled and
replaced by a new tariff system. In addition, more vigorous export promotion
efforts were undertaken along with a more flexible exchange rate policy, which
complemented an increase--introduced in 1976--in CERTEX. The first important
liberalization measures were introduced in March 1979, when the RNM was
abolished and replaced by a greatly reduced temporary list of import prohibi-
tions, which by now have virtually disappeared. The new tariff structure
became effective in December 1979. These policy changes, together with fall-
ing domestic demand in the late seventies, resulted in an important reorienta-
tion of industrial development, with the value of manufactured exports increas-
ing from about US$100 million in 1976 (equivalent to 1.6 percent of industrial
output) to almost US$800 million in 1980 (equivalent to about 8 percent of
output). Textiles and fish products accounted for most of this increase.
2.04      The new Government has accelerated the import liberalization process
by further eliminating administrative barriers (including the whole system of
import licensing) and by reducing tariffs. At present, the unweighted average
of tariffs is close to 30 percent, with the maximum tariff at 60 percent.
The Government is committed to reduce tariffs further over a period of three
to five years through successive, pre-announced cuts and to make the tariff
structure more uniform. The Government revised the CERTEX system in February
1981 to make it more responsive to the goal of industrial development and
growth of manufactured exports and to correct abuses which have crept into
its use. Moreover, the devaluation process is kept about in line with the
differential between domestic and international inflation. The continuation
of these policies, together with the general process of decontrol, should
provide the appropriate framework for sustained growth of industrial invest-
ment, production and exports.
2.05      Small industry is expected to participate vigorously in Peru's
economic and industrial growth. Preliminary indications are that small indus-
try has benefited from the new import liberalization process. It is now able
to purchase many imported raw materials and intermediate goods at lower prices
than those that persisted when local manufacturing was practically the only
source of supply. Also, because small industry is more labor intensive than
larger firms, it has been more able to respond to changing market forces to
remain competitive. The proposed project would provide term resources that
would help small industry further adapt to the new industrial and trade
policies.

Structure of Manufacturing 1/
2.06      Performance and Structural Features:  By the end of the 1970s, the
manufacturing sector accounted for roughly one-fourth of Peru's GDP. Growth
of the sector during the past decade largely depended on the domestic market
and was subject to large fluctuations, which mirrored those of the whole economy.
During 1969-74, sectoral production grew at an average annual rate of 6.6% in
real terms, well above GDP growth of 4.8%. During 1975-76, sectoral growth
slowed down to about 4% per year and during 1977-78, because of the economic
crisis referred to in Part I of this report, it dropped to a negative 4%.
During 1979-80, as the economy rebounded, the sector resumed growth at
annual rates of about 4% and 6%, respectively.  Industrial investment fluc-
tuated widely during the 1970s, doubling during 1971-75 and then dropping by
1978 to 25% below its 1975 peak. Investment in manufacturing came largely
from public enterprises.
2.07      The manufacturing sector in Peru is diversified.  Industrial policies
pursued during the past decade led to a strong expansion of intermediate goods'
industries such as textiles and chemicals. In 1978, traditional consumer goods'
industries (food, beverages, and tobacco; clothing and footwear; furniture;
and others) accounted for about 40% of manufacturing industry value added, the
chemical and related industries (including petroleum refineries) accounted for
another 30%, and metal processing industries for some 15%. Manufacturing is
heavily concentrated in the Lima-Callao area, by far Peru's largest market. The
Lima area accounts for about 70% of the number of firms, employment, and output.
Other industrial centers of importance are Arequipa in the south as well as
Trujillo, Chimbote, and Piura in the north. With the exception of Arequipa
and Trujillo, industries outside the Lima-Callao area mainly process locally
available raw materials such as sugarcane, bagasse, cotton, fish, and others.
2.08      While the private sector accounts for over 90% of the number of
industrial firms and for about two thirds of output and employment, the state's
role in manufacturing is substantial. State-owned enterprises accounted for
one-third of output in 1978, mostly in tobacco, paper, petroleum refining,
cement, iron and steel, and non-ferrous metals. The new Government is firmly
committed to promoting the private sector, including foreign investment. It
is also considering divesting itself of some Government owned industrial
investments. Its general policy of decontrol is expected to result in the
further revival of private investment, which started to pick up in 1979, and
in a lessening of direct government involvement in the industrial sector.
Small Scale Enterprise
2.09      Definition.  Small scale enterprises are legally 2/ defined in Peru
to include firms engaged in industrial, tourist services and commercial
1/   A more detailed review of the manufacturing sector, covering also indus-
trial and trade policy is included in the SAR for the Second Industrial
Credit Project for Peru (Report No. 3238-PE dated March 12, 1981).
2/   Law of Small Enterprises (D.C. 21435) of February 24, 1976.  A new law
approved by the previous Government in July 1980 has not been put into
effect. The present Government has prepared a draft industrial law
including a section dealing with small scale industry.



activities, as well as fishing, forestry, and mining operations. Small
industrial firms (the most important type of SSE in terms of employment and
contribution to GDP) are defined as private sector industrial enterprises with
annual sales of up to 590 minimum legal wages (about S/. 191 million or
US$500,000 equivalent in mid-1981). The legal definition is used by the
Ministry of Industry (MITI) solely for purposes of application of the labor
and incentive legislation, whereas most statistical data available classify
industrial enterprises by size, according to the number of employees. Also,
Banco Industrial del Peru (BIP), the main financial institution currently
providing resources to SSE, uses a composite definition, including total
assets (up to 295 minimum legal wages or about US$250,000), annual sales (up
to 590 minimum legal wages or about US$500,000), and number of employees (up
to 50).
2.10      A review of the most recent year for which reliable industrial
census data is available (1975) shows that the legal definition above covers
virtually all enterprises with less than 20 employees, plus a a large number
of firms in the group with 20 to 49 employees. Also, the 1975 data (covering
only firms with five employees or more) show that small industrial enterprises
accounted for 87% of the total number of manufacturing establishments, 33.5%
of total employment in the formal manufacturing sector, and 22% of value
added. In addition to the industrial census data, the information used in
this report has been complemented with data from the SSE Registry established
after 1976, which contains a total of about 8,000 firms in the Lima-Callao
area, and from a survey conducted in late 1980, of 248 small firms located
also in the Lima area and selected randomly from the Registry (ESAN Survey).
The Registry data show that about 74% of the enterprises had less than five
employees, and an additional 20% had between five and ten employees. Firms
with more than 30 employees were less than 1% of the total. Thus, the data
from the Registry and the ESAN Survey cover the smaller end of the range and
complement the 1975 census data.
2.11      Size and Number of Firms.  In 1975, Peru had a total of 7,500 formal
industrial enterprises with five or more employees and an estimated 25,000
unregistered "cottage industries," mostly with less than five employees but
sometimes exceeding this figure. By 1980, the number of formal industrial
enterprises had increased to 10,000, of which about 75% were estimated to meet
the legal definition of SSE. In addition, registered and unregistered firms
with less than five employees plus other informal sector firms, are likely to
exceed 30,000.  Thus, the total number of small industrial enterprises
(including some services such as mechanical repairs) is estimated to be close
to 40,000. In addition, there is a large number of purely commercial firms
that also qualify as SSE.
2.12      Most Peruvian industrial enterprises are small.  Two-thirds of the
about 10,000 registered industrial establishments have less than 30 workers;
and in 1975, there were less than 500 firms with more than 1,000 workers.
Data for the nearly 8,000 firms in the SSE Registry indicate that average
employment per firm was between four and five employees, and the ESAN Survey
shows an average of about six full-time employees and an additional two to
three part-time employees. The second set of data is likely to be more repre-
sentative, as it reflects the actual situation as of late 1980, whereas the



- 6 -
Registry data covers a period of four years and reflects only the expectations
of enterprises at the time of registration.
2.13      Output and Employment.  Assuming that non-registered SSE may be some-
what smaller on average than registered ones, the average employment per firm,
including full and part time employment, is estimated at about six jobs. Thus,
small-scale industrial enterprises currently provide an estimated 240,000 jobs,
about one-half of total    industrial employment and one-third of value added.
Small scale industry   production is concentrated in consumer goods mainly in
the lower price and quality ranges, with processed foods, textile, and clothing
products accounting for more than 52% of the total number of firms, followed
by metal products (19%).
2.14      Small-scale enterprises have generally a spatially limited market.
The ESAN Survey shows that 75% of the enterprises in the Lima area sell most
or all their output in the Lima market, with only less than 20% selling signi-
ficant amounts in the rest of the country. A total of 10 firms in the sample
(4%) entered the export markets, with 4 firms selling most of their output
abroad. Most of the small firms in the sample sold directly to the public
and/or to commercial enterprises, and only 11% sold to other industrial firms.
2.15      The firms included in the ESAN Survey reported average sales of
about S/. 10.3 million in 1980 (about US$35,000). With a reported average
investment of V/. 8.02 million (para. 2.19 below), the firms show a very low
output/fixed assets ratio of 1.3. Even assuming a very high percentage of
value added in the firms' output, the corresponding value added/fixed assets
ratio would be well below the level shown by the 1975 data on the smallest
group included in the census (para. 2.16 below). This probably reflects a
lower value of the ratio for the smaller firms (in the ESAN Survey) but also
the relatively depressed conditions prevailing in 1980 in contrast to the high
level of economic activity prevailing in 1975.
2.16      Investment and Productivity.  There is a strong positive relation-
ship between labor productivity and size of firm for the Peruvian manufacturing
sector as a whole (Table 2.1). Value added per employee in the largest size
group of enterprises (1,000 or more employees) is nearly four times higher
than in the smallest size group (five to nine employees). Also, fixed assets
per employee (average investment cost per job) in the largest size group are
more than three times higher than the smallest group, indicating that higher
labor productivity is at least partly the result of higher capital/labor
ratios.

2.17      Labor productivity is only a partial measure of a firm's economic
efficiency and market competitiveness. Capital/labor and capital/output
ratios, as well as differences in factor prices among firms, also have a
major impact on competitiveness. The three indicators together (labor pro-
ductivity, capital/output ratio, and capital/labor ratio) suggest a modest
increase in economic efficiency with an increase in the size of firm (see
Table 2.1). However, a full measure of the degree of competitiveness has
to include differences in factor costs (particularly labor) facing firms of
different size. 1/
2.18      A qualitative assessment of the overall efficiency and market com-
petitiveness of industrial firms by size group can be obtained by looking at
the last two columns of Table 2.1, which reflect the relationship between
value added generated in the firms and the two main claimants to value added--
labor and capital.  The higher the ratios, the higher the amount of value
added which will go into profits; but the two ratios cannot be directly com-
bined into a single measure because of their heterogeneity. While the wage
bill is a flow concept, reflecting labor costs during the period, the value
of fixed assets indicates a stock concept; and it is not possible to obtain
direct data on the corresponding flow (capital use or depreciation during
1/   Differences in average salaries are the net result of several factors,
including differences in labor skills and differences in institutional
constraints, such as legal minimum wages. Similarly, the cost of capital
for firms of different size may be quite different, reflecting easier
access to the financial sector by large firms, different availability of
subsidized financing and of import duty exemptions and others.



the period). A consideration of the two ratios plus a crude measure which
combines labor and capital costs under two alternative assumptions 1/
(Table 2.2), indicates two local maxima, one for the largest firms with 500
or more employees and another covering two of the size groups of small-scale
industries (those from 10 to 49 employees). The smallest firms (5 - 9
employees) also show reasonably good competitiveness: above that of medium-
sized firms and very similar to the group with 200 - 499 employees.

2.19      Recent measures of fixed assets in Peruvian small industries are of
difficult interpretation because of very high rates of inflation and devalua-
tion of the sol which are not adequately reflected in the standard accounting
practices. The ESAN Survey included a question on the current value of the
investment in machinery and equipment in the sample firms, in 1980 soles. The
average investment is reported to be S/. 8.02 million (about US$23,000 equiva-
lent at the December 31, 1980, exchange rate). With an average employment of
six employees, the average investment cost per job (excluding land and build-
ings) is about US$4,000.  About one-half of the firms in the ESAN Survey are
considering making additional investments with an average of US$35,000 equiva-
lent for machinery and equipment and US$56,000 in total investment per firm.
1/   Capital use or depreciation is approximated by using 10% and 20% of
the value of fixed assets.  Then we can obtain the ratio of value added
to labor costs plus capital costs as V.A./(Wage Bill + d* Fixed Assets)
where d is the depreciation rate.  The results, included in Table 2.2
are consistent with the first two ratios considered separately.



- 9 -
2.20      A separate, smaller sample of enterprises interviewed during the
preparation of the proposed project resulted in somewhat higher figures for
fixed assets, employment, and investment cost per job. The sample, consisting
of 45 firms selected from among BIP small-scale industry clients in the Lima,
Piura, Ica and Cusco areas, indicates average fixed assets of about US$75,000
equivalent, average employment of 13, and an investment cost per job of
US$5,800 equivalent. These figures seem to indicate that the BIP customers
were selected from among a subgroup of relatively "large size" small firms and
would be fully consistent with the figures in para. 2.19 above.
2.21      Wages and Salaries.  A majority of small scale industry full-time
employees receive the minimum legal wage, but it appears that most of the
part-time employees may receive lower wages. The ESAN Survey indicates that
the average monthly wage in late 1980 was S/. 26,000 (about US$80 equivalent),
close to the minimum wage; and the average monthly salary for administrative
employees was S/. 30,000. Also, the owner-managers of the firms in the ESAN
Survey reported an average salary allocation of about S/. 50,000, less than
twice the minimum wage. The average wages in small firms are well below those
in medium and large firms (Table 2.1).
2.22      Financial Structure and Management.  A large number of small-scale
industrial enterprises operate outside of the formal financial sector. One-
third of the 248 firms included in the ESAN Survey do not have any relations
with a bank or other financial intermediary.  Among the firms   dealing with
banks, the largest number (40 firms) deals with Banco de Credito (Peru's
largest private commercial bank), whereas two other commercial banks (Banco
Continental and Banco Comercial) follow. Banco Industrial del Peru appears
only in the fourth position after the above.
2.23      The number of firms obtaining loans during the last few years is
small. Of the firms in the Survey only 147 received loans during the last
ten years, with an average loan size of S/. 3 million (about US$10,000
equivalent). Only slightly more than half of the total amount of the loans
came from the banks, whereas 45% of the total came from friends and relatives.
Significantly, however, 79% of the loans were received in the last three years,
showing an increasing use of resources external to the firm. The low degree
of participation in the formal financial system is typical of the lower end
of the small industry range covered by the ESAN Survey. Also, the special
attention given by BIP to SSE firms outside Lima-Callao may account for its
limited importance as a source of finance among the firms in the ESAN Survey,
which covered only the Lima-Callao area.
2.24      Industry and Trade Associations.  There are two major associations
of small-scale firms at the national level, the Small-Scale Industry Committee
within the Sociedad de Industrias (Industrial Association) and the much larger
APEMIPE (Asociacion de Pequenas y Medianas Industrias del Peru). In addition,
a number of local associations of small-scale firms have been recently estab-
lished in several departments outside Lima (mainly in Arequipa, Trujillo and
Piura). These local associations are also members of APEMIPE and maintain a
close relationship with the regional offices of the Ministry of Industry and
other local authorities, as well as with the institutions providing technical



- 10 -
assistance to SSE. Thus, the local associations may develop into a very impor-
tant element to coordinate the provision of assistance to small enterprises
in the different areas of the country.
2.25      Government Assistance to SSE.  As indicated above (para. 2.09), the
Law of Small Enterprises (LSE) was enacted in February 1976. The main feature
and objective of the LSE was to relieve small enterprises of some of the
obligations of profit and ownership sharing established by the Industrial
Community Law. During its last days in office, the previous government
approved another law for small enterprises in July 1980. The purpose of this
new law was to encourage formal registration of small enterprises by simplify-
ing administrative procedures and lowering the potential tax burden by estab-
lishing a unified tax. However, the new Government, inaugurated in July 1980
indicated its intention to prepare a new industrial law covering also small
industries and did not put into effect the Law approved by the outgoing
government. Currently, there is a draft Industrial Law being discussed by
Congress, including a small scale industry section. The draft law proposes
to maintain and expand the benefits of small firms in terms of more liberal
labor legislation, simplified registration procedures, and a single tax to be
levied on small firms. The draft law would also expand the definition of
small scale industry to cover a wider range of firms.
III.  TERM LENDING TO SMALL SCALE ENTERPRISE
3.01      The Peruvian financial system is dominated by the banking system
which has historically held around 88% of the total assets of the financial
system. Besides the Central Bank (Banco Central de Reserva del Peru - BCR),
the banking system comprises Banco de la Nacion (the central Government's bank
and tax collector), five specialized development banks, and 21 commercial banks
including eleven non-specialized commercial banks, six regional commercial
banks, and three construction and one savings commercial banks. The non-banking
system includes the Government's development finance institution (Corporacion
Financiera de Desarrollo-COFIDE), 10 financieras, 16 savings and loan associa-
tions, 22 insurance companies, and over 500 small savings cooperatives and
credit unions (Annex 2, T-4).
Resource Mobilization and Interest Rates 1/
3.02      Financial savings in Peru are mainly marshalled by the banking
system, which at year-end 1980 held about 85 percent of all financial liabili-
ties (including demand deposits) with the private sector. These financial
instruments include savings and time deposits, various types of bonds, mort-
gage certificates, and certificates of deposit. In past years, however,
mobilization of medium- and long-term resources was severely constrained by
1/   A detailed review of the financial sector is included in the SAR for the
Second Industrial Credit Project for Peru (Report No. 3238-PE, dated
March 12, 1981). The relevant tables presented in Annex 2 of this report
have been updated to include data for 1980.

negative real rates of interest that prevailed during the seventies. During
1980 effective lending rates amounted to some 50%, compared to an inflation
rate of 60%. Effective deposit rates were in the 35 to 40 percent range,
with some instruments, like certificates of deposit and time deposits over
two years with financieras, at higher rates. In early January 1981, the
Central Bank made a full revision and simplification of the interest rate
structure, including an upward adjustment of from 10 to 20 percentage points
for most deposit and lending rates, which brought their effective rates to
over 60 percent, above the current annualized rate of inflation of 50% (after
briefly reaching 75% to 80% in early 1981) (Annex 2, T-12).
3.03      More recently, in July 1981, the Government and the Central Bank
introduced indexation primarily for mortgage financing in the housing sector.
Simultaneously, financial intermediaries are being allowed the option of
using indexation in operations with maturities of more than one year. The
index will be announced monthly, in advance, will be based on the prior
month's non-indexed rates set by the BCR, and has been designed so that, at
least initially, the combined indexation and interest on indexed obligations
will result in the same effective "interest charges" as under the non-indexed
system. As long as it remains optional, however, it is not clear whether financial
institutions will adopt indexation. There are no apparent incentives for them
to do so. With some exceptions the Central Bank will apparently continue its
own lending operations without indexation. The financial system can only
index their assets (loans) but not their liabilities (deposits they receive
and obligations they issue). Cash flow volumes and thus available cash for
new lending of financial institutions would be reduced. Without new additions
of paid-in capital debt-to-equity ratios would increase substantially over
time.  The announced policy of the Central Bank is that under the existing or
any new system, interest rates would remain positive in real terms.  For
borrowers, however, a reduction in their debt servicing burden would be
expected. This would be particularly favorable to SSE. Finally, however,
indexation was introduced by executive decree which must be confirmed by
Congress through enactment of a bill presently before that legislative body.
Whether Congress should enact the bill in its present form or limit indexation
to the housing sector alone is currently being debated.
Banco Industrial del Peru
3.04      In past years the main institution channelling term resources to
the SSE sector has been BIP, one of the five specialized development banks.
As of December 31, 1980, BIP had total assets of S/. 113 billion (US$328
million), net loans outstanding of S/. 92 billion (US$268 million), and
equity of S/. 26 billion (US$76 million). (Annex 2, T-5, T-6 and T-7.)
It has a network of 26 branches throughout the country of which only one
is in the Lima area. BIP has in past years suffered from an inadequate
organization (15 divisions report to the General Manager), over-staffing,
and deficiencies in its resource mobilization side, owing mostly to the ready
availability of low cost money from the Government. On the lending side,
however, and particularly lending to SSE, BIP has developed a high degree of
operational and institutional competence (para. 4.08). The only major weak-
nesses on the lending side are cumbersome loan appraisals, where a much higher
degree of thoroughness and quality is required by BIP than the smaller loans

merit, and lenghty and time consuming processing procedures. The new General
Manager who took office in February 1981 is addressing these issues.
3.05      BIP lends to SSE through its regular SSE lines of credit which have
been funded mostly by IDB loans, and through the Regional Development Fund
(RDF), a special program supported with USAID resources and targeted to SSE in
rural areas. Of US$127 million equivalent in total loans approved by BIP in
1980, fully 35%, or US$44.5 million equivalent were for SSE (Table 3.1). In
real terms, between 1978 and 1980 only RDF and normal SSE lending showed
significant increases. An important reason for the high level of SSE lending
prior to January 1981 was the large volume of low cost resources that were
being made available by the Government exclusively to BIP for financing SSE at
subsidized rates of interest. RDF and SSE lending in 1980 included some 12%
to 14% of refinancing and were, in addition, inflated by the highly negative
real interest rates that prevailed during that year. Discounting the effects
of refinancig and negative rates, demand in 1980 would have more likely been
in the range of S/. 9 billion (US$30 million) to SI. 10 billion ($33.3 million)
instead of the SI. 13.4 billion (US$44.5 million) experienced. Branch managers
of BIP with whom the mission met confirmed some slowdown in demand with the
large increases in interest rates introduced after January 1981.

3.06      Normal SSE lending operations were supported with three IDB loans
made to the Government between 1977 and 1979 totalling US$54 million, most
of which was passed to BIP as capital contributions, and of which one-third
to one-half were used for SSE lending. Prior to January 1981, interest rates
ranged from 32% to 48% p.a. nominal (37% to 60% effective) depending on the
size of the firm and loan, with the smaller firms receiving the lower rates.
In 1980, a total of 1,940 loans with an average loan size of about US$16,600
were made under the above lending program. The majority of BIP's SSE benefi-
ciaries were in the center and north zones of the country. In terms of amounts



- 13 -
approved, in 1978 Lima-Callao was the most favored area, but by 1979 and 1980
the north had become the major consumer of SSE resources (Annex 2, T-8).
3.07      The Rural Development Fund.  RDF was initiated with USAID's support
in November 1975 to provide technical and financial assistance in order to
create new iobs and support investments with better regional distribution.
RDF's objectives were to be accomplished by making credit available to enter-
prises in rural areas on highly preferential terms and conditions. RDF could
make loans of up to US$60,000 equivalent to industry, commerce, services and
artisanal activities. And, in order to encourage the creation of new jobs,
the cost per job created was not to exceed the equivalent of US$4,000. RDF
started its operations in 1975 in four areas: Cuzco, Junin, Puno and Ayacucho
with a US$8.3 million component of a USAID loan to the Government that was
passed on in soles to BIP as capital contribution. In addition, the Govern-
ment made available counterpart funds of US$5.2 million equivalent. RDF, now
operating through most of BIP's 26 branch offices, was replenished two years
ago by a second USAID loan of US$8 million and counterpart funds of US$2.7
million equivalent. By 1980, RDF had made a total of 5,537 loans, of which
1,611 were approved in 1980, amounting to S/. 3.7 billion, for a monthly
approval average of US$1.0 million and with an average loan size of US$8,000
equivalent (Table 3.2).

3.08      Until January 1981, RDF lending operations carried highly negative
interest rates ranging from 18% to 26% plus a 2% commission, as compared to an
inflation rate of about 60% in 1980. Traditionally, cottage industries and
smaller firms were charged the lower interest rates. In line with the new
Government and BCR policy on interest rates (para. 3.02), BIP increased interest
rates in January 1981, and RDF nominal lending rates, including commissions,
moved up to a range of 32 to 49.5% including commissions (equivalent to
effective rates of 37% to 62%) depending on the loan size and activity of the
enterprise. The upper limit rate became the same as the prevailing commercial
bank rate. More recently, all interest rates have been unified at the higher
rate for long-term operations (currently 54% excluding commissions). RDF
resources have been totally committed.

3.09      Prospects.  BIP is going through a major reassessment of its role,
policies and organizational structure. One major area that is receiving pri-
ority is resource mobilization. Because of the large dependency on Government
resources, in past years this area of BIP's operations failed to develop
adequately. As a consequence, and because the new Government is no longer
making available low cost money and is forcing all institutions to fend for
themselves, BIP is in the process of strengthening its resource mobilization
function and developing plans for raising new resources. The SSE programs
are currently underfunded and some rationing began as early as March 1981,
and BIP does not expect to begin capturing significant volumes of new resources
before 1982. Consequently, the proposed loan is expected to help BIP through
the early part of 1982. More importantly, because the resources of the
project would be available to other financial intermediaries on equal terms
and conditions, BIP will for the first time in many years face competition
that should result in motivation to improve the efficiency of its lending
operations where these are weak, particularly in the processing of loan
applications (para. 3.04).
Banco Central de Reserva del Peru
3.10      Special Funds.  BIP term lending efforts to SSE have been comple-
mented by a number of funds established by the Central Bank during the last
three years, and which in November 1980 were transferred to COFIDE. The first
to be introduced was the Fondo de Redescuento Agroindustrial (FRAI) estab-
lished in 1978 to finance agroindustrial projects, and partially financed
through a US$14.7 million loan from USAID (plus US$4.9 million equivalent in
counterpart funds provided by the Central Bank). Subloans for a period of
up to 10 years with up to 2 years of grace, for a maximum of US$750,000
equivalent are denominated in local currency and carry a nominal interest rate
of 54%. A total of 25 financial intermediaries channelled FRAI resources,
with 8 financieras accounting for 54% of the total, followed by 9 commercial
banks (about 29%) and 4 regional banks (13%).
3.11      In November 1979, the Central Bank established the Fondo de Bienes
de Capital (FONCAP) with a capital of S/. 5 billion (about US$17 million
equivalent) to finance the sale of domestically produced capital goods and
equipment. Subloans for a period of up to 10 years for a maximum of US$2
million equivalent are denominated in local currency and carry a nominal
interest rate of 54%. Of the 20 intermediaries channelling FONCAP resources,
eight financieras accounted for 63% of the total, three commercial banks used
30% and two regional banks 3%. A third Central Bank fund, the Fondo de
Inversiones Regionales (FIRE), was established in February 1980 to finance
a wide range of activities outside the Lima-Callao area. FIRE's capital
was S/. 5 billion. Subloans of up to US$2 million equivalent can be denomi-
nated in soles (for the local component of the projects) or in US dollars (for
the imported component). Local currency subloans carry a nominal interest
rate of 54%, and US dollar subloans carry a rate of 15%. Five financieras
accounted for 73% of the total approved amount, two regional banks channelled
20% and two commercial banks the remaining 7%. Table 3.3 shows that FRAI and
FONCAP have operated mainly as small and medium scale industry credit lines,
while FIRE financed larger operations.

3.12      Regional Selective Credit.  Because the majority of industries out-
side Lima are small to medium scale, most commercial and regional bank loans
outside Lima are directed to this sector. However, commercial bank loans are
only on a short-term basis (up to 360 days); and regional banks, although
authorized to make loans for up to five years, greatly depend on their ability
to mobilize term resources for their term operations. Accordingly, commercial
and regional banks have been using a special rediscount line of credit of the
Central Bank, the Regional Selective Credit (RSC), for financing operations
outside of Lima through their network of branches.
3.13      RSC rediscounts loans of up to S/. 50 million (about US$131,000
equivalent) for firms with total assets not exceeding S/. 300 million
(US$750,000 equivalent). RSC total resources amount to S/. 5 billion of
which 93% had already been used by June, 1981. Regional banks have used
about 54% of the total amount, commercial banks 43%, and the rest have been
used by other finance and savings institutions. Although RSC is formally a
renewable short-term credit line, a pre-established amortization schedule
of at least 20% (and in some cases 16.7%) every 180 days allows its conver-
sion into medium-term loans with maximum maturity of 2-1/2 years (3 years).
Many SSEs have benefitted from this facility, but at 2-1/2 to 3 years the
terms are not fully adequated for financing most long-term investments.
3.14      Beyond the above programs, some of which have now been transferred
to COFIDE, the Central Bank continues very interested in assuring the avail-
ability of term resources for sectors currently underserved, and in creating
competition among intermediaries in the whole financial system to assure the
broadest possible distribution of term resources. The desire of the Central
Bank to take the proposed loan and convert it into soles, and of passing it on
to the entire financial system through COFIDE, with an additional counterpart
of the Central Bank (para. 5.01), reflects the concern of the Central Bank in
assuring the availability of term resources to SSE on a competitive basis
through the largest number possible of intermediaries.
Commercial and Regional Banks
3.15      There are eleven commercial and six regional commercial banks with
a network of 770 branch offices, of which 688 are of the commercial and 82 of
the regional banks. In 1980, these banks held 28.4% of the total assets of



- 16 -
the financial system (Annex 2, T-4, T-9 and T-10). Except when specifically
exempted by the Central Bank, commercial banks are not allowed to extend
credits that exceed one year, and regional banks five years. To mobilize term
resources only regional banks are allowed to issue certificates of deposit
with maturities of up to three years. All commercial banks, except one,
however, have created financieras (finance companies) as vehicles for mobiliz-
ing and providing medium-term resources for their clients, although in the
case of the financieras the lending orientation tends to be solely for medium
and large industries (Annex 2, T-11).  Despite these limitations commercial
banks have been dealing extensively with SSE in working capital financing, and
regional banks have been, in addition, providing medium-term financing to SSE,
which is the predominant clientele in the regions outside of Lima. Commercial
and regional banks, therefore, have a large potential for providing long-term
credit to SSE, particularly in the regions outside of Lima. They have a large
branch office network, they know the clients, and, perhaps most important, are
more likely to make "character" loans to well known clients with insufficient
physical guarantees, a problem that is particularly troublesome in lending to
SSE. To-date the major limitation to extending long-term credit to SSE has
been the lack of term resources. The proposed project would make available
such resources; and would, in addition, contribute towards the upgrading of
the term lending capabilities of the loan officers of commercial and regional
banks through a training program that would be sponsored by COFIDE under the
project (para. 5.15).
Other Intermediaries
3.16      Cooperatives.  There are about 530 savings and credit cooperatives
that incorporate some 800,000 members. In 1979, credit cooperatives extended
loans amounting to S/. 23.6 billion (US$94 million), which represented about
6% of the total credit commitments of the financial system in that year.
Credit commitments of cooperatives increased by an annual average of 16.6%
between 1976 and 1979. To-date the bulk of their operations have been for
personal credits to members. However, their very structure, objectives, and
distribution throughout the country give cooperatives the potential of
becoming an important channel for mobilizing resources to the smaller size
firms that normally would not have access to banking services. At the end
of 1979, the capital of savings and credit cooperatives was estimated at
S/. 16,000 million (US$64 million equivalent), which indicates an important
mobilization of resources within the national financial system. There are two
relatively large cooperatives in Lima that channel resources to other smaller
cooperatives throughout the country: Banco Nacional de las Cooperativas del
Peru (BANCOOP) and Central de Credito Cooperativo del Peru (CCC). The total
assets of these two cooperatives in 1980 was S/. 6.4 billion (US$18.8 million
equivalent) compared to 2.4 billion (US$9.6 million equivalent) in 1979 which
indicates that their assets increased by 67% in real terms between 1979 and
1980. BANCOOP and CCC can act as intermediaries in this project by channel-
ing part of COFIDE's SSE resources to the smaller cooperatives all over the
country in an attempt to facilitate the access of smaller cooperatives to
those funds. COFIDE is currently reviewing various alternatives and proce-
dures for working with cooperatives under the proposed project.
3.17      Financiera de Desarrollo, S.A.  FINDESA is a financiera currently
being established in Lima to provide medium- and long-term financing for SSE.



- 17 -
The main promoter of FINDESA is the Institute of Investigation and Development
for Self-Management (INDA). INDA's resources originated from a donation of the
Inter-American Foundation (USO3 million) and a credit from the IDB (US$500,000),
in addition to some fixed-term deposits (US$450,000). INDA, which has been
in existence for four years, has provided small short- and medium-term loans
to some 70 small scale enterprises. INDA has also been providing technical
assistance services to its clients, mainly in the field of project preparation
and feasibility studies. INDA is now promoting FINDESA to allow expansion of
term credit operations to SSE and will provide S/. 140 million as a contribu-
tion to FINDESA capital, which represents 20% of the total capital and is the
maximum allowed by law for a single shareholder. Negotiations are being con-
ducted with German, Dutch, and Canadian groups to secure another 20% from a
foreign source (an amount of US$350,000 equivalent). The remaining 60% of the
minimum legal capital required (S/. 700 million) is still being sought in
Peru. FINDESA is expected to come on stream before the end of 1981. Because
it will be specializing in term credit to SSE, it has the potential of making
a significant contribution to the development of the sector, and COFIDE has
begun conversations with FINDESA about their participation under the proposed
project.
SSE Credit Guarantee Fund
3.18      One of the problems facing small scale enterprises in getting
financing is the lack of sufficient collateral. To help ease this problem,
a guarantee fund, Fondo de Garantia para Prestamos a la Pequena Industria
(FOGAPI) was created in 1978. FOGAPI has a small capital (about US$85,000)
that was provided by the West German aid agency (D.M. 100,000), COFIDE (S/.
6.5 million), BIP (S/. 6.5 million), and small amounts from the two national
SSE associations, APEMIPE and the Small Industries Committee of the Sociedad
de Industrias. While FOGAPI can have a guarantee portfolio up to 10 times its
capital, so far it has only guaranteed the 21 loan applications it has received,
amounting to 76% of its capital. Guarantee operations were all for BIP loans
in the Lima area and started to be presented about two years after FOGAPI's
creation. The main reason for the late start of FOGAPI activities has been
lack of promotion, especially outside Lima. Recently steps have been taken
to expand FOGAPI's operations in Trujillo and Arequipa. An increase in the
operations of FOGAPI could be an additional factor facilitating the accessi-
bility of credit to a larger segment of SSE, particularly at the smaller end.
The availability of SSE funds to COFIDE under the proposed project would be
expected to create a greater demand on guarantees and will be a good oppor-
tunity to make increased use of FOGAPI. COFIDE, the administrator of the
fund, is currently making arrangements to integrate FOGAPI's administration
into the newly established SSE unit of COFIDE's Financial Intermediaries
Division (para. 5.10).
Prospects
3.19      Despite the existence of specialized funds and lending facilities
and the use made of them for some lending to SSE by many financial intermedia-
ries, the participation of financial intermediaries, other than BIP, in term
lending to SSE has been quite limited. There are a number of reasons for this.
Prior to January 1981 practically all term lending to SSE was at highly



- 18 -
negative real rates of interest, mostly through BIP, with which private sector
financial institutions were unable to compete with their own resources. When
competitive resources were made available to a wide range of intermediaries,
as was the case with the specialized Central Bank funds which until January
1981 also carried negative real rates of interest, financial intermediaries
appeared ready and quite willing to lend to the smaller size spectrum of
enterprises. The specialized funds, however, are specifically targeted and
their resources limited so that the volume of resources available for SSE lend-
ing is marginal to the subsector's needs. Finally, commercial and regional
banks, which with their large network of branch offices can most effectively
reach the large number of widely dispersed SSE, have not in the past been able
to mobilize sufficient term resources with which to support the investment
needs of small enterprises. The proposed project would make available term
resources to the entire financial system for onlending to SSE. It is expected
that this would increase the availability of term resources for SSE, and
result in a larger number of small enterprises using the formal financial
system for their investment needs.
IV. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
4.01      SSE in Peru tend to suffer from a wide range of managerial and
technical problems apart from limited access to finance. These problems tend
to be associated with enterprise size and the background of the entrepreneur,
and are not fundamentally different from those facing SSE in other developing
countries. They include inadequate financial management and cost accounting,
a weakness particularly troublesome in an inflationary economy; difficulty
in keeping up with technological developments; limited knowledge of how to
tackle new markets, particularly exports; inadequate quality control; and
management weaknesses in purchasing, inventory control, production, labor
management, and related areas of the business.
4.02      There are a large number of agencies, institutions, trade associa-
tions, and public consultancies in Peru offering a wide range of technical
assistance services that are relevant and useful to SSE, particularly small
industry. No institution offers a comprehensive service, but at least five
important institutions offer services that are specifically targeted to the
needs of SSE. These are Servicio Nacional de Adiestramiento en Trabajo
Industrial (SENATI); Instituto de Investigacion Tecnologica Industrial y de
Normas Tecnicas (ITINTEC); Banco Industrial del Peru (BIP); Universidad del
Pacifico; and Escuela Superior de Administracion de Negocios (ESAN). In
addition, in three cities, Arequipa, Trujillo and Piura, executive committees
have been established by the local authorities and trade associations and some
of the above institutions in an effort to coordinate the activities of the
participating institutions and thereby more effectively meet the needs of SSE
in the region. Since last year the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and
Intregration (MITI) also started to focus on the development problems of SSE,
and there is currently under consideration the creation of a mechanism or
agency to improve coordination and promote more effective and wider coverage
throughout the country of the various technical assistance programs of the
specialized institutions.



- 19 -
Major Institutions Providing Technical Assistance
4.03      Servicio Nacional de Adiestramiento en Trabajo Industrial.  SENATI
is a semi-autonomous state institution established primarily to conduct
professional and vocational training programs for the workers of Peruvian
industry. Five years ago an attempt was first made to develop training and
consultancy programs for SSE but these were designed and operated haphazardly.
Almost simultaneously a technical assistance program sponsored by the Federal
Republic of Germany was initiated. This program aimed at the creation of an
institute for small industries development (Instituto para el Desarrollo
Industrial y Profesional de la Pequena y Mediana Empresa - IDINPRO), and was
co-executed by SENATI and the German Government. IDINPRO has focused on the
metal working subsector in the Lima metropolitan area and provides SSE in
that subsector with technical training, consultancy services, subcontracting
arrangements and administrative assistance. Through this program a technical
center was established which provides on-the-job training and testing facili-
ties mainly in the design and manufacture of molds. The center also has a
small unit for assistance and training in budgeting and costing, and a larger
unit for conducting technical courses.
4.04      Another activity undertaken by SENATI to assist SSE is a management
training and consultancy program for enterprises in all economic sectors
(Asesoria y Capacitacion en el Campo de la Administration para la Pequena
Industria - ACAMPI). ACAMPI was developed and executed with technical assis-
tance sponsored by the Government of the Netherlands. Eleven courses were
designed in the areas of general management, production, finance, and market-
ing, and were made available to SSE on a national scale. A management advisory
program was also introduced to give on the spot orientation and training to
entrepreneurs.  The ACAMPI program has been operated out of SENATI's Lima
headquarters and its two regional centers in Trujillo (north) and Arequipa
(south), with courses also having been conducted in five other cities.
4.05      Together with BIP, in 1979 SENATI established a technical assistance
center in Trujillo (Centro de Apoyo a la Pequena Empresa Industrial - CAPEI)
to make available technical training programs to SSE in the northern region
of the country. CAPEI conducts courses on a selected number of topics and
provides on-the-job training and technical assistance. It has its own physical
infrastructure, including a machine shop for on-the-job training much like
IDINPRO in Lima. Last year the management training and advisory activities of
ACAMPI in Trujillo were physically integrated into CAPEI to allow for better
coordination of the various technical assistance services provided by SENATI
in the region.
4.06      SENATI has adopted a policy of decentralization of its activities.
This policy has allowed for better response to the differing needs of SSE in
different regions. In general, the SENATI programs are well designed and
executed. However, in some cases they need to be better coordinated and
integrated with the programs of other institutions. SENATI's ability and
willingness to develop SSE oriented programs outside of Lima appears to be
highly dependent on the availability of in-place infrastructure that can
support the programs. For this reason the only programs that have achieved
some degree of institutionalization are those located in Lima, Trujillo, and



- 20 -
Arequipa, where SENATI operates large vocational training centers. Further-
more, SENATI's existing SSE programs have been designed for the central person
in small enterprise, usually the owner/manager, and are not compatible with
SENATI's principal activity of providing vocational training for the workers
of medium and large industry. This situation is currently being reviewed by
SENATI's senior management, and by officials of MITI who are searching for a
mechanism that would allow for better coordination and integration of the
programs of all institutions (paras 4.14 and 4.15).
4.07      Instituto de Investigacion Tecnologica Industrial y de Normas
Tecnicas. ITINTEC is a decentralized government agency concentrating on
setting and overseeing standards of industrial products, granting and regis-
tering patents and trade marks, and helping individual firms, until recently
almost entirely large firms, in solving specific technological and quality
control problems. During the last two years ITINTEC began showing interest
in developing activities to support SSE, particularly in the dissemination of
technical information of use mostly in the production and quality control
functions. Together with other institutions in Lima, like SENATI and BIP,
ITINTEC is currently developing a program for information retrieval by small
industries, including the setting up of a small extension unit that will act
as liaison between SSE and ITINTEC. At the regional level ITINTEC has offices
in Trujillo and Arequipa where last year programs were developed to improve
the use by SSE of ITINTEC'a technical information. As a result, in Arequipa
the local ITINTEC office participates in the coordinating body of ACAMPI, and
in Trujillo discussions are underway that would result in better coordination
and integration of ITINTEC into the local programs of CAPEI and ACAMPI.
4.08      Banco Industrial del Peru.  BIP's primary involvement in providing
technical assistance to SSE is through its lending operations. Each of its
branch offices is staffed with professionals, including at least one
engineer, one lawyer, and one lending operations oriented accountant, that
assist borrowers analyze their real financing requirements, fill in loan
applications and obtain the documentation necessary in support of their
application. While analyzing real financing requirements and later evalua-
ting the loan applications, BIP's staff in effect have to do a diagnosis of
each borrower's operations. This usually results in BIP staff delivering
some assistance required by the borrower to solve some of his problems or
more efficiently plan and implement his new investment program. Often BIP
staff will also refer borrowers or potential borrowers to existing technical
assistance programs of other institutions. This is particularly true in
cities like Trujillo, Arequipa and Piura where technical assistance programs
are well underway. The quality of BIP's technical assistance content and
delivery capabilities vary considerably from one branch office to another,
and are very highly dependent on the capabilities and initiative of indivi-
dual branch managers. Although it is BIP's policy to assist its small
clients, a unit does not yet exist in the organization that would assure a
continuous upgrading of capabilities at the branch level and consistency in
application of such capabilities throughout the country. BIP's new manage-
ment is reviewing this situation and indicated to the appraisal mission
that in coming months they would carefully reassess BIP's role in technical
assistance.



- 21 -
4.09      Universidad del Pacifico.  This institution is the most active of
all Peruvian universities in the development of special programs of assistance
to small enterprises. Like all other universities in Lima, however, its area
of operation does not reach beyond the Lima metropolitan area except when
invited to participate in specific programs. Presently the Universidad del
Pacifico is undertaking an ambitious plan for setting up a management training
and advisory program for SSE in Lima with financing from the Interamerican
Foundation. There is little coordination with SENATI, and the program being
developed appears to be duplicating many of the activities of SENATI's ACAMPI
program. Universidad del Pacifico is also considering establishing a special
unit for the training of industrial extension workers, investment and loan
officers, project analysts and project engineers that would work with SSE.
Universidad del Pacifico's current thinking is to orient this training program
to the entire Andean Pact region. During appraisal the mission approached
Universidad del Pacifico about the possibility of developing similar programs
under the sponsorship of COFIDE. Such programs would be for the loan officers
of Peruvian financial intermediaries under the proposed project and delivery
of the courses would be at the regional level. Universidad del Pacifico was
enthusiastic, and during appraisal a draft course outline, procedures for
coordination and execution, including identification of possible professorial
staff, and a tentative budget were prepared (para 5.15).
4.10      Escuela Superior de Administracion de Negocios.  ESAN is a manage-
ment training institute conducting training programs mainly for higher level
executives of medium and large scale industry. During the past year and a
half ESAN has been studying the possibility of developing programs for SSE,
and plans are underway to develop special training programs and advisory
services for the owner/manager of SSE. In the process ESAN carried out a com-
prehensive survey on the problems and needs of SSE in the Lima area (para.
2.10). Although it is not yet clear how far ESAN will carry its current plans
and how effective its coverage of SSE would be, its role could be major in
future years if its activities can be properly coordinated and integrated with
those of other institutions.
Prospects
4.11      On the whole, in recent years reasonable progress has been made
towards meeting the technical assistance needs of SSE in Peru. However, much
remains to be done. The existing programs need to be further integrated and
better coordinated to avoid duplication. Gaps in some of the existing pro--
grams need to be filled. The loan officers of financial intermediaries
providing term credit to SSE need to be trained in the efficient and effective
evaluation of SSE investment projects, in methods of providing SSE with
assistance in at least financial management, and in guiding SSE to other
specialized sources of technical assistance. Under the proposed project
COFIDE would sponsor such training for loan officers of new financial
intermediaries.
4.12      Finally, programs for cities not yet covered need to be developed
and implemented. The more meaningful regional programs now in existence in
Peru have resulted from initiatives and continuous and effective lobbying by
regional interest groups, mainly the local associations of small enterprises



- 22 -
and in some cases the local offices of MITI and the regional development
organizations. The most successful programs are those of Arequipa, Trujillo,
and Piura. The success of the Trujillo and Arequipa programs, however, has
been due in large part to the large presence of the national institutions in
those two cities: SENATI with large regional centers, ITINTEC with regional
offices, and BIP with larger offices and staff than in other cities outside of
Lima. There is, therefore, an apparent need for a national body that would
help promote the development of programs for other cities where the national
institutions have not found it economically efficient to individually under-
take their own programs on a permanent basis.
4.13      Supreme Decree No. 034-79 of November 6, 1979, created the National
Committee for the Promotion and Development of Small Industry to form the
base from which, among others, the previously mentioned problems could be
solved. Its membership includes the chief officers of MITI, COFIDE, BIP,
SENATI, the SSE committee of the national association of industries (Sociedad
de Industrias), and the association of small and medium industrialists (APEMIPE).
Among the basic objectives of the Committee are the development of policies
that would regulate all activities in support of SSE, including lending
policies, technical assistance and external financing of Peruvian programs;
and the coordination of the efforts of the various institutions providing
technical assistance. The Committee has not functioned mainly because the
decree did not provide for funding nor for an executive committee or secre-
tariat to carry out day-to-day activities.
4.14      One of the first measures of the new Government was to create a
small working group within MITI that would focus on the development problems
of SSE. Since then a consensus has formed within MITI, the Sociedad de
Industrias, APEMIPE, and among most institutions providing technical assistance,
about the need to create a small but effective semi-autonomous "institute" to
coordinate and promote the efforts of the various specialized institutions now
providing technical assistance. The institute would promote the creation of
coordinating committees at the regional/city level which would contract the
services of the specialized national institutions. Central to the development
of the institute would be that it remain a small but effective institution.
This would result from the institute not executing technical assistance pro-
grams itself but instead promoting the development and execution of regional
programs by the local coordinating committees and the specialized national
institutions. The institute would also provide some funding, operational and
administrative guidance, and technical assistance to the regional committees.
Finally, at the national level it would lobby with the specialized institu-
tions to assure their response to the requests for assistance from the
regional committees. The small working group in MITI that has been developing
the above scheme has made considerable progress towards outlining in more
detail the scope, objectives, responsibilities, organization, funding, and
early plans of action for the institute (documents B8(1) and B8(2) in the
Project File--Annex 3--discuss in ronsiderable detail the institute and work
done to-date). In addition to the above, MITI is undertaking a thorough review
and evaluation of the existing programs and of the role of the national
institutions executing the programs.
4.15      Given the wide variety of technical assistance services already avail-
able to SSE, which although they may require strengthening are nevertheless



- 23 -
generally adequate in quality, the mission concluded that the provision of
additional programs was not necessary for the success of the proposed project
and would, in fact, not be desirable until the thorough review and evaluation
being made by MITI is completed. One of the major problems at this time is
not the availability of technical assistance but rather the lack of a mechanism
to put SSE in contact with the sources of assistance they require. Therefore,
under the proposed project COFIDE would sponsor a training program for the
loan officers of participating financial intermediaries so that they can
evaluate the technical assistance needs of their clients and direct them to
the most appropriate source of such services (para. 5.15). Also, during
supervision of the proposed project, Bank staff would continue the dialogue
that it initiated during appraisal with MITI officials about the further
strengthening of technical assistance services, including the possible crea-
tion of the institute or an alternative coordinating and promotion mechanism.
Finally, the UNDP is planning a project to support MITI's effort to evaluate
and coordinate existing services and to provide additional services in Arequipa
and two other cites in the south. MITI has requested that the Bank be made
executing agent for this project to insure coordination with the SSE project.
V. THE PROJECT AND PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Loan Amount and Objectives
5.01      A loan of US$26 million equivalent is proposed to finance the esti-
mated foreign exchange content of up to 1,500 subprojects with an estimated
overall investment cost of US$50 million, and a technical assistance program
(US$750,000 of loan funds) to upgrade the capabilities of the staff of COFIDE
and of financial intermediaries. Local counterpart term financing for onlend-
ing to SSE would be provided by BCR (US$10 million), participating intermed-
iaries (US$4 million), and project beneficiaries. Intermediaries are also
expected to participate with additional short-term financing. In past years
BIP has been virtually the only source of term financing for SSE. Based on
BIP's 1980 lending levels (para 3.05), and considering inflation and some real
economic growth, term credit demand of SSE is estimated at some US$100 million
for 1982 and 1983 combined. Since it would be committed in about two years,
the proposed loan would cover about one quarter of total SSE term financing
demand. Including the local counterpart of BCR and participating financial
intermediaries, the project would cover some 40% of the demand. BIP is
expected to cover the remaining demand gap from resources it plans to mobilize
in 1982 and recoveries of its current SSE portfolio.
5.02      The principal objectives to be achieved through this operation would
be to:
(a) Generate new employment opportunities. This loan would complement
the Second Industrial Credit Project (Loan 1968-PE) by financing
smaller scale projects which tend to have greater employment gene-
ration potential. 10,000 new jobs would be expected to result;



- 24 -
(b) increased participation by a larger number of financial inter-
mediaries. Increased competition by financial intermediaries
participating on equal terms and conditions would be expected
to increase the availability of term resources for SSE, and result
in a larger number of small enterprises using the formal financial
system for their investment needs. Also, the participation of
regional banks and of commercial banks with a large network of
regional branch offices would provide more term credit to areas
outside Lima and contribute to the further decentralization of
economic activity;
(c) policy improvements. The proposed project is designed to support
the Government and Central Bank's efforts to eliminate subsidized
interest rates and standardize financial terms and conditions
for SSE lending. It would also establish uniform policy guide-
lines for lending to small enterprise; and
(d) support the overall institutional development of COFIDE and the SSE
lending capabilities of intermediaries, and through the loan officers
of intermediaries assure a more widespread and effective use by SSE
of the technical assistance services available in Peru to small
enterprises.
Borrower and Onlending Terms and Conditions
5.03      The proposed US$26 million equivalent loan would be made to the
BCR for 15 years, including four years of grace at the prevailing interest rate
(currently 11.6% p.a.). Because of the large number of subprojects that would
be financed under the project, the loan would have a fixed amortization schedule.
The BCR would onlend in soles the US$25.25 million of the Bank loan intended for
SSE financing and an additional US$10 million equivalent from its own resources
for 15 years, including four years of grace, at the prevailing Central Bank
discount rate (Tasa de Redescuento Bancario - TRB) to COFIDE (currently 42%).
Interest payments to the BCR would be made monthly. In order to maintain the
real value of the Bank funds to be onlent by BCR in soles, the BCR would semi-
annually adjust the amount of its commitment to COFIDE, expressed in soles, to
be financed out of such Bank funds. The adjustment would be equivalent to any
difference that developed due to variations in the exchange rate during the
previous six months in the amount of soles equivalent to the Bank loan not yet
repaid. This, in effect, would be a form of indexing that would assure that
the soles value of the disbursed and outstanding resources of the proposed
Bank loan remain equivalent to the foreign currencies being held by the BCR
throughout the life of the loan. The US$750,000 for technical assistance would
be onlent to COFIDE in the same currencies and on the same terms and conditions
as the Bank loan. Agreement on the above was reached during negotiations.
Agreement was also reached on the BCR keeping separate accounts for the proposed
loan and on a yearly audit of such accounts.
5.04      Recently, steps were taken that could result in indexation of
loans with maturities of more than one year. The first steps, however, have
been tentative -- indexation is currently only an option whose use is left at
the discretion of financial institutions -- and it is not clear whether the
new system will take hold, and whether Congress will ratify it in its present



- 25 -
form (para 3.03). Until its outcome becomes clearer, onlending rates under
the proposed project would be based on the existing non-indexed system.
However, should indexation be ratified in its basic current form, indexing of
loans would also be made available on an optional basis to beneficiaries under
the proposed project. When the law regulating indexed loans is enacted,
COFIDE would prepare policies and procedures satisfactory to the Bank for
indexed onlending. The minimum requirements for indexed lending would be that
the cost of money to beneficiaries and spreads to intermediaries be the same
as under the current non-indexed lending system (paras. 5.05 and 5.06 below),
and that the same amount of indexed funds onlent by intermediaries be indexed
by the BCR in its loan to COFIDE. Confirmation of the BCR's agreement to
these principles was obtained during negotiations. The Central Bank has
indicated that its policy would be to maintain the cost of capital under the
new system at the same acceptable levels of the present system. Reduced debt
servicing burdens resulting from indexation would very likely be beneficial to
most SSE, although additional training in financial management and budgeting
may be required.
5.05      COFIDE would refinance or discount loans made by eligible inter-
mediaries for the same periods as the loans received by SSEs, and at a rate
equivalent to the TRB plus 2% for loans of up to US$10,000 equivalent, TRB
plus 3% for loans between US$10,000 and US$40,000, and TRB plus 4% for loans
above US$40,000, all payable monthly. This will provide COFIDE with a
nominal spread of about 3% on average (an effective spread of about 4.4%).
The differential rates to intermediaries would allow intermediaries a higher
spread on the smaller loans which would be more costly to evaluate and process,
and to COFIDE a higher spread on larger loans which would be above COFIDE's
free limits to intermediaries and would thus require further appraisal by
COFIDE. The higher spread on smaller loans would also be expected to provide
intermediaries with an incentive for lending to the smaller enterprises among
SSE.  These terms and conditions were confirmed during negotiations, including
agreement on the use of repayments from loans made under the project for
further onlending for the purposes and under the same terms and conditions of
the project.
5.06      Eligible intermediaries would onlend Bank and BCR resources to SSE
for periods ranging between not less than two years and up to ten years,
including a grace period of up to three years, when the investment is for
fixed assets and related working capital; and for periods of not less than one
and a half years and up to five years, including a grace period of up to two
years, when the investment is for permanent working capital for utilization of
installed idle production capacity. Interest rates would be at up to the pre-
vailing maximum rate allowed for term lending (currently 54% nominal), would not
include commissions, and would be payable quarterly (thus making the effective
interest rate reach 65.95%). Intermediaries would be allowed to charge interest
monthly but would be required to adjust the nominal rates so as not to exceed
the effective rate with quarterly payments. These rates would be positive when
compared to the current rate of inflation (about 50% over the past four months
on an annual basis after having reached 75% to 80% in the early months of
1981), and would allow intermediaries a nominal spread of from 8% to 10% (on
average about 10.4% effective). These spreads allow the intermediary a reason-
able profit after covering estimated processing and risk costs of some 7% tco



- 26 -
8% depending on loan size. These terms and conditions were confirmed during
negotiations. On their portion of their participation in short-term financing
of subprojects, intermediaries would be free to charge any interest rates,
commissions, and other charges allowed to them by prevailing BCR regulations.
5.07      The above procedure for establishing interest rates is based on
the Central Bank's TRB and maximum allowed commercial rates, both of which
are changed from time to time. This procedure has the advantage of following
standard practice in the Peruvian financial system (most rates are set in
points above the TRB) and of providing an automatic mechanism for adjusting
lending rates upon changes in the TRB and the rate of devaluation which, under
current policies would reflect the rate of differential inflation between Peru
and the rest of the world. This system has the further advantage that when the
country's structure of interest rates is modified, all interest rates on out-
standing loans are also adjusted. During negotiations it was agreed that
should such policy be abandoned a revision to the procedure for establishing
lending rates for project resources would have to be agreed upon to assure
that these remain competitive and adequately reflect expected levels of
inflation, and that the spreads to intermediaries remain reasonable and
competitive with other lending programs.
Administration of the Project
5.08      For many years BIP was practically the only financial institution
channeling term resources to SSE (paras 3.04 and 3.05). Since July 1980, the
new Government has been reviewing the role of public sector financial insti-
tutions, particularly those channelling term resources. As part of the result-
ing reallocation of functions, foreign term resource mobilization is being
conducted predominantly by COFIDE in its capacity as financial agent for
medium- and long-term foreign borrowings of public enterprises, and by Banco
de la Nacion in a similar role for the Central Government. COFIDE was also
assigned the role of major wholesaler of term resources, both local and
foreign. In this capacity, COFIDE would be the executing agency for the
proposed project. Project resources would in turn be retailed by eligible
financial intermediaries.
5.09      COFIDE was established in 1971 as an autonomous state enterprise.
As part of the ongoing realignment of public sector financial institutions
channeling term resources, COFIDE recently went through a fundamental reassess-
ment of its role. The outcome has been a reorientation of COFIDE's objectives
and priorities. COFIDE is divesting itself of its frozen investments in
industries nationalized through 1979 and will now concentrate on development
banking functions. A major objective of COFIDE will be to expand its lending
operations to the private sector, and to increase the coverage of that sector
by channeling increasing amounts of term capital, particularly foreign
resources, through financial intermediaries. Although COFIDE began lending
through intermediaries in 1978, it did not initially actively promote this
method of lending because it lacked the organizational capability to do so.
COFIDE's Board of Directors remedied this situation with the organizational
changes it approved on September 23, 1980, and which included the creation of
a new Financial Intermediaries Division along with COFIDE's other two operat-
ing divisions. The new division has been partly staffed with personnel



- 27 -
experienced in dealing with intermediaries as a result of the transfer to
COFIDE on November 13, 1980, of four specialized funds operated by the Central
Bank. 1/
5.10      The Government exercises its authority over COFIDE through the
Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), and COFIDE's Board of Directors.
COFIDE's organization includes a seven-member Board of Directors and a Credit
Commmittee. The Board, which is COFIDE's highest authority, is appointed by
the MEF (Annex 2, T-13). The members of the Board and the senior management
have the experience, skills and capacity to carry out this role successfully.
Under the General Manager, who is mainly responsible for day-to-day operations,
operational responsibilities have functionally been assigned to the new
Resources, Operations, and Financial Intermediaries divisions (Annex 2, C-1).
COFIDE's second-level management and professional staff are competent and
experienced. For the management of the proposed project, a special unit was
created in the Financial Intermediaries Division. This new unit is now
staffed by two professionals and a third would be added upon project approval,
which would be adequate for the management of the proposed project.
5.11      The recent expansion of COFIDE's lending operations through finan-
cial intermediaries made necessary the preparation of a comprehensive set of
policies to govern these activities, and which were approved by COFIDE's
Board in June, 1981. Except for the need to expand on policies applicable to
lending for SSE to or through financial intermediaries, the existing overall
policies and procedures are adequate. During project preparation a draft set
of policies and a comprehensive operations manual (document B7 in the Project
File--Annex 3) to govern onlending to SSE were prepared. During negotiations
agreement was reached on approval of policies by COFIDE's Board and operat-
ing procedures by COFIDE's and BCR's senior management, both satisfactory to
the Bank, as a condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. Agreement was
recently reached with COFIDE on the appointment of independent auditors,
acceptable to the Bank, to prepare annually full audit reports following the
long form format for DFCs associated with the Bank.
5.12      At year-end 1980, COFIDE had total assets of SI. 272.7 billion
($796 million). Long-term borrowings amounted to SI. 83.1 billion ($254 mil-
lion) and total equity stood at SI. 67.8 billion ($198 million). The S/. 31.8
billion ($93 million) in paid-in capital is fully owned by the Government.
(Annex 2, T-14.) Since mid-1978, COFIDE's operations have grown substantially
in line with Peru's overall economic recovery. Geographically, operations
have been reasonably well distributed. By maturity, 75% of COFIDE's loans and
guarantees during the same period were for more than 5 years and 18% were for
2 to 5 years. (Annex 2, T-16 and T-17.) COFIDE's exposure reached S/. 269
billion ($785 million) at year-end 1980. On the whole, the quality and
management of COFIDE's portfolio are adequate. Arrears over 90 days affected
only 6.2% of the loan portfolio, and exposure to companies in arrears consti-
tuted only 5% of COFIDE's overall exposure (Annex 2, T-18 to T-20). Provisions
1/   A more detailed description and appraisal of COFIDE is included in the
SAR for the Second Industrial Credit Project for Peru (Report No. 3238-PE
dated March 12, 1981).



- 28 -
for bad debts and losses in value of the investments portfolio are also
adequate. COFIDE has an adequate financial structure (with a long-term
debt to equity ratio of 2.9 to 1 in 1980) as well as a satisfactory liquidity
situation (with a current ratio of 1.6 to 1 in 1980). However, COFIDE's
profitability, although improving during recent years, has remained low. In
1980 net profits after taxes were equivalent to 4.5% of equity--well below the
opportunity cost of capital in Peru. In line with Government policy to raise
interest rates to positive levels in real terms, COFIDE's management approved
in January 1981 a new structure of interest rates and guarantee fees that will
allow a more adequate return on equity. With the new structure of interest
rates and the divestiture of equity investments in nationalized basic indus-
tries, the Bank estimates that COFIDE's financial position will remain adequate
and that its return on equity will gradually increase to satisfactory levels.
5.13      Technical Assistance to COFIDE.  COFIDE has given particular impor-
tance to upgrading the technical and managerial competence of its staff, and
the project appraisal capabilities of both its staff and of the staff of the
financial intermediaries it deals with. Accordingly, COFIDE requested that a
US$750,000 technical assistance component be added to the proposed project to
finance the foreign exchange costs of a US$900,000 program to upgrade the
capabilities of its staff and that of financial intermediaries. The program
would essentially consist of three subprograms: (i) training of the staff
of COFIDE and financial intermediaries on project appraisal and lending
techniques, including the comprehensive training programs for loan officers
of financial intermediaries dealing with SSE (para. 5.15). Under this sub-
program COFIDE would sponsor, and in some cases carry out itself, comprehensive
courses and seminars; (ii) a young executive development program within COFIDE,
including inservice training with international banks, both in Peru and over-
seas, and scholarships for post-graduate studies abroad. At least eight young
executives would receive training abroad over the next two years; and
(iii) training of middle level executives of the Financial Resources Division,
particularly the International Department, in foreign resource mobilization
and cofinancing. This would allow COFIDE to play a more important and effec-
tive role in its capacity as financial agent for term foreign borrowings of
public enterprises (para. 5.08). Outside consultants would be contracted to
provide guidance in organizing a unit which would specialize in mobilizing
foreign resources both for COFIDE and, through cofinancing, for its public
and private sector clients. COFIDE's staff would be trained overseas through
inservice programs with international banks and export financing institutions.
In addition Bank staff and consultants would assist COFIDE's staff to estab-
lish close working relationships with exterior official and private financing
institutions.
Participation of Intermediaries
5.14         All financial intermediaries legally established in Peru and in
good standing with the BCR would be eligible in principle for participation
under the proposed project. Institutions currently meeting the eligibility
criteria include state development banks, financieras, commercial and regional
banks. Commercial and regional banks would require a special permission from
BCR to undertake long-term lending operations (para. 3.15), and to charge up
to the maximum rate allowed for term lending in Peru. Such exemptions from



- 29 -
current banking regulations are commonly extended by the BCR for special lend-
ing programs, and their extension to the proposed project was confirmed during
negotiations as a condition of loan effectiveness. Before signing participa-
tion contracts, the Financial Intermediaries Division of COFIDE would ensure
that the specific intermediaries meet the above criteria, as well as the
conditions set forth in COFIDE's policies for financial intermediation,
particularly regarding sound financial practices and project appraisal capa-
bilities. New types of financial intermediaries or existing institutions
2        subject to a revised legal framework may be considered for participation in
the project if they comply with the general requirements of the BCR, and are
willing to participate under the policies and operating procedures of the
proposed project.
5.15      During negotiations agreement was reached with COFIDE, whereby
COFIDE would sponsor a training program for loan officers of financial inter-
mediaries. The training program would go well beyond upgrading the appraisal
capabilities of loan officers. Over the course of 16 weeks (tentatively
6 weeks full-time after banking hours to the public, 8 weeks part-time,
and 2 weeks evening courses) loan officers would be exposed and sensitized to
the problems and needs of SSE, and to the lending and profit opportunities
available to financial institutions operating in the SSE sector. Since most
operations of the financial sector outside of Lima are with SSE, the first two
courses would be in Arequipa and, tentatively, Trujillo. It is expected that
a greater knowledge of their clients and of the profit opportunities that can
can open up to their institutions from healthy and growing SSE would result in
loan officers making an important contribution toward supporting and providing
some important technical assistance to the sector. A draft course outline,
procedures for coordination and execution, including identification of possi-
ble professorial staff, and a tentative budget (about US$18,000 per course)
have been prepared.
Eligible Beneficiaries and Lending Limits
5.16      Enterprises with annual sales of up to US$750,000 equivalent and fixed
assets, excluding land, of up to US$300,000 equivalent before the new investment
in all productive, distributive or service activities, except agriculture, but
including construction and agroindustry, would be eligible for financing under
the project. According to available statistics these limits are essentially
equivalent for the average firm.  Furthermore, the sales limit is in line with
the new definition included in the draft industrial law presently before
Congress, and not much higher than existing definitions (para. 2.09). Based
on mission findings, the definition adopted here would allow the lending pro-
gram under the project to overlap with other lending programs for medium and
large industry only sufficiently to assure that term credit is available to
the whole size-spectrum of enterprises. Nevertheless, to avoid excessive use
of resources by enterprises in the borderline between small and medium, and by
those which are sufficiently large to have access to other credit programs,
the maximum investment eligible for financing under the project would be
US$200,000. This limit should also help assure use of project resources by
a larger number of small enterprises. Based on the experience gained from
existing SSE lending programs, it is expected that the average subloan size
would be about US$25,000.



- 30 -
5.17      COFIDE would refinance or discount 90% of the loans made by inter-
mediaries for fixed assets and permanent working capital. In the case of new
enterprises such loans would not exceed 80% of the investment required to
establish the new enterprise. For expansion of existing capacity or for
permanent working capital with which to use idle capacity, whether, and in
what proportion the beneficiary should participate with risk capital of his
own would be left at the discretion of the financial intermediary. In such
cases the intermediary would base his decision on the adequacy of the capital-
ization of enterprises that are already established. Bank participation would
be limited to a maximum of 50% of the investments in fixed assets or permanent
working capital, which is the estimated direct and indirect foreign exchange
content for the expected typical subproject.
Operating Procedures and Free Limits
5.18      The proposed project would be handled by COFIDE only at the whole-
sale level by discounting or refinancing loans by participating intermediaries.
The unit that would manage the project (para 5.10) has already prepared draft
operating procedures for the purpose (para 5.11). Given the small size and
large number of subloans expected under the project, an automatic discount
mechanism would be used for most subloans. This would be equivalent to a free
limit given by COFIDE to the intermediaries below which the only information
required would consist of a list of the basic features of the firm and the
investment being financed, and the terms and conditions of the subloan to
prove eligibility. Upon presentation of such information COFIDE would auto-
matically discount the corresponding percentage of the subloan. Documentation
evidencing the final expenditure would be forwarded to COFIDE ex-post. Other
detailed documentation for the subloan, including the list of goods financed,
would remain with the intermediary, available for ex-post sample review by
COFIDE and the Bank. For subloans above COFIDE's free limit to intermediaries,
evaluation and approval of subprojects would be done by COFIDE's Financial
Intermediaries Division. Free limits for each intermediary would be estab-
lished by COFIDE in its intermediation contracts, and would be arrived at after
careful appraisal of each intermediary, including its SSE lending evaluation
capabilities, by COFIDE's Financial Intermediaries Division. Based on the
appraisal mission's findings tentative free limits were developed by type of
intermediary: for BIP at least US$100,000 based on its extensive experience
and capabilities in SSE lending; for other development, commercial and regional
banks, and financieras about US$70,000; and for credit cooperatives and other
intermediaries about US$40,000. These, however, are only guidelines for
COFIDE to use in arriving at a final figure on a case by case basis for each
intermediary. It is expected that COFIDE would review from 5% to 10% of the
subprojects.
5.19      Given the small size of the maximum subloan under the project
(US$180,000 including only US$100,000 of Bank funds), detailed Bank review of
subprojects would take place ex-post on a sample basis during supervision
missions. Because of the expected large number of subloans under the project,
an ex-post random sample of subprojects regardless of size would be more
indicative of the quality of appraisals being made by intermediaries than the
selected sample that would result from the Bank reviewing ex-ante only the
largest projects sent by COFIDE to the Bank. Choosing for ex-ante review by
the Bank the first two or three subprojects, regardless of size, of each



- 31 -
intermediary would also not result in a meaningful sample because of the large
number of branch offices of many banks and the likely difference in appraisal
quality from one branch to another.
Procurement, Disbursement and Audit
5.20      Because of the large number of small subprojects expected under
the project, procurement would be made by SSE following standard commercial
practice.  It is expected that most goods will be purchased locally and
since it would not be practicable to determine the foreign exchange content
of each individual subproject, Bank disbursement would be based on the 50%
estimated foreign exchange content of the average investment made by SSE.
Accordingly, for each subproject financed under the proposed project, the
Bank would reimburse COFIDE for up to 100% of its participation in the financ-
ing provided that the Bank's participation does not exceed 50% of the cost of
the machinery, equipment, installation, civil works, or permanent working
capital, that make up the investment for the subproject.
5.21      Bank disbursements for subloans to SSEs would be made against state-
ments of expenditure issued and certified by COFIDE for specific subprojects.
The detailed documentation evidencing the final expenditures would be retained
by COFIDE for inspection by the Bank in the course of project supervision.
Applications requesting Bank authorization to withdraw for subprojects would
include information required under the Bank's Subproject Data System for DFCs.
Because all subloans under the proposed project will be made by second-tier
financial intermediaries, expenditures made not more than 180 days prior to
Bank receipt of the corresponding withdrawal requests would be eligible for
Bank reimbursement. All technical assistance expenditures would require prior
Bank approval, for which purpose COFIDE would from time to time present
discrete programs for approval by the Bank. Consultants would be hired in
accordance with Bank guidelines. Disbursement would be made against the
documentation normally required for technical assistance financing. During
negotiations confirmation was obtained that COFIDE keep separate accounts
for the project and that a special audit of such accounts and of the state-
ments of expenditure and supporting documentation be made as part of the
annual independent external audit of COFIDE. The final date for submission of
approval requests would be December 31, 1984, and the closing date December 31,
1985.
Project Benefits and Risks
5.22      The proposed project would enhance the development of the SSE
sector and the generation of new job opportunities at a relatively low
capital cost. Investment cost per job is expected to range between US$4,000
and US$6,000 (paras. 2.19 and 2.20). Thus, the proposed project would
generate about 10,000 new jobs. The project would also result in increased
competition between financial institutions and better service for SSE. The
technical assistance component would strengthen the institutional development
of COFIDE (para. 5.13); and the program to upgrade the capabilities of
the loan officers of intermediaries (paras 4.09, 4.15 and 5.15) would
help improve the delivery of existing technical assistance programs. The
proposed project would also further strengthen COFIDE's role as a whole-
saler of term resources through a wide range of financial intermediaries.
With this project COFIDE would be reaching and helping develop new financial
intermediaries with which it had not previously worked, particularly



- 32 -
credit cooperatives. Finally, regional banks and the large network of
regional branch offices of commercial banks would allow increased channelling
of term resources to areas outside of Lima, thus contributing to further
decentralization of economic activity.
5.23         While the project does not involve unusual risks regarding
attainment of its major objectives, the term credit processing capacity of
intermediaries, other than BIP, may somewhat delay the speed with which the
entire financial system becomes involved in term lending to SSE. The incen-
tives to handle term credit are nonetheless high since intermediaries would be
in a better position to offer a wider range of services to what is by far
their largest potential market in terms of the number of industrial borrowers.
This is particularly true outside of Lima where the number of medium and large
enterprises is very small relative to SSE. Another risk is the interfacing
between COFIDE and BIP, the only institution that has to-date specialized in
term lending to SSE, since this is a completely new arrangement for BIP in its
mobilization of resources for financing SSE. Misunderstandings between the
two institutions could delay project implementation. This risk, however, is
mitigated by the simplified appraisal criteria and processing procedures that
have been developed for the project based in great measure on BIP's own
procedures. Also, the free limits that would be allowed BIP are relatively
high and in line with the free limits that BIP itself allows its branch
offices. Finally, regardless of the level of BIP participation, the SSE
sector would be benefiting substantially from the increased competition among
intermediaries and the larger financing options that would become available
to the sector.
VI. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION

6.01      During loan negotiations agreements were reached on the following:
(a) With the Government on provision of the loan guarantee;
(b)  With the Central Bank on
(i)  loan amount, local counterpart, and terms and conditions
for onlending to COFIDE, including the maintenance of value
of the Bank resources onlent to COFIDE, the keeping of separate

(ii)  exemptions from current regulations to allow commercial and
regional banks to make loans of more than one and five years,
respectively, and to allow such banks to lend at rates up to
the maximum allowed for term lending operations (para. 5.14);



- 33 -

(i)  a draft policy statement for SSE lending operations
(para. 5.11);
(ii) terms and conditions for onlending to intermediaries, including
onlending of repayments (para. 5.05) and to SSE (para. 5.06); a
periodic review of these, including immediate review of the
method for establishing interest rates and spreads should the
current policies for establishing the TRB change (para. 5.07);
and the terms and the development of policies and procedures
for possible future indexed onlending (para. 5.04);

(paras. 5.20 and 5.21).
6.02      The following would be conditions of loan effectiveness:
(i)  approval by COFIDE's Board of the policies and COFIDE's
and BCR's management of the operating procedures for lending
to SSE (para. 5.11); and
(ii) extension by the BCR of the necessary exemptions to allow
commercial and regional banks to engage in term operations
under the project (para. 5.14).
Recommendation
6.03      The proposed project would constitute a suitable basis for a Bank
loan to the Central Bank of Peru, guaranteed by the Republic of Peru, of
US$26 million equivalent with a term of 15 years, including four years of
grace, at the prevailing interest rate (currently 11.6% per annum).

1/ Affected refers to the company that is in arrears; that is, although a company with two or more loans may only be in arrears in one of them, it is here assumed that
all of the company's loans are affected. Thus, the number of loans and corresponding amounts are those of the companies in arrears and not just the loans in arrears.
2 Commissions on guarantees and penalty charges on arrears.
3/  State enterprises account for 76% of the loans and 60% of the amounts outstanding affected by arrears of less than 3 months.
4/ PETROPERU is presented separately because although in arrears over 12 months on some accounts, these accounts represent obligations it assumed from another enterprise                                        -
(ALAMBRESA) and which are in the process of being reviewed and renegotiated; thus, although technically in default, PETROPERIJ does not nerit being classed
as a risk based on arrears the cause of which is known and in the process of being corrected.
