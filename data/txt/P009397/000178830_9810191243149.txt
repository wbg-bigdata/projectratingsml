Rate of Natural
Increase:          Difference between crude birth and crude death rate;
usually expressed as a percentage.
..
Rate of Population

of population has declined from 2.8% in 1975 1/ to about 2.5% in 1978, owing
to a fall in the birth rate from 47 to an estimated level of 44 during this
period. 2/ This decline, if confirmed, is significant but not sufficiently
substantial to make an impact on socio-economic conditions.
1.02      A child born in Bangladesh today faces prospects of a grim life.
Life expectancy at birth is about 42 years; one-fifth of children die before
the age of five. Tetanus, diptheria and diarrhea are major causes of infant
and child mortality; scabies, respiratory infections and worm infestations,
are prevalent. About 16% of the children from 0-5 years are wasted and
stunted because of acute and chronic malnutrition and the growth of another
58% is stunted by chronic undernutrition. 3/ Because one-third of pregnant
and lactating mothers suffer from calorie deficiency, their children are weak
and vulnerable. Communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy,
and diarrhea account for a large proportion of morbidity and mortality. About
90% of the people live in the rural areas where, although agriculture is the
main occupation, about 45% of families are landless. No less than one-third
of the labor force is either unemployed or underemployed. Per capita income
of about US$90 (in 1977) is one of the lowest in the world, while the depen-
dency ratio of about 95 is one of the highest in the world. Therefore, an
average family of six members must survive on about US$45 per month; for the
many families whose incomes are below the average, one full meal a day is a
luxury. Only about 23% of the population is literate; the illiterates are
generally poorer and have larger families. 4/
1/   The population program, disrupted after independence, was re-established
in 1975, which can be considered as the base year for measuring program
performance. The first population project, supported by IDA, Australia,
Canada, the Federal Republic of Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United
Kingdom, also became effective in September 1975.

1.03      A continuing high birth rate will exacerbate these desperate
conditions, and the prospects for better health and education and of conse-
quent improvement in welfare will become even more uncertain. Realizing the
gravity of the threat, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) has accorded popula-
tion control the highest priority in its development program and proposes to
attack the problem by means of more concerted efforts to: (a) improve health
and education; (b) reduce infant, child and maternal mortality; (c) raise
the socio-economic status of women through vocational training programs;
(d) change the outlook of the rural population by the use of mass media;
(f) deliver contraceptive services to people at home; and (g) enlist community
support for population planning.
B. Demographic Trends
1.04      Bangladesh's population has doubled since 1951.  The rate of growth,
which is close to the natural rate since migration is negligible, rose from
1% in the early fifties to about 2.8% in the mid-seventies, mainly because
of a rapid decline in the death rate. Data are summarized in the following
table and details are given in Annex 7, T-1 and T-2.

1.05      The Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS) estimated that in 1975 the
birth rate was 47 and the death rate 19. These figures are close to the
census estimates for 1974. Although no reliable data for 1978 are available,
the GOB estimates that the birth rate may have fallen to 44 1/ and that the
death rate may have remained constant at 19.
1.06      Due to constant high fertility and mortality in the past, the pro-
portion of population below 15 years has remained almost constant at over
45% of the population during 1961 and 1974 (Annex 7, T-3). The average age
of marriage in 1974 was 15.9 years for females and 24.0 years for males.
1/ The basis of this estimate is an increase in the contraceptive prevalence
rate as revealed by surveys conducted during 1978.



C. Demographic Prospects and Implications
1.07      The implications of population growth can be analyzed by considering
the consequences of two assumptions about the decline of fertility over the
next seventy years. The first, and optimistic, assumption is that the two-
child family will become the norm by the turn of the century or, in technical
terms, that the net reproduction rate (NRR) will fall to one by 2000-2005.
The second, and perhaps more realistic, assumption is that the two-child
family norm (i.e., a NRR of one) will not be reached until 2030-35. To assess
the implications of different rates of decline in fertility, the same decline
of mortality is assumed in both cases, so that life expectancy would increase
in both cases from about 48 years at present to 54 years by the end of the
century, and reach the level of developed countries (70 years) in 2085.
1.08      On the first assumption, the natural rate of growth of population
would decline to below 1.5% by 2000; the population would be more than twice
the present size by 2030, and would become stationary at about 212 million by
2165. On the second assumption, the natural rate of growth would remain above
2% until the end of the century, and the population would be nearly three
times its present size in 2030, becoming stationary at more than 330 million--
four times its present size--by 2165. Thus a delay of 30 years in reducing
fertility to the replacement level would add more than 100 million to
Bangladesh's population (more than its present size) before it became
stationary. Data are given in Annex 7, T-4.
1.09      Although the implications of population growth for Bangladesh's
development prospects under the optimistic first assumption are serious
enough, those under the second are staggering. It is evident that Bangladesh's
chances of meeting even the basic needs of its population will dwindle with
every delay in reducing the rate of growth of population. For example, even
on the first assumption, arable land per person will decline from the present
meager 0.3 acre to 0.2 acre by 2000, and will fall as low as 0.18 acres under
the second assumption. At the same time, annual food grain requirements, even
at the current low level (16 ozs per day), will rise from 14 million tons in
1975 to 27 million tons in 2000, compared with less than 24 million tons under
the first assumption. An unprecedented increase in yield per acre would there-
fore be necessary to maintain consumption at a subsistence level (Annex 7, T-5).
Under the first assumption, an investment of about US$14 billion would be
required by the turn of the century to provide schools for every child in the
5-14 age group. The required investment would be at least one billion higher
under the second assumption. The labor force would increase from about 26
million in 1973 to about 89 million in 2050 under the first assumption, and
to 113 million under the second assumption. Therefore, if a NRR of one were
attained by 2000-2005, 63 million more jobs would be needed by 2050; if, on
the other hand, the NRR did not fall to one until 2030-2035, over 87 million
more jobs would be needed. Given the low rate of economic growth in the past
and the extent of current unemployment and underemployment, it would clearly
be impossible to provide employment on the scale called for by either assump-
tion (Annex 7, T-6).

II.   NATIONAL POPULATION AND HEALTH POLICIES, STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMS
A. Policies
Population
2.01      Voluntary efforts to promote family planning during the 1950s
led to the adoption of a national program in the early 1960s.  In 1965, the
Government set itself the task of reducing the rate of growth of population
from 3% in 1965 to 2.5% in 1970 by reducing the birth rate from 50 to 40 and
the death rate from 20 to 15. At the same time, it established a network of
family planning clinics administered by an autonomous Family Planning Board,
independent of the health service. The program suffered from weaknesses of
policy and administration and a lack of full-time field workers, and conse-
quently had little effect on fertility. The BFS of 1975-76 showed no sig-
nificant change in fertility since 1966-68. The total fertility rate was
estimated at about 6.3 by BFS and 6.0 by the National Impact Survey (NIS)
conducted in 1966-68. However, the program sharpened public awareness of
population issues and modern contraceptive methods, and thus created a latent
demand for family planning. According to BFS, about 82% of the respondents
knew about family planning, compared with the NIS figure of 62%.
2.02      In 1972-73, immediately after Bangladesh became independent, the
family planning activities came to a virtual halt. Program performance fell
to an all-time low and its methods and organization were found unsuitable.
One of the main issues at this time was whether the vertical family planning
program should be continued, or whether health and family planning services
should be integrated. It was against this background that the GOB prepared
its First Five-Year Plan (1973-78), which called for a decline in fertility
to replacement level by the end of the century. A broad-based multi-sectoral
population program described in para 2.06 was thus formulated. The target was
drastically revised in 1976 with a view to attaining a NRR of one as early as
1985 and thus containing population size to about 120 million by the end of
the century. Subsequently, the GOB realized that this revised target was
too ambitious and set 1990 as the date for reaching a NRR of one. Even this
target is too ambitious in relation to program capacity and socio-economic
conditions, as shown in paras. 2.39-2.43.
2.03      These ambitious targets reflect GOB's realization of the need for
drastic action. Based on the progress of the program to date and the experi-
ence of other countries, it would appear unlikely that these goals can be
reached. It should be recognized that unrealizable targets are not only
frustrating to program staff but, more seriously, jeopardize development
itself if economic planning is based on them. The GOB is, however, consider-
ing various unconventional measures during the Second Five-Year Plan period
(1980-85) to achieve an unprecedented decline in fertility. These measures
include a four-year birth moratorium to be implemented through community
participation, giving awards to successful villages, providing special



- 5--
health care to these villages, raising the legal age at marriage, devising new
ways of extending family planning services, expanding the participation of the
private sector in the family planning program and sanctioning flexible finan-
cial and administrative procedures for PCFPD.
2.04      To implement the current policy effectively, the GOB proposes to
prepare a plan of action geared to achieving the demographic targets to
be measured in terms of contraceptive prevalence rates during the next five
years.  This plan of action will be used as a management tool to review and
monitor program progress.
Health
2.05      As a result of the control of epidemics alone, the death rate
declined drastically from about 38 in 1951 to 19 in 1974. The first Five-
Year Plan, pending the census results, assumed a death rate of 17 in 1973 and
envisaged a decline to 15 in 1978. This goal has now been postponed until
1985 on the basis of an analysis made by the World Health Organization (WHO)
in its country health programming exercise. 1/ (The reduction in deaths
from various causes necessary to achieve this decline are given in Annex 7,
T-7.) The Ministry of Health and Population Control (MOHPC) is now planning
to set up a data collection system and to lay down targets for reductions in
mortality and morbidity. A health policy statement, currently under prepa-
ration, in connection with the Second Five-Year Plan is expected to be final-
ized by July 1979. The objectives of this health policy are: (a) provision
of primary health care to meet priority health needs; (b) development of
health manpower to render primary health care; (c) integration of the program
for communicable disease control with general health services; (d) provision
of specialized services in health care institutions; (e) reorientation of
drug production and procurement--linking availability with health priorities;
(f) promoting industrial and school health; (g) provision of safe drinking
water and waste disposal facilities; and (h) development of a health informa-
tion system.
B. Strategies
Population
2.06      The current strategies were adopted during the first Five-Year
Plan. The Plan envisaged that by 1978:
(a)  the family planning program would be integrated with the
health service;
(b)  health and family planning services would be delivered in rural
areas through home visits by 10,000-11,000 teams of field workers,
with one team (one male and one female) for every 8,000 people, and
one rural health center and about three subcenters would be estab-
lished in each of the 356 rural thanas (about 160 rural health
centers and 180 subcenters existed in the country at that time);

- 6 -
(c)  educational and motivational efforts would be made by all
ministries that maintain wide public contact, e.g., the Minis-
tries of Agriculture; Education; Labor and Social Welfare; Local
Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives; and Information
and Broadcasting;
(d)  voluntary family planning organizations would be given
encouragement and support;
(e)  the GOB would consider applying strong incentives after the
second child, legalizing abortion and introducing measures for
the emancipation of women; and
(f)  a central Population Planning Division would be established to
coordinate the multi-sectoral population program and population
policy would be formulated by a National Population Council.
It is to the GOB's credit that it has acted on all the above strategies,
naturally with differing degrees of completeness and success as described
below.
2.07      In 1973, the family planning program was integrated with health services
and the Ministry of Health, which was renamed the Ministry of Health, Population
Control and Family Planning (MOHPP), was made responsible for the family
planning program. In 1975, a Population Planning Division was established
under the MOHPC for coordinating the population program and family planning
services were taken out of the Health Division and entrusted to the Popula-
tion Planning Division. Maternal and child health (MCH) services were soon
transferred to this Division, which was then renamed the Population Control
and Family Planning Division (PCFPD) (para. 2.20 and 2.21). Thus, integration
of MCH and family planning services was retained. However, inadequate co-
operation in the utilization of personnel and facilities by the two divisions
has created serious problems for delivery of MCH/FP services. Recently the
MOHPP has again been renamed as Ministry of Health and Population Control
(MOHPC).
2.08      Although PCFPD has recruited about 12,500 full-time female family
welfare assistants (FWAs) for field work, they are not yet working as teams
with family welfare workers (FWWs), their male counterparts in the Health
Division.  By 1978, only about 165 thana health complexes (THCs) and, more
seriously, only about 400 union-level family welfare centers (FWCs) were in
operation.
2.09      By 1976, the five ministries mentioned in the Plan, as well as
the MOHPC, were conducting population/family life education and information
programs. This multi-sectoral approach has been effective in drawing atten-
tion to population growth as a family, as well as a national, problem and in
creating a considerable demand for family planning services.
2.10      The GOB has encouraged private sector efforts.  An institute to
coordinate private sector activities was set up in 1978. A large contracep-
tive marketing project and a sterilization program conducted by two private
agencies have provided about one-fourth of the family planning services.



2.11      Although no legal measures or disincentives have been adopted, a
study of the fertility impact of national laws has been completed. Pilot
schemes designed to raise the socio-economic status of women have yielded
encouraging results in terms of increasing earning capacity and family plan-
ning acceptance and will be expanded during the second project period. The
National Population Council has been set up (para. 2.17).
2.12      In addition to implementation of the above strategies, the GOB has
been experimenting, during the past two years, with various types of schemes
to encourage community participation in the population sector program. Notable
among them is the success achieved by the self-reliant village scheme. In
about 9,000 villages, leaders have been trained to plan and implement important
development programs. Committees at village level are formed for different
types of sectoral development programs including population. An evaluation
of the scheme by the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies in 20 sample
villages concluded that the scheme had a definite, positive impact on produc-
tion, mainly as a result of better irrigation facilities promoted by it. It
also made a positive contribution to the population control program: "The
village-level organizations facilitated discussions among local people and
government officials about the usefulness of family planning and its methods.
As a result, a large majority of heads of households came to approve family
planning and quite a significant proportion of them were currently practicing
family planning methods." In two intensive-input villages, 30% and 47% of
the respondents were practicing family planning (Annex 7, T-8).
2.13      On the other hand, the report points out that the level of people's
participation in the use of local resources and the benefits to poorer sec-
tions of the community were limited. Its replicability is not ensured since
the participants in the program relied heavily on Government resources. It
is important that these defects are remedied before the scheme is expanded
beyond a pilot phase.
Health
2.14      The First Five-Year Plan provided for a shift of emphasis from
curative to preventive health care and the delivery of both health and family
planning services in rural areas by teams of FWAs and FWWs with the support of
THCs and FWCs. In order to surmount the obstacle to the extension of rural
health services presented by the shortage of doctors, preventive and curative
services were to be entrusted as far as possible to paramedicals and auxil-
iaries; for this purpose, a new category of medical assistants (MAs) was to be
created. Health services staff were to be trained in community medicine, and
a system for data collection was to be organized.
2.15      Progress has not been as fast as was hoped.  As mentioned, the
construction and staffing of THCs has been slow. There has been negligible
progress towards the collection of health data. The eight THCs now being
constructed under the first project will provide field training facilities
for community medicine. Four training schools for MAs have been established.



- 8 -
2.16      The strategy to provide primary health care as envisaged in the
health policy under preparation now is to: (a) make village health workers
accountable to village health committees; (b) develop a referral system;
(c) provide one doctor for 5,000 population, one nurse per four beds and
one "village doctor" per village by 1985; (d) review and revise basic health
workers' functions; (e) control tuberculosis, leprosy and worm infestation;
and (f) extend rural water supply to cover all areas.
C. Organization
Policy Formulation and Coordination
2.17      National population policy is formulated by a National Population
Council consisting of representatives of the interested ministries and
agencies and chaired by the President. A Central Coordination Committee
comprising the secretaries of these ministries and presided over by the
Minister of Health and Population Control coordinates the multi-sectoral
information, education and motivation (IEM) program and service delivery
program. The GOB proposes to set up a National Health Council to advise on
health policy.
2.18      Coordinating committees have also been set up at district and thana
levels. Similar committees for unions and villages are being set up (Annex 7,
C-1).
Implementation
2.19      The MOHPC is responsible for coordination and implementation of the
health and population program. Other ministries and voluntary organizations
assist in the implementation of the program.
2.20      MOHPC.  The MOHPC is divided into two divisions--PCFPD and Health
Division. The PCFPD is responsible for the MCH and population program; the
Health Division is responsible for the remainder of health services. Both
divisions at headquarters level have ministerial wings call'ed the Secretar-
iats responsible for planning and monitoring, and operational wings called
the Directorates.
2.21      The PCFP Directorate has five functional units at headquarters.  It
has population control and family planning officers in district, subdivision
and thana levels for coordination and administration. At the union level,
the family planning assistant (FPA) is responsible for coordination. The
technical staff of the PCFP Directorate consists of district and thana medical
officers (MCH/FP), family welfare visitors (FWVs--paramedicals) at thana and
union levels, and family welfare assistants (FWAs--female multipurpose workers
at village level), (Annex 7, C-2).



- 9 -
2.22      The Health Division has two Directorates which administer preventive
and curative health services respectively. At the district level, a civil sur-
geon and a deputy civil surgeon are in charge of health and hospital services.
Below the district, the thana health administrator is the head of the thana
health complex (THC) and administers the entire health program in the thana.
At present, assistant health inspectors at the union level supervise FWWs.
However, the Health Division has started training medical assistants (MAs) who
will be posted at union level. FWCs will provide health care at the union
level and technical support to the FWWs who provide primary health care
at the village level (Annex 7, C-2).
2.23      Other Ministries and Agencies.  In addition to the MOHPC, the five
ministries mentioned in the Five-Year Plan (para. 2.06) serve as channels for
the dissemination of family planning information. Each of these ministries
has a population program officer appointed under the first project. Each
ministry has also strengthened its field staff to enable it to discharge its
population role. The coordination of the multi-sectoral program is achieved
through coordination committees as well as through regular meetings of popula-
tion program officers chaired by the PCFPD.
2.24      The Health and Population Planning Section of the Planning Commis-
sion reviews the budgetary allocations for the health and population programs
and is also responsible for the external evaluation of key program activities.
2.25      Voluntary Organizations.  The chief voluntary organizations partici-
pating in the health and family planning services are the Bangladesh Family
Planning Association, the Bangladesh Association for Voluntary Sterilization
and the Concerned Women for Family Planning. Others are the Christian Health
Care Project, the Companiganj Project, the People's Health Care Project and
the Family Planning Social Marketing Project. All these agencies and projects
are funded from external sources; a few of them also receive money from PCFPD.
PCFPD has a subvention committee which allocates funds to private organiza-
tions. A National Council of Voluntary Agencies was recently formed, and a
Family Planning Training and Service Center, financed by the Ford Foundation
and Family Planning International Assistance has been established to coordi-
nate and support private sector and voluntary efforts.
Management Study
2.26      A management study of the population program conducted as part of
the first project recommended that: (a) there should be a closer working
relationship between PCFPD and the Health Division; (b) the PCFPD's planning
(Secretariat) and operational wings (Directorate) should be merged; (c) the
PCFPD organization should be decentralized to the district level; (d) the
deputy commissioner at district level and the circle officer at thana level
should be involved in the administration of the family planning program;
(e) the sub-division should be developed as a supervisory tier between dis-
trict and thana; (f) union councils should help to supervise field workers;
(g) the FWV, FPA, FWA and Dai (midwife) at the union level should function as
a team; and (h) the Health Division should help in providing family planning
clinical services.



- 10 -
2.27      First, in accordance with recommendation (a) above, the Health
Division and PCFPD reached a working agreement for coordination and coopera-
tion of their activities in early 1978; furthermore, to resolve eventually
the problem of inadequate cooperation, the GOB proposes to integrate MCH/FP
with health services in well-defined phases (para. 2.47).  Second, the GOB
has recently approved a proposal for merging the PCFP Directorate and the
Division (see recommendation b). Third, the PCFPD has recently decentralized
its administration and has assigned definite functions to Deputy Commissioners
under this decentralized set up (see recommendations c and d, para. 2.48,
and Annex 7, C-3). Fourth, PCFPD has already developed a supervisory tier at
sub-division level--recommendation (e). Fifth, PCFPD is enlisting the help
of union councils in the supervision of field workers and the promotion of
family planning in villages--recommendation (f). Recommendation (g) is under
GOB's consideration; (h) will be implemented in the course of phased integra-
tion of MCH/FP with the health services.
D. Facilities
2.28      While PCFPD has its own manpower, it shares the Health Division's
physical facilties. Neither PCFPD nor Health Division has a full complement
of facilities and manpower.
2.29      While each of the 356 rural thanas, covering about 200,000 people,
should have a THC for curative and preventative health care, and for sterili-
zation and other family planning services, at present only 165 thanas have
a functioning THC. The number is expected to increase to 270 by July 1980.
Each THC comprises an outpatient clinic, a laboratory and a 31-bed hospital;
actual bed strength at present varies between 10 and 25. The full comple-
ment of THC staff consists of four medical officers, including a thana health
administrator, five staff nurses and supporting staff from the Health Divi-
sion, and one medical officer and two or three FWVs and supporting staff from
PCFPD. Because of the shortage of doctors, due to emigration and the reluc-
tance of doctors to join rural health services, only one or two of the sanc-
tioned four positions have been filled by the Health Division. PCFPD's
situation is worse, only nine of 356 positions were filled until recently,
when the Health Division assigned 100 doctors to PCFPD. Because of a general
shortage of nurses and emigration, a negligible number of staff nurses is
available for THCs. PCFPD has now trained enough FWVs to staff the THCs.
PCFPD inherited from the previous program a family planning clinic in each
thana. These clinics are being merged with the MCH/FP units at THCs. PCFPD
also has MCH centers at the district and sub-division levels.
2.30      Lack of physical facilities is more serious at the union level.
A FWC at the union level is expected to provide simple curative and preventive
health care and family planning services, with technical support from the
THC. The FWCs are the only source of institutional health care, referral
services and a base for the outreach program for about 20,000 population.
Only 400 of the 4,500 unions have FWCs, in rented inadequate premises. None
of these has a full complement of staff. The staff of a FWC consists of a MA,
a compounder and a health inspector from the Health Division, and a FWV and a



- 11 -
midwife from PCFPD. The FWWs, FWAs and FPAs use FWCs as their base station.
The first batch of MAs has just finished training and is undergoing intern-
ship. An adequate number of MAs and FWVs should be available by 1985.
2.31      Below the union level, no physical facilities exist.  The FWWS
from the Health Division and FWAs and FPAs from PCFPD deliver health and
family planning services at the village level. The FWWs are responsible for
malaria control, simple health care, referral of cases to health centers,
inoculation and health education, while FWAs and FPAs are responsible for the
delivery of contraceptives, the referral of family planning clients to clinics,
family planning motivation, and advice on MCH care. Since each worker has to
cover three or four villages, he/she can visit each household only once in
two or three months. This coverage is clearly inadequate. The situation is
made worse by inadequate technical support from the FWC or THC.
E. Financing
2.32      The annual budget of PCFPD increased from Tk 75 million (US$5
million) in 1974-75 to Tk 441 million (US$29.4 million) in 1978-79. The
allocation in 1978-79 constituted about 3% of the total annual development
budget, which compares favorably with 0.2% in Indonesia, 0.04% in Thailand
and 0.2% in the Philippines. The Health Division allocation increased from
Tk 196 million (US$13 million) in 1974-75 to Tk 542 million (US$36.1 million)
or about 3.7% of the annual development budget, in 1978-79.
2.33      Under the two-year plan for fiscal years 1978-80, the allocation
for health amounts to Tk 1,180 million (US$78 million) and for population
Tk 1,000 million (US$66 million).
2.34      About 80% of the PCFPD budget is allocated for rural services.
Although 60% of the Health Division's development budget is allocated for
rural health services, a large part of the revenue budget goes for hospitals
and research institutes. The entire PCFPD allocation comes out of the devel-
opment budget, and GOB has only recently funded a small part (US$1 million)
from the revenue budget of 1978-79.
2.35      A large part of the country's development budget is funded from
external sources. During the period 1973-78, total foreign assistance for
population control and family planning amounted to about US$74 million,
out of a total plan allocation of US$100 million. This included contributions
from Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, IDA, Norway, Sweden and
the United Kingdom (US$39.7 million), UNFPA (US$10 million) and USAID (US$14
million). In addition, Family Planning International Assistance, Ford Founda-
tion, Japan, Netherlands and Pathfinder Fund contributed about US$5 million to
the program.

F. Impact
2.36      The program has been able to create a large demand for family
planning services. While services delivery remains short of demand, some
progress in this respect is reported. Available service statistics show a
four-fold increase in sterilizations and a seven-fold increase in the distri-
bution of condoms and pills in 1977-78 compared with 1974-75 (see Annex 7,
T-9).  About 1.44 million married women are estimated, by the GOB, to have
been protected through these services. Also, the estimates indicate that over
77% of the services in 1978 were provided by the Government program with the
remaining coming from non-program sources (Annex 7, T-10). The BFS data on
contraceptive use indicate that about 8.2% of currently married women used
contraceptives in 1975. A survey carried out by the Institute of Statistical
Research and Training in 1978 suggests an increase in this proportion to about
16%. This increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate is also supported by
the tentative results of a number of ad hoc surveys. These figures have still
to be confirmed by a prevalence survey scheduled for late 1979. Although
actual contraceptive acceptance has closely matched the program targets set in
1973, it has fallen short of the revised targets set in 1976 (Annex 7, T-11).
2.37      Although detailed data on mortality and morbidity are not available,
serious diseases such as smallpox have been eradicated, and malaria was under
control until recently. Nevertheless, cholera and gastroenteritis remain
major causes of death and about 90% of children suffer from worm infestation.
To achieve even a small reduction in the incidence of disease will require a
considerable expansion of health facilities.
G. Program Assessment
2.38     The program, during the three years of its existence, has been
successful in setting up an organization from central to village level with
full-time staff, in training the paramedical manpower to expand the service
delivery, and in modest increases in the contraceptive prevalence rate. The
program and the socio-economic environment will need to be improved markedly
to achieve the present ambitious demographic targets.
Program Capacity
2.39      In order to attain the present target of fertility reduction, con-
traceptive usage would have to be extended to about 54% of currently married
women by 1990 (see Annex 7, T-12). This would reduce the crude birth rate
from 47 in 1975 to about 27 by 1990. Such a steep fall in the birth rate,
though desirable, may not be feasible. The contraceptive acceptance rate
required greatly exceeds the rates achieved in even the most successful
programs. While in a few developing countries, such as Singapore, Hong Kong
and Korea, the proportion of currently married women using contraceptives
reached 40% within 10-15 years of the start of the program, the decline of
fertility in these countries took place in an environment of fairly rapid
social and economic development (Annex 7, T-13). In contrast, Bangladesh
lacks the advantages of a fully established family planning program and a
strong economy.



- 13 -
2.40      A study rating the effectiveness of national family planning prog-
rams assigned Bangladesh a rating of 3 in 1975, compared with Singapore's 26,
Korea's 24 and India's 19. 1/ However, the progress the Bangladesh program
has made during the last two years (see para. 2.07-2.13) would probably
entitle it to a rating of 14. (See Annex 7, T-14 for details of rating.)
Even with the latter rating, the program can at best be considered moderate.
2.41      The same study also rates countries according to their nearness
to socio-economic "thresholds" favorable to a decline in fertility. On this
basis, Bangladesh is rated at 24, compared with Korea 81, Malaysia 71 and
Indonesia 45. Bangladesh at present seems to be a long way from these thres-
hold levels of development (see following table).

2.42      It is estimated by the GOB that about 25% of the eligible couples are
currently ready to accept family planning provided the services are delivered
properly. Thus, it appears that this level of acceptance can be achieved by
simply improving the delivery of services (see paras. 2.45-2.52). Increases
in the acceptance rate of this level have already been achieved in small areas
where family planning services are effectively delivered, such as in the
Matlab Thana and Christian Health Care Project areas. A further increase in
acceptance of family planning, of course, will depend on further program
improvement, community participation in health and population programs,
reduction in infant mortality, expansion of education particularly among women
and greater women's participation in economic activities. The non-formal
education and health care need to be expanded to a greater extent than has
been the case so far.

2.43      To reduce the death rate from 19 to 15 will also require a much
greater investment in health infrastructure than at present planned and a
rise in the standard of living which would improve nutrition and make people
more responsive to health care. The following table compares health facili-
ties in Bangladesh with other countries which have attained a low death rate
and Annex 7, T-13 shows the level of socio-economic development in these

Program Constraints
2.44      Major constraints of the program reflected in the inadequate
delivery of family planning and health services are:
2.45      Facilities.  Only about 15% of the population is reached by insti-
tutional health and family planning services. Even the existing facilities
do not have a full complement of staff. Although about 12,500 FWAs have
been posted, their performance is poor due to inadequate on-the-job training
and technical supervision both from field officers and headquarters staff.
Training of supervisors is non-existent and transport is not available for
village visits. The fieldworkers are, therefore, left alone without logistics
or technical support. Even where staff and infrastructure exist, shortages
of drugs and other supplies make it difficult to deliver effective health and
family planning services. The second project is being designed to remove
these constraints.
2.46      Organization.  Inadequate cooperation between the Health and PCFP
Divisions and lack of technical and administrative support and supervision
of PCFPD field staff are the main organizational bottlenecks. A working
agreement between PCFPD and the Health Division reached in 1978 provided
inter alia for the transfer by the Health Division of medical officers (MCH/
FP) to PCFPD, but this transfer has run into considerable difficulties within
the medical profession.



- 1 5 -
2.47      Due to this continuing problem of inadequate cooperation between
the Health Division and PCFPD, the GOB has decided to integrate MCH/FP ser-
vices with health services. This integration will imply transferring the
responsibility for delivering MCH/FP services to the Health Division. A draft
plan of action for integration of MCH/FP services with health services at
the thana level and below has been prepared and approved by the GOB. The
plan states that integration will be most feasible and least disruptive if
phased out over a period of five to ten years. The transfer of MCH/FP services
to the Health Division will start immediately (July 1, 1979) at 20 district
and 45 sub-divisional hospitals. At thana level and below the transfer of
these services will be linked to the establishment of MCH/FP units at the
existing THCs and the construction and operation of the proposed FWCs. Thus
the transfer of services at the thana level and below, according to the
present schedule, will commence on July 1, 1983 with the completion of the
establishment of 700 FWCs during the project period. Such phasing will
allow evaluation of performance in areas where services are integrated before
proceeding further. During negotiations agreement was reached that the
GOB shall implement the agreed plan of phased integration of MCH/FP services
with health services and shall review its progress at regular intervals in
consultation with the Association. Meanwhile, as a step towards achieving the
overall objective of strengthening MCH/FP services, the Health Division should
continue to depute doctors to PCFPD for filling its medical officer positions.
2.48      The PCFPD has started to improve field operations by decentralizing
its administrative structure to the district level. It has begun appointing
additional technical staff and officers at the level of Deputy Director
responsible for the population program in the districts (Annex 7, C-3). The
Deputy Commissioners will be responsible for approving the travel of Deputy
Directors, as well as their confidential performance report and leave sanctions.
At the headquarters, the PCFP Directorate will be merged with the Division
and four Directors each responsible for the program in five districts will
be designated.
2.49      Despite the above proposals, the inadequate cooperation between
the PCFPD and the Health Division may still persist. Furthermore, frequent
reorganizations in the past (para. 2.07), have contributed to slow implemen-
tation of the program. Even an ideal organizational structure will not be
meaingful unless program implementation improves. During negotiations,
the GOB agreed to maintain the district and national-level organizations being
set up and, in the event of any significant changes in these organizations,
consult the Association and take into account the Association's comments, if
any.
2.50      Administration.  Although administrative problems are common to
all development activities in Bangladesh, the critical priority of population
and health requires that special attention be given to the early resolution
of: (a) the shortage of highly skilled manpower, such as doctors, nurses,
managers, architects and engineers due to emigration; (b) cumbersome proce-
dures for the release and use of funds; (c) slow decision-making; (d) absence



- 16 -
of incentives to improve staff performance; and (e) delays in recruitment of
staff and advisers. Agreement was reached, during negotiations, that the GOB
will review the PCFPDs' administrative, financial and recruitment procedures
for direct recruitment of staff and advisers to allow speedy implementation of
the population program and make appropriate modifications as are
feasible to these procedures by December 31, 1979.
2.51      Strategy.  Although the experiments in community participation ild
both health and population programs have been encouraging (para. 2.12), the
GOB has no definite strategy or plan for promoting community participation.
Agreement was reached, during negotiations, that the GOB shall review existing
programs of community participation in health and population activities,
particularly population activities in village self-reliant programs by
March 31, 1980, and on the basis of such review prepare in consultation
with the Association a detailed strategy to strengthen these activities
by September 30, 1980.

and therefore its impact, will have to be phased over a longer period. The
proposed second project meets only eight percent of the requirement and is
therefore only one small step towards achieving the population and health
program goals. In addition to the proposed second project, about US$100
million are expected from other funding agencies, particularly UNFPA (US$50
million) and USAID (US$40-50 million) during 1980-85. The total external
assistance, according to present indications during the next seven years,
will amount to about US$220 million. Expected inputs from various sources
are summarized in Annex 1. About US$71 million of estimated annual recurring
cost for health and US$77 million for population, as shown in the above table,
will require a doubling of the present revenue budget allocation for health
and the total budget allocation for PCFPD by 1985 (Annex 7, T-15).

III. THE FIRST POPULATION PROJECT
Objective
3.01      The object of the first project was to increase the demand for and
supply of MCH and family planning services. Toward this end, the project
assisted the GOB to: (a) train more MCH and family planning paramedical
workers; (b) increase the number of MCH/FP field workers; (c) establish pilot
schemes for introducing family life education into the activities of five
sectoral ministries and for women's vocational training; (d) strengthen the
capacity of the mass media to deal with population topics; (e) build up
research and evaluation capacities; and (f) support private sector activities
and innovative ideas.
Project Description
3.02      The project included:  (a) constructing, furnishing and equipping:
(i) one College of Nursing for training nurse tutors; (ii) eight FWV training
schools; (iii) eight THCs and 24 union FWCs for the field training of medical
and paramedical personnel; and (iv) four model family planning clinics
attached to medical colleges; (b) salary support for 3,700 FWAs to improve the
delivery of MCH and family planning services in rural areas; and (c) equipment,
vehicles, technical assistance and operating cost (salaries, material and
travel allowance) to: (i) carry out pilot schemes in 61 thanas designed
to incorporate family life education in the activities of the Ministries of
Agriculture; Education; Information and Broadcasting; Local Government, Rural
DeveloDment and Cooperatives; Labor and Social Welfare; and MOHPC; (ii) prepare
population education curricula; (iii) establish a population program cell in
Radio Bangladesh, strengthen the film development laboratory, and expand other
mass media activities; (iv) establish a Service Statistics Unit in PCFPD and
an External Evaluation Unit (EEU) in the Planning Commission; and (v) enable
the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies to conduct a study of the
determinants of reproductive behavior. The project also included a study of
the impact of national laws on fertility, a management study of the population
program, the engagement of architects to design and supervise construction,
and funds for support to private sector and innovative activities.
Financing
3.03      The total cost of the project amounted to US$45.7 million.  This
cost is being financed by IDA (US$15 million), NORAD (NKr 45 million--US$8.5
million), Federal Republic of Germany (DM 15 million--US$6.1 million),
Australia (A$2.0 million--US$2.6 million), UK - ODM (E1.4 million--US$3.2
million), CIDA (CN$2.0 million--US$2.0 million), SIDA (Skr 15 million--US$3.0
million), and GOB (US$5.3 million equivalent). The total amount available
from the six donors was US$25.4 million equivalent at the exchange rate pre-
vailing in September 1975.
3.04      The devaluation of the taka in 1977, combined with a lower-than-
estimated rate of increase in costs and delays in initiation of various
schemes, resulted in savings of about US$18.0 million. With the agreement



- 19 -
of the co-financiers of the project, about US$15.6 million of the savings are
being used to expand crucial project activities which, inter alia include:
(a) extending salary support for 8,000 FWAs through June 1980; (b) training
union council chairmen and village leaders to promote family planning;
(c) training program managers; (d) extending the IEM pilot schemes until June
1980; (e) providing 19 teams for retraining FWAs; (f) purchasing additional
films; and (g) constructing 80 union FWCs through community participation on
a pilot basis to test the feasibility of this method for construction on a
larger scale during the second project. The remaining amount is reserved for
contingencies.
Implementation Mechanism
3.05      The primary responsibility for implementing the project rests with
PCFPD in collaboration with the Health Division and five other ministries.
The only new units established under the project have been: (a) the Building
Planning and Design Unit (BPDU) under the Health Division, which monitors and
supervises construction; (b) the Project Finance Cell under PCFPD for keeping
accounts and submitting withdrawal applications; and (c) population program
officers in the five ministries mentioned in para. 3.02.
Progress
3.06      The buildings on 45 sites originally included in the project are being
constructed under 21 contracts, 19 of which have been awarded after consider-
able delay due to problems in acquiring sites and time-consuming contracting
procedures. Tenders for one further contract have been received leaving only
one FWV school on which action has still to be taken. All sites have now
been acquired. It is estimated that all construction will be completed by
the last quarter of 1980--one year behind the appraisal schedule and six months
behind the master plan schedule. Progress on 80 pilot FWCs has been satisfac-
tory. Seventy-seven of the 80 FWCs are under construction and 50 of these
have reached roofing and finishing levels within the last 12 months. The
procurement of equipment, vehicles, technical assistance and the appointment
of additional staff is nearing completion (Annex 2).
Activities
3.07      During the three-year implementation period since September 1975,
the first project has helped the GOB to set up an organization capable of
implementing a broad-based multi-sectoral population program; to review this
organization on the basis of a management study (para. 2.26); to set up a
service statistics and program evaluation system; to increase the number of
MCH/FP field workers; to increase the capacity of FWV training schools and
the capacity of the College of Nursing to train tutors; to establish pilot
women's development schemes; to extend and strengthen mass media activities;
to prepare population education curricula; to initate a study of the deter-
minants of fertility and of the impact of national laws on fertility; to
initiate the community participation in the population program through self-
reliant village programs; and to test the feasibility of constructing FWCs
through community participation (Annex 2). Preliminary evaluation of all major



- 20 -
project components and activities such as field workers' performance, training
of FWVs and FWAs, Radio Bangladesh's family planning program, women's develop-
ment schemes, service statistics system and the self-reliant village program
has been completed. Results of this evaluation are summarized in paras. 4.06,
4.27, 4.33, 4.39, 4.47-4.48, 4.63 and 4.73. Related documents are listed in
Annex 8.
Impact
3.08      It appears that the project has succeeded in creating demand for
family planning services through its motivational program and in modest
increases in the contraceptive prevalence rate (para. 2.36). It has also
contributed to an increase in the number of trained paramedicals.
3.09      In the absence of reliable data, it is difficult to assess the
demographic impact of the program and to separate the impact of the project
from the program as a whole. However, with available information, from
various evaluation studies, on acceptors recruited through different program
components, an attempt is made to assess the achievement of program and
project targets as set for the first project period (1975-78).  nata are
given in Annex 7, T-16.  It is estimated that about 1.3 million acceptors
would have been recruited through the program as against the target of 0.9
million. The reasons for achievement exceeding the target were: appointment
of a larger number of FWAs than expected; low targets set at the time of
formulation of the first project because of the difficulties that were anti-
cipated and the availability of ready clients. The impact of the acceptance
level on birth rate cannot be determined as contraceptive continuation rates
are not known.
Expenditures and Disbursements
3.10      After initial delays, particularly in respect of construction and
vehicle and equipment procurement, progress is now satisfactory and $31.6
million, or 80% of the combined external financing made available, have been
committed. About US$13.1 million or 42% of the amount committed has been
disbursed (Annex 7, T-17). Disbursements have been below target but, with
construction expenditures now accelerating and special measures to expedite
the processing of project expenditures and reimbursement requests under way,
the IDA credit and the bilateral grants are expected to be substantially
disbursed by the Closing Date, currently December 31, 1980 (Annex 7, T-18).
Delay and Problems in First Project Implementation
3.11      The construction of buildings and the procurement of equipment
and vehicles have been delayed by about one year. The main reasons for
delay are: (a) delay in organizing and staffing the Population Planning
Division of MOHPP, which was a condition of credit effectiveness; (b) delay
in appointing an architectural consultant and weak staffing and inadequate
facilities of BPDU; (c) difficulty in acquiring sites. Remedial measures
to overcome these problems during the second project period have been recom-
mended in paras. 5.15-5.30.

the Population Program Officers at four implementing
Ministries other than MOHPC; and (c) providing
additional staff to assist the Population Project
Officer at the Bank's Dacca office.
C. Description
Health and Family Planning Service Delivery
4.04      The recent WHO country health program paper states that Bangladesh's
health system, with which family planning services are inextricably linked,
should be improved by providing: (a) better primary health care through
home visits and community action at the village level; (b) better out-patient
and in-patient care through the completion and staffing of THCs and FWCs,
which will also be responsible for supervising the village health workers;
(c) stronger communicable disease control programs; (d) better water supply
and sanitation; (e) better training facilities for health and family plan-
ning workers; (f) more efficient procurement and distribution of supplies
and equipment; and (g) an increased supply of drugs. The project includes
support for (a), (b), (e) and (g); UNICEF is supporting (c) and (d), and
UNFPA (f).



- 24 -
4.05      Basic Health and Family Planning Field Workers.  At the village
level, 12,000 FWWs (Health Division) and 12,500 FWAs (PCFPD) deliver primary
health care and family planning services through home visits. (Annex 3 sum-
marizes their functions.) Unlike the FWWs, the FWAs have been added only
recently, and their salaries have so far been provided from external resources.
The salaries of 8,000 FWAs are being financed under the first project from
January 1978 until June 1980. UNFPA has been supporting another 1,800 FWAs
and is expected to continue this support. In view of the vital importance
of FWAs, the second project will continue salary support for the FWAs for
three years, starting in July 1980, on a declining basis as described in
para. 4.03(a). The GOB will finance the salaries of workers not covered by
the project or UNFPA. Details of financing are given in Annex 7, T-19 and 20.
4.06      Not surprisingly, considering the speed at which they were recruited,
the performance of FWAs in terms of household visits, recruitment of acceptors,
treatment of complications arising out of contraceptive use and MCH care has
so far been below standard. The main reasons for poor performance have been
identified by PCFPD 1/ as: (a) inadequate basic training; (b) absence of tech-
nical supervision and on-the-job training; (c) lack of training of supervisors
in supervision; (d) absence of drugs and logistics support such as transport;
and (e) absence of adequate community support for contraceptive use. Further-
more, about 40% of the workers were found to be related to influential members
of the community which make administrative control difficult. Since FWAs and
FPAs are the only sources of MCH/FP services at the community level, improvement
in their performance is critical for the program.
4.07      A Plan of Action for improving the performance of FWAs and FPAs has
been agreed during negotiations. First, according to this plan, a retraining
for FWAs and training in supervision for their supervisors including FWVs,
Population Control and Family Planning Officers and FPAs are being organized
(paras. 4.34 and 4.36). Second, while the FPAs will provide logistic support
to FWAs, the FWVs will be providing technical support and on-the-job training.
For this purpose, additional FWVs are being posted at THCs pending the estab-
lishment of FWCs which will then become the base of outreach programs. The
FWVs will combine on-the-job training with delivery of community level MCH
and family planning services. The FWVs will also stay for a week with FWAs
requiring special attention and will give them intensive on-the-job training.
This training should help to give the FWA's confidence in carrying out their
work and create credibility with the clients. Furthermore, definite instruc-
tions for headquarters staff to visit the field at least 10 days a month will
be issued.  Third, the GOB will provide FWAs and FPAs with limited supplies of
medicine, nutrition supplements and first-aid kits to provide basic medical
care and enhance their acceptability within the community. Fourth, the social
sanction to contraception is being sought by using union and village health
and family planning committees and mothers' clubs and women's cooperatives
1/   PCFPD--A study on the Performance and Training of Field Workers
(FWAs and FPAs), December 1978. This was a follow-up study of another
evaluation conducted by the Planning Commission in November 1977.



- 25 -
to promote the FWA's work. Fifth, union and village committees are being made
responsible for monitoring FWAs and giving them support. Sixth, a system of
incentives and disincentives related to performance will be worked out.
Seventh, a change in the methodology of work of FWAs is being contemplated by
the GOB. Recognizing that individuals differ in their responsiveness to the
program in the initial stages, the FWAs will devote the necessary time and
attention to prospective clients, based on individual needs. Careful attention
will be paid to individuals expressing readiness to accept contraception and
they will be contacted regularly. The satisfied acceptor will then be used to
diffuse family planning and MCH care information within the neighborhood and
beyond. Each FWA will be assigned a geographic area which she can conveniently
cover. Some uncovered areas will be assigned to part-time workers. Eighth, a
two-way radio system will be used to improve the communication link between
FWAs and THCs. Ninth, the FWWs of the Health Division will work closely with
FWAs. This cooperation will result in combining family planning with total
health care at the village level. A schedule for the above actions ig given
in Annex 4. Agreement was reached, during negotiations, that the GOB shall:
(a) carry out this agreed plan of action by June 30, 1980; (b) furnish required
information on implementation of the plan to the Association by December 31,
1980; and (c) commencing July 1 each year evaluate the activities and perform-
ance of FWAs and FPAs in consultation with the Association and furnish to the
Association by October 31 each year reports of such evaluation, and based on
the results of the reports, take corrective actions as may be satisfactory to
the Association.
4.08      To facilitate the above actions, the project provides transport and
communication facilities which are seriously lacking (4.03(a) and Annex 7,
T-20). At present, neither FWVs nor THCs have transport to supervise field
work or carry patients, even in emergencies. About 17 four-wheel drive
vehicles (ambulances) are being procured for FWVs, using first project savings.
An additional 253 such vehicles will be provided under the second project, so
that each of the 270 THCs which are expected to be functioning by July 1981
will have one. These vehicles, in addition to transporting patients, will
enable FWVs to organize mobile clinics in villages, where they will also give
FWAs on-the-job training and technical support. Four mobile vans will be
provided for preventive maintenance of these vehicles. In addition, each one
of the PCFPD district offices will have one vehicle for supervision of field
work. During negotiations, the GOB agreed to: (a) take all actions necessary
to maintain the vehicles and equipment for the project in good working con-
dition; and (b) in consultation with the Association, undertake an analysis of
its system for maintenance and use of such vehicles and equipment by December
31, 1979 and shall thereafter take steps as may be necessary to strengthen the
system.
4.09      A survey undertaken by PCFPD indicates that about 25% of the FWAs
are willing to use bicycles. The project provides bicycles for about 50% of
the FWAs supported through the project. It is possible that, as some FWAs
begin using bicycles, others may follow suit. All 18,000 FWAs and FPAs will
be given first-aid kits and about 2,000 kits will be kept in reserve.



- 26 -
4.10      FWAs at present cannot commute to THCs conveniently because of lack
of transport and the long distances between villages and THCs. During the
monsoons, some villages are isolated. FWAs and FPAs must walk 10-20 miles
to schedule sterilizations. If the trial in three thanas proves the proposed
radio system (citizens band) effective, it would enable FWAs to obtain instruc-
tions in complicated cases, call for ambulances and schedule sterilizations.
In a few unions of the pilot thanas where there are FWCs, the system will
also be used for communication between FWAs and FWCs and between FWCs and
the THCs. Workers of other ministries will also have access to these radios.
The system should be simple to maintain, as the batteries will be charged by
solar energy and one technician in each thana will be trained to maintain
them. The field workers will be trained to use them. A common vocabulary
will be developed to avoid mistakes in communication, and PCFPD will monitor
and evaluate the system.
4.11      If the performance of the FWAs improves, the number of women and
children served through MCH services will be about 6.5 million, or about
10% of the women and children requiring these services. At a minimum rate
of 50 acceptors per year, workers supported through the project could recruit
about 675,000 acceptors per year.
4.12      The GOB will evaluate the impact of the above inputs on field
workers' performance. The FWAs supported through the project will be posted
in the 270 thanas where THCs are expected to be functioning by July 1981, thus
enabling their performance to be evaluated under the project. An illustrative
list of criteria for evaluation and a schedule are given in Annexes 4 and 5.
4.13      Family Welfare Centers (FWCs).  Since only 400 FWCs exist at pre-
sent, there is neither provision for outpatient care in 90% of the unions
nor any technical support for field workers. A survey of available physical
facilities conducted by the PCFPD showed that, about 665 of the 920 existing
Health Division dispensaries could be used as FWCs, provided that some minor
repairs and renovations were carried out. These 665 dispensaries, together
with about 400 FWCs, will permit the establishment of 1,065 FWCs by 1979.
More than 2,600 additional FWCs will be required to cover all 3,698 rural
unions by 1985.
4.14      The rate at which FWCs can be constructed and brought into operation
is limited by:  (a) the system of construction; and (b) the output of MAs to
staff them. FWCs provided under the project will be constructed by the experi-
mental method being used for the 80 FWCs financed from first project savings.
Under this method, construction, instead of being carried out by the Public
Works Department is entrusted to the local community through the medium
of Construction Committees headed by union council chairmen. The progress
of the 80 FWCs has demonstrated the technical feasibility of this method of
construction. However, because of the need for close supervision and the
scarcity of architects and engineers, it is estimated that not more than
300-400 FWCs can be constructed annually. The number of FWCs that can be
built during the four-year project period is, therefore, conservatively esti-
mated at about 1,200. The GOB sought assistance from other external sources
for about 500 FWCs, and the second project provides for the construction of
and equipment for another 700 (details in Annex 7, T-21).



- 27 -
4.15      The FWCs will be constructed and operated initially by PCFPD before
their eventual transfer to the Health Division. During negotiations, the GOB
agreed to prepare or cause to be prepared by December 31, 1979 an operational
manual for maintaining and operating FWCs.
4.16      Because of the unique system of construction and the large number
of FWCs, construction will be divided into three phases--230 in the first
phase and 235 in each of the second and third phases. Any shortfall in
construction during the first three years will be made good during the fourth.
The phasing of construction will be confirmed when the master plan for con-
struction currently under preparation by the architectural consultant is
completed. During negotiations, the GOB agreed to undertake the construction
of FWCs in accordance with the master plan; have progress and quality of such
construction evaluated annually by the architectural consultants; and undertake
no further construction under the project unless such progress and quality
are satisfactory to the Association. The impact of FWCs on health and
family planning services will be evaluated one year after the FWCs are put in
operation in a union. The construction of FWCS will be evaluated by the
architectural/ engineering consultants for the Droject and operations by the Planning
Commission. The proposed schedule is given in Annex 4 .
4.17      The 700 FWCs will be located in unions with access to a THC and
where no existing building is available. The distribution of FWCs by dis-
tricts is based on rural population. Each FWC will provide about 20,000
people with primary health care and family planning services. These FWCs
are expected to serve 10.5 million women and children with health care and
133,000 sterilization clients during the project period. They will improve
the performance of field workers by providing them with technical support.
4.18      Thana Health Complexes (THCs).  Since large thanas need two THCs,
about 368 THCs will be required for the 356 rural thanas. Excluding the
165 existing THCs, 203 (additional) THCs are required. Buildings are under
construction in 154, while in about 30 some construction has been started.
The project includes construction, equipment and furniture for the remaining
19 THCs. Each of the 19 thanas will cover a population of 200,000 by out-
patient and hospital services. These THCs will also strengthen the services
at FWCs through supervision and referral.
4.19      The MCH/FP services are often neglected in THCs.  At present, no
THC staff can be spared exclusively for MCH services. The establishment of
a separate MCH/FP unit is therefore essential. The available physical facil-
ities of the THCs will be used for this purpose. Each MCH/FP unit would be
headed by a medical officer assisted by two FWVs. Not all THCs have FWVs,
as some of them are still posted at separate family planning clinics. PCFPD
proposes to merge these clinics with the MCH/FP units. Agreement was reached,
during negotiations, that MCH/FP units will be established at the 270 THCs to
be in operation by July 31, 1981. These MCH/FP units will help, not only to
reduce infant and maternal mortality, but also to improve family planning
program performance. They are expected to perform at least 135,000 sterili-
zations (male and female) and IUD insertions annually. An estimated ten
million women and children are expected to receive health care through these
units.



- 28 -
4.20      Drugs.  Fieldworkers are not provided with drugs, and even the FWVs
at thana level have limited supplies. This shortage is partly due to logis-
tical problems, but to a much greater extent to the inadequate budget provi-
sion for drugs. UNICEF has been supplying drug and dietary supplement kits.
UNICEF will be able to provide only half the present estimated annual require-
ments of 30,000 kits at present, rising to 44,000 by 1983. Furthermore, the
rapid expansion of primary health care will increase the demand for drugs. To
overcome the shortage of drugs, GOB proposes to expand the present MOHPC drug
factory.
4.21      An interim report, by the consultants appointed by the GOB, on the
relative merits of expanding the MOHPC factory and buying drugs from commercial
pharmaceutical firms not only endorses the GOB proposal but also recommends
the establishment of four more MOHPC factories in order to meet the entire
needs of the public health system by 1985. The report also estimates that
these drugs would be 27% to 75% cheaper than commercially produced drugs. A
final judgment on this issue can only be reached in the light of the final
recommendations of the feasibility study. An increase of MOHPC capacity would
in any case take three years to complete. About US$4 million for the purchase
of basic drugs, is, therefore, included in the project (Annex 7, T-22). These
drugs could be procured in the form of drug and dietary supplement kits through
UNICEF. The use and suitability of drugs will be evaluated regularly by
PCFPD. The UNPFA will strengthen the logistics system for distribution of
drugs.
4.22      Evaluation.  In all, the project will strengthen health care and
family planning services in the 270 thanas by providing field workers, drugs,
vehicles and MCH/FP units. One hundred of these 270 thanas will also have
fully staffed and equipped FWCs. These 100 thanas will be evaluated to
measure the impact of the combined inputs on fertility and mortality, and
the results will be compared with the other 170 thanas.
Training of Health and Family Planning Manpower
4.23      Rural health and family planning services are delivered by doctors
and paramedicals such as FWVs and MAs at the union level, and FWWs, FWAs and
FPAs at the village level. Only a small number of nurses are engaged in rural
health services. Training capacity for medical and paramedical manpower, with
the additions under the second project, will be adequate to meet requirements
at least up to 1985. However, the shortages of medical personnel and nurses
are likely to persist unless the GOB can limit their emigration and make them
available for rural health services. The training of paramedicals, as evalua-
tions indicate, is weak, and these personnel are therefore unable to meet the
health and family planning needs of the population adequately.
4.24      The GOB proposes to make a study of:  (a) the long-term manpower
needs of the health and population program; (b) the extent to which the cur-
rent training prepares workers for their functions; and (c) the consequent
training requirements. Such a functional analysis should enable the GOB to
formulate a health manpower policy covering the next 25 years and to develop
a national training plan for 1980-85. Agreement was reached, during negotia-
tions, that the GOB shall: (a) in consultation with the Association, undertake
a functional analysis of its health and population programs for determination



- 29 -
of the manpower requirements at thana level and below by December 31, 1979;
and (b) prepare a health and population manpower policy, including a national
training program by December 31, 1980.
4.25      Doctors.  The medical colleges have lacked facilities for training
doctors in community medicine, new contraceptive technology and for clinical
contraceptive research. The first project financed the construction and
equipping of eight field THCs for training in community medicine, and a model
family planning clinic for contraceptive training and research at each of the
four medical colleges. USAID is funding model family planning clinics in the
other four medical colleges. These buildings (THCs and model clinics) are
expected to be completed by December 1980. The second project will continue
operating cost support for the four model family planning clinics for three
years. (For estimates, see Annex 7, T-23.) It is expected that the GOB will
be able to take over the cost of operating these clinics at the end of the
project period. It is proposed that these clinics should also be used for
the training of medical students in MCH care. Each clinic has 25 beds for
sterilization.
4.26      Nurses' Training.  The project does not include nurses' training,
as about nine schools each with a capacity of 100 students are under con-
struction through GOB's own resources. These should be adequate to meet
the requirements of hospital and health services at least up to 1990.
Furthermore, the shortage of nurses can also be reduced by using FWVs (of
whom there will be an adequate supply) as assistant nurses.
4.27      Family Welfare Visitors (FWVs) Training.  The FWVs are the key para-
medical personnel for delivering MCH/FP services in rural areas. The first
project included the construction of eight FWV schools. Pending the comple-
tion of the buildings, UNFPA helped to establish the schools in temporary
buildings. In all, 11 FWV schools have been established so far. The supply
of FWVs from existing schools will meet the requirements up to 1985 and beyond
(Annex 7, T-24). The quality of training in these schools, however, as indi-
cated by a Planning Commission evaluation, is impaired by inadequate provision
of tutors, tutor training, libraries, field training and training manuals.
4.28      As recommended by the Planning Commission, PCFPD has already taken
action to: (a) fill the vacant staff positions at FWV training schools and
assigned sister tutors as principals where feasible; (b) increase the supply
of textbooks and trainees' manuals; and (c) increase the practical content
of FWV training. The shortage of tutors is being eased by reviving the tutor
training program at the College of Nursing. In the meantime, the GOB has
entered into a contract with the voluntary Christian Health Care Project to
provide tutors and field training. The training of tutors will be improved
through workshops to be organized by the GOB, using first project funds.
The second project will provide: (a) the operating cost (travel allowances,
stipends and training materials) of retraining FWVs; (b) technical assistance
and materials for preparing training manuals and teaching aids and for the
training of tutors; and (c) books and publications. It will also provide
additional classrooms, dormitories, libraries and staff quarters to enable
the FWV training school at Barisal to accommodate 80 instead of 30 students
(Annex 7, T-25).



- 30 -
4.29      The second project will help to make good the deficiencies in the
basic training of FWVs. The existing 1,800 FWVs will be given two weeks'
retraining at the FWV schools. The retraining program is expected to be
completed by 1982. Tutors will require annual refresher training at the
College of Nursing. PCFPD will, with the assistance of an adviser provided
in the project, review the curriculum for FWVs and prepare manuals for tutors,
trainees and FWVs.
4.30      Medical Assistants (MAs).  To relieve the shortage of doctors in
rural areas, the GOB started to train MAs--a new category of paramedical
staff--in 1976. The course consists of two years of basic training and six
months of internship. Like FWVs, MAs will be assigned primarily to union
FWCs, where they will provide curative and preventive health services.
4.31      The GOB, with support from the Netherlands, has established four
training schools for MAs, each with an annual intake of 100 students. ,The
first group of 330 students (excluding dropouts) completed their basic
training in December 1978. These four schools would produce about 2,500 MAs
by 1985 towards the 4,500 needed. The GOB therefore proposes to establish
four more schools in temporary quarters in July 1979 to meet the requirements
up to 1980. The estimated availability of MAs is shown in Annex 7, T-26.
The project includes construction, equipment and furniture for four MA
training schools to replace the temporary premises. The project will also
include training equipment, vehicles, fellowships for teaching staff and
stipends for students. (For cost estimates, see Annex 7, T-27.)
4.32      Field Workers.  The FWWs and FWAs are front-line paramedical and
family planning workers, each serving as the main source of referral and
advice on health and family planning matters for 8,000 people. Their training
and retraining is therefore crucial. The FWWs of the Health Division were
formerly malaria workers, and thus have considerable experience in the
health services. The Health Division has already begun to retrain them,
using its own funds.
4.33      A Planning Commission evaluation of FWA training in 1977 identified
inadequate knowledge of MCH care and of complications resulting from contra-
ceptive use as the chief weaknesses. These are confirmed by another recent
evaluation conducted by PCFPD. This study also indicated that the training of
FWAs related to motivating women for acceptance of family planning was weak.
4.34      To overcome the above deficiencies, the first project provided for
the establishment of 19 FWA training teams in rented premises. Under the
second project, permanent training centers will be constructed to replace
these temporary premises.  FWAs and FPAs will receive two weeks' retraining
each year at these centers, which will also give a four week pre-service
basic training course for newly recruited fieldworkers. The training load
and utilization of facilities of the centers are shown in Annex 7, T-28, and
detailed cost estimates are given in Annex 7, T-29.



- 31 -
4.35      Evaluation.  The PCFPD's Training Unit and the Planning Commission
will: (a) continuously evaluate the training of manpower supported by the
project; (b) improve the training program and arrange for the retraining
of FWWs, FPAs, FWVs and FWAs in accordance with the evaluation.
4.36      Training of Supervisors.  The single factor most responsible for
weak service delivery is inadequate supervision due to the lack of training
of the supervisors in management and technical support to field staff. The
National Institute of Population Research and Training (NIPORT), attached
to PCFPD, is responsible for the training of managers and supervisors. It
has already arranged a few training courses for thana population control
and family planning officers. About 1,000 supervisors, comprising: (a) head-
quarters staff, (b) district and thana population control and family planning
officers, and (c) district and thana MCH/FP officers--will be trained by PCFPD
for about two weeks in supervision and management. About 50 training courses
of one to five-week duration will be organized for various categories of
management personnel. The training load is given in Annex 7, T-30. The
rented buildings which house the PCFPD training section and NIPORT are not
suitable for a large training program; the GOB proposes to build a population
training accommodation to house training sections of NIPORT and PCFPD. This
building will help centralize training and facilitate organization of large
training programs. It will also help in improving the quality of training.
The facilities, provided in the project, will include a hostel for 65 students,
common room, library and classrooms for about 80 students.
Information, Education and Motivation (IEM)
4.37      The first project initiated four types of IEM activities:  (a) use
of mass media; (b) promotion of women's development programs; (c) population
education in the schools and the use of primary school teachers as change
agents; and (d) utilization of model farmers, agricultural assistants and
organized labor to spread family planning information among village men. In
1977, the GOB, with UNFPA/UNESCO assistance, formulated a population communi-
cation strategy, covering these and other activities. The second project will
continue and slightly expand the mass media activities and the women's develop-
ment programs. The UNFPA will support the other two types of activity which
have been of interest to it.
4.38      Mass Media.  The first project:  (i) established population pro-
gram cells in Radio Bangladesh; (ii) strengthened Ministry of Information
and Broadcasting's film production capacity; (iii) provided audiovisual vans;
(iv) established a Feature Writing Bureau; and (v) trained public relations
officers. Although formal evaluation of only Radio Bangladesh has been con-
ducted, the routine evaluation of other mass media activities is encouraging.
Formal evaluation of these activities will be conducted early in the second
project period.
4.39      Radio Bangladesh has set up one central and five regional population
program cells. Radio is evidently a potent media for reaching low-income
groups. It appears that family planning programs are very popular: about
75% of the persons interviewed in a recent evaluation of radio family planning
programs reported that they listen to discussions on family planning as part



- 32 -
of a 20-minute "Happy Family Program." Reportedly, about 16% of owners of
radios are practicing contraception as compared to 7% of non-owners. 1/ The
second project will provide more equipment, vehicles, fellowships and continu-
ing operating cost for three years to enable the population program cells to:
(a) produce programs for the villages; and (b) include health education in
their program. (For details of costs, see Annex 7, T-31.)
4.40      The first project provided funds for dubbing six films in Bengali,
and staff and equipment to increase Ministry of Information and Broadcasting's
film production capacity. Eleven new films have been produced towards the
target of 14 set in the first project. Most of the laboratory equipment has
arrived, but cannot be fully used until a new laboratory building has been
completed. The second project provides additional equipment, vehicles, tech-
nical assistance and operating cost which will be needed when the new labora-
tory is ready in August 1979 and when the Ministry begins to produce films on
health education, either separately or in combination with population educa-
tion (Annex 7, T-32).
4.41      Films are popular among rural people, and thousands attend each
show. The first project provided eight closed door and eight open-air
cinema vans. The eight closed-door vans are operative, and by January 1978
had given 1,760 film shows in eight pilot thanas. The eight open-air vans
have arrived and are being put into service. The second project will increase
the number of vans to 26 and provide six film motor launches to cover riverine
areas, equipment, fellowships and operating expenses (Annex 7, T-33).
4.42      The Feature Writing Bureau has a staff of ten and has published
over 500 articles on population. The second project includes operating
cost to continue the operation of the Bureau for three years (Annex 7, T-34).
To coordinate the activities, the Office of the Population Program Officer,
established under the first project, will be continued and strengthened
through operating cost support, equipment, fellowships and vehicles (Annex 7,
T-35).
4.43      Folk media in the form of wandering bands of singers and musicians
are a very important attraction in the villages, and by allying them with a
film show and a speaker, the family planning program gains credit for a whole
evening's entertainment. The project, to be implemented by the IEM Unit of
PCFPD, includes provision of allowances for holding folk festivals, training
of talents, evaluation of films, records and puppet shows (Annex 7, T-36).
4.44      Women's Development Programs. The first project supported mothers'
clubs, women's cooperatives and a women's vocational training program with a
view to raising the socio-economic status of women and to making them more
receptive to the small family norm. The schemes covered various target groups
and geographic areas, and were conducted on a pilot basis in selected villages
in about 42 thanas. The approaches of the three schemes also differed as
described later. These approaches will be reviewed in March 1980 in the light
of evaluation being conducted now before expanding the schemes under the
1/   Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting,

- 33 -
second project from July 1980. An attempt will be made to make the schemes
self-financing and commercially viable. In this respect women's cooperatives
propose to enter into an arrangement with commercial banks for obtaining loans.
4.45       The mothers' clubs are being organized by the Ministry of Labor and
Social Welfare, while women's cooperatives are part of the Integrated Rural
Development Program (IRDP) of the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Develop-
ment and Cooperatives. The women's vocational training program is being
conducted by the Women's Rehabilitation and Welfare Foundation under the
Women's Affairs Division.
4.46       A consultant engaged by IDA to review the schemes reported that,
although the three women's development schemes are not yet fully under way,
they have: (a) created jobs for women in rural areas, thus providing a
viable alternative to early motherhood and high fertility; (b) revealed a
large latent demand for family planning; (c) identified some of the problems
in delivery of family planning and health services; and (d) provided training
in leadership which has enabled women to become members of union councils,
where they voice the needs of rural women and their families.
4.47       A Planning Commission study, which compared women in one of the
schemes with women outside, concluded that: (a) the project women knew more
about contraception and practiced contraception more; members actively per-
suaded other village women to use contraception; and (b) project women made
more profits from poultry raising and vegetable growing. About 25% and 38% of
the participants in the mothers' clubs and women's cooperatives respectively
had accepted family planning. A UN study 1/ reveals that there has been a
fertility reduction of 48% among members of mothers' clubs. The study con-
cludes that it is testimony to the fact that population messages delivered
in the context of socio-economic programs has a better chance of successfully
reaching the target audience. The targets and achievements of different
women's development schemes during the first project and the proposed tar-
gets for the second project are given in Annex 7, T-37.
4.48       UNICEF 2/ and Planning Commission evaluations of the pilot schemes
noted the need to: (a) base the choice of goods to be produced on market sur-
veys; (b) organize the marketing of goods; (c) give priority to agricultural
projects for local markets; (d) maintain quality control; and (e) organize
vocational training, functional literacy, health, nutrition and population
education programs, making use of simple training materials for local needs.
4.49       The second project will:  First, provide operating cost, vehicles
and technical assistance to establish a marketing unit in PCFPD to make market
surveys, provide design and quality guidance, and make sales contracts. The

marketing unit will serve the three ministries which implement the women's
programs. Second, the project will provide equipment, vehicles, incremental
salaries, and materials for the formation of mothers' clubs and women's
cooperatives in 21 additional thanas, and women's vocational training programs
in 12 additional thanas. The project also includes a buffer fund for the
purchase of goods produced by mothers' clubs pending their sale in the market,
and the construction of production centers in 12 thanas for the women's voca-
tional training program. The recurring cost of mothers' clubs established
under the first project will be taken over by the GOB when first project
supp)rt ends. The second project will, however, continue to provide the
operating cost of the women's cooperatives and women's vocational training
programs started under the first project for three more years starting in
July 1980 when the first project support ends (Annex 7, T-38-41).
4.50      Women's Cooperatives.  Up to October 1978, over 500 Women's
Cooperative Societies have been established with a membership of 18,000 women
as against the target of 300, under the first project. The scheme was '
expected to cover 10 villages in each of the 19 pilot thanas, but because of
popular demand, the IRDP extended the scheme to another nine thanas and
covered 20 instead of 10 villages in each thana. Village women have deposited
over Tk 500,000 (about US$30,000) in cooperatives as a result of the schemes.
No firm data on income are available, but an income of Tk 80 to 100 per month
is reported by various members. The repayment of loans from the cooperatives
is prompt. The IRDP proposes to increase the the coverage from 20 villages per
thana to 30 and to increase the number of thanas to 40 during the second
project. Since the activities in nine additional thanas started recently
these are considered as new thanas under the second project. Thus, there
are 21 additional thanas under the second project. The number of cooperative
societies will be increased from 500 in 1978 to 1,200, with a membership of
about 48,000, in 1983.
4.51      Mothers' Clubs:  Up to October 1978, 750 mothers' clubs with a
membership of about 26,400, had been established. Mothers' clubs also offer
vocational training to women of differing backgrounds, provide them with
materials to produce goods and arrange for marketing. Most of the goods
produced by mothers' clubs are either for export or the urban market, while
women's cooperatives concentrate on agro-based activities catering to the
local market. The first project supported mothers' clubs in 40 villages in
each of the 19 thanas. The same pattern will be followed in the 21 additional
thanas of the second project,so that by the end of the second project there
will be 1,600 mothers' clubs with a membership of about 48,000.
4.52      Women's Vocational Training Program.  The Women's Rehabilitation
Welfare Foundation under the Women's Affairs Division organizes vocational
training programs for women. These training programs are of longer duration
than those of the women's cooperatives and mothers' clubs, and range from six
months to one year. Trainees receive a small stipend during the training
period. Under the first project, 40 training centers were opened in eight
thanas; these have trained 2,400 women who have motivated 45,000 women to
accept family planning.



- 35 -
4.53      Under the second project, the scheme will be extended to 12 new
thanas. The 12 thanas will be selected in common with women's cooperatives as the
the centers will train trainees for these cooperatives. As in the first
project, training centers will be established in 48 unions in these thanas.
The scheme will thus cover 20 thanas (8 old and 12 new) and 80 unions. In
order to make the schemes financially viable, production will be oriented more
towards items of local demand.
4.54      Training Community Leaders.  The power of social pressure to promote
acceptance of family planning has been proved by the success of programs using
community leaders under various pilot schemes. The IEM Unit of PCFPD will
train formal and informal community leaders such as union council chairmen,
religious leaders and school teachers, who could play a vital role in estab-
lishing linkages between program workers and target audiences and in influenc-
ing target audiences. The project provides operating expenses for the orienta-
tion of these leaders at district, thana and union levels, for curriculum
development, and evaluation. About 25,500 leaders are expected to receive
three days' orientation during the project period. (For estimates, see
Annex 7, T-36.)
4.55      Health Education.  The provision of health education for the people
is a pre-requisite to the success of any preventive or curative health service.
Health education in Bangladesh is weak. There is a small Bureau of Health
Education at Health Division headquarters. This Bureau, with its present number
of staff, is incapable of using existing manpower and facilities of MOHPP and
of other ministries for promoting health education. Each district has one
health education officer but there is no specialist staff below that level.
The second project will provide the Bureau with equipment, vehicles, technical
assistance and operating cost to formulate and implement a multi-sectoral
health education program. (For cost estimates, see Annex 7, T-42.) The
objectives of the program will be: (a) to train and equip FWWs to organize
community health education; (b) to introduce health education into the school
system; and (c) to use mass media for promotion of health education. The
Planning Commission will evaluate health education activities.
Evaluation and Research
4.56      Research and evaluation activities in population and health can be
divided into three groups: (a) those which are directly relevant to the GOB
program; (b) those which provide results of value for development planning;
and (c) those with little immediate relevance to policy-making.
4.57      The second project, like its predecessor, will be concerned only
with activities in group (a). Activities in group (b), will be sponsored by
the proposed Population and Development Cell in the General Economic Section
of the Planning Commission, which is to be funded by UNFPA. Activities in
group (c), will be sponsored by the universities and research institutions.
4.58      Research and Evaluation Capacity.  The present system of evaluation
needs to be strengthened. The Research, Evaluation, Statistics and Planning
(RESP) Unit of PCFPD is responsible for setting up a management information



- 36 -
system. A Service Statistics Cell was established in RESP, under the first
project. The External Evaluation Unit (EEU), created under the first project
in the Health and Population Planning Section of the Planning Commission, is
responsible for evaluating the impact of project and program investments.
Each of the sectoral ministries participating in the multi-sectoral IEM
program was provided funds under the first project for collecting routine
data. The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies carries out basic
demographic and population research and evaluation studies requiring sophis-
ticated methodology. PCFPD recently decided to make the newly created NIPORT
responsible for coordinating population-related research and evaluation. The
Bureau of Statistics is responsible for census and vital registration. The
Health Information Unit of the Health Division is responsible for collecting
health program management data. All the agencies mentioned above have limited
capacity to conduct evaluation and research studies. Therefore, IDA consul-
tants 1/ reviewed the capacity of institutions and universities outside Dacca
to undertake evaluation and research studies on a contract basis. The consul-
tants prepared an inventory of institutions with capacity to undertake these
studies and a list of priority evaluation and research studies.
4.59      Four major areas of importance in evaluation and research are:
(a) setting up of a service statistics system; (b) evaluation of health and
family planning service delivery and training of manpower; and (c) evaluation
of the IEM program including community participation schemes; and (d) deter-
minants of fertility and contraceptive behavior. The second project will
strengthen the service statistics cell of the RESP Unit of PCFPD for setting
up the service statistics system. The EEU of the Planning Commission will
conduct evaluation studies defined under (b) and (c). The Bangladesh Institute
of Development Studies has already started the studies under (d).
4.60      RESP Unit.  The Service Statistics Cell of the Unit has already
initiated a new system of service statistics to replace the existing system.
The existing system has never been operative throughout the country and
reports are known to have been incomplete, often inaccurate and, in some
instances, falsified. Forms are unwieldy and complex and make no reference
to data, direct or indirect, on contraceptive prevalence.
4.61      A new system was therefore devised early in 1978.  The forms are
considerably simplified and yet will hold more information than the present
form. The FPAs collect the summary forms from the FWAs and mail them once
a month to RESP. The RESP will store the records in a mini computer now on
order. From the data stored in the computer, routine tables will be prepared
monthly and sent back to district offices for their information and use. This
feedback system is crucial for improving the program. Accuracy in the basic
field worker records depends on the proper training and supervision of the
FWAs visiting the households and on the spot checking of their reports by
their immediate supervisors, and by headquarters staff.

- 37 -
4.62       The new system has been tested in seven unions, and is now being
expanded to cover seven thanas. It is planned to extend the system in the
next year to 50 unions in 50 thanas where prevalence studies will be conducted
to evaluate the system. The system is expected to be established throughout
the country in three to five years.
4.63       RESP recently made a first attempt to evaluate the new system by
comparing service statistics produced by the new system with data obtained
through direct interview. The findings are promising. For example, the
finding that more than 80% of the respondents interviewed confirmed that an
FWA had visited them in the past three months suggests that a supervised
reporting system with feedback encourages field workers to make household
visits. The FWA reports showed the contraceptive prevalence rate was 21.8%,
compared with the 19.7% found by the independent survey. On the other hand,
FWAs seem to have missed at least half the births. This suggests the need for
more intensive training and household probing to capture vital events. The
RESP Unit will make annual prevalence surveys as an independent check on FWA
reports.
4.64       The service statistics system, now being set up, has all the makings
of a vital registration system because it plans to record all changes--births
and deaths as well as migration--in household composition. Once operational,
the service statistics could be made available to another agency, say the
Bureau of Statistics, for computing vital rates and other statistics.
4.65       The project provides operating cost, equipment and technical assis-
tance for the Service Statistics Cell for the second project period. (For
cost estimates, see Annex 7, T-43.)
4.66       External Evaluation Unit (EEU).  This unit, set up in the Planning
Commission in 1976 under the first project, is responsible for the external
evaluation of the sectoral and multi-sectoral population programs.
4.67       The EEU has completed the following four studies:  (a) an evalua-
tion of the performance of FPAs and FWAs; (b) a study of family planning
habits among the staff of the Ministry of Planning; (c) an evaluation of
the FWA training program; and (d) an acceptors follow-up survey.   It is at
present undertaking follow-up surveys of the seven IEM pilot schemes of the
first project.
4.68       The EEU has a small professional staff and disproportionately large
number of interviewers. There is at present a serious lack of senior profes-
sionals with experience in sample survey research, and the prospect of finding
*         more in the near future is not bright.  The Unit should, therefore, contract
out the evaluation studies to universities or research institutions. Further,
it should concentrate on evaluating the service delivery system in general and
the performance of FWAs, FPAs and FWVs in particular. The project provides
additional senior staff, vehicles, equipment, technical assistance and funds
for forming a Service Delivery Evaluation Cell in this Unit. The staff,
supported through the first project, should be used for evaluation of IEM
activities. (For cost estimates see Annex 7, T-44.)

4.69      Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies.  It is at present
engaged, inter alia, in a study entitled "Determinants of Reproductive
Behavior in Bangladesh," a large-scale population research project funded
under the first project. The field investigation for the study has been
combined with that of another study entitled "Participation of Low Income
Strata in Rural Development" partially funded by ESCAP.  The study is ex-
pected to be completed by the end of 1980.
4.70      Coordination of Evaluation and Research.  The coordinating functions
of research and evaluation will be entrusted to NIPORT. It will be impossible
for a few full-time professionals in the research wing of NIPORT to coordinate
research without the assistance of a committee representing the relevant dis-
ciplines and institutions. The committee should also include representatives
from PCFPD, the University Grants Committee and the Social Science Research
Council. Agreement was reached, during negotiations, that the GOB shall form
a research and evaluation committee and prepare in consultation with the Asso-
ciation a comprehensive plan of action for evaluating the population and
health programs and the project including its various components by December
31, 1979 and shall cause such plan to be carried out in accordance with its
terms. This plan will: (a) define the measurable objectives of each compo-
nent; (b) identify corresponding quantitative performance indicators;
(c) ascertain the availability of baseline values of these indicators; (d)
determine the data to be collected; and (e) identify agencies for carrying out
specific studies. An illustration of performance indicators and timetable for
evaluation studies are given in Annexes 4 and 5.
4.71      Health Information Unit.  The health information system in Bangladesh
is in an early stage of development. The GOB has recently sanctioned a scheme
which calls for expansion of the present Health Information Unit of the Health
Division by establishing a four-man statistical cell in each of the 19 dis-
tricts and by posting a statistical assistant in each of the 412 thanas. The
Health Information Unit proposes to liaise closely in its work with the Office
of the Director of Health Services (preventive) who receive reports from FWWs,
with the RESP Unit of PCFPD and with other agencies involved in research and
evaluation work.  The Unit will combine epidemiological reporting forms with
FWWs reporting forms. The Unit will collect and analyze basic information nec-
essary for management of the health program such as: (a) manpower and equip-
ment availability and use; (b) epidemiological surveillance; and (c) results
of innovative schemes adopted in the health sector. In addition, three
medical audit teams will be formed under the Unit to note, and determine the
reasons for, under-utilization or shortage of manpower, beds, physical facili-
ties and equipment of THCs and hospitals. The teams will consist of one
medical officer, one statistical assistant and two typists. Two teams will be
assigned to THCs and FWCs and one to hospitals. The project provides salaries,
vehicles, and operating expenses for medical audit teams, data processing
equipment and fellowships. WHO will provide technical assistance. (For cost
estimates, see Annex 7, T-45.)

Support to Private Sector and Innovative Activities
4.72      The rigid budgets of national agencies make it difficult for them
to allocate funds to private agencies or for the testing of new ideas. The
first project therefore allocated US$350,000, later increased to $645,000, for
private sector and innovative activities (Annex 7, T-46).  PCFPD appointed
a subvention committee to review proposals for use of this fund. PCFPD has
found the fund very useful and has supported some important schemes. The
schemes supported through the project include: (a) support to voluntary agen-
cies through Bangladesh Family Planning Association; (b) intensive family
planning in selected self-reliant villages; and (c) use of folk media for
family planning in villages. Under the first of these schemes, representa-
tives from voluntary organizations at district and thana level are being
trained to organize the family planning program, for which contraceptives
are supplied. Under the second scheme about 71 self-reliant villages were
provided with small amounts of money to organize family planning related
activities in their villages. The third scheme combines folk shows with
talks by public leaders on family planning. The self-reliant village program
has been evaluated and the results are given in paras. 2.12-2.13. Other
programs will be evaluated during the second project period.
4.73      The second project includes $2 million for these activities.  This
amount, as under the first project, will be used for private sector and
innovative activities. The subvention committee set up under the first
project will review the proposals and submit them for IDA approval. About
$1 million of these funds is expected to be used for intensifying the family
planning activities of the self-reliant village programs in 700 selected
unions. Such intensification will begin after evaluation of the self-reliant
villages programs in July 1980 using the first project funds.
V.  PROJECT COST, FINANCING, IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION
A. Cost
5.01      The total project cost, including contingencies, local taxes
and duties, is estimated at US$110 million. The foreign exchange component
is estimated at US$36.9 million, i.e., 34% of the total project cost. Taxes
and duties are estimated at US$9.2 million. Construction accounts for
nearly 50% of the cost. Operating cost accounts for 22% (US$24.3 million) of
the project cost. Of this, 68% or US$16.5 million is incremental operating
cost and the remaining US$7.8 million or 32% is for continuation of crucial
first project activities. The cost estimates are summarized in the following
table, while details are given in Annex 7, Tables 47-48.

exchange costs, and the operating cost (salaries, travel allowances and
maintenance of equipment and vehicles) involves local costs except for petro-
leum, which is entirely imported. Some materials, drugs and fuel are also
imported and their foreign exchange component is estimated at US$5.2 million
out of a total of US$8.5 million.
5.04                The contingency allowance of US$18.5 million covers:  (a) unfore-
seen physical factors, estimated at 10% of base cost of civil works component;
and (b) price escalation, estimated at 14% of project costs and physical
contingencies. Contingencies were calculated on the basis of estimated
expenditure and expected annual percentage increases in prices as follows:
construction, professional fees and furniture--7.5% in 1979-80 and 7.0%
annually in the remaining three years; vehicles, equipment, materials, tech-
nical assistance and operating cost--6.5% in 1979-80 and 6.0% annually in
subsequent three years.

B. Financing
5.05      The total project cost (US$110 million) is to be financed by an
IDA credit of US$32 million equivalent, other external financing of about
US$67 million equivalent and a GOB contribution of US$11 million equivalent,
representing about 10% of project cost. A proposed donor financing plan is
described in Annex 7, T-49. The co-financiers of the first project, Australia,
Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom,
have agreed in principle to participate in the financing. In addition, the
Netherlands has also agreed to finance parts of the project.
All the cofinanciers except Sweden, will finance specific components.  Sweden
will, as in the first project, enter into joint financing arrangements directly
with the GOB. IDA, as the lender of last resort, will finance project compo-
nents not selected by other donors. Conclusion of arrangements satisfactory
to the Association to obtain external assistance amounting to not less than
US$67.2 million equivalent for purposes of carrying out the project is a
condition of credit effectiveness.
5.06      The five co-financiers (excepting Sweden) of the first project have
also agreed to support the salary of a population expert in the Bank's Dacca
Office, as under the first project. In order to improve the monitoring of the
project, the population expert is to be assigned an assistant whose salary
will be funded by the co-financiers and IDA.
C. Disbursements
5.07      Funds from the credit and any other funds which IDA may be author-
ized to disburse on behalf of other donors will be disbursed on the basis
of satisfactory documentation submitted by the Project Finance Officer
(details are given in Annex 6). Normal documents required by the Association
will be submitted for all items of expenditures except FWCs, salaries of local
staff, travel allowance and maintenance of vehicles. Disbursements against
these items will be made on the basis of a certificate of expenditure, the
documentation of which will not be submitted for review, but will be retained
by the GOB and available for inspection by the Association during the course
of a project supervision mission. Certificate of expenditure for the con-
struction of FWCs will be issued by the FWC Administrative Unit on the basis
of certificates of satisfactory progress by the architectural consultants.
The reimbursement will be made in installments: 50% will be paid on comple-
tion of the FWC up to plinth level, 25% on completion up to roof level, and
the remaining 25% when the FWC is put into operation, as certified by the
Secretary of PCFPD. The disbursement schedule is given in Annex 7, T-50.
5.08      The project components to be financed out of the proceeds of the
Credit include: (a) construction, furniture, equipment, and professional
fees for 434 FWCs and 13 THCs; (b) 253 ambulances for THCs, 26 four-wheel
drive vehicles for use in field supervision, and 2,000 bicycles for FWAs;
(c) vehicles, furniture, equipment and operating cost for project implemen-
tation units; and (d) unallocated amount for support to private sector and



- 43 -
innovative activities.  The percentage of the cost of the various categories
of expenditure to be met from the credit are:  (a) 90% of cost of civil works
and 100% of foreign expenditures of directly imported construction material;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures of directly imported equipment and vehicles
and 60% of locally procured equipment and 50% of locally procured vehicles;
(c) 90% of total cost of furniture; (d) 100% of cost of consultancy services;
and (e) 100% of operating costs and support to private sector and innovative
activities.
D. Procurement
5.09      The procurement of civil works items, other than union family welfare
centers and the twelve Women's Vocational Training Centers (WVTC) will be
based on bid packages prepared in consultation with IDA. The bid packages
will possibly total 44 in number with a total cost of about $20.4 million
and will be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance
with the Bank Guidelines, domestic contractors being accorded a preference of
7.5%. Procurement for the twelve WVTCs, which will cost about $250,000 in
total, will be on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures, under
which foreign contractors would not be excluded, and which are satisfactory
to IDA. In all cases, the contractors will be pre-qualified.
5.10      The 700 union FWCs, each estimated to cost about US$46,000, and
altogether US$32.2 million, are too scattered and numerous for the normal
procedures to be applicable.  Moreover, it is desirable that the community
identifies itself with the construction of the centers from the very beginning
to ensure that the community will subsequently maintain and make use of the
centers. The GOB will therefore appoint union project committees, each to
be responsible for the construction of the local FWC, using local resources,
with technical support from the architectural consultants. This approach
has been successfully applied to the construction of 80 pilot FWCs in the
first project. Materials such as cement, steel, bricks and sand, will be
procured locally by prudent shopping by the committees, who will also hire
construction labor. Simple furniture, worth about US$0.5 million in total,
will also be procured by prudent local shopping. Medical equipment, worth
about US$2.5 million in total, will be procured by MOHPC through ICB in
accordance with Bank Guidelines.
5.11      Contracts for furniture, (except for FWCs), equipment and vehicles,
amounting to about US$16.1 million, will be grouped in appropriate bid packages
and awarded after ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines. In the evaluation
of bids, domestic manufacturers will be accorded a preference margin of 15%,
or the applicable custom duties if lower. Contracts for equipment and furni-
ture, which cannot be reasonably grouped in packages worth at least US$100,000,
will be awarded after local competitive bidding in accordance with GOB pro-
curement procedures, which have been found to be acceptable to IDA.



- 44 -
5.12      The project includes US$3.5 million for the purchase of material
for the production of films, filmstrips, transparencies, and printed, training
and raw materials. These items cannot be packaged in lots suitable for inter-
national competitive bidding. Foreign suppliers of such materials are well
represented in Bangladesh, and contracts will be awarded through local com-,
petitive bidding procedures, similar to those adopted for the first project,
which are satisfactory to IDA. It is proposed that drugs and dietary supple-
ment kits worth about US$4.0 million may be procured through UNICEF or through
any other agency following ICB procedures in accordance with the guidelines.
5.13       In order to provide for efficiency and flexibility in the procurement
of smaller items, contracts for equipment, furniture, vehicles and materials
for amounts not exceeding US$20,000 may be procured through international or
local shopping on the basis of at least three price quotations provided the
aggregate of such contracts does not exceed US$200,000. It is estimated that
about US$100,000 worth of these items will be procured in this manner. These
limitations do not apply to the procurement of materials and furniture for
FWCs, which are described in paragraph 5.08.
E. Revolving Fund
5.14      Under the first project, in order to speed up project payments,
GOB established a revolving fund in takas. During the second project, this
Revolving Fund will be retained. The GOB has agreed during negotiations:
(a) to maintain a Revolving Fund in a commercial Bank to be used exclusively
to make payments in takas for expenses of items of the project, excluding:
(i) salaries; (ii) travel expenses and per diem of local staff; and
(iii) import duties and taxes for all imported items for the project; (b) to
deposit in the Revolving Fund at least once a month an amount sufficient to
maintain a balance of TK 1 million; and (c) to authorize the Project Finance
Officer to make withdrawals from the Revolving Fund.
F. Implementation
5.15      The second project will be implemented by essentially the same
agencies as the first. PCFPD will coordinate project activities and a full-
time Project Coordinator will be appointed (para 5.29). The GOB proposes to
retain and strengthen the units set up to implement the first project, such
as: (a) BPDU for civil works; (b) population program offices in the four
ministries (excluding Health) participating in the IEM program; and (c) the
Project Finance Cell which will form a part of the Project Coordinator's
Office under PCFPD. In addition to the above, however, and because of the
large number of FWCs to be built and the unusual procedure for construction,
GOB proposes to create a further unit within PCFPD to administer the construc-
tion of FWCs (Annex 7, C-4).



- 45 -
5.16      BPDU.  The GOB proposes to strengthen BPDU to enable it to handle
the large civil works program included in the project with support from the
consortium of consultants similar to that provided in the first project.
The BPDU is responsible for the planning and design of all civil works
including FWCs but its monitoring and supervision activities will exclude
FWCs. It is responsible for instructing the consultants, checking the
designs and passing these to the Public Works Department for tendering action
and at all stages it monitors the progress of work. It also has responsibil-
ities in the preparation of specifications and tender documents for the
procurement of furniture and equipment. It is essential that the Director of
the Unit should be a senior person with wide administrative and technical
abilities strong enough to ensure speedy action by the Public Works Department
and other agencies. The responsibilities of BPDU vis-a-vis the Health and
PCDFP Divisions are shown in Annex 7, C-4.
5.17      The BPDU was inadequately staffed and equipped for the first project,
and needs a strong director, more staff, office accommodation, telephones, and
transport if it is to discharge its additional responsibilities under the
second project. The second project will provide BPDU with salary support for
four years, furniture, equipment and transport (Annex 7, T-51) and the GOB
will ensure the availability of adequate office accommodation and other
facilities. The consortium of local and foreign consultants set up under
the first project has worked well and there are many advantages in retaining
this arrangement. The strengthening of BPDU through the appointment of a
full-time Director, two additional executive engineers and the architectural/
engineering consultants, is a condition of credit effectiveness.
5.18      FWC Administration Unit.  This new unit under the control of the
PCFPD will deal solely with the establishment of FWCs, together with all
administrative and financial matters related thereto. The functions will
include responsibility for initiating and following up the acquisition of
land; the construction of the centers; procurement of equipment; monitoring
the purchase of furniture; and making the centers operational initially. The
new unit will issue instructions to Deputy Commissioners, Thana Population
Control and Family Planning Officers, and Union Council Chairmen to initiate
and expedite action, overcome delays, and allocate funds. It will be headed
by a senior Engineering Adviser and be staffed by senior administrative
officers. The staff will also include 20 assistant engineers stationed in
the field who will assist Deputy Commissioners and the PCFPD Deputy Directors
in monitoring the activities of the Project Committees and liaise with the
consultants. As in the first project, the GOB will engage a consortium of
architectural consultants to provide technical assistance and monitor and
certify the work of the Project Committees. The engagement of such consul-
tants is a condition of credit effectiveness. The project provides
vehicles, equipment, salary support and other operating expenses for this
unit for four years.
5.19      Public Works Department.  As in the first project, GOB proposes
that construction contracts, except for FWCs, shall be awarded and supervised
by the Public Works Department. After designs and specifications have been
prepared by the consultants and examined by BPDU, the Department will invite



- 46 -
tenders, evaluate bids and, on the approval of PCFPD, which will consult IDA,
award the contracts and supervise the work. To ensure the speedy processing
of tender documents and contracts, the GOB will set up a Population Project
Cell within the headquarters of the Public Works Department for the first two
years of project duration. The Cell will contain a superintending engineer
with an assistant engineer and an estimator for whom the project will provide
salary support (Annex 7, T-51).
5.20      Supplies Directorate.  To expedite procurement of equipment and vehi-
cles valued at about US$14 million under the project, the Supplies Directorate
needs to be strengthened. The project provides two additional Deputy Directors
for Supply and Inspection Wings and furniture and equipment (Annex 7, T-51).
5.21      FWC Project Committee.  As indicated above (para. 4.14), GOB pro-
poses to make local communities responsible for the construction of FWCs.
Thana Site Selection Committees will select and purchase sites, and Union
Project Committees will organize construction. The Chairman of the Union
Council will be a member of the site selection committee as well as Chairman
of the Union Project Committee.
5.22      The Union Project Committees will purchase materials, engage and
pay labor, and supervise construction, which will follow a pattern prescribed
in a pictorial building manual. This manual includes schedules of building
materials, furniture and equipment required, costs and simple building in-
structions. The PCFPD will engage consultants to give technical advice to
the Union Project Committees and certify the progress of work. This system
has been tried in the pilot scheme under the first project with encouraging
results. The experience gained will be used to improve methods in the second
project.
5.23      Since Union Councils are not in a position to finance, even tempo-
rarily, the purchase of sites and building materials for FWCs, the GOB pro-
poses to make them an initial advance of 50% of the estimated total cost.
Further advances will be made on evidence of proper use of the initial advance
and certificates by the consultants that construction has reached prescribed
levels. GOB will have to be prepared to reimburse justified cost overruns.
5.24      Sites.  One reason for the slow progress of civil works under the
first project was the delay in acquiring sites, although the first project
required only 45 sites, while the second requires 755. The locations for
700 FWCs and other physical facilities have been identified by the GOB.
Acquisition of sites for the buildings to be constructed in the first year
of the project as set forth in the master plan, is a condition of credit
effectiveness. Agreement on a timetable for the acquisition of the remaining
sites was reached during negotiations.
5.25      Population Program Officers.  The offices of Population Program
Officers in the Ministries of Labor and Social Welfare (Director of Social
Welfare); Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives; Ministry of
Information and Broadcasting; and the Women's Affairs Division will be pro-
vided with additional staff and vehicles through the project. These officers
have been upgraded wherever necessary so that they can report directly to
their Directors.



- 47 -
5.26      The first project required the Health Division to designate a
Joint Population Program Officer responsible for the execution of Health
Division project components. No officer has been formally designated for
this purpose, although various officers have handled project matters. It is
essential that the Health Division should designate a population program
officer and provide supporting staff for the execution of its share of the
first and second projects.
5.27      Project Finance Cell (PFC).  The performance of the PFC under the
first project has been unsatisfactory with respect to all its functions, such
as the submission of withdrawal applications, keeping project accounts and
routine auditing. The situation has recently improved. An accounting firm
hired by GOB to help to set up the accounting system has made preliminary
recommendations.
5.28      Auditing.  Under the first project, an audit of local currency
expenditures was required within six months of each fiscal year. Government
auditing has been delayed. Under the project the PFC will audit local currency
expenditures and reimbursement in the third quarter will depend on the audit
of expenditures in the first quarter of the fiscal year. This auditing will
be in addition to general government audits. The project provides salary
support for the appointment of additional staff by the PFC to audit the
project accounts.
5.29      Coordination.  For coordinating non-construction activities, the
PCFPD organizes regular monthly meetings of Population Program Officers to
discuss problems they have encountered. The Project Finance Officer and the
Directors of Supplies and Inspection also attend these meetings. However, the
PCFP Directorate has played little part in coordination. Greater participation
by the IEM, evaluation, service delivery, and training units of the PCFP
Directorate would help to improve coordination. Furthermore, no full-time
officer in PCFPD has been designated to coordinate all project activities. In
view of the size of the second project, the PCFPD will designate a full-time
officer of the rank of at least Deputy Secretary to coordinate project activ-
ities.
5.30      Schedule.  The key actions to be taken by the GOB, and the detailed
implementation schedule for civil works and other project components, are
presented in Annex 4. To expedite project implementation, it is essential
to complete the master plan for project physical facilities as soon as pos-
sible. Completion of a master plan by the BPDU and the architectural consult-
ants is a condition of credit effectiveness. The plan is already under
preparation and is expected to be completed by the end of June 1979. Project
implementation cannot be initiated without approval of schemes under the
project by the Planning Commission. Approval of project evaluation proformas
by the GOB is a condition of credit effectiveness.



- 48 -
G. Project Evaluation
5.31      Immediate progress on the project will be measured against an
agreed implementation schedule (Annex 4). Interim progress will be evaluated
from quantitative indicators to be specified by PCFPD in collaboration with
EEU and the implementing agencies. An illustrative list of these indicators
is given in Annex 5. Agreement on the preparation of a plan for project
evaluation was reached during negotiations (para. 4.70).
H. Project Risk
5.32      It would be unrealistic to assume that difficulties will not arise
in the implementation of the second project. The difficulties experienced
during the first project were largely due to the delay in setting up a suit-
able organization for the population program. Although the second project
starts with the advantage of an established organization, uncertainties arise
from the proposed integration of MCH/FP with health services. Given the same
organization, and GOB's commitment to the program, the expected problems are
administrative and managerial. Difficulties in project implementation will
arise if: (a) cooperation between the Health Division and PCFPD does not
improve; (b) PCFPD does not strengthen its own administrative machinery and
improve the performance of fieldworkers and the training of FWVs and other
managerial and supervisory workers; (c) BDPU is not provided with adequate
staff including consultants and facilities; (d) the PCFPD is unable to hire
suitable architectural consultants for its FWC Administrative Unit; (e) the
local committees and thana officers responsible for the construction of FWCs
do not take adequate interest; and (f) sites are not acquired according to
the agreed schedule. If the organization is changed, additional problems
may arise as the reorganization itself may cause dislocation and disruption
through staff transfers. Despite these risks the critical nature of popula-
tion problems in Bangladesh requires continuing external support to help GOB
improve the program. The components included in the project are the minimum
essential to carry out further the activities initiated under the first
project. Furthermore, agreement on actions to reduce these risks was reached
during negotiations (paras. 2.47, 2.49, 2.50, 4.07, 5.17, 5.18, 5.24 and 5.30).
5.33      The GOB is entrusting the construction of FWCs to Union Project
Committees as the only feasible method of erecting large numbers of centers
in a short period of time. It would not be possible to do so using either
the Public Works Department or the normal contracting procedures. There are
risks involved in the system, and some problems and even failures must be
anticipated but the urgent need to bring large numbers of centers into active
service operation as quickly as possible justifies the risks. These risks are
being minimized by the engagement of an Architectural Consultant firm to
advise the committees and inspect and certify the work at defined construction
stages.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The primary justification of the project lies in its potential to
improve MCH and family planning services in about 270 of the 356 rural thanas.
In these thanas, 8,000 of the project FWAs will be given better technical
support by FWVs who will be given additional improved training and provided
with transport. The FWVs, using the ambulances provided in the project, will
also organize mobile clinics in the villages of these 270 thanas and will thus
bring better MCH/FP services to outlying areas. Additional drugs supplied
under the project will help in meeting the drug requirements of these 270
thanas, and will reduce morbidity and mortality.
6.02      In 100 of the 270 thanas, health and family planning services will
be improved further by the establishment of FWCs in each union. An estimated
one-fourth of the population in these 100 thanas will thus have a fully
established health and family planning infrastructure, and the decline in
morbidity, mortality and fertility, which will be measured through baseline
and follow-up studies, is expected to be substantial.
6.03      About 100,000 women will be served by vocational training, func-
tional literacy and health and family life education programs to be provided
in pilot areas. These programs will provide earning opportunities for women
who have not hitherto been able to supplement family income. The first
project has shown that women taking part in these programs are highly recep-
tive to MCH/FP instruction imparted through the programs. The mass media
activities will continue to help in creating awareness of population and
health problems and will thus enhance the demand for health and family plan-
ning services. The geographic coverage of project activities defined in
paras. 6.01 to 6.03 are shown in Annex 7, M1 and M2.
6.04      Assuming improvement in the service delivery system, it is esti-
mated that the program will be able to recruit about four million additional
acceptors by 1983, constituting about 24% of the estimated married women
in that year (Annex 7, T-52). About 1.6 million of the additional acceptors
would be the direct result of project inputs. In addition, about 36 million
women and children (or 56% of the total women and children in the country in
1983), will be reached by MCH and other health care. Of these, about 18 mil-
lion women and children will be served through the project inputs. The
project's physical facilities will continue to serve the population beyond
1983 and will thus result in greater long-term benefits than specified above.
VII. AGREEMENTS
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached that the GOB shall:
(a)  implement the agreed plan of phased integration of MCH/FP with
health services and review its progress at regular intervals in
consultation with the Association (para. 2.47);



- 50 -
(b) maintain the district and national-level organizations being
set up and in the event of any significant changes in the
organization shall consult the Association and take into
account the Association's comments, if any (para. 2.49);
(c)  review the PCFPD's administrative, financial and
recruitment procedures for direct recruitment of staff
and advisers to allow speedy implementation of the
health and population programs and make appropriate
modifications to these procedures as are feasible by
December 31, 1979 (para. 2.50);
(d) review existing programs of community participation in
health and population activities, particularly population
activities in village self-reliant programs, by March 31,
1980 and on the basis of such review shall prepare, by
September 30, 1980 in consultation with the Association,
a detailed strategy to strengthen such activities
(para. 2.51);
(e) carry out the agreed plan of action for improving the
performance of FWAs and FPAs by June 30, 1980; furnish
required information on implementation of the plan to
the Association by December 31, 1980; and commencing
July 1 each year evaluate the activities and performance
of FWAs and FPAs in consultation with the Association and
furnish to the Association by October 31 each year reports
of such evaluation, and based on the results of the reports
take such corrective actions as may be satisfactory to the
Association (para. 4.07);
(f) take all actions necessary to maintain the vehicles and
equipment for the project in good working condition; in
consultation with the Association, undertake an analysis
of the system for maintenance and use of such vehicles
and equipment by December 31, 1979 and shall thereafter
take steps as may be necessary to strengthen such a system
(para. 4.08);
(g) prepare or cause to be prepared by December 31, 1979 an
operational manual for maintaining and operating FWCs
(para. 4.15);
(h) undertake the construction of FWCs in accordance with the
master plan, have progress and quality of such construction
evaluated annually by the architectural consultant, and
undertake no further construction under the project unless
such progress and quality are satisfactory to the Association
(para. 4.16);



- 51 -
(i) establish MCH/FP units in all 270 THCs in operation by
July 31, 1981 (para. 4.19);
(j) in consultation with the Association, undertake a functional
analysis of its health and population programs for deter-
mining the manpower requirements at thana level and below
by December 31, 1979 and prepare a health and population
manpower policy including a national training program by
December 31, 1980 (para. 4.24);
(k) form a research and evaluation committee and prepare in
consultation with the Association a comprehensive plan
of action for evaluating the population and health programs
and the project including its various components by December
31, 1979 and shall cause such plan to be carried out in
accordance with its terms (para. 4.70);
(1) maintain a Revolving Fund in a commercial bank to be used
exclusively to make payments in takas for expenses of
defined items of the project (para. 5.14); and
(m)  acquire all sites for project physical facilities, except
those required in the first year, according to the schedule
agreed during negotiations (para. 5.24).
7.02      As conditions of credit effectiveness, the GOB shall:
(a) conclude arrangements satisfactory to the Association to
obtain external assistance amounting to no less than US$67.2
million equivalent for purposes of carrying out the project
(para. 5.05);
(b)  employ a full-time Director and two executive engineers
for BPDU and architectural/engineering consultants for BPDU
and PCFPD (paras. 5.17 and 5.18);
(c) acquire sites required for physical facilities scheduled
for construction during the first year of the project as
set forth in the master plan (para. 5.24); and
(d) complete the master plan for the physical facilities in the
project (para. 5.30);
(e) approve project proformas for carrying the project
(para. 5.30).
7.03      With the above assurances, the project constitutes a suitable
basis for an IDA credit of US$32 million to the GOB for a term of 50 years,
including a ten year grace period.

STATEMENT OF EXPENDITURE:  FINAL REVIEW OF DOCUMENTS
Maintenance of Project Accounts
1.        Each implementing ministry is responsible for preparation of an
annual budget and for obtaining the approval of the schemes by the appropriate
authorities within the Government. The implementing agencies then incur the
expenditures an the approved schemes and submit the accounts regularly
to the Project Finance Cell (PFC) established under the PCFPD for the
first project. The PFC's terms of reference inter alia include maintenance
of project accounts, internal audit, submission of withdrawal applications,
monitoring of disbursement and utilization of funds.
2.        Additional accountant and administrative officers for implementing
agencies are provided under the second project to enable them to deal with the
expanded financial matters under the project. Also, a PCFPD proposal to
enlarge the staff of the PFC substantially is currently under GOB's
consideration; if approved, the additional staff will enable the PFC to
discharge its increased volume of work adequately. Present and proposed PFC
staffing patterns are described in Appendix I.
3.        A local accounting firm, hired as consultant, under the first
project to review the PFC's accounting system and procedures, recommended
measures to simplify and streamline the system. The consultant's report
is under GOB's consideration. Implementation of key recommendations of the
firm will help in expediting the submission of withdrawal applications and
maintenance of proper accounts.
Statement of Expenditures
4.        Normal required documentation will be submitted by the GOB for
all expenditures except: (a) those related to the construction and
furnishing of family welfare centers (FWCs), which will be undertaken on a
community participation basis, and (b) all the operating costs. For both
these categories of expenditures the Statement of Expenditures procedure will
be adopted. Copies of supporting documents will be kept on file at the PFC,
an- raze Rvailahle for review by supervision missions and audit teams.
5.        FWCs.  Reimbursement will be made at defined stages on the basis
of a Statement of Expenditure certifying the progress of work up to those
stages. These are:
(a) 50% reimbursement when construction reaches plinth level;
(b) 25% reimbursement when construction reaches roof level; and
(c) 25% reimbursement when center becomes operational.

6.        Certificates of progress will be signed by the head of the FWC
Administration Unit of PCFPD on the basis of, and supported by, certificates
of progress given by the consultants.
7.        The statements of expenditure from the GOB will be accompanied by:
(a) a statement of expenditure on each individual FWC included in
the statement; and
(b) a certificate of progress of construction of each FWC included
in the statement signed by the head of the FWC Administration
Unit.
8.        Furniture for FWCs will be procured by the Union Construction
Committees at union level on the basis of prudent shopping and reimbursement
for such expenditure will be on the basis of statement of expenditure certified
by the FWC Administration Unit.
9'        Operating costs.  Statements of expenditures will be submitted for
all items of expenditures constituting operating costs such as salaries,
maintenance of vehicles, travel allowance and purchase of materials.
10.       The documentation and audit requirements for each category of
expenditures are summarized in the following table:

Audit
11.       Ideally, all withdrawal applications for local currency expendi-
tures should be supported by the audited statement of expenditures. Under
the first project the GOB was requested to submit the audited statement
within six months of each fiscal year, but these statements were delayed.
Therefore, under the second project disbursements of local currency
expenditures in the third quarter of the fiscal year will be contingent
upon submission of audit statement of accounts for expenditures incurred
in the first quarter. Such audit reports will be prepared by the audit
team of the PFC.
12.       In accordance with GOB procedures, the General Accounting
Office will maintain overall responsibility for auditing project accounts.
In view of this Office's heavy workolad, however, the GOB has agreed
to provide separate auditing of local currency expenditures under the
project by the PFC. Additional staff for this purpose is included
in the project.

Note: Assuming male labor force participation rate of 90% in 15-64 age group
throughout the period, the female participation rate with same age group
is assumed to increase from 5% in 1975 to 22% in 2050 under assumption
II and to 50% under assumption I. Labor force estimates given in this
table are lower as compared to labor force estimate of 26 million in 1972/73
due to difference in definitions and methodology. Figures in this table
are only illustrative.

/1 The PCFPD's evaluation of FWAs revealed that each FWA, on the average.
recruits 10 acceptors a month, or 120 a year.  For this exercise, we made a
conservative assumption of 50 per year. The target was 4U each year
for each FWA. The larger actual average number of acceptors recruited by
each FWA, plus the fact that there were more FWAs employed during 1975-78
(19,500 as compared to 7,500 assumed in the target), explains largely the
greater number of acceptors achieved as compared to the target.
/2    Number of facilities/staff/cooperatives, etc., financed under the project
multiplied by the average number of acceptors recruited.
