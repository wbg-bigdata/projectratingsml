PROYECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADES
SECOND POPULATION AND FAr Y HEALTH PROJECT
(CREDIT 921-bD)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second
Population and Family Health Project in Bangladesh for which Credit 921-BD
in the amount of US$32.0 million was approved on May 29, 1979. The Credit
Closing Date was extended twice from December 31, 1983 to December 31,
1985. The final disbursement was made on August 22, 1986 and the remaining
balance of US$1.2 million was cancelled. In addition to funding from IDA
and the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, the project was
cofinanced on a parallel basis by the governments of Australia (ADAB),
Canada (CIDA), Federal Republic of Germany (KFW), The Netherlands (DGIS),
and Norway (NORAD) and jointly by the Government of Sweden (SIDA).
This PCR was prepared by Country Department I in the Asia Region.
It is based on reviews of the Appraisal Report (No. 2323-BD dated May 16,
1979), the President's Report (No.2552-BD dated May 16, 1979), the Credit
Agreement dated May 31, 1979, correspondence with the Borrower and relevant
memoranda on project issues as contained in IDA files, background documents
on project implementation prepared by relevant implementing agencies, and a
PCR submitted to IDA in January 1988 by the Family Planning Wing of the
Ministry of Health and Family Planning (MOHFP) in Bangladesh (copy
available in OED files). In addition, a mission to Bangladesh was
undertaken in July 1988 by Country Department I in the Asia Region to
gather data and seek clarification of points raised in the PCR of the
MOHFP.
The draft ofZ IDA's PCR was sent to the Borrower for comments on
September 26, 1988; comments were received on December 8, 1988 indicating
general agreement with the findings of the report.
The valuable assistance provided during the preparation of this
report by officials of the GOB, in particular the .MOHFP, is gratefully
acknowledged.

BANGLADESH
SECOND POPULATION AND FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT
CREDIT 921-BD
EVALUATION SUMMARY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The prospects for economic development of Bangladesh are severely
constrained by a large base population estimated at 112 million in 1987,
and a high growth rate of around 2.6 in 1984; a density as high as 630
persons per square kilometer; and young age of population, with 46.7X below
15 years of age. Even if the Government's current efforts to control the
rate of population growth to reach NRR one by the year 2000 succeed, the
total population by the turn of the century will be around 133 million.
This, in turn, would result in an ultimate population size of about 200
million by the year 2050, leading to a great imbalance between the
country's natural resources and population and a heavy strain on national
efforts to raise the current low level of GDP.
1.02     While the overall mortality rate has come down to 15 in 1985 (from
38 in 1981), infant mortality continues to be high at an estimated 132 per
1000 live births. There has been a progressive decrease in per capita
energy consumption from 2300 calories in 1962166 to 2095 calories in
1975176, to 1935 calories in 1981/82; less than 402 of the population now
have an adequate caloric supply.  Coupled with the above demographic
setting, is a low social setting, with only about 22S of the total
population being literate (1981), and female literacy at a still lower
level of 13.7Z of the female population.
1.03     Starting with voluntary efforts in the 19508, the then Government
assumed responsibility to promote family planning since the 19609. The
1965 governmental program aimed at reducing the populatiou growth rate from
31 in 1965 to 2.5Z in 1970. While the program had limited success,
especially in improving knowledge about family planning, all national
efforts came to a standstill following the war of independence in 1970.
However, the First Five-Year Plan (1973-78) of independent Bangladesh
clearly recognized that the high rate of population growth was detrimental
to national objectives and stated that 'no civilized measure would be too
drastic to keep the population of Bangladesh on the smaller side of 15
crores (150 million) for sheer ecological viability of the nation.' The
plan aimed at reducing population growth rate from 3? in 1973 to 2.8? by
1978. A long-term goal to reach an NRR of one within 25-30 years was al.so

spelled out. The family planning program was based on linkages with the
Ministry of Health, formation of male-female worker teams for the delivery
of family planning and health services, multi-sectoral efforts for
communication activities, activities specially aimed at women, and research
and evaluation.
1.04     It was against this background that the First Population Project
for Bangladesh (Credit 533-BD) was formulated and implemented. The object
of the project was to increase the demand for, and the supply of, MCH ar
family planning services. Towards this end, the project assisted the X
In training MCH and family planning field workers; increasing the numA.. ox
field workers; establishing pilot schemes for introducing family life
education into the activities of five sectoral ministries, and for women's
vocational training; strengthening the capacity of the mass media to deal
with population topics; building-up research and evaluation capabilities;
and supporting private sector activities and innovative ideas. The
project, costing US $45.7 million, was financed by IDA, a number of
bilateral donors like Norway (NORAD), Federal Republic of Germany (KFW),
Australia, United Kingdom (OM). Canada (CIDA), Sweden (SIDA) and by
Government of Bangladesh. The 1977 devaluation of the taka, combined wit
a lower than estimated rate of increase in costs and delays in
implementation, resulted in savings of about US$18.0 million, and by
agreement among the co-financiers and the GOB, the project was extended by
two years to June 1980.
1.05     The project succeeded in creating demand for family planning
services through the motivational program and a modest increase in the
contraceptive prevalence rate. It contributed to an increaste in the number
of trained paramedicals and the setting-up of an organisati a capable of
planning and implementing a broad-based multi-sectoral populaiAon program.
In 1980-81, the number of sterilization and IUD acceptors was 12 times, and
the number of condoms and pills cycles distributed about 6 times that in
1974-75. The contraceptive prevalence rate increased from 7.7 (1975) to
12.7 (1979).
1.06     A performance audit by the Operation Evaluation Department tOED)
raised a number of issues regarding the project. In particular, the audit
raised reservations about the project design, complexity and size,
logistics and management of supervision, utilisation of facilities etc.
The audit also felt that the consensus approach adopted by the Bank to keep
the Cofinanciers with different ideological background together sometimes
led to the sacrifice of the program interests. The audit favored a number
of separate, simple projects over one complex multi-sectoral project; a
more gradual and focussed approach towards project design; greater
delegation of authority to the field in supervision; smaller supervision
missions; and delegation of part of the supervision responsibilities to
cofinanciers. It also suggested a training construction moratorium and re-
orientation of motivational efforts to consumer needs.

II. SECOND PROJECT - FORMULATION AND OBJECTIVE
2.01     A major policy decision taken by the GOB towards the close of the
First Five-Year Plan in 1978 was to formulate a Two-Year Plan (1978-80) and
start the Second Five-Year Plav from 1980 onwards. The Two-Year Plan was
meant to enable the Government Lo complete the projects initiated during
the First Five-Year Plan, which had a delayed start and unexpected teething
troubles. The approach helped the First Population Project too, in that
the project objectives could be met in full by the extended period and the
funds fully utilized. However, pending the above decision on the Two-Year
Plan, the Population Control and Family Planning Division (PCFPD) had
initiated 6teps for the formulation of a second population plan for the
period (1978-83). Towards this, PCFPD constituted a number of committees
with responsibilities for reviewing of ongoing projects in the population
sector, formulating objectives and strategies for the second plan, and
outlining project components in various sectors to meet the overall
objectives, etc. The outcome of the efforts was a preliminary draft
outline of the Population Control and Family Planning Program for the
period 1978-83, made available in March 1977. This outline was
subsequently revised and reconstituted into two separate plans for
(1978-80) and (1980-83), respectively, to adhere to the overall
governmental decision in planning.
2.02     As against the first project, the involvemeut of the Bank and
other co-financiers with Second Population and Family Health Project
started almost simultaneously with the PCFPD decision to prepare a draft
outline for the population sector plan for 1978-83. The Secretary sought
participation by the Population specialist in the Resident Mission and
other Co-financiers, in a technical advisory capacity, in the preparation
of the plan, which was agreed upon; simultaneously GOB conveyed its
informal request for assistance from IDA and Cofinancing agencies in a
follow-up Second Population Project. The preliminary outline of the
population sector plan was presented to IDA and Cofinanciers during the
supervision of the first project held in March 1977; discussions that
followed resulted in a series of actions to be taken by the PCFPD in
refining and elaborating the plan outline. These included participation by
PCFPD in the Country Health Programming Exercise organized by the World
Health Organization (July 1977); completion of UNFPA-financed study on
1Testing, Evaluation and Development of Comprehensive Population
Communication Program"; survey of available physical facilities in the
heslth sector at union level; and an evaluation of the large number of
experimental projects, both in the health and population sectors, carried
out both by NGOs and Government. The GOB took a major policy decision to
decentralize the delivery of both health and family planning services
through the establishment of union level Family Welfare Centers
(subsequently renamed as UHFWCs); this had its impact both on the design
and content of the second and subsequent third projects. A number of
evaluation studies, including one to evolve a mode of construction for
UHFVCs using community participation, were also planned and implemented.



- vil -
2.03     A recurring problem during the first project had been the absence
of a stable working relationship between the Health and PCFP divisions.
Based on the management study funded under the first project, the PCFPD had
strengthened the district level set up; created a sub-divisional
supervisory tier; decentralized powers to district and thana levels; and
simultaneously strengthened national headquarters for supervision purposes.
In view of the difficulties experienced by PCFPD to recruit medical
officers of its own, an agreement was reached with the Health Div:sion to
recruit the required number of doctors and depute them to PCFPD. A working
agreement was signed between Health and PCFPD in 1978, to sort out the
difficulties experienced in establishing a smooth relationship between the
two divisions at operational levels; however, the written understanding did
not have a smooth sailing and opinions were divided both within the
Government and donor community on integration or otherwise of PCFPD with
the Health Division. Caught between the pressures from both within and
without, the Government decided in principle to integrate family planning
with health services; however this integration was planned to be achieved
in a phased manner, spread over five to ten years so that the process would
be least disruptive (I-20); the decisions were reflected in the credit
agreement for the second project.
2.04     While a preliminary identification of the project took place in
1977, this was further substantiated or confirmed in October 1977, well
before the appraisal of the project in April-May 1978. A number of issues
that arose out of the appraisal was conveyed to the Government in an aide-
memoire dated May 11, 1978 and the implementation of the recommendations
contained therein was closely monitored. The Bank representatives visited
the European headquarters of some of the co-financing agencies for detailed
discussion of the project; in addition, following the meeting of the
Bangladesh Aid-consortium held in Paris in April 1979, a session was
devoted to a discussion of the project.
2.05     The project was essentially a continuation and strengthening of
the first project. The objective was to reduce fertility and mortality by:
(a) primarily extending and strengthening the family planning services
and health care delivery system;
(b) increasing and improving the quality of training of health and
family planning manpower;
(c) extending the IEM activities of the first project;
(d) strengthening evaluation and retrearch capabilities; and
(e) improving program and project implementation.
2.06     The project included the following components:
(a) strengtSening the delivery of health and family planning services
through salary support to field workers, purchase of 253



- viii -
ambula,ces, 19 vehicles for supervision, 4 maintenance vans and
bicycles for field workers; constructing and equipping 700 UHFWCs
and 19 THCs; and provision of drugs (DDS kits);
(b)  training support through provision of operating .-st for four
model family planning clinics; technical assistance, books, etc.,
to FWV training schools and expanding the capacity of one FWV
training school; construction of four new schools for training of
medical assistants; construction, equipping and operating costs
for 19 training centers for FWAs/FPAs; and construction and
equipping the tralning building for the PCFPD;
(c) support for 1EH activities through continuation of support for
mass media activities of the Ministry of Information and
Broadcasting; expanding the women's development program to 84
thanas; training of community leaders and use of folk media by the
IEM unit of PCFPD; and strengthening of health education bureau of
the Health Division through provision of equipment, vehicles and
technical assistance;
(d)  strengthening evaluation and research through continuance and
strengthening of the External Evaluation Unit of the Plancom; the
services statistics unit of PCFPD; and the health information unit
of the Health Division;
se) strengthening project implementation capability through support to
BPDU, PWC administrative unit, population cell in FWD, Population
Cell in Directorate of supplies, additional staff for population
program offices of four implementing ministries; and
Cf) supporting private sector and innovative activities.
2.07     The total project cost was estimated at US$111 milliou.  The
continuous devaluation of the taka during the project period, starting from
a rate of 15.0 against the US dollar at appraisal, to 20.04 (1981-82) to
26.2 (1984-85), together with the dropping of thre. project components, and
reduction in the procurement of ambulances and vehicles, resulted in
considerable savings which were re-allocated for the construction of an
additional 335 UHFWCs and in the extension of the project by two years.
The United Kingdom ultimately did not participate in the project and the
items originally proposed to be financed by the UK was financed by IDA and
Australia.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
3.01     The project was approved on May 16, 1979 and the credit agreement
signed on May 31, 1979. Though the credit was to become effective by
December 4, 1979, all the five conditions stipulated were not met before
that date, and hence the effectiveness date was extended and the credit was
declared effective in April, 1980.
3.02     The construction component accounted for about 5OZ of project
cost, and consisted of both major civil works and UHFWCs. In spite of many
precautions taken, considerable delays occured; the first batch of tenders
for major civil works was called in February 1982 and work orders issued in
April 1982 against the appraisal date of the first half of 1980. Initial
delays were caused by delays in approval of PPs, appointment of
architectural consultants, the cost rationalisation exercise in 1980-81 due
to cuts in second plan expenditure, and a governpental decision that the
buildings located at upazila level should be semi-permanent in nature.
After months of discussions, an inter-miniaterial meeting decided that
functional buildings of the training center be pucca-style and the staff
quarters of semi-perzanent type. All these delays had a cumulative effect.
However site related problems were rare. The major contract-related
problems experienced under the first project, particularly related to price
escalation, did not occur in the second project as this clause was deleted.
Decentralisation of powers to Resident Mission expedited issue of 'No
Objection' for award of contracts. There was no shortage of materials; and
contractor-related problems occurred only in a few cases. In spite of all
problems, most of FWATIs were completed in less than 12 months, and thana
health complexes within 18 months. Better coordination and team work
between the PWD - Population Cell, BPDU and architectural consultants
facilitated this. As compared with the first project, there has been
better coordination between construction, procurement of furniture and
equipment and their movement to site and installation.  While the gap
between the completion of construction and taking over of thana health
complexes were attributable to delays in getting electrical connection and
installation of furniture and equipment, part of the delays in cases of
FWATIs was due to reluctance on the part of the principals to take over the
completed buildings (IV-18).
3.03     The major problem with the construction of UHFWCs was the failure
of the project committee system, which was introduced after a pre-test. In
spite of governmental actions to simplify the procedures regarding fund
flow, the system did not function effectively though it had a promising
start. Major causes were attributable to human factors. Therefore, a
change over to a contract system was made, and this too had its own
problems (IV-20). In many cases, the quality of construction of UHFWCs
was less than satisfactory, partly attributable to design factors, partly
to contractor-related problems and partly for want of availability of good
wood for doors and windows. In spite of the problems, some foreseen, some
unanticipated and some beyond control, GOB was able to complete 1035 UHFWCs



- x -
during the project period, an achievement in one respect. The lessons
learned from the second project were analyzed in depth, and corrective
steps implemented under the third project; it is seen that these corrective
actions have already begun showing beneficial results.
3.04     The lack of maintenance of completed buildings, both of major
civil works and UHFWCs, has been a problem. In case of major civil works
constructed under the first project, the second project allocated funds for
a one-time repair. The poor quality construction, combined with lack of
maintenance, resulted in a one-time repair for about 500 UHFWCs, before
they could be handed over to the thana parishads for routine maintenance.
Delays in governmental policy decision as to which agency will maintain
what type of buildings also delayed maintenance. These problems have since
been sorted out; however, the third project had to provide for a
maintenance component both to undertake major repairs resulting out of lack
of maintenance and poor initial quality, and as a demonstration of a good
maintenance operation for health sector as a whole.
3.05     There have been comparatively fewer problems in the Implementation
of non-civil works components. The training of field workers and their
imvediate supervisors went ahead as planned; there has been an improvement
in the quality of training through improved curriculum, training of
trainers, etc. The mid-level management staff at thana and district levels
were also trained in supervision.  The impact of the training, however, was
not fully ieflected in performance since the organizational climate was
unfavorable due to integration. The basic training of FWCs received
substantial input in term of improvement of curricula, higher content of
practical woik, training of trainers, and better quality field training.
The major problem in training lay with NIPORT and the failure of GOB in
developing this as an apex training institution, including its capability
to provide full support to FWATIs and FWVTIs. A major input of the
training component in the third project addresses this problem.
3.06     The implementation of mass media project attached to the MIB
components like leadership training, use of folk media, etc. went ahead
smoothly, though a better coordination between the various agencies would
have been beneficial to the program. Evaluation of both radio and folk
media projects has been quite encouraging.
3.07     The implementation of the three women's projects was affected by a
number of factors like budget pruning at two stages, changes of leadership
at PPO level, and inadequate marketing arrangements for finished products.
The Marketing and Design Development Unit originally approved by the
Plancom was blocked by further cutbacks in the second plan. Still, the
physical targets provided for these projects were achieved. A comparison
of the evaluation studies carried out by the EEU of the three projects, at
time intervals of 4-5 years during 1979-85, revealed that the three women's
projects have succeeded in bringing about some reduction of fertility and
also in raising the income level of participants. The evaluations also
highlighted the weaklesses of the projects; they are being addressed under
the third project.



- xi -
3.08     The performance of both the MIS and the Services Statistics units,
which are complementary to each other, has improved. The EEU has carried
out 28 studies since its inception. Most of these were completed during
the second project. The EEU has since been merged with the Population and
Development Planning Unit to form the 'Program Development and Evaluation
Unit;' so far, the merger has not affected *se functioning of the EEU, as
was originally feared. A major part of the funding under private sector
and innovative activities was allocated to the Swanirwar program. Two
independent evaluations of the population activities of the Swanirwar
revealed that the investment has been beneficial.
3.09     A notable development during the second project was the financing
of Sterilization Surveillance Scheme, aimed at improving the quality of
sterilization operations (III-64); the combined results of a series of
initiatives under the scheme have resulted in the number of deaths
attributable to sterilization coming down from 5.76 per 100,000 (1982) to
1.67 (1987).
3.10     The organizational arrangements made under the second project for
its smooth implementation proved quite effective. The functioning of BPDU
and the Project Finance Cell was much better compared with the first
project. The setting up of the CMC within PCW was netrumental in getting
1035 UHFWCs constructed over the project period. The major responsibility
for coordination of the entire project vested with MCHFP, with coordination
taking place at two levels -- the ministerial level and the secretarial
level. While the ministerial level meetings were discontinued sometime in
1983, the secretarial level meetings were dislocated for considerable
periods. The latter are now being held regularly at the level of
additional secretary, family planning. The coordination of related
activities like IEM, research etc. was not effectively done. The meetings
of the National Population Council (NPC), the high-level body for policy
making and program review did not take place, until the body was
reconstituted into NCPC in 1983 (V-3). On the whole, the coordination
activities should have attracted more attention than what was actually
given.
3.11     The integration of family planning with health at thana level and
below in 1980 and the various amendments made to the original concept
leading ultimately to the present functional integration setup are
discussed in the following section.

IV. PROJECT AND PROGRAM RESULTS
4.01     The first and second population projects, together, have made a
substantial contribution to GOB efforts towards population control. The
project elements directly or indirectly influenced finance and/or support
all the major components of the national population control program, viz
service delivery, manpower development, communication, organisation,
research, evaluation, involvement of voluntary sector. As such, it is very
difficult to isolate the impact of the project from that of the program.
The projects are multi-sectoral in nature and focus their attention on four
major aspects of the population control programs ti) delivery of quality
contraceptive services to the target population; (ii) generating awareness,
imparting knowledge and providing motivation; (iii) improving maternal and
child health with particular reference to reduction of infant and child
mortality; and (iv) raising the socio-economic status of women and drawing
them into the developmental stream. The relative emphasis paid to any of
these four aspects between the first, second and third population projects
might vary; in fact the variations in emphasis are governed more by
infrastructural, social and program development considerations than others.
4.02     The second project consolidated, strengthened and expanded the
activities started under the first project. All project components, except
three, were fully implemented and there were considerable savings in few
othcrs (11-01). On the construction side, an additional 305 UHFWCs were
built; the original allotment for drugs was more than doubled. All project
components were evaluated and results of performance over a five-year
period are available.
4.03     The development of an infrastructure, both physical and human, for
the delivery of PPIMCHIPHC services has been striking. The entire rural
Bangladesh has now two field workers, one male and one female, for every
ward of 6000-7000 population; when current effects to recruit additional
workers are completed, the ratio will change to 2 workers for 4,000
population. A total of 341 UHCs out of 397 are functional; 652 of the 4350
rural unions have a full-fledged UHFWC or rural dispensary; MCHFP units
exist in all functional UHCs. Capacity now exists for carrying out more
than half a million sterilizations per year; IUD insertion facilities are
available in at least 70Z of rural unions; all rural households are within
the reach of household distribution of contraceptives by field workers,
supplemented by nearly a 100,000 of commercial outlets. The expanded
immunization program now covers 190 Upazilas and is proposed to be extended
to another 270 Upazilas by 1990. Remarkable progress has been achieved in
institutionalising ORT at village homes.
4.04     The impact of the communication activities has also been
coniderable; according to a 1986 survey, a large proportion of rural women
have knowledge about family planning methods, condom (72S), oral pills
(77S), sterilization (79S), and IUD (202). The strategy of promoting
radio, incorporating population activities into Swanirwar, and use of folk



- xiii -
media have produced beneficial results. The gap between knowledge and
practice is still large; some studies have reported fear of health
consequences of contraceptive use and objection from religious leaders as
main obstacles to use. The three women's projects have also succeeded
largely, though a number of difficulties remain to be solved (III-59).
These projects cover about 100 thanas.
4.05     Contraceptive prevalence surveys carried out since 1975 have
recorded a continuous rise in contraceptive uses 7.7? (1975), 12.7?
(1979), 18.6? (1981), 19.12 (1983) and 25.3? (1985). Injectables are
becoming more popular; the CPR recorded by some of the NGO projects is as
high as 35-40X.
4.06     The impressive achievement in developing the infrastructure and
delivery of services is not accompanied by corresponding increase in
performance. The field worker performance is still below optimal; latest
studies have shown that each UHFWC is serving only 20? of its targeted
population; as such, considerable under-utilisation exists. While the
capability of PCW in planning and implementing family planning program is
strong, its relationship with the health wing creates a number of problems.
There has been a series of organizational changes starting with full
integration of family planning with health in 1980, switching over to
functional integration in 1983, and the latest arrangements under which the
Upazila chairman is made the co-ordinator for health and family planning at
Upazila level. These changes were not without costs and have resulted in
poor staff morale, lack of team efforts, work stoppages, etc. Still there
seems to be no feasible alternative other than strengthening the current
set up and making it work. Supervision continues to be weak; preparation
of supervisory checklists and guidelines, training in supervision and
provision of transport have not brought the desired results. The third
project addresses the issues in depth, and improvement in organisational
climate is a must for improved supervision and performance.
4.07     There have been many changes in the demographic target set by the
Government. Starting with a more realistic approach at the time of the
first plan formulation, the target was revised to achievement of NRR of one
by 1985, then to 1990. After considerable discussions between GOB and the
donor community, an agreement has since been reached that the immediate
target will be to achieve a CPR of about 40? by 1990, and an NRR of one
around 2000. The third plan and third project targets are based on this.
Considering both the economic and demographic scenario, it should be the
endeavour by all to see that all necessary steps and actions are taken to
achieve NRR of one by the turn of the century and that there is no slip in
this respect.
4.08     The program has also been affected by a number of issues (VIII-
01-26). Some of the issues that divided the donor community are related to
balance between HCH and FP services, system of compensation for
sterilization and IUD, reward and punisbment of workers, etc. The issue of
balance between MCH and FP services has been almost resolved with priority
MCH services being built into the third project and the formulation of a



- xiv -
national strategy for development of MCH services. This can be expected to
make a dent in the infant and child mortality over the next few years (III-
05). A time-motion study is now underway to find out whether the time
allotted by field workers (FWAs) for MCH activities will dilute efforts in
family planning. The system of compensation for clients and service
providers was also a subject of detailed study and the results confirmed
that sterilization decisions in Bangladesh are firmly founded on the
principle of informed choice; however, there has been evidence of a
relatively high incidence of regret among women who experienced the death
of a child subsequent to sterilization, and the 'agents' who function under
the referral system as a potential threat to voluntarism (111-17). Another
contentious issue was the reward and punishment of workers, since the
original governmental decision was to base performance purely on
achievements on sterilization and IUD and punitive action was proposed for
those who failed to achieve the targets (III-18). The issue has since been
sorted out and there is an agreement that the performance will take into
consideration priority FP and MCH services and that a satisfactory
recording and reporting system will first be developed, based on which
performance can be measured.
4.09     The donor community has also raised the issue of sustainability by
the Government of the present xfforts, particularly whether GOB will be
able to absorb into their budget the cost of maintaining the infrastructure
being developed. There can be no satisfactory answer to this issue at
present. The donor community is already aware that more than 80Z of the
development budget of GOB are met from external sources; the Bank studies
have shown that it will not be before the year 2000, when the Government
will be able to reduce their dependence on external financing for their
developmental program to an extent. It is generally accepted that there
can be no slowdown in efforts to reduce population growth rate; on the
other hand, current efforts have to be stepped up substantially if an NRR
of one by the turn of the century is to be achieved; donors are also aware
that the economic prospects of Bangladesh is bleak without a reduction 'n
the rate of population growth and that population control programs have to
be planned and implemented on a long-term basis. In spite of the above,
efforts have to be made to transfer to the GOB revenue budget the cost of
the infrastructure in a phased manner; during the second project period,
GOB has stood up to their commitment by transfering infrastructure costs up
to and including Upazila headquarters to revenue budget. Current studies
now being undertaken under the third project are expected to provide
guidelines as to further possible action in this regard.
4.10     An equally important issue is one of contraceptive mix.  Without
let-up in the provision of sterilization services to those who opt for it,
a greater stress on temporary methods is essential for the reason that
sterilization acceptance by those with parity 3 and above alone will not be
adequate to bring down birth rates to reach an NRR of one. In addition,
the entry into the eligible couple group of a large number of young couples
and the prevailing high rate of infant mortality are sufficient reasons for
much more intensive efforts to promote temporary methods.

V. LESSONS AND FINDINGS
5.01     A number of issues have arisen during the course of implementation
of the project and program, which should receive continuous attention.
Scme of these had already been raised during the audit of the first
project. They are:
(a)  A consensus now exists between the GOB and donor community that
the demographic objective of the population control program should
be to reach CPR of 352 or better by 1990; a NRR one by 2005; and
maintain NRR one or lower until such time as Zero Population
Growth is achieved. An analysis should be made by the Bank by
1990, in consultation with GOB and other Co-financiers, to decide
whether any additional approaches of demand creation over the
existing ones will be necessary to achieve a CPR of about 60Z by
the year 2000, and if additional approaches are indicated the Bank
should mobilise technical and financial support for their planning
and implementation.
(b) In order to strengthen MCH services, the component has been built
into the third project so as to ensure periodic review of progress
in its implementation, identification and remedying of problems
and budgetary support. The beginning now made should be continued
and consolidated in subsequent/follow-up projects.
(c)  Greater stress should be laid on the promotion of temporary
methods of contraception, if an NRR of one is to be achieved by
the turn of the century.
(d)  Frequent organizational changes have been counter-productive.  The
current functional integration set-up should be maintained over
the next several years and strengthened through:
(i) measures to rebuild the confidence of the staff through
assurance of near stability of the structure and facilitating
interactions at all levels and between levels;
(ii) sorting out of gross anamolies, if any, in the administrative
structure (the powers of MIO/MCH need be looked into);
(iii) improving supervision of the program; and
(iv) improving effectiveness and efficiency of the structure.
A major aim should be to increase the effectiveness of the upazila
health complex and this will require actions well beyond
administrative, financial and personnel aspects of financial
integration.



-xvi -
(e)  The present design of UHFWC is reasonable and will cater to
anticipated requirements up to the year 2000. A review of the
design does not seem to be necessary.
(f)  The 39 training centers, along with NIPORT and NIPSOM, should be
treated as a training system for training of all health and family
planning staff from district and below. The fact that a training
facility is created for a particular category should not stand in
the way of its utilisation for training others. The currently
anticipated training and re-training needs will ensure full
utilisation of facilities created for years to come.
(g)  Immediate attention is necessary to improve the functioning of
UHFWrs and reduce under-utilisation.  An appropriate T &x V system
should be evolved to enable this and such a system should includes
(i)  definition of priority functions of the UHFWC, tasks to be
performed and their proper distribution among the personnel
concerned;
(ii) development of monthly work routine for the UHFWC to include
the functions of not only HA, FWV, AHI and FPA but also the
HAs and FWAs;
(iii) holding monthly staff meetings which are to be attended
invariably by a senior staff from among FPOMO (MCH) and FWV
(Sr.);
(iv) utilization of the regular staff meetings for training and
developing suitable Technical Modules for the purpose;
(v)  building the satellite clinics into the work routine for the
center and make them truly functional; and
(vi) welding the staff of the UHFWC into an effective team.
(h)  The present system of compensation for sterilization acceptors has
been found to be firmly founded on the principle of informed
choice. The Government has taken steps to dLscourage people with
only two children to accept sterilization and to phase out
payments to referral agents.
(i)  A system of reward for field workers should be based on a clearer
definition of priority FP and MCH performance indicators and the
introduction of an integrated recording and reporting system, now
under pre-test.
Ci) The Family Planning Clinical Supervision Team (FPCST) should be
continued and strengthened, if necessary, in follow-up projects.



_ xvii -
(k) The multi-sectoral program, now in place. is based upon the best
available information, and experience over the past ten years does
not call for a rec6nsideration of the program and its main
strategy. Integrated projects should, however, have build-in
capacity of a high order for project monitoring, evaluation and
research and these should be strengthened. The findings from
monitoring, evaluation should be carefully reviewed and results
fed into program/project planning and implementation strategy.
(1) Population control projects, whether designed as an integrated
project or a larger number of separate projects, usually cut
across various ministries of Government and will require a high
degree of coordination among implementing agencies. Conscious
efforts should be made not only to build structures for
coordination but also to make them work. Those responsible for
coordination, should not only believe in the value of coordinated
efforts but also make serious efforts to make coordination work.
A clear definition of roles and responsibilities, training for
participating agencies and their staff, periodic reviews to assess
progress and solve problems and above all, involvement of
partiPipating agencies during planning stage itself are useful
steps toward more effective coordination.
tm)  A participatory approach between the Government, Bank and donor
agencies during various phases of definition of program strategy
and program/project development will be highly useful. The
initiative and leadership should come from the Government.
(n) As mentioned in the first project's PCR, the population control
program should be viewed in a longer timeframe of at least 20-25
years, and persistent efforts are needed to achieve results. Once
the critical areas for support are identified, Government should
be assured of continuous support in these areas.
(o) The NGO sector has been a very useful supplement and a complement
to the governmental program.  While their activities are generally
limited to the urban areas, they also have useful functions to
perform in the rural areas.  The Bank strategy should be to assist
GOB in delineating areas where NGOs can be effective and seek
their partnership in the national population efforts.
(p) The currently accepted strategy of fewer and smaller supervision
missions (except for the annual multi-donor mission),
decentralization of supervision responsibilities for Resident
MissiL. and allocation of specific supervision responsibilities to
cofinanciers, based on their interest and expertise, should be
kept under continuous review and strengthened.



BANGLADESH
SECOND POPULATION AND FAMILY HEALTH PROJECT (CREDIT 921-BD)
Proiect Completion Report
1. PROJECT FORMULATION
A. Introduction
1.1      The population of Bangladesh has more titan doubled during the 30-year
period, 1951-81, rising from 42.6 million in 1951 to 89.9 million in 1981, the
date of the most recent census. The growth rate continues to be high and is
estimated to be around 2.6Z in 1984. Even if the Government's current efforts
to control the rate of population growth succeeds, as planned, the total
population by the turn of the century will be around 133 million, close to the
Government's own calculation of about 125 million. The current, 1987, popula-
tion is estimated at 112 million; with a land area of 142,776 km2, the density
of population measured about 630 persons per km2--the highest in the world,
barring some of the city states. About 46.7? of population is below 15 years
and considered young and this figure is almost the same as that of 1974
census, i.e., 45.32. However, the 0-4 age group shows a slight decline to
17.0Z (1981) from that of 18.1S (1974) census.
1.2      As a result, mainly of the control of epidemics, the death rate
declined drastically from about 38? in 1951 to 19 in 1974, and is reported to
have subsequently come down to 15X in 1985. Most of this decline resulted
from a fall In adult mortality and infant mortality continues to be high at
132 per 1,000 live births. Child mortality (1-4 years) remains at an
estimated 19/1,000 population. Deaths in infancy are concentrated in the
first month of life with an estimated neonatal mortality rate of 85 per 1,000
live births; this represents more than 60? of infant mortality against an
international norm of 30-50X. Life expectancy at birth has risen from 48.12
in mid-1960s to about 572 by 1980.
1.3      Malnutrition is a major contributory factor to mortality among
children and to morbidity and low productivity among adults. Maternal malnu-
trition is very common and all rural mothers are classified as malnourished in
terms of weight for height; mean weight of babies born to rural >"omen is
between 2.3 and 2.4 kg. A recent survey of rural children from birth to five
years identified over 60S of subjects with second- to third-degree malnutri-
tion based on weight-for-age measurements; acute malnutrition, pr:ncipally
marasmus, is not frequently found until the fourth year of life. There have
been progressive decreases in per capita energy consumption from 2,300 calo-
ries in 1962-66, to 2,095 in 1975/76, to 1,935 in 1981/82. Less than 40? of
the population now have an adequate energy supply. The per capita energy
intake of landless farm workers averages 1,500 calories per day, a critical
level for basic function without considering work energy requirements.



-2-
1.4      The demographic setting is coupled with a low social setting.  Only
about 222 of the total population is literate, with female literacy at 13.7Z
of female population. The number enrolled in primary schools as a percentage
of the age group rose from 472 (1960) to 622 (1981); dropouts during the
primary stage continues to be high. The gross domestic product (GDP) was
estimated at US$130 per capita in 1983; few other countries in the world have
a lower per capita GDP. Coupled with a low per capita GDP, the income
distribution is also skewed with only about 19S of national income accruing to
the bottom 402 of population. The population is predominantly rural and only
about 121 (1982) live in urban areas. Women, especially face many
disabilities which reduce the quality of life.
1.5      The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) recognized the seriousness of the
rapid national population growth in early 19709. With a low national resource
base, thin per capita income, 471 (1985/86) of rural people in poverty and a
serious unemployment and underemployment situation, the Government recognized
that the high rate of population growth was detrimental to national purposes
and that serious action was needed to control the rate of grow-th as early as
possible. The First Five-Year Plan (1973-78) stated that Ono civilized
measure would be too drastic to keep the population of Bangladesh on the
smaller side of 15 crores (150 million) for sheer ecological viability of the
nation.u
B. Historical Background
1.6      Voluntary efforts to promote family planning in Bangladesh (previ-
ously East Pakistar.) date back to 1950E and this led to the adoption of a
national program in the early 1960s. The 1965 governmental program aimed at
reducing the population growth rate from 32 in 1965 to 2.5Z in 1970, by reduc-
ing the birth rate from 50 to 40 and the death rate from 20 to 15. Toward
this, it established a network of family planning clinics administered by an
autonomous Family Planning Board, independent of the health services. The
program depended on doctors for sterilization, lady family p'?nning visitors
for IUD insertion and incentive payments to program personnel and acceptors.
There were no full-time field workers. The program sharpened public awareness
of population issues and modern contraceptive methods, and thus created a
latent demand for family planning. According to Bangladesh Fertility Survey,
about 822 of the respondents knew about family planning; however, it made no
significant change in fertility as was revealed by the National Impact Survey
(1966-68). Pakistan's fourth five-year plan (1970-75) was supposed to bring
about changes in the program, but its implementation was disrupted following
the civil war and the achievement of independence by Bangladesh.
1.7      Though family planning program efforts came to a virtual halt in the
early 1970s, there was considerable thinking and discussions on the nature of
the program to follow, its structure, targets, etc. As an initial step aimed
at reorganization, the Autonomous Family Planning Board, along with its Post-
partum and Inspection Directorates, was placed under the Ministry of Health.
An interministerial board was also formed in 1972 for policy planning, program
guidance, coordination and evaluation. The Board never met; the planning
efforts culminated in the formulation of a revised national family planning
program as part of the First Five-Year Plan for independent Bangladesh. The
plan aimed at reducing the population growth rate from 32 in 1973 to 2.8Z by



-3-
1978. A long-term goal to reduce the net reproduction rate to one within
25-30 years was also spelled out. The program was based on linkage with the
Ministry of Health, formation of male-female worker teams for delivery of
family planning and health services, multisectoral efforts for communication
activities, activities aimed especially at women, research and evaluation.
The main issue as to whether a vertical family planning program should be
continued or whether health and family planning services should be integrated
was left unsolved. The target was, however, again revised in 1976 to achieve
a net reproduction rate of one by 1985 and thus containing the population size
to about 120 million by the turn of the century. Though the revised target
was unrealistic by any standard, it nevertheless reflected the political
commitment to population control efforts and the urge for accelerated action
on the implementation front.
C. First Population Project
1.8      The first IDA project was, therefore, formulated under conditions of
uncertainty prevailing in 1973, both in environment and program policy.  The
object of the first project was to increase the demand for and supply of MCH
and family planning services. Towards this end, the project assisted the GOB
to: (a) train more MCH and family planning paramedical workers; (b) increase
the number of MCHFP field workers; (c) establish pilot schemes for introducing
family life education into the activities of five sectoral ministries and for
women's vocational training; (d) strengthen the capacity of the mass media to
deal with population topics; (e) build up research and evaluation capacities;
and (f) support private sector activities and innovative ideas.
Project Description
1.9      To meet the above objectives, the project provided for:  (a) estab-
lishment of a number of training facilities (21); (b) salary support for 3,700
FWAs to improve the delivery of MCHFP services (the number was subsequently
increased by Government to 13,500, one for every ward); (c) pilot projects for
women's development programs in about 42 thanas; (d) establishment of popula-
tion cells in the various units of the Ministry of Information and Broadcast-
ing; (e) incorporation of population education in the formal school system;
(f) field projects to cover organized labor sector, Ministry of Agriculture;
(g) establishment of a Service Statistics Unit in PCFPD and an External Evalu-
ation Unit (EEU) in the Planning Commission; and (h) study of the determinants
of fertility behavior, national laws to assess their pronatality impact and
funds for support to private sector and innovative activities. The project
components are detailed in Annex 1.
Financing
1.10     The total cost of the project amounted to US$45.7 million.  This cost
was financed by IDA (US$15 million), NORAD (NKr 45 million--US$8.5 million),
Federal Republic of Germany (DM 15 million--US$6.l million), Australia A$2.0
million--US$2.6 million); UK-ODA (C 1.4 million--US$3.2 million), and CIDA
(Can$2.0 million--US$2.0 million), SIDA (SKr 15 millien--US$3.0 million), and
GOB (US$5.3 million equivalent). The total amount available from the six
cofinancing agencies was US$25.4 million equivalent at the exchange rates pre-
vailing in September 1975.



-4-
1.11     The devaluation of the taka in 1977, combined with a lower than esti-
mated rate of increase in costs and delays in initiation of various schemes,
resulted in savings of about US$18.0 million. With the agreement of the cofi-
nanciers of the project, about US$15.6 million of the savings were allocated
to expand crucial project activities and the remaining amount was reserved for
contingencies. The project was extended by two years to June 1980.
Progress
1.12     During the five-year implementation period since September 1975, the
first project helped the GOB to set up an organization capable of implementing
a broad-based multisectoral population program; to review this organization on
the basis of a management study; to set up a service statistics and program
evaluation system; to increase the number of KCHFP field workers; to increase
the capacity of mW training schools and the capacity of the College of Nurs-
ing to train tutors; to establish pilot women's development schemes; to extend
and strengthen mass media activities; to prepare a population education cur-
ricula; to initiate a study of the determinants of fertility and of the impact
cf national laws on fertility; to initiate the community participation in the
population program through self-reliant village programs; and to test the
feasibility of constructing FWCs through community participation. Preliminary
evaluation of all major project components and activities such as field work-
ers' performance, training of FWVs and FUAs, Radio Bangladesh's family plan-
ning program, women's development schemes, service statistics system and the
self-reliant village program was taken up, and some of them completed.
1.13     The project succeeded in creating demand for family planning services
through its motivational program and a modest increase in the contraceptive
prevalence rate. It also contributed to an increase in the number of trained
paramedicals. In 1980/81, the number of sterilization and IUD acceptors were
12 times and the number of condoms and pill cycles distributed about 6 times
that in 1974/75. The contraceptive prevalence rate increased from 7.7 (1975)
to 12.7 (1979). In summary, the project was instrumental not only in influ-
encing married women to use contraception but mainly in supporting the
quantitative expansion and institutionalization of the national population
program.
Performance Audit by OED
1.14     A performance audit by the Operations Evaluation Department raised a
number of issues regarding the project. In particular, the authors had
reservations about the project design, complexity and size, logistics and
managemtnt of supervisors, utilization of facilities, etc. They also felt
that the consensus approach adopted by the Bank to keep cofinanciers with
different ideological backgrounds together leads, sometimes, to the sacrifice
of the program interests. In their conclusion, they spelled their preference
towardss
(a) a number of separate projects rather than a complex multisectoral
project;
(b) a more gradual and more focused approach towards project design;
(c) more delegation of authority to the field in supervision;



-5-
(d) smaller and more focused supervision missions;
(e) delegation to some of the cofinanciers of supervision
responsibility;
(f) a training construction moratorium until more detailed insights on
the present training capacity and its utilization is obtained; and
(g) reorientation of motivational efforts to consumer needs.
D. Proiect Formulation Process
1.15     By the time the First Five-Year Plan, which had a delayed initial
start and teething troubles, was to come to a close by end-June 1978, the
Government initiated discussions on the formulation of a follow-up Second
Five-Year Plan for the country. Two alternate approaches, and their relative
advantages and limitations were discussed; the first approach was to extend
the life of the First Five-Year Plan by two years to enable completion of the
main projects already taken up and the second to formulate a new Five-Year
Plan for the period 1978-83. The projects in the population sector which were
started in the first plan and which largely made up the First Population
Project (Credit 533-BD) were also midway in their implementation process.
Pending a final decision on the choice between the two approaches, the
Population Control and Family Planning Division (PCFPD) (redesignated as
Population Wing-PCW in 1983) decided to proceed with the preparation of
initial outline proposals for a Population Sector Plan for the period 1978-83.
The Secretary, PCFPD, constituted various committees, with responsibilities
for a review of ongoing projects in the population sector, formulation of
objectives and strategies for the second plan, and outline project components
in various subsectors of service delivery, training, IEM, research, etc., to
meet the proposed objectives; coordination of the work of the various
committees was undertaken by the Secretary himself. The outcome of the
efforts was the preliminary draft outline of the Population Control and Family
Planning Program during the Second Five-Year Plan, 1978-83, made available in
March 1977.
1.16     The preparation of the document was facilitated largely by the exper-
ience of implementing the first project and the framework laid by the
Government while formulating a comprehensive National Population Policy in
June 1976. The policy stated explicitly that population control and family
planning were needed not only to reduce the growth rate and stabilize the
population size consistent with available resources of the country, but also
to: (a) regulate family size to ensure better health for women and children,
higher standard of living aud welfare of the family; and (b) reduce the burden
of larger families and thereby release time and energies of women and youth
for increased production and greater strength of the nation rather than
diverting all their efforts into only building larger families. The outline
of the population policy envisaged the achievement of NRR one by the year
1985, thereby restricting the growth of the country's population to about 110
million by the turn of the century.



-6-
1.17     The outline proposals made clear that the population control and
family planning program was *an integral component of total social
mobilization and national development effort;" within this broad framework, it
stressed that during the second plan:
(a) the ongoing program, particularly maternal and child health and
family planning services, will be further strengthened and expanded;
(b) program responsibilities will be delegated to district and thana
levels to achieve greater decentralization;
(c)  multisectoral thrust of the program, including women's program, will
be strengthened and expanded; and
(d) community participation to develop social sanction for the program
will be strengthened.
1.18     While the outline proposals did not go into the program requirements
in detail, they nevertheless reflected the thinking within the Government; the
requirements indicated a major shift in policy to establish health subcenters
at union level. The other indications were a continuation of the field worker
program and strengthening their training; continuation and extension of the
pilot schemes initiated under the First Population Project; further
strengthening of mass media activities, particularly radio and television;
contraceptive services with greater emphasis on injectables, Copper T. IUDs;
provision of drug and diet supplemention kits (DDS) for field workers; support
to newly formed NIPORT; further strengthening of PCFPD and Planning Commission
Evaluation Units and support to private sector and and innovative activities.
1.19     The involvement of the Bank and other cofinanciers with the Second
Population and Family Health Project started almost simultaneously with the
PCFPD decision to prepare the draft outline for the population sector plan for
1978-83. The Secretary sought participation by the Population Specialist in
the Resident Mission, in a technical advisory capacity, in the preparation of
the plan. This resulted in Bank, and, sometimes, interested local
representatives of the cofinancing agencies, participating in the work of
various subcommittees and in the main committee under the Secretary, which
provided guidance. Simultaneously, the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) con-
veyed its request, informally to start with, for asssltance from the Bank and
cofinancing agencies in financing a follow-up Second Population Project. The
preliminary outline of the population sector plan was presented to the super-
vision mission in March 1977, thus leading to formal exchanges of ideas on the
subject. While the Bank and cofinancing agencies were sympathetic and hinted
at the possibility of their continued fi.Aancial assistance, they advised that
much more effort would be needed so that a viable and practical plan capable
of meeting Government's short- and long-term objectives would evolve.
1.20     Towards this end, the PCFPD agreed that the existing working groups
would be reconstituted and, where necessary, new groups would be formed; all
ministries concerned with implementation would be involved and work out a
timetable to complete the work before September 1977. As a major step, it was
agreed that representatives of PCFPD will participate, along with Health Divi-
sion representatives, in the Country Health Programming Exercise to be orga-



-7-
nized by the World Health Organization and scheduled for completion by July
1977. Such participation would help to coordinate major elements of
population and health sector plans and also draw inputs into the population
plan. Meanwhile, a full report of the task force on 'Testing, Evaluating and
Development of a Comprehensive Population Communication Program' would also be
available; their preliminary findings had been, however, incorporated in the
preliminary draft outline. Another major source of information for the plan
preparation was the survey, initiated in early 1977, of available physical
facilities in the health sector at union level. In addition, it was mutually
agreed that the PCFPD would make full use of the Bangladesh Fertility Survey
findings, and carry out a quick evaluation of some of the experiments being
conducted in the country in health and population, both under nongovernmental
and government sector, so as to draw useful lessons for the second plan on
population. The period April to September 1977 hubbed with activity; most of
the agreed-upon decisions were carried out. Meanwhile, GOB took a decision
that the country planning exercise would be based on a Two-Year Plan for
1978-80 and the Second Five-Year Plan for 1980-85. The PCFPD, which had
anticipated such a decision, could modify their proposals to conform to the
governmental directives, and came forward in September 1977 with their version
of the 'Two-Year (1978-80)' and 'Second Five-Year (1980-85) Plan Proposals for
Population Control and Family Planning."
1.21     The Country Health Progranming Exercise carried out by the WHO pro-
vided valuable insights and inputs into the project preparation. The exercise
indicated that the Bangladesh Health System, with which family planning ser-
vices are inextricably linked, should be improved by providing (a) better
primary health care through home visits and community action at the village
level; (b) better outpatient and inpatient care through the completing of
staffing the THCs and FWCs, which will also be responsible for supervising the
village health workers; (c) stronger communicable disease control program;
Cd) better water supply and sanitation; (e) better training facilities for
health and family planning workers; (f) more efficient procurement and distri-
bution of supplies and equipment; and (g) an increased supply of drugs. Sup-
port for most of these items except c, d and f was ultimately provided in the
project.
1.22     One of the most significant developments during the period reflected
in the plan proposals for 1978-83 was the GOB decision to decentralize the
delivery of both health and family planning services through the establishment
of union-level Family Welfare Centers (redesignated subsequently as Union
Health and Family Welfare Center--UHFWC). The nucleus of the UHFWC was the
earlier union-level health centers, approved at the rate of three per thana
Health Complex and the rural dispensaries functioning in the Health Divisioi.
Most of the rural dispensaries were established in inadequate rented premises;
none had a full complement of staff. Each rural union had a population of
about 20,000 or more and in order to reach this population with health and
family planning services, it was decided that a satisfactory physical
facility, staffed by a team of personnel trained to deliver such services
should be established in each union. The FWC would be the focus not only for
institutional and outreach services, but also for integrated delivery of
preventive, promotive and curative services in health care and family
planning. It was decided to be staffed by a medical assistant, family welfare
visitor and pharmacist; ultimately all existing rural dispensaries and
subcenters, where necessary, would be upgraded to the UHY*C standard.



-8-
Incidentally, it should be recognized that the rural health dispensaries had
the position of a medical officer sanctioned for each; however, these
positions, barring a few, were never filled and were occupied by that of a
compounder. Both the second project and the third were influenced by this
major decision, and it will equally be the case with all subsequent projects.
1.23     A recurring problem during the first project had been the absence of
a stable working relationship between the Health and PCFP Divisions. The
PCFPD, estaLlished in 1975, had carried out a number of measures to improve
its performance, based on the recommendations of the Management Study carried
out as part of the first project. It had strengthened the district level
setup by the appointment of a deputy director and two assistant directors;
created a subdivisional supervisory tier between the thana and the district;
decentralized powers to the district and thana levels; involved the deputy
commissioners and union councils in family planning program implementation;
and strengthened the nacional headquarters through the creation of four posts
of divisional directors. However, proolems persisted in that the PCFPD did
not succeed in recruiting medical officers, of its own, to fill the various
positions at thana and district levels; the sharing of physical facilities at
the thana level between the two divisions ran into constant problems; the
field workers of the health divislon (mW/health assistants) divorced
themselves of all responsibilities for family planning after the appointment
of family welfare assistants. The concept of male-female teams as envisaged
in the first plan proposals did not thus materialize. However, a working
agreement was signed between PCFPD and the Health Division in 1978 which
provided, among many others, arrangements for sharing of physical facilities,
smooth functioning of UHFWCs and village-level functionaries, and for
deputation of medical officers from Health to PCFPD for two years at a time.
After an initial hesitation, an adequate number of medical officers opted for
deputation for longer periods also. However, the written understanding did
not have a smooth sailing; opinions both within the Government and donor
community continued to be divided, with some opting for full integration and
others for a vertical setup for family planning. Government received
conflicting advice; the Bangladesh Medical Association voiced strongly in
favor of integration. Caught between the pressures, the Government decided to
integrate family planning with health service; however, this integration was
planned in a phased manner and spread over a period of five to ten years so
that the process would be most feasible and least disruptive. Vhile the
integration was to start froia July 1979 initially with the district and
subdivisional hospitals, the thana-level integration was linked to the
progress in establishment of MCHFP units at the thana level and construction
and operation of UHFWCs. Thus, the transfer of services at the thana level
and below, according to the schedule prepared by the Government was to
commence from July 1983 with the cowrletion of the establishment of the first
batch of 700 UHFWCs.  The governmenta4 plan of phased integration was accepted
by IDA and other cofinanciers during negotiations and built into the credit
agreement for the second project, to ensure adherence to the same and
contlnuation of a reasonable degree of stability to the organization during
the proposed project period.
1.24     The development of the project was preceded by a number of special
evaluation studies. These studies related to the women's projects, including
one on Marketing and Design Development, Training, Population Program of the
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Research and Evaluation, function of



-9-
the family welfare assistants, etc. In addition, two feasibility studies were
carried out, one on setting up 'Two-Way Radio Communication Between Field
Workers and Thana Health Complex" and the other on 'Procurement and Manufac-
ture of Drugs for Use in Primary Health Care in Bangladesh." These special
studies, along with the evaluation reports made available from the External
Evaluation Unit under the Planning Commission, provided valuable inputs for
the formulation of the second project.
1.25     Another major feasibility study proposed and undertaken by the
Government was to evolve a new mode of construction for UHFWCs using community
participation. The need for the study was influenced by a variety of factors,
important among them, being: (a) inability of the PWD for construction of
such widely dispersed facilities in the remote rural areas; (b) community
participation might attract donated lands fcr construction; (c) entrusting
construction to local leaders will ensure quality, even in the absence of
tight supervision from the top; and (d) above all, the involvement of the
community will ensure their participation in the maintenance of the facility
and its utilization. The Bank and cofinanciers agreed with the approach and
allocated part of the savings under the first project to undertake
construction of 80 UHFWCs on a pilot basis under what was t.ermed 'Project
Committee Mechanism." It was anticipated that sufficient experiences would be
available from the pilot study for their fuller application by the time the
first batch of UHFWCs proposed under the second project was due for
construction.
1.26     The demographic targets for the Two-Year and Second Five-Year Plans
were also a subject of considerable debate. The GOB, during the planning
exercise, worked out the implication of three different demographic options-
-moderate, substantial and drastic reduction in fertility. Moderate reduction
assumed NRR-1 beyond 2000 AD, while substantial and drastic reductions assumed
its achievements by the year 2000 and 1990, respectively. Under these assump-
tions, the total population was estimated to be 132 million, 127 million and
115 million, respectively, by the year 2000 AD. Considering their economic
implications, the Government came to the conclusion that the only meaningful
natioral policy option was to achieve NRR-1 by 1990. In order to achieve
this, under r predetermined contraceptive prevalence ratio, the percentage of
contraceptive users had to be raised to 37.5 by the year 1985. In absolute
terms, the contraceptive users were to increase to about 7.1 million couples
(1985) from about 2.3 million in 1978. The GOB decision in setting such a
high target was a subject of discussion during appraisal. While the GOB pol-
icy reflected commitment at the highest level to contain the population growth
within a short time, there were different opinions, both within the country
and the donors, about the administrative feasibility of its achievement. It
was feared that the fixing of such impossible, though desirable, targets might
have negative effects; failure to achieve it may lead to demoralization, coer-
cion and even fudging of figures at the implementation level. Nevertheless,
GOB was determined to keep its target, and as subsequent developments have
shown, it had to revise them substantially during project implementation.
1.27     A preliminary identification of the project took place in March 1977,
along with the supervision of the first project. Additional inputs were
available before appraisal from the UNFPA needs assessment mission and also
from a more detailed version of the PCFPD plan proposals made available in
October 1977. The appraisal of the project took place in April/May 1978.



-10-
Both during identification and appraisal and supervision missions, the cofi-
nanciers had raised a number of issues, particularly regarding relationships
between PCFP and Health DiFision, performance of field workers, slow implemen-
tation of the first project, establishment of MCHFP units at THCs, retraining
of FWAs, etc., and these were sunmarized and communicated to the Government in
an aide memoire dated May 11, 1978. It was also agreed to postpone negotia-
tion about the project by about nine months in order tu give time for the GOB
to implement the recommendations contained therein. The Bank undertook to
monitor, closely, the implementation of these recommendations through its
Resident Mission. A post-appraisal mission, consisting of Bank staff and
representatives of cofinancing agencies, again visited Dhaka from October 23
to November 10, 1978.
1.28     All the donor agencies cofinancing the first project were involved in
the second project. While the extent of their involvement varied, most of
them participated in the identification, appraisal and post-appraisal of the
project. Some of them participated in the negotiations held at Washington.
In addition, the Bank representative visited the headquarters, in Europe, of
four of the cofinancing agencies for discussions. Following the meeting of
the Aid Consortium for Bangladesh held at Paris in April 1979, the morning of
the second day was devoted to discussion on the second project. While some of
the donors had reservations about the capability of the GOB for executing the
bigger second project and wanted safeguards to be built in, there was a con-
sensus on extending continuing support to the Government for its population
sector plan. As happened in the first project, there were some members of the
donor community, outside the cofinancing group who questioned the wisdom of
investing in civil works; however, the majority of donors agreed on the need
to establish the decentralized UHFWCs as quickly as possible. They did not
want heavy investments in THCs. Donor reservations at the meeting were a
reiteration of what they had expressed earlier, i.e., slow implementation of
the first project, poor field worker performances and the need to maintain
stability on the organizational side. During the meeting, the Government of
the Netherlands also agreed to participate in the project, particularly
through direct financing of the four medical assistants school component. The
Netherlands had assisted the GOB in establishing the first four MA schools
earlier.
1.29     The project was presented to and approved by the Board on May 16,
1979. The project documents acknowledged the risks associated with the proj-
ect both in terms of implementation and impact. The credit was signed on May
31, 1979, about 27 months after the project identification started (March
1977). The date for Credit Effectiveness was fixed for December 4, 1979, by
which time the Government was to complete, among others, the arrangements with
other cofinanciers to obtain external granticredit for the purpose of carrying
out the project.

-13-
Supplies Directorate, the Public Works Department and Project Finance
Cell of PCFPD with vehicles, equipment, consultant services, and
incremental operating cost; (Li) providing additional staff for the
Population Program Officers at four implementing Ministries other
than MOHPC; and (iii) providing additional staff to assist the Popu-
lation Project Officer at the Bank's Dhaka office.
Organizational Arrangements
2.4      The second project was to be implemented by essentially the same
agencies as the first. The responsibility for coordinating all project activ-
ities vested with the PCFPD: the appointment of a full-time project coordina-
tor in PCFPD did not materialize and the Government opted to place coordina-
tion responsibilities in deputy secretary (development). GOB action seemed
justified since the project comprised a major slice of the family planning
program. The Bank had unrestricted access to Secretary, PCFPD, for discussion
on project implementation and sorting out problems; two units set up under the
first project, BPDU for civil works and the Project Finance Cell (PFC) were
strengthened to take up increased responsibilities. The positions of popula-
tion program officers in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and
those attached to the three women's projects were continued and strengthened.
Within the Health Division, one of the joint secretaries was named as the
focal point for coordinating the project components relating to that division.
Based on the experiences of the first project, a population cell under the
Chief Engineer, PWD, was created to strengthen coordination and provide uni-
fied direction to the civil works. A similar cell was set up in the
Directorate of Supplies also. In addition to the above, and because of the
large number of UWFWCs to be built under an innovative approach, the GOB a
agreed to create a further unit in PCFPD to administer the construction of
UHFWCs. It was also agreed that the Government would continue the two coordi-
nation committees set up under the first project, one chaired by the Minister
for Health and consisting of secretaries of all ministries/departments
involved in the project, and the other chaired by the Secretary, PCFPD, and
consisting of PCFPD directors, ull population project officers, etc. The
External Evaluation Unit at the Planning Commission was further strengthened
to undertake the larger load of evaluation activities envisaged under the
project. The Population Planning Section at the Planning Commission had
responsibilities for coordination at the stage of preparation of project pro-
forma, release of funds and revision of PPs. The main direction in policy and
program review for the family planning program was to be from the National
Population Council chaired by the President; as discussed in para. 5.3, this
council was reconstituted in 1983 to form the National Council for Population
Control.
2.5      It was also envisaged that a master plan would be prepared for the
project's physical facilities in order to expedite their implementation;
completion of the master plan and the appointment of architectural consultants
were made conditions of effectiveness.
Cost at Appraisal
2.6      The total project cost, including contingencies, local taxes and
duties, was estimated at US$110.0 million at time of appraisal. The foreign
exchange component wes estimated at US$36.9 million, 34Z of the total project
cost. Construction accounted for nearly 502 of the cost and operating costs
accounted for 222. The appraisal cost is given in Tables 2.1 and 2.2.



-14-
2.7      The largest share (642) of project funds is allocated to the improve-
ment of health care, MCH and family planning services. About 212 of the proj-
ect funds are earmarked for tra.'uing.
Proiect Financing
2.8      The project was originally envisaged to be financed by eight donors
and the Government of Bangladesh, according to the breakdown shown in
Table 2.3. However, Great Britain and Northern Ireland expressed their
inability, at a later stage, to cofinance the project and the items proposed
for their financing were reallocated to IDA and Australia. The percentage
share of total cost at appraisal was Australia 3.7Z, CIDA 4.6?, IDA 29?,
Federal Republic of Germany 16.5?, Netherlands 72, NORAD 18.22, ODM 3.6?,
SIDAtGOB 172. The type of financing arrangements also varied. IDA and
Australia had joint financing; so too SIDA and GOB; all other donors had
parallel financing for specified components. During the process of
implementation, SIDA however desired that the project components they were
financing should be spelled out and progress reports on these sent to them.
Changes in Project Content
2.9      The project cost at appraisal of US$110.0 million consisted of a base
cost of US$83.2 million and contingencies of US$16.5 million. The provision
under contingencies was about 20? of base cost, compared with about 61? in the
first project which was designed under very unfavorable environmental circum-
stances. The exchange value was reckoned at Tk 15.00 to US$1.00 at the time
of appraisal; however, there was a gradual devaluation of the Taka compared to
the US dollar to about 16.3 (1980181), 20.04 (1981182), 23.76 (1982/83), 26.2
(1984/85) and 30.62 (1986/87). This gradual devaluation against the dollar
and other currencies and the initial delays in starting the project resulted
in considerable savings. In addition, three of the project components were
dropped during implementation; these were the training building for PCFPD,
Two-Way Radio Communication System; and the Marketing and Design Development
Cell for reasons cited in paras. 3.8, 3.28 and 3.46. There were considerable
savings under some of the other approved components also, in that the GOB did
not approve the purchases of about 200 ambulances (out of 253), the four
vehicles provided for medical assistants' training and the projects under the
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
2.10     The equipment for UHFWCs was also not purchased, as the UHFPA
supplied these out of grant funds. However, one niajor component was added
through the establishment ot the Sterilization Surveillance Scheme and part of
the savings was allocated to this component. As stated earlier, the thana
health complexes (3) and FWCs (28) originally proposed for ODM funding had
also been reallocated to IDA and Australia. An amount of Tk 6.0 million was
also reallocated to two of the women's projects for establishing a revolving
fund to provide family assistance to those trained under the project. The
balance of savings was utilized to build an additional 335 family welfare
centers and to support all the schemes for another tiwo years (1983-85).
Details are in Annex 2.

III. PROJECT IHPLEMENTATION
A. Overview
3.1      The initial start of the project, particularly the civil works
componeat, was delayed due to delays in formal approval of the project
proformas by the Planning Commission, in the appointment of architectural
consultants and in the completion of cofinancing agreements between other
lenders and GOB. The first batch of tenders for civil works was called in
February 1982 and work orders issued in April 1982. The uonconstruction
components proceeded more smoothly, since many of these were continuation
of projects initiated under the first project and required only
strengthening and expansion. Most of the project components were evaluated
during the project period and comparative figures of performance and input
were available. The project did not however have a smooth sailing
throughout mainly because of three factors: first due to the pruning
exercises carried out initially by the PlanCom, as part of the second plan
pruning, and later by the Martial Law Administration, second due to not-so-
congenial organizational climate resulting out of the initial integration
of family planning with health services at the thana level and below (1980)
and many subsequent changes resulting therefrom, third due to the
abandoning of the innovative approach, introduced after a pretest, for the
construction of family welfare centers in favor of the contract system,
which was also not free from contract related problems, and fourth due to
organizational pruning at the district and national level, particularly
supervisory staff, resulting out of the governmental decision to
decentralize executive powers and responsibilities to the Upazilas. In
spite of the many tremors in the system, the project implementation went
ahead, albeit a little slowly. Due to the continuing devaluation of the
taka against the U.S. dollar and other currencies, there were considerable
savings; this, together with delays in the completion of civil works, made
the Government request IDA and cofinanciers for an extension of the closing
date of the project by two years, i.e., up to December 31, 1985, which was
approved by the Association. It was also agreed that all the project
components would be financed up to July 1985. Only about US$8.0 million
was disbursed out of the IDA credit by December 1983, the original closing
date of the project. The physical targets fixed under the training, IEM,
Women's Projects, evaluation were largely achieved; the contraceptive use
also increased reaching a CPR of 25.3, all methods (1985) compared with
12.2 (1979). Out of a total credit of $32.0 million, the amount disbursed
was $30.84 million by August 1986, t us leaving a balance of $1.16 million
cancelled.
B. Credit Effectiveness
3.2      The project agreement stipulated five conditions to be met by the
GOB for the credit to become effective and fixed December 4, 1979 as the
date by which these conditions may be met. Since the conditions were not
met by that date, the Association extended the date on GOB request to
April 1, 1980. Of the five conditions, the one relating to the preparation
of a master plan for construction of all physical facilities was prepared



- 16 -
on time. The utilization of the services of the Architectural Consultants
employed under the first project facilitated this. The site selection
process was also largely completed; many of the sites for locating the THCs
were already available. New sites had to be acquired for the consLruction
of the first batch of 230 FWCs and the involvement of the thana level
organization expedited the process. The major delays were in the approval
of the 32 project proformas (PPs) and the appointment of architectural
ccrs-ultants. The approval of the PP is a very complicated process; while
the planning commission had powers to approve PPs of value 5k 30 million
(since raised to Tk 50 million), all those above this cost should be
referred to the ECNEC, a high level body. The appointment of consultants
follow lengthy and rigorous governmental procedures. It should, therefore,
be stated to the credit of the Government that these two conditions were
also satisfied within ten months; however, what may be necessary on the
part of the Bank is to work with the Government to evolve simpler
procedures for approval of PPs and appointment of consultants, so as to
expedite the processes and avoid delays in future projects. The
negotiations with cofinanciers also take time, as these are dealt with by
separate desk officers and coordinated efforts are essential. Each donor
country stipulates its own conditicns, which are to be met. It was the
combined efforts of the PCFPD, Planning Commission, ERD, and the Resident
Mission that made the credit effectiveness possible within ten months. The
Secretary PCFPD provided the much needed leadership and coordination.
C. Lmglementation of the Project
Health Care and Family Planning Services Delivery
3.3      A major policy objective of GOB, to achieve its goals in
population control and health, is to build an integrated (ultimately)
system for the delivery of family planning and health services through
male-female teams at village level for domiciliary services, establishment
of UHFWCs for institutional and outreach services; and 31-bedded thana
health complexes (since renamed as Upazila health complexes) for
institutional services and supervisory support to the outreach program.
The Upazila Health Complexes will be linked for further referrals and
support, to the subdivisional and district hospitals. The establishment of
the system components is in varying stages of progr)ss and is expected to
be completed by the end of the Fourth Five Year Plan (1995). The First
Population Project assiste among others, in setting up the male-female
team, particularly the recruitment and deployment of the female members.
The second project provided for sizeable investments in building up the
system particularly through: (a) support to the field workers (female);
(b) establishment of 700 UHFWCs; (c) establishment of 19 thana health
complexes; and (d) drug supply (DDS kits). About 64Z of the total project
iL earmarked for the service delivery system.
Support for the Family Welfare Assistants
3.4      With assistance from the first project, GOB began, for the first
time, recruitment and deployment of Family Welfare Assistants (females) to
work as counterparts to the Health Assistants (males) already in position.
Before the end of the first plan, a total of 13,500 UAs and 4,500 Family



- 17 -
Planning Assistants (PpAs-males) were in position. These workers were
recruited over a period of 30 months starting from May 1976. The FWAs were
responsible for making regular home visits for educationimotivation,
distribution of contraceptives, referrals for sterilization and IUD, and
follow of acceptors, while the FPAs were responsible for supervision and
logistics support to FWAs and, in addition, to contact the male population,
individually and in groups for educational purposes. The new recruits
received eight weeks of trainiug, four weeks in an institution and four
weeks in the field. After a satisfactory initial start, performance of the
field workers deteriorated; and the main reasons for poor performance were
identified as inadequate basic training; absence of technical supervision;
lack of training of supervisors in supervisiong absence of drugs and
logistics support such as transport; and inadequate community support for
contraceptive use. Further, about 402 of the workers were found to be
related to community influentials which made administrative control
difficult. However, both the GOB and donor community were unanimous and
confirmed by evaluation studies, that the FWAs are the only sources of
FPIMCH services at the community level and therefore improvement in their
performance is critical to the program's success.
3.5      A plan of action for improving the performance of FWAs and FPAs
was agreed upon during negotiations and the major components of the plan
consisted in retraining of FWAs; training in supervision for their
supervisors; technical support and on-the-job training of FWA by family
welfare visitors (FWs); supply to FWAs and FPAs with limited supplies of
medicines, nutri- tional supplements to enhance their acceptability;
creating social sanction to the contraception through the involvement of
community influentials; setting up of union level committees; and
delegating responsibility to the union council for monitoring WA's work.
In addition GOB thought about a system of incentives and disincentives
related to performance and also a change in methodology of work of FWAs.
The project provided for training, logistics support--particularly of
transport to FWAs and their supervisors, setting a two-way Radio
Communication System between field workers and the thana health complex.
The credit agreement al-3 stipulated a timetable for the plan of action and
also for the evaluation of field worker performances at regular intervals.
3.6      It should be stated that the plan of action agreed upon has been
substantially carried out by the GOB, as can be seen from the following:
(a) to impart additional refresher training to FWAs and FPAs, the GOB
set up, by utilizing the savings under the first project, 19
district training teams, each staffed by two full-time trainers, a
training officer carefully selected from among the thana family
planning officers and one family welfare visitor.  Both the
training center and hotels were located in rented premises and the
UNFPA supplied a vehicle and some audio visual equipment to each
of the training teams. Both the FWAs and FPAs were initially
trained together in the first week of the two weeks course; the
second week of FPA training specially concentrated on supervision.
The training strategy was changed after the GOB announcement of
integration of family planning with health services in 1980; the
announcement resulted in the organization of one-week team
training for FWAs and HAs together. It was also decided that



- 18 -
henceforth both the male and female workers will be trained
together. Following this, the 19 training teams, commenced a two-
week (12 working days) training program for FWAs and HAs and after
the comp'etion of one course of training for all FWAs and HAs, the
training was repeated with a slightly modified curriculum. The
FPAs also received a two-week training. The other supervisors
were trained at NIPORT. Each of the FWAs was supplied with a set
of three flash cards and other pamphlets that she could carry and
utilize in her educational work;
(b) the technical link between FWAs and FWVs was strengthened; first,
through a proposed weekly visit by the FW to each of the three
FWAs in her jurisdiction, during which visit FWV will provide MCH
services and also provide technical support to FWA, and secondly
through fortnightly meetings proposed to be held at the UHFWCs for
program review and planning.  In spite of governmental
instructions, the technical link was not effectively established
since the FWVs never made regular weekly visits to FWAs and the
fortnightly meetings at UHFWCs were also irregular and, whenever
held, were used for routine administrative reporting:
(c)  Government also initiated a series of steps to create social
sanctions for use of contraception. Union level committees were
constituted to review the progress of work every month and render
assistance to field workers; the Swanirvar program initiated
training of village influentials in population control and family
planning; IEH unit organized regular seminars for religious
leaders; and the mass media, particularly radio, was used
extensively for promotion of family planning both by Government
and NGO eector. The involvement of the Ministry of Education,
particularly the training of headmasters of primary and secondary
schools (through UNFPA assistance) lent credibility to the
program; similarly training was organized to involve women members
of parliament;
(d) the PCFPD proposal to involve the Union Council Chairmen and the
concerned Ward MemLer in supervision of the progrpnu through
certification of the FWA performance before her monthly salary was
disbursed, however, ran into trouble. The orders were resisted
not only by the field workers but also their supervisors like FPA
and thana family planning officer and were ultimately withdrawn.
This raised a fundamental issue in the sense that, unless the
workers are appointed and paid by the Union Council/Upazila out of
their budget, it may not be possible to insist on work
certification by the elected members. Moreover the involvement of
the commnity, at this stage of program development, has to be
sought through their participation in program planning and
implementation, particularly educational efforts; the assignment
of a certification role to the elected members might have the
opposite effect of making them function as line supervisors to the
field workers and the neglect of their essential role in program
promotion activities; and



- 19 _
(e) the GOB also introduced a system cf reward and punishment for
field workers through their orders issued in 1983; but this was
not implemented for reasons cited in para. 8.18. As a recognition
for good performance, medical officers, who performed very well
were given preferential treatment for study tours abroad and
higher training, both inside and outside the country.
3.7      The project provided for improving transport and communication
facilities whicn were severely lacking. The main provision included the
purchase of 253 ambulances, one for each thana health complex with a
functioning MCHFP unit; four maintenance vans; 4,000 bicycles. The
purchase of ambulances ran into trouble right from the beginning in view of
the orders issued by the Government banning the purchase of four wheelers;
the approved PP therefore, as a special case, contained provision for the
purchase of only 50 ambulances. Additionally purchase of 12 jeeps to
improve the mobility of deputy directors of districts, who had no
transportation and of 100 motorcycles for supply to thana family planning
officers was approved.  The ambulances were to be placed at the MCW.
Centers at the district/subdivisional level for requisition by the thana
health complexes as and when necessary. In addition to IDA, there were two
other agencies financing transportations UNICEF and UNFPA. The
procurement was therefore coordinated so that IDA funds were to be utilized
to fill in gaps. At a later stage the Association agreed to finance
purchase of 21 pick-ups for transportation of MSR and DDS kits from
districts to Upazilas; the advisor (logistics) had asked that this urgent
need be met. The Government did not agree to supply bicycles to FWAs
straight away; on the other hand they supplied two or three cycles to each
of the district training team and FWV training schools so that all trainees
who attend courses be given tLaining in the riding of bicycles. Bicycles
were purchased to meet the needs of FPAs. In short, the mobility of all
supervisory staff from FPA to the Deputy Director (Family Planning) at
district level was improved through supplies from IDA, UNFPA and UNICEF.
3.8      To improve the communication facilities between the field workers
and the thana, the project provided for setting up a pilot two-way Radio
Communication System in selected thanas. A feasibility study carried out
by the consultants recommended setting up the system. However, the
proposals were abandoned at implementation stage, since the Government had
second thoughts about its capacity to maintain the system. Secondly, the
Government came forward with proposals to improve the telecommunication
facilities by providing all rural unions with public telephone exchanges
before the end of the second plan, and providing telephone connection to
each thana health complex. By now the communication facilities have
improved considerably; all THBs have their own phones. The dropping of
this component did not affect the project adversely, primarily due to
improvement in the mobility of the supervision staff and also because of
the decentralization of sterilization facilities to selected unions in each
thana.
3.9     'While considerable inputs were made to improve the performance of
field workers, the issue remains as to how much of an impact they produced.
The key role of FWAs in the program has influenced a number of authors to
undertake studies to evaluate their performance. A total of about 14



- 20 -
studies have been carried out over a ten-year period from 1978 directly
concerned with field worker performance; in addition, findings from a
number of other studies are also relevant to the subject. Most of the
earlier studies revealed deficiencies in their training, lack of
supervisory support, inadequacy of field visits, noninvolvement of
coummity leaders, lack of skill in motivational techniques, etc. In view
of the diverse inputs that went into the program from 1980, it may be
worthwhile to look into some of the recent studies on their performance. A
study by Mabud (1986) showed that 37.21 of the eligible women were never
visited by FWAs in a period of three months; it also showed that
supervisory support was inadequate. While the results of the latest
evaluative study on FWAs by External Evaluation Unit is still expected, a
baseline study on MCHFP field workers by NIPORT (1988) showed that 751 of
the interviewed married women reported a visit to them by the FWA during
the month preceding the interview. However studies by H. R. Khan and
others (1985) reveal that less than 301 of the household heads were
contacted by domiciliary workers during the preceding three months of
interview. The CPS Survey (1985) also reports a deterioration in home
visitation by field worker, compared with 1983. The results of the above
studies reveal quite divergent findings and might be due to differences in
sample, nature of questions asked, etc. 'Whatever the reasons, it seems
clear that the performance of FWAs in terms of domiciliary visits is still
below expectation. While many reasons could be advanced for the same,
there is a consensus that the more important aret supervision still
continues to be weak and is regulatory in nature; the area/population
assigned to the field worker is too large as revealed by the Matlab
experiences and that of NGOs; there is need still to improve the quantum
and quality of training received by the field workers; though the field
workers state during formal conversation that they visit 20 households per
day as per the PCFPD circular, informal discussions reveal that their
visits are confined to easily accessible areas and to households which show
some interest to accept family planning. The experiences during the
project also confirm that training alone will be inadequate to improve
performance. It has to be backed up by organizational climate and
supervision, both of which were lacking during the project period.
3.10     The job descriptions of the FWAs underwent changes during the
project period and a consensus on the subject is still to emerge. The
integration proposals (1981) provided for a set of uniform function for
both FNA. and HAs reflecting both health and family planning services.
These were again separated in 1984; and under the revised job description
FWA was assigned not only family planning but also for selected maternal
and child health responsibilities like referring pregnant women to FWVs,
education regarding imuunization, distribution of vitamin A capsules, etc.
PCFPD has issued orders that the FWAs working in Upazilas taken up for
intense immunization services will devote one day a week for that activity.
These job functions reflected the mandate vested in PCFPD for family
planning and MCH services, and reflected more of a consensus within the
Government and donor communmity. However, some among the donor community
still argue that the additional functions, particularly immunization will
reduce her ability to spend adequate time on family planning, though it
might improve her credibility in the community. A time-motion study has
therefore been undertaken recently to seek answers to some of the question
still agitating donor minds.  The Matlab study recommends the addition of
NCH function to FWAs, but on an incremental basis and linked with training
and performance.



- 21 -
3.11     What emerges clearly out of the experiences is that there is no
short cut to improving field workers performance. A three-pronged strategy
of: (a) increasing the density of FWAs by reducing their work area and
jurisdiction; (b) complementary steps to strengthen the managerial aspects
of health and family planning services delivery system with particular
reference to clear job descriptions, functions related training,
strengthened and supportive supervision both administrative and technical,
team planning and team work among the UHFWC staff, including field workers;
and (c) a bottom-up IDM strategy that will produce a *pull effect' on the
field workers. Of the above a number of steps to improve quality of
training have been initiated from 1984-85 and the third project strengthens
and builds on them still further. The third project has also addressed the
need to increase worker density; an additional 10,000 FWAs are being
recruited so that there will be one worker (PWA) for 4,000 population.
Measures to improve supervision have been built into the project;
para. 3.1' !-rvides some suggestions on better functioning and utilization
of UHPWCs. The synergetic effect of all the above should help to improve
field worker performance. Further changes in the organizational set up
should be avoided.
Establishment of UHFWCs
3.12     The second project provided for the establishment of 700 UHFWCs as
part of the GOB plan to establish this static facility in all the rural
unions in a phased manner, starting with the Second Five Year Plan. The
plan provides for upgrading some of union dispensaries through repairs,
renovations and additions where necessary; each UHFWC will have a uniform
staffing and functions. While the union level subcenter and dispensaries
belonged to the health division, the new centers are to be established by
PCFPD. As a preliminary step, construction of 80 UHFWCs were undertaken
under the first project to test out the feasibility of involving the local
community in the process; a survey of existing union level health
facilities (para. 1.17) indicates which of the dispensaries wanted repairs
and renovation. The 700 UHFWCs were to be constructed in three phases, the
first batch of construction commencing from the fourth quarter of 1979; the
second and third from the fourth quarters of 1980 and 1981, respectively.
Selection of adequate number of sites for the first batch of construction
was a condition of credit effectiveness.
3.13     As already explained in the PCR for the first project, the
experiences with the project committee mechanism were uneven. Difficulties
were experienced due to fund shortages, procedural delays in release of
funds and inflexible accounting procedures to deal with price escalation.
Two consultants hired by the PCFPD in March 1980 to generally study and
reconmmend steps to simplify procedures in the area of general
administration, had, in their initial report, recommended simplified
procedures to sanction and release of funds from district to union levels
for the UEFWC component. These recommendations were accepted and put into
effect. The first batch of construction of 230 UHFWCs through the project
committee system started in 1979; in view of the unsatisfactory performance
of the project committees, the second batch of construction of 300 (1982)
was split up between the project committee system and contract system, the
former being adopted in those districts where the committee system was



- 22 -
functioning better. The third and subsequent batches, including those to
be built from the savings were awarded on contract basis and a total of
1,035 centers were thus established during the period 1979-1985, under the
project. In addition, there were UHFWCs established through assistance
from other donors. Some rural dispensaries were converted using GOB fund,
with the result that a total of 1,620 UHFWCs were available for service
delivery by 1987.  Another 125 have 1een completed under the third project,
making a total of 1,745.
3.14     There was a lag between completion of construction and making the
centers functional. Initial delays were due to late recruitment of medical
assistants by PCFPD; while trained family welfare visitors were available,
they had to be transferred to unions where UHFWCs were established.
Shortage of pharmacists did not permit their posting to all centers. This
was not considered a serious deficiency since the work load could be
managed by MA and FWV. The deputy director (FP) at the district level was
responsible for tendering and purchase of furniture; procedural delays and
cost escalation problems delayed procurement. The Director-General, PCFPD
was responsible for supply of equipment out of the UNFPA supplies and each
center was to be supplied with one NWC kit, one MCH kit, one mid-wifery
kit, one IUD kit and one TBA kit. The coordination of procurement of the
required equipment was done by the Bank, UNFPA and GOB. The IDA provision
for equipment purchase was not utilized.
3.15     The project also envisaged the preparation by December 1979 of a
manual for operation and maintenance of FWCs. The draft of this manual was
originally prepared by an expatriate consultant hired for the purpose. A
precondition for its completion was a pretest in selected UHFWCs, and this
process was unduly delayed due to the frequent organizational and
administrative changes since 1980. The Munshigang project which had
gathered sufficient experiences in running UHFWCs agreed to complete the
manual; about 7,000 copies have since been printed and distributed to all
UHFWCs. While it was envisaged that the MA and FWA will be oriented to the
use of the manual through a one-week training, the proposal is still to
materialize.
3.16     A number of administrative problems also cropped up in the running
of the UHNNCs. First, was the line relationship between MA and FW, with
MA being in charge, and this issue was settled only after PCFPD began
recruiting MAs on their payroll. Second was the supervision which was
initially shared by the HO (MCH) and thana family planning officer. The
detailed working arrangements issued under the functional integration
proposals (1983) distributed the supervision functions among the medical
officers in THC on a geographic distribution basis. The arrangement did
not work due to non-cooperation from the medical officers. Lack of
transport was advanced as the obvious reason for not performing the
supervision duties.
3.17     Midway through the second plan period, there were indications that
the UHFWcs, designed as the cutting edge for the family planning and
primary health care services were not functioning satisfactorily. Results
of three evaluation studies are since available, the first covering the
period January 1980-December 1982, the second, based on an Observational
Evaluation conducted in early 1985; and the third based on a study on



- 23 -
*Evaluation of the MCH services Programg carried out by PDEU in late 1985.
The first study compared the performances of newly constructed FWCs with
those of the previous ones constructed by PWD. While it touched upon
utilization, major emphasis was on comparison of other variables. The
PCFPD instruction issued in 1985 clearly defined the job functions of M.A.
and PWA, relationships, holding of satellite clinics, holding of
fortnightly meetings, drug supply, etc. The staffing of the UHFWCs had
considerably improved and drug supply streamlined. Major findings arising
out of the evaluation studies are:
(a) a total of about 180 clients were utilizing the UHFWCs per month, for
medical relief, antenatal and postnatal care and family planning
services. However, the study on MCH service program, reveals an
attendance of about 20 per day (mothers and children only) among the
UHFWCs studied. The antenatal and post natal care did not show much
variation (37 and 30 cases per month) were reported in the latter two
studies;
(b) as against three days to be spent by FWVs on home visits, the studies
show that they rarely make home visits; some report one or two visits
per month;
Ic) the instruction to conduct satellite clinics are not followed in
practice;
,d)  regarding supervision of UHFWCs, one study showed 50Z of M0s (MCH)
did not make any supervisory visits to UHFWCs over a three-month
period. Among the 40 FPOs studied, 1OZ did not visit any UHFWC over
a three month period. Those visited did so mainly for checking
registers of attendance or verify the stock of medicines;
(e) fortnightly meetings to review progress were not regular; even when
held, the HAs and AlIs did not attend the meeting;
(f)  studies highlighted lack of administrative control by M.0. (MCH) over
FWV and M.A. Shortage of drugs was reported; and
(g) only 18 out of 32, and 13 of 32, MP.s and FWVs were actually residing
in the quarters provided.
3.18     The evaluat-'-.- show that the utilization of UHFWCs is poor; against
an expected number of 5,000 patients it is supposed to cater to, the actual
number served varies from 1,080 to 3,000. The reasons are also not far to
seek: Supervision is the weakest link, no outreach services are rendered, the
health personnel functions separately, and there is no work routine for the
UHFwCs. The third project addresses some of these issues directly through a
strengthened supervision system, through the creation of post of MO (CC and
MCH) at district level and a post of a senior FWV at thana level. Additional
transportation is also provided under the project. At the UHFWC level, the
development of proper work rcttine combining institutional and outreach
services (including holding of satellite clinics, monthly meetings centered on
the work routine and attended by one senior staff from thana health complex)
will be essential. The monthly meeting should be strengthened through in-



- 24 -
service training activity utilizing specially prepared technical modules for
the purpose. Senior FWs should be paid transportation allowances, relaxing
the five-mile radius limit for claiming travelling allowance. Further details
are in para. 8.15.
Establishment of 19 Thana Health Complexes
3.19     The 19 thana health complexes provided under the project were
completed and started functioning during the period 1984-86. In order to
strengthen the MCHFP services with the TBCs, it was envisaged that an MCHFP
unit headed by separate staff of one medical officer and two family welfare
visitors should be established.  These units have become operational in all
the 368 functional TSCs. In order to maintain contact with the field, the
FWVs are expected to make field visits in the unions where the THCs are
located. The drug supply is being taken care by issuing six DDS kits every
year to each MCHFP unit. These units will ultimately help not only to reduce
infant and maternal mortality, but also improve family planning services. The
unit has access to the special beds earmarked in each TIC for HCHFP services.
3.20     In view of their crucial role in the country's health system, the
functioning of the THCs are subject to critical review. They have been
strengthened during the second plan period through the addition of three posts
of consultant medical officers in medicines, surgery and gynecology. Two
studies, one conducted by BIDS (1985) on functioning of TICs and the other by
the External Evaluation Unit of the Planning Commission on evaluation of MCH
services program (1987) are available. The BIDS study reveals critical staff
shortages in THCs (113 of total posts were vacant); an average daily
attendance of 125 in each THC, with 63Z of patients from within a radius of
three miles; bed occupancy of about 542. Lack of essential medicine and
surgical equipment, frequent electricity failures and poor diet were cited as
the main reasons for poor bed-occupancy rates. All THCs had facilities for
outdoor distribution of contraceptives.
3.21     On HCH services, the THC study reports a daily attendance of 51
persons of which 522 are children and 482 adult females. A third of the
surveyed THCs delivered inpatient MCH service; 672 of bed nights were utilized
by mother and children. Institutional deliveries were however low, mainly
attributed to lack of female doctors. The MCH evaluation study also expected
a daily attendance of 27, and a monthly attendance of about 50 for antenatal
and postnatal care; and about 4.5 deliveries per month.
Drug Supply
3.22     A rapid expansion of primary health care services through the
establishment of TICs and UHFUCs have increased the demand for essential drugs
for the program. The project provided US$4.0 million for supply of DDS kits
to UHFWCs and MCHFP units in order to augment the supplies available from
UNICEP to TICs and rural dispensaries. Procurement of DDS kits was made
through UNICEF who had the experience and expertise in the matter. The
contents of the kits were finalized by a committee headed by Director-General
(Health) specially appointed for the purpose. The list included two
categories, one to be imported (17 items) and the other locally purchased (10
items). The first supply 2,700 DDS kits reached the country in 1982 followed
by another five installments of additional 29,550 kits. The Federal Republic



- 25 -
of Germany who financed the DDS kits increased their grant to this
subcomponent by an addition DM 7.5 million towards the close of the project.
This enabled the drug supply to be maintained at a minimum level until the
arrival of supplies from the third project. The procedures for supply of DDS
kits were also streamlined. Each functioning UHFWC was to get one DDS kit per
quarter; MCHFP units were to receive six kits per year and MCW centers also a
similar quantity. The kits were to be transported to the THCs in unpacked
condition, and a committee under the chairmanship of THFPO was constituted to
open and verify the contents. There were problems regarding availability of
adequate contingent funds required for transportation of kits from district
down to union and this has been since sorted out.
3.23     Meanwhile, GOB has taken some initiatives to increase the supply of
essential drugs for the program. Apart from the essential drug manufacturing
unit at Dhaka, a second factory has been established at Bogra which has
started manufacturing tablets. Manufacture of injectables and ointments is
yet to be taken up. Sufficient capacity exists in the private sector also for
the manufacture of essential drugs. The Government, through UNICEF's
assistance, has already started the preliminaries in connection with
procurement of DDS kits from within the country. The kits are to be supplied
in standard packings and the quality have to conform to international
standards. The local manufacturers have quoted for the supply of 5,000 kits
in the first instance. A new committee was appointed to review and determine
the components of DDS kits in the light of latest information available on
disease pattern, provisions in the new drug policy, etc. The committee has
completed the task and come forward with a list of 18 items that now
constitute in the DDS kit. NGOs are also being supplied with DDS kits for
their essential requirements for MCH services; the Director-General,
Population Control Directorate determines each request on merit. In order to
ensure proper use of DDS kits the GOB has strengthened its system for
monitoring supply and distribution. Four monitoring teams each staffed by an
expatriate and a national counterpart monitor the logistics supply; a n.milar
monitoring, though less intensive in nature, is carried out by the two
vigilance teams attached to the directorate general.
Training of Health and PP Nanpower
3.24     Among a large variety of health and family planning workers and
supervisors engaged in FPIPHC services delivery, seven categories are working
at union level and below, viz medical assistant (MA), family welfare visitor
(FWV), pharmacist, Assistant Health Inspector (AHI), family planning assistant
(PPA), family welfare assis'ant (PWA), and health assistants (HA).
Supervisory officers from thana consist of thana family planning officer and
medical officer. The first project emphasis was on the basic training of
FWVs, medical officers, and initial training of newly recruited FWAs, though
some assistance was made available for in-service training also. The second
project, while financing the continuation of the basic training activities
initiated under the first project, added the category of medical assistants to
it and strengthened and expanded the retraining component and of supervision
training.
3.25     Medical Officers. The medical officers are key to the provision of
health and family planning services including supervision, support and on-the-
job training of a large category of service providers. Their attitude,



- 26 -
orientation to community health and family planning services, knowledge and
skill in plauning and delivery of such services is crucial.  To facilitate the
first project had financed eight field training thana health complexes, one to
be attached to each medical college, and these are yet to be put to use.  A
high pow,r committee recently appointed by GOB to look into health manpower
requirenents until the year 2000 has reconmended attachment of at least three
THCs to each medical college to strengthen the training of medical students in
community health. Meanwhile, the facilities created are used for training of
newly recruited (5,000) health assistants. The second project provided the
operating cost of four Model Family Planning Clinics constructed under the
first project. :Aese facilities are fully staffed and equipped. All medical
undergraduates spend at least 15 days in the model clinics and medical
internees and the senior house surgeon spend longer periods.  As pointed out
by OED in their audit of the First project Completion Report, these clinics
are still underutilized: They do not have adequate clinical material, as well
as sterilization and IUD for demonstration and practical training purposes. A
number of attempts by PCFPD to influence larger referrals by field workers of
sterilization cases have not succeeded. The availability of BAVS clinics in
the same locality with better quality services, reported offer of better
monetary and other facilities to field workers referring cases, and NGG
control of field workers in urban areas are cited as some of the reasons.
However, renewed efforts are now being made by PCFPD to improve the situation.
The International Assistance for Voluntary Sterilization (IAVS) is entering
into an agreement with GOB to p.ovide technical and other assistance aimed at
improving the utilization of all the eight clinics. Meanwhile the linkage
between the MFPCs and the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology has been
strengthened by nominating the professor of Ob and Gyn as the ex-officio
director of the model clinic.
3.26     Family Welfare Visitors (FWVs).  While the first project financed
setting up eight new schools for training of FWVs, making a total of 12
including the existing four schools, the second project provided for
strengthening of FWV training, making textbooks available, and training of
t.ainers, etc.   Meanwhile PCFPD entered into an agreement with CARE
Bangladesh for technical and financial assistance to FWV training; this was in
addition to UNFPA support available for certain components. The Association
therefore decided to liaise closely with both CARE and UNFPA to ensure
coordination of inputs, avoid duplicatio.  and above all to ensure the
achievement of the main objective of improving the quality of training. A
governmental decision to appoint senior FWms to fill vacant posts of Field
Trainers in the FWVTIs had its repercussion on the use of Nursing College for
tutor training. The Nursing Council refused to admit FWVs, who were not
nurses, basically, for tutor training. To meet the situation, PCFPD organized
with CARE assistance, a special six month course for training of field
trainers. A number of inputs were made to improve FWV training during the
second project period. This included a recasting of the curriculum to make it
practical and field-oriented, preparation of a training manual, periodic
refresher courses for trainers, development of training materials, and
translation of four standard books into Bengali, as well as their printing and
distribution to all trained FmVs and those under training. Three other
aspects also received adequate attention. There were: (i) the selection and
improvement of functioning of about 24 UHFWCs, which were to be used during
the six months field training of FWs; (ii) the provision of technical
assistance to four selected schools through appointment of additional staff;



- 27 -
and, (iii) a innovative experiment to increase the number of institutional
deliveries in selected MCWs utilized for mW training through offer of
incentives. This increased level of deliveries could be used for providing
hands-on-training for FWV students in conducting deliveries. The experiment
succeeded in attracting women to deliver at these institutions; but was given
up after a two year trial on account of administrative and accounting
problems. This area needs further attention. Four of the twelve schools were
earmarked for conducting refresher training; a one month curriculum was
developed, pretested and put into effect and the refresher courses are
continuing. A second Evaluation Study of the Functioning of Family Welfare
Training Institute was carried out by the PDEU in July 1986. The results of
the study showed that the staffing of the FWJTIs had considerably improved,
902 of the gazetted and BlZ of the nongazetted posts were filled; 752 of the
princirals were engaged in training activities in addition to management
function; the assessment of knowledge of those under training showed good
grasp of the subjects. There were some suggestions for further improving the
field training but these related to problems of transport, accommodation,
field logistics. The refresher courses had adequate coverage of MCH subjects.
The output of FWVs during the period 1980-85 has been 2,624; the total output
until that date being 3,974, (Annex III). The training program has been
discontinued for the past one year and eight of the schools are currently
being used for training of new FWA recruits (two months course). Refresher
training is being organized at four schools. Other aspects of utilization are
dealt with in para. 8.14.
3.27     Medical Assistants (MAs).  The GOB plan provides for the posting of
one medical assistant to each UHFWC, in addition, two at each thana health
complex. The MA is in-charge at UHFWC and hence the team leader. Under an
earlier Dutch assistance, GOB had established four schools for training of
MAs. Since their output was estimated to be inadequate to meet the
requirements under the Second Five Year Plan, the project provided for
j          establishing another four sc aols.  The Netherlands agreed to finance them and
also provide technical assistance.  The schools were to be located initially
in rented premises and shifted to new buildings as and when they were
completed. Apart from the construction and furniture costs, the project
provided for training equipment, vehicles and fellowships. The four new
schools were constructed and commissioned during the period August 1983-Hay
1985. The number of MAs graduated since 1980-81 is 3,337, the total output
since 1978-79 being about 4,014 (Annex III). Another batch of students who
took the exams in December 1987 are likely to come out soon.
3.28     The curriculum for training MAs was revised by an expert committee in
1985 and the period of training increased to three years, from the earlier
2-1/2 years. The training includes field posting at THCs and UHFWCs and to
facilitate this, two thana health complexes along with field training UHFWCs
are attached to each school. The training of medical assistants was evaluated
by PDEU and its report is available. The evaluation consisted of visits to
all eight training schools apart from administering questionnaire to trainers,
trainees and MAs on-the-job. The study has pointed out some inconsistencies
in that the training curriculum is still oriented more towards clinical
medicine, though MAs are responsible for promotive and preventive health care.
They are made team leaders of UHFWCs without concommitant administrative
powers to exercise the responsibility. The inappropriativeness of the
curriculum was pointed out by the teachers also. Field training attendance



- 28 -
was poor; students did not stay in the field training premises, in spite of
accomnodations being available. The teachers were dissatisfied (642) since
the teaching experience did not help their career prospects; students also
were dissatisfied as the training did not meet with their future aspirations.
Staff vacancies (tutor posts) in four of the schools was high at 80?, the
training did not emphasize practical teaching and use of audio visual aids.
The decision to create the category of medical assistants was taken at a time
of acute shortage of medical personnel. Now that the output of doctors has
increased and opportunities for their employment abroad is less, there is a
demand from the medical profession for creating a post of medical officer at
UHFWCs. At the same time, experiences with medical officers posted to rural
dispensaries reveal that they are not prerared to stay and work at the union
levels. A medical assistant well trained in the delivery of primary health
care and family planning services with rural orientation can be an asset to
the program; but the idea does not seem to match the aspirations of the
medical assistants. A paradoxical situation seems to be emerging, which has
to be sorted out soon.
3.29     Field Workers.  The HAs and FWAs are front line paramedical field
workers, each serving as the main source of advice on health and family
planning matters for about 6,000 population; they receive immediate line
supervision and logistics from the AHIs and FPAs respectively. Earlier
evaluation studies para. 3.04, had highlighted certain weaknesses in the
training of the FWAs and FPAs. The second project, therefore, provided for
construction of 19 training centers to house the 19 training teams already
established for operational costs and for 24 months of Advisory Assistance.
The training centers were to be located in the THC premises to facilitate
access to visiting lecrurers from THCs and for practical training in a rural
atmosphere. After an initial delay caused primarily by a governmental
decision that buildings located at thana level should be semipermanent in
nature, the construction work started by mid 1982; all centers excepting one
were cnGmissioned in 1984.
3.30     The training activities were carried out as scheduled.  A two-week
training program was drawn up initially to retrain FWAs and FPAs together. The
second week of the two-week training for FPA consisted of separate classes in
supervision. After the governmental decision to integrate family planning
with health services, it was decided to train FWAs and HAs together for a two-
week period; the curriculum was modified accordingly. Pending the
organization of two week training, a crash program of one week initial
training for the field workers and their immediate supervisors was organized
at thana health complexes, the training teams participated in the organization
of this training. The number of students for each regular batch of training
was fixed at 30; the curriculum included two days field work in the 12-day
training period. The Advisory Assistance provided under the project was not
utilized since the UNFPA financed the consultancy services. The expatriate
Advisor assisted in revising curriculum, preparation of training materials,
training of trainers and making the training practical oriented. Pre and post
evaluation of the training courses were also ca_ried out. After the initial
two-week training of all service candidates, attendance by health assistants
for the second course of two weeks thinned down. The training centers were
also utilized for the initial two-month training of new recruits to fill FWA
vacancies. They were also utilized, by a conscious decision, to train the
staff of the multisectoral projects in family planning and primary health



- 29 -
care. The post of nutritionist-cum-home-scientists was filled towards the
middle of the project period. A total of 49,460 candidates (FWAs and HAs)
were trained by these centers (since redesignated as Regional Training Centers
- R.T.Is) during the period 1979-85; in addition 1,576 FWAs received their
basic training and about 700 multisectoral staff were also trained. Details
are in Annex IV. It was only towards mid-1984 that the revised job functions
of FWAs and HAs were finalized. In view of the high content of primary health
care in the training program it was thought necessary to strengthen the staff
by adding a full time medical lecturer. The need for strengthening the
supervision of the training centers from NIPORT was keenly felt. A new
curriculum based on job functions, and a training manual was prepared. It was
also decided that the training centers will be used for basic training of
newly recruited FWAs, retraining of FWAs, HAs, FPA, AHIs, and multisectoral
staff, etc. Evaluation studies showed improved knowledge as part of FWAs.
The third project therefore provides for considerable strengthening of these
centers primarily to improve the quality of training. The NIPORT has carried
out a Baseline study of MCHFP Field Workers in March-September 1987 against
which improvements in the third project period could be measured.
3.31     Training of Supervisors.  Training and supervision are interlinked;
apart from supervision being used for on-the-job training, supervisors are
work facilitators and lend organizational support to the workers in improving
their performance. Since inadequate and inappropriate supervision has been
responsible for weak services delivery, the project provided for training of
the thana and district level officers in supervisory techniques; the training
to be carried out by NIPORT, s3t up mainly for this purpose. About 1,000
officers were to be trained, with the training courses varying from one week
to one month in duration. The project provided assistance to build training
accommodations to house the training sections of NIPORT and PCFPD. As stated
elsewhere, assistance for the supervisory training was made available by UNFPA
for a three year period. The assistance could not, however, be made fully
effective use of, because of the absence of full-time leadership at NIPORT and
many faculty vacancies. The construction of the training building was also
not carried out since PCFPD wanted to build the training section as part of a
Population Building, housing all population offices, and the Government could
not mobilize the required resources for this from either internal or external
sources. The NIPORT carried out a number of training courses during 1980-85,
(Annex V). The courses included, apart from the training of supervisors,
training of multisectoral staff, training of trainers for FWVTIs, training for
NGOs involved in family planning and others. It also assisted in carrying out
a crash training program of four days duration for the thana 1evel staff in
1982-83. Simultaneously, the National Institute of Preventive and Social
Medicine (NIPSOM) attached to the health division was also carrying out a
one-month training course for thana level medical personnel, including ths
health administrators. In order to avoid duplication of efforts and train a
larger number of medical personnel, NIPORT liaised and collaborated with
NIPSOM in the training of medical officers. The supervisory training
organized by NIPORT was mostly team training - teams of civil surgeon and
deputy director (FP), thana level program managers-medical and non-medical.
In spite of best efforts, the effect of team training was nullified to an
extent by the administrative bottlenecks resulting out of integration of
family planning with health, and both sides adopting rigid postures. It is
alio the general fqeling that some of the courses conducted by NIPORT could
have been decentralized to the district training teams and NIPORT could Live



- 30 -
strictly adhered to its role as an Apex Training Institute. The need to
reorganize the RTIs, FWVTIs, and NIPORT into a training system with NIPORT as
the leader was keenly felt. The above issues were addressed by two
consultants hired by PCFPD and their main recosmendations consisted of:
(i) restructuring of NIPORT training activities into two divisions, one
responsible for training program development and other for field supervision;
(ii) staff strengthening through appointment of additional staff and a
rigorous staff development program; (iii) improving the quality of training;
and (iv) increasing the quality of training through contracts with other
institutions. The above aspects are being addressed, with substantial
success, as part of the third project.
Information, Education and Motivation (IEH)
3.32.    The second project provided for continuation, strengthening and
expansion, in some cases, of the IEM activities initiated under the first
project. Three of the projects connected with population education in
schools, use of model farmers and agricultural assistants in the Ministry of
Agriculture, and organized labor for population activities were handed over to
UNFPA for support along with the projects they had in these sectors.
Mass Media Activities
3.33     Population Program Cells in Radio Bangladesh.  The first project
assisted in establishing population program cells in Radio Bangladesh, both at
the Central and five regional stations; this marked the beginning of a
systematic and sustained effort in the use of radio to inform, educate and
motivate eligible couples and induce them to adopt family planning methods.
The central station at Dhaka broadcasts daily 70 minutes of a program *Sukhi
Sangsar' in three different time slots from 11:30 A.M. to 8:30 P.M., six days
a week. Apart from a relay of this program by the five regional stations,
each of the regional cells also put up their own exclusive programs, designed
to suit local conditions. A total of 41 officers and staff are working in the
main and regional cells together. The program producers have received
training either locally and abroad.
3.34     While an initial study of the  Sukhi Sangsarl program by Radio
Bangladesh was encouraging, a detailed evaluation of the program was carried
out in the first quarter of 1983 by National Broadcasting Academy. The study
revealed that of the radio 'isteners, whether owning a radio or not, about 732
are in the habit of listening to population programs; 472 of these listeners
could correctly reproduce the names of programs and another 252 after probing.
Among the programs listened to, discussions on family planning rank high
followed by songs; 62Z of listeners opined that the issues discussed are
identical to the problems faced by them in family planning. The study showed
that the practice of family planning is much more among radio listeners (492),
compared to the then national acceptance rate (192). A concurrent evaluation
is also carried out through inviting reactions from listeners as the programs
are broadcast, the suggestions received by post are analyzed and discussion or
talks are arranged to answer queries raised by listeners. The content of
programs broadcast was expanded to include maternal and child health services.
A major setback was the pruning of the purchase of vehicles provided for the
regional stations, this prevented the staff moving out and recording reactions
and messages from the public.



- 31 -
3.35     Production of Films.  The second project continued financing the film
production laboratory set up under the first project. A total of 24 films
have been produced by the laboratory, apart from the six films dubbed into
Bengali under the first project. Adequate number of copies both in 16mm and
35mm have been produced for distribution. Apart from the Department of Mass
Communication--the films are distributed to IEM units of the PCFPD, NGOs
working in family planning, training centers, etc.
3.36     Use of Audio Visual Vans for Population Activities.  There are 16
vans available with the Department of Hass Communication, all procured under
the first project. Screening of films through these units continued. In
addition, the IEM unit of the PCFPD also screen films in villages through
eight mobile A.V. vans located in the districts, and 17 static M.V. units,
each based in a district. As against a target of 2,511, the number of films
shown by ISH unit came to 2,103 (1980-84) covering an audience of about 31.5
lkhs.
3.37     Venture Writing Bureau.  The second project provided support for the
Bureau for the three-year period up to June 1983.
3.38     Population Program in Bangladesh Television.  Support was provided
under the second project to Bangladesh Television for producing programs in
Health and Population. About four hours of television time is being devoted
every month for programs related to population and health.
3.39     Folk Media.  Folk media, in the form of wandering bands of singers
and musicians are an important attraction to the villagers. The second
project provided substantial assistance to the use of Folk Media for family
planning information dissemination, particularly for training of singers and
holding performances in villages. The organization of folk media is done
through utilization of three-member teams, each team being placed in one
Upazila. The team members are trained in family planning and MCH, and the
training incorporates the information to be disseminated in their program. A
total of 145 teams were established under the project. The number of programs
to be conducted in a month and villages to be covered are determined by the
thana family planning officer in consultation with the FPAs; the programs were
usually held in local market places and bazaars. Attendance by females was
usually much better when held in interior villages. Evaluation of the folk
talent program gives very encouraging results. It was found that folk songs
media ranked second (13.85?) next to family planning workers (41.5Z) in the
program area, in motivating people to adopt family planning. Although radio
came as second in non-program area, in program areas its position is third
(12.5Z). It has been found to facilitate two-way communication by interaction
of audience with the singers, an advantage not enjoyed by other mass media,
particularly radio. The evaluation also gave valuable information on
improving the program through choice of places, making seating arrangements,
providing microphone facilities, etc. It is unfortunate that the number of
folk-song teams has been currently (1988) cut down due to budgetary
constraints; it is expected that this will be only a temporary phase since the
USAID has come forward to finance the folk sorgs in a big way.
3.40     Informational Campaign.  Informational campaigns were also organized
at public places, especially bazaars and market places, and included speeches



- 32 -
by community influentials, film shows, exhibition and distribution of
temporary contraceptives to those who asked for it. The program was organized
by the thana officersl while these were regularly held until about 1983, its
frequency has come down to a great extent after that.
3.41     A.V. Haterials.  At the central level, the TEM developed, produced
and distributed a number of printed materials and a good number of display
materials. The unit has physical facLAties for job-printing, graphic and
photostat cells. The printed materials consisted of flash cards, flip charts,
pamphlets on subjects like MCH care, need for contraceptive practice, methods
of contraception, nutrition, etc., for use by field workers in their
interpersonal communication. The project, out of innovative funds, financed
production of exegetic booklets produced by renowned religious leaders on the
basis of the Holy Koran and the Hadith. The first project had assisted in
increasing the printing capacity of the IEM unit through the supply of an off-
set pres    The second project financed the construction of a premises for
locating the press out of savings; the commissioning of both the press and the
building was unduly delayed and the Association was informed that both will
become operational in the next two or three months.
3.42     Orientation of Community Leaders.  The project also financed the
training of religious leaders, female members of parliament, organization of
late marriage campaigns, etc. A total of 2,500 religious leaders were
reported to be trained during the period and 3,200 community leaders were
given a one-day orientation.
3.43     Coordination of IEH Activities.  The organization of IEH activities
cut across a number of ministries, viz Health, Information and Broadcasting,
Women's Affairs, and also the NGOs; a coordination between the activities of
various agencies would have been very useful to provide the necessary focus
and mutual reinforcement, and to ensure appropriate contents for messages.
Whatever coordination existed was through review meetings convened by PCFPD of
all project officers and also through informai get-togethers. It was only
towards the end of the Second Five Year Plan that the MDHFP constituted a
committee, under the chairmanship of the Secretary. MOHFP would provide
leadership in developing communication policies and strategies, coordination
of various communication activities under governmental and non-governmental
sector, and program review, etc. While it is stated that the committee has
met once, the objective for which the committee has been set up is yet to
materialize.
3.44     Family Planning Through Swanirvar Village Development Program.  The
GOB, towards the end of the First Five Year Plan, has been promoting
experiments with various types of scheme to encourage community participation
in the population sector program. Notable among these is the *Swanirvar Self-
Reliant Village Scheme' under which village leaders are trained to plan and
implement village development programs. An experimental underpinning or
population activities into the total developmental process, through training
of community leaders produced a favorable impact on family planning, as
observed in an evaluation of the scheme by the Bangladesh Institute of
Development Studies. Based on this evidence, the second project provided for
a larger support to family planning through Swanirvar program, out of the
allocation for innovative projects. The main elements of support included
training expenses for community influentials, a small national headquarters



- 33 -
staff for planning and monitoring of activities. The Swanirvar, at a later
stage, built family planning into their economic activities for village women,
particularly the poor, aimed at income generation. The project which covered
70 thanas and 600 unions until June 1983, was later extended to cover 130
thanas and 1,300 union. A total of 24,000 community leaders, field workers
and Government officials had received training until June 1983.
3.45     The project has been evaluated in depth twice, the first evaluation
carried out during 1982 and the second in 1985. The first evaluation
substantiated program contribution to raise income levels of landless, and
stated that the effect of program on family planning has been impressive. The
contraception rates in Swanirvar villages were twice that of national rate and
three times that of non-Swanirvar villages. In terms of motivation and
follow-up service, the contribution of Swanirvar workers closely matched that
of governmental workers. While the second study also reported a high level of
contraceptive use among the loanees (472) compared to the general population
of the Swanirvar and non-Swanirvar program areas; the study revealed a major
deficiency (as against the first study) in that the Swanirvar workers do not
pay adequate attention and devote time in family planning motivational work.
The workers under the second study are the self-employed, who arrange loan for
the women and facilitate their work, by charging a small commission on the
loan; these are different from that of the first study. The concluding
remarks of the study are significant. The Swanirvar program appears to have
emerged as a lead non-governmental organization capable of achieving tte two
social goals: (i) raising income level of low income group; and (ii) moulding
reproductive behavior of the rural people. The trend is very clear with
regard to the former but with regard to the latter, some policy directive and
reorientation of Swanirvar workers appear in order. In Bangladesh context,
there appears to be no doubt that family planning through Swanirvar offers
real opportunities to promote contraceptive practices.
3.46     Health Education.  While the first project did not include any
support to the Health Education Bureau, the second project provided for
strengthening of the bureau to plan and implement health education program for
primary health care. The major objective was to train and equip health
assistants for community health education, introduce health education into the
school health system and use mass media for health education activities.
Project assistance was utilized to hire the services of a health education
specialist through the World Health Organization for a period of one year; the
specialist assisted the bureau in streamlining its functioning and division of
responsibilities between the various units and also plan and implement a
number of training activities. The training of health assistants was the
resporsibility of district level staff; the Bureau trained its personnel at
dist:ict and subdivisional level so that they, in turn, could organize
training at thana level. A mini offset printing press was procured to enable
the bureau to mass produce educational materials--leaflets, pamphlets,
etc.--produced by it. The mobility of officers at the district level was
improved through provision of motorcycles. The bureau also contracted with
the film division for the production of three films on health related
subjects. School health education activities were also strengthened during
the period. Support for the Bureau is being continued under the third
project. This is necessary in view of the increasing importance given under
the project for selected MCH interventions and the role that the bureau could
perform to strengthen health education for MCH activities.

3.47     Women's Development Program.  The first project supported mothers
clubs, women's cooperatives and a women's vocational training program with a
view to improve the socioeconomic status of women and to make them more
receptive to the small family norm. The operational objectives of the
projects consisted of (a) providing gainful employment to participating women
through promotion of income generating activities at village level;
(b) imparting non-formal education with emphasis on health, family planning,
nutrition and health care; and (c) contraceptive services to those motivated
to accept and use them. The schemes were implemented in 42 thanas located in
different geographical areas. The approaches of the three schemes to reach
rural women differed, though the overall objectives had much in common. The
department of Social Welfare was responsible for the organization of Mothers
Clubs, as part of the rural social service activities of the department.
About 40 clubs are organized in each thana, with membership of about 40--50
each. Trade instructors were appointed to teach women in various income
generating activities like sewing, knitting, embroidery, etc. and the social
welfare organizer imparted non-formal education to members. The IRDP
administered women's cooperatives project; about 25 cooperatives were to be
constituted in each thana and a deputy project officer with three inspectors
(female) formed and guided the functioning of the societies. The educational
activities are organized in a two-step approach, under which the office
bearers of the societies received training at thana headquarters, and they, in
turn, undertook responsibility to train the members of the society at village
level. The project on women vocational training was organized by the Women's
Rehabilitation and Welfare Foundation and consisted in setting up one thana
level and four union level vocational training centers in each selected thana.
Women, in batches, received training in subjects like tailoring, handicrafts,
weaving, soap making, etc. along with non-formal education in health related
subjects.
3.48     A review and evaluation of the projects by diverse agencies had
brought out both the successes and deficiencies in the projects. The
promising side of the review/evaluation showed that the projects were able to
provide some gainful employment to women; the project women knew more about
contraception and practiced contraception more; members actively persuaded
other women to use contraception; and agriculture related income generating
activities were more promising than others. These evaluation also highlighted
some of the deficiencies, particularly to problems in the delivery of health
and family planning services; need to base choice of goods produced on market
surveys; inadeqn-ate marketing facilities for goods; and lack of quality
control. Based on the above, the second project provided for both
strengthening and expansion of the three projects to cover a total of 100
thanas including that of first project; distributed between the three projects
of mother clubs (40), Women's Cooperatives (40), and Women Vocational Training
(20). The project also provided for a review of the approaches adopted by the
three projects in March 1980 in the light of evaluation being carried out by
the external evaluation unit of the Planning Commission.
3.49     The implementation of three projects during the period 1980-85, was
affected by a number of adverse factors, some more seriously than the others.
Firstly, the projects were subject to budget pruning at two stages, the first
being by the PlanCom at the stage of project approval, and second by the
Martial Law Administration when the projects were half way through; the



- 35 -
pruning affected the staff to be employed, vehicles to be procured, advisory
assistance and fellowships. Secondly, there was change of leadership at PPO
level in all the three projects: while this did not affect one project, the
new leadership was weak in one case, and in third, the post of PPO was vacant
for a fairly long period. Thirdly, inadequate marketing arrangements for and
quality control on produced goods persisted throughout the project period,
because of the setting up of the Marketing and Design Development Unit
originally approved by the Planning Commission was blocked by catbacks in the
second plan.
3.50     Women's Cooperatives.  Extension of the scheme to 40 thanas as
envisaged in the project went on smoothly. Organization and maintenance of
women's cooperatives require greater efforts initially and during functioning;
however, the supervisory support was hampered to an extent since only three
posts of female inspectors were approved by the PlanCom for each thana, as
against six proposed in the project. The PP provided for setting up 750
cooperatives during a five-year period 1980-85, thus making a total of 1,250,
including those existing before 1980; however the actual accomplishment was
1,722 societies. Similarly the total members enrolled reached 70,000 by 1985,
as against a planned cumulative total of 61,500. (See also Annex VI.)
3.51     A significant achievement of women's cooperatives was their agreement
with Sonali Bank for providing loans to cooperative members. Though the Bank
originally agreed to provide only one lakh taka for each thana, the ceiling
has been since removed in view of the highly satisfactory credit realization.
The credit extended by the Bank rose from Tk 47.04 lakhs in 1980-81 to
Tk 128.54 lakhs in 1984-85. The 1984 evaluation by EEU has shown that 75S of
the members received at least one loan and half of that number more than one
loan. The medium value of the loan was Tk 396.0. The accumulation of shares
and deposits by members accounted for cumulative total of Tk 20.0 lakh and
Tk 79.04 lakhs in 1984-85 compared with Tk 7.47 and Tk 23.26 lakhs
respectively in 1980-81. These are individual deposits and while the
depositor could borrow from the loan, it was not available for general loaning
purposes. A very promising aspect of the women's cooperatives is the training
arranged for its members. The regular training consists of the scheduled
visits by the office bearers to the thana headquarters and their role in
training of members at the village level. In addition, the project provided
for training as many members as possible in selected places outside the thana,
the subjects covered being cooperative management, nutrition, tailoring,
health, agriculture, handicrafts, adult literacy, poultry, and duck farming,
etc. A total of about 3,500 cooperators received training during the
five-year period, the duration ranging from four days to few months. Family
planning acceptance rate was also high among the society members; a total of
37,339 eligible couples, 712, accepted one method or other, the highest being
pill acceptors followed by condom users and sterilization acceptors.
3.52     Mothers' Clubs.  The scheme covered 40 thanas by 1985, as envisaged
and a cumulative total of 1,600 mothers clubs were established at the rate of
50 clubs for each thana. Vocational training to the members were provided by
1,144 part-time trade instructors, appointed for the purpose. Each club was
provided with at least two sewing machines; some had embroidery machines. A
one band radio was also supplied to each club. A revolving capital of
Tk 2,000 was available for each center to purchase raw materials for training.
The total number of members enrolled by the clubs is about 102,000.



- 36 -
3.53     The project was adversely affected by the cutback on the Marketing
and Design Unit, and also because there was no credit facilities for providing
loan assistance to members who wanted to start income-generating activities of
their own. Part of the problems due to the cutback on marketing unit could
have been avoided, if the project had filled up the three posts of marketing
officer, designer and quality control inspector provided for in the project,
the posts were actually filled only by 1985. Similarly, it was only towards
the tail end of the extended period of the project than an amount of Tk 40.0
lakhs, reallocated from savings for the establishment of a revolving fund to
provide credit facilities for trained women, became operational. Most of the
trade instructors recruited under the project received some training, both
vocational and non-vocational. Evaluation studies (1984) have shown that
training was arranged both within and outside Upazila; trades for which
training was arranged were sewing, knitting and embroidery, bamboo and cane
work, and jute work, etc. The mean duration of training varied from 2-4
months depending on trade; non-vocational training was imparted both in family
planning and MCI/primary health care, all in the Upazila, the duration of
family planning training varying from 7-12 days and primary health care/MCH
training from--6-7 days. The inadequa2y of training especially in vocational
trades, was keenly felt. Almost all mothers' clubs had some additional inputs
from the RSS scheme; in addition, almost all cltibs under the first project and
some under the second phase had inputs from the International Union For Child
Welfare (IUCW) project which operated in the same area.  IUCW project provided
for not only loan assistance and also helped in marketing of goods. About 761
of the participants engaged themselves in some income-generating activities
with a medium monthly earning of Tk 75 per month. The family planning
practice among direct participants has been found to be 47Z, against the
indirect participant (22Z).
3.54     Women's Vocational Training.  The scheme was extended to cover 20
thanas, and a total of 100 training-cum-production centers were established at
the rate of one thana level and four union level centers in each thana. Each
of the 12 new thanas had also a weaving shed; in addition four soap and bakery
units were also built. A total of 11,340 rural women are reported to have
been trained during the period 1980-85, the training period being six months.
Most of the equipment and vehicles provided for in the project were purchased.
3.55     The project was also affected by budget cuts in the second plan.  A
major item deleted was the construction of 48 union level training centers;
instead the facilities were ordered to be rented. The Advisory Assistance for
evaluation and training and study tours proposed in the project could not be
made use of due to budget cuts. The project experienced considerable
difficulties in recruiting skill trainers of special trades due to low level
of salary; and due to lack of adequate working capital for production centers.
The seed money of Tk 20.0 lakhs, at one lakh take per thana, for providing
assistance to trained women for setting up income generating activities was
available for disbursement only from 1985-86. The project benefitted to some
extent from expatriate Advisory Assistance made available for training of
personnel, design development, etc; it also benefitted from the expansion of
garment industry in the country, since a number of women trained in tailoring
found jobs in that industry. Each trainee under the project had to recruit
ten family planning acceptors and according to figures furnished, a total of
136,040 acceptors are reported to have been recruited against a target of



- 37 -
170,000. The contraceptive use among the trained women is observed to be 47S,
as against 312 observed in 1979. There has been an improvement in current use
of more effective methods also. The quarterly median income of those involved
in production centers is found to be Tk 321, as against Tk 170 of those
working at home. Trained women knew at least two trades. Evaluation of the
project has shown that trained women had been successful in recruiting family
planning acceptors; in fact 49.3Z of the respondents among the indirectly
exposed group reported that trained women had talked to them on family
planning. In spite of the difficulties faced, the project has achieved
substantially a number of its objectives.
3.56     Results of Evaluation.  Information relating to age, education,
income level of participants of all the three project, knowledge and use of
family planning, income-generating activities, etc. are summarized in
Annex VII. In this connection, a review by Dr. M.A. Mabud of the PDEU
Planning Comission on 'Women's Program--Impact on Income and Reproductive
Behavior' (February 1986) is significant. According to the review, 'The three
women's program discussed above appear to have varying degree of lmpact on
income, contraceptive and reproductive behavior of those who have been
directly exposed to the program. Women's exposure to trade skills have
inverse relationship with fertility as in the case with women of the
vocational training programs. Even duration of membership of the women's
cooperatives and mothers' centers has and inverse relationship with fertility.
In the areas where women's programs exist, the contraceptive prevalence rate
was found to be higher (rates among the direct and indirect participants
combined), than in the areas where no such program exists.  Those who are
!         direct participants of the program came from the middle and low income
families, and by utilizing the program-inputs like training and credit
facilities, they are earning some income which otherwise would have not been
possible. Thus, the three women's programs appear to have succeeded to bring
about some depressing effect on fertility, and raising income le-.el of
participants'.
3.57     Some Pending Issues.  In spite of the apparent success, amidst
problems, of the three women's projects, it is evident that the effectiveness
and efficiency of the projects could be increased substantially if some of the
issues affecting the project were resolved. The issues to be addressed are:
Firjtlz. both the training and production activities under the prcjects have
to be dovetailed to market surveys so that women can produce goods that can be
easily sold. As an example, the top administrator of one of the projects
mentioned that, in some cases, training in weaving has been given in some
districts, which are traditionally not accustomed to that occupation, and
heuce the women could not put the skill to use. Secondly, a major emphasis in
all the three projects should be on training, both of trainers and trainees,
in income generating activities and non-formal education.  The projects have
suffered in the past since trainers themselves were not adequately trained.  A
number of training centers available in the country, both in the governmental
and NGO sector, should be identified and utilized for training. Apart from
initial training, trainers should have periodic refresher courses. Thirdly,
the famLly assistance (credit) to those trained should be strengthened. The
amount of loan to individual members should be increased and credit should not
be refused to any trained woman who wants to avail the same. The amount of
credit should be determined as a more scientific basis. Fourth, an issue has
been raised as to whether the projects can be justified on the small amount of



- 38 -
additional income, less than Tk 100 per month, that the women are able to
generate through their activities. This issue has to be looked from the
perspective of the average per capita income in the country and for the rural
poor, any incremental income will be welcome. This is not to say that
attempts should not be made to increase the earnings out of income-generating
activities; rather the issue is linked up with training, quality of goods
produced, amount of loan assistance and marketable nature of goods produced.
Attention to these will help in finding a solution to the main issue. Fifth,
there have been administrative deficiencies in the project particularly with
respect to pay scales, managerial capability of staff, supervision, monitoring
and evaluation and these are to be corrected. Sixth, an issue has been raised
regarding the target population to be served by the projects. Evidently the
projects should be aimed at the rural poor and lower middle class and some
criteria has to be fixed in selecting beneficiaries. Seventh, some doubts
have been expressed about the desirability of establishing production centers
as an integral part of all three projects. Under the project, it has been
made obligatory for all the three projects to establish production-cum-
training centers; while only the women's vocational training had training-cum-
production centers under the first two projects. There have been reservations
on this issue; the BRDB that runs women's cooperatives is not convinced of the
idea; the social welfare department also has its reservations. The present
inhibitions have arisen because of the unsatisfactory experience with
training-cum-production centers established under the Vocational Training
Project; and secondly because of a predominant view that the governmental
agencies are not the best suited to establish and run the widely dispersed
production centers profitably. One way of resolving the issue is to design
the projects with heavy emphasis on training and provision of credit, which
the departments can do effectively; and leave the production centers to be
established by trained women, individually or collectively, or by non-
governmental organizations. Whatever minimum production centers are
established as part of the projects should be only for training and, in such
case, the profitability will not be the main criteria for their assessment.
To facilitate the establishment of production centers by trained women, a
scheme for entrepreneurship training of promising trainees from among the
three projects be designed and implemented. It can be reasonably assumed that
some of them will be able to organize production centers, after their return
to villages after training. Last but not least, the linkages between the
women's projects and PCFPD service delivery system should be strengthened.
The women's projects, in their village setting, offer ideal locations for
delivery of family planning and MCH services; in fact these centers should be
treated as satellite clinics to UHFWC as far as service delivery is concerned.
3.58     Evaluation and Research.  By the end of the first project, the
elements of a system for evaluation and research had taken shape. The second
project provided for strengthening of two of the units, viz the Service
Statistics Unit of the MIS of PCFPD, and the External Evaluation Unit of the
Planning Coumission. Service Statistics Unit. The Management Information
System (MIS) of which the Service Statistics Unit (SSU) is a component, is the
main source of performance data for the PCFPD. The SSU collects detailed and
continuous data on births, deaths, fertility and contraceptive prevalence
rates among the people for a sample population; the data not only complements
figures generated by the MIS, but also acts as a cross-check. During the
second project period, MIS developed the service statistics system,
progressively, to cover 17 wards, of 37 randomly selected Upazilas. The



- 39 -
number of wards is being increased to 23 and will be pegged at 25 by 1990.
Further expansion will be subject of a review by the end of the third plan
period. As stated, the system is introduced to enable the MIS to monitor,
unionwise, the performance of the family planning program and to evaluate its
effects on the reduction of birth rate and the general lowering of fertility
rates. Detailed analysis of the data collected in 1984, 1985 and 1986
covering 10, 12 and 17 wards have been completed and the results are given in
Annex VIII. The project made available expatriate advisory assistance to the
unit during the first two years.
3.59     The MIS over the period, has developed capacity: (i) to prepare and
distribute monthly reports on contraceptive acceptance by Upazila and
district, governmental and NGO providers, matching performance against MOHFP
targets; (ii) to analyze, collect and distribute monthly inspection reports of
field visits by senior officers; (iii) to prepare monthly simAnries of all FPW
activities, expenditure and progress against projects managed by FPW; and
(iv) to prepare for the President's Secretariat a report on sterilization,
UHPWC construction and service delivery activities.
3.60     Data analysis by MIS is facilitated through the installation of a
computer financed partly by the first project and supplemented under the
second project. The memory of the computer has been raised to deal with th
increased volume of data expected; in addition two terminals have been
installed, one in the room of the Secretary of MCHFP and the other in the room
of the Minister for Health and Family Planning. The initial difficulties that
arose due to problems in the recruitment of qualified staff have been
overcome; and the computer is fully operational now.
3.61     The MIS originally started with the collection of family planning
statistics, their analysis and feedback; however, by the middle of the second
project deficiencies in the availability of MCH services statistics were
acutely felt. The MIS therefore introduced a system for collection of HCH
statistics; it took about two years for the system to develop and currently,
both family planning and MCH data are received from the Upazilasldistricts
together at the beginning of every month. Another major development has been
the responsibility to develop an integrated recording and reporting system for
health and family planning services.   Both the ICDDRB and World Health
Organization rendered advisory assistance in developing the system, which is
now under pretest in eight Upazilas for the past one year. The Director of
HIS has recognized and asked for further expatriate assistance for 2-3 months
to consolidate the results of the pretesi., finalize the system and initiate a
training program for its introduction all over the country.
3.62     When the reorganized family planning program was introduced in 1976,
the FWAs were to prepare a list of eligible couples with number of children
each, for the population of her ward. The very useful practice got
discontinued in the middle; with the result, basic information for local level
programming was not available. The MIS has revived it recently and the first
round of couple registration for the entire country has been completed. The
information will be very useful for Upazila level planning; and it is expected
that the registers will be updated once a year hereafter. The third project
provides for strengthening and continuance of assistance to MIS. It will have
two major objectives of (a) to promote more realistic local target setting for
contraceptive and MCH performance; and (b) to develop more effective reporting
instruments to monitor both worker performance and availability and use of

3.63     External Evaluation Unit.  The External Evaluation Unit was set up
under the first project with the overall objective of carrying out evaluation
of the national population/MCH program. It had a slow start, mainly due to
staffing problems, and only four studies were completed by the end of the
first project though another seven were in progress. In view of the need for
an independent evaluation of the program and various projects financed by IDA
and other co-financiers, the second project provided for strengthening of the
EEU. The EEU did not have a smooth sailing even during the second project
period due to large staff turn-over; in addition, the policies of the
Establishment Division did not permit staff of temporary projects like EEU to
be deputed for long-term training. A number of senior staff, after gaining
some experience in the unit, left to take up more permanent positions.
Expatriate advisory assistance was provided to the unit for most of the second
project. A proposal to contract out projects was not favored by the Planning
Commission, however this policy has been revised during the third project
period. In order to improve the quality of its work, the EEU made use of
technical committees appointed specifically for each or a group of projects.
The committees scrutinized the evaluation design, discussed the preliminary
findings and offered suggestions for improvement. Later, the practice of
appointing separate committees was discontinued; there is one technical
committee attached to the unit to provide advisory services. The Unit
arranges pre-publication seminars of the preliminary findings of each study so
that they get disseminated to a wider audience including the consumer; the
unit, in turn, gets a feedback that enables it finalize the report more
purposefully. The EEU has carried out about 28 studies since its inception to
1985; most of the studies were completed during the second project period. It
has evaluated performance of field workers, Upazila and district family
planning officers, functioning of UHFWCs, women projects, sterilization
program, etc. Most evaluation studies were so planned that progress at
specified time intervals are measured. The quality of studies has also
improved substantially over time.
3.64     At the beginning of the third plan, COB decided to merge the two
units, under PlanCom, the EEU and the Population and Development Planning Unit
funded by UNPPA. While the PDPU was concerned mainly with integration of
population variables into other developmental sectors at the stage of
planning, EEU concentrated on the evaluation of national population
control/family planning programs. However, in view of the multisectoral
nature of population activities, it was considered that the scope of
evaluation extends far beyond family planning and the results of evaluation
will help in integrating population variables into other developmental
sectors. From that perspective, the two units are mutually supportive and
reinforce each other. The new unit termed *Program Development and Evaluation
Unit" has three major objectives of: (i) evaluation of family planning and
other population activities; (il) assessment of correlates between the
demographic and development variables and their progressive incorporation into
the development planning policies, as well as developing appropriate
strategies for population control through 'Beyond Family Planning'; and
(iii) establishment of a data bank for population related information. The
third project supports PDEU, particularly the evaluation component. The
working of the unit so far does not confirm the original apprehension that the
merger may have negative consequences to the evaluation functions.



- 41 -
3.65     Health Information Unit.  The project provided support for two
medical audit teams, to study sad determine the reasons for under utilization
or shortage of manpower, beds, physical facilities, etc. The teams were not
ultimately approved and were the casualty of second plan budget cuts. The
project support for strengthening the data processing facilities at thana was
utilized. Under expatriate assistance made available by CIDA, the unit worked
out proposals for the training of district level personnel and thana level
statistical assistants. Proforma for combining epidemeological reporting and
HA reporting were also developed. A MOHFP decision towards the end of the
project for developing an integrated recording and reporting system fo: health
and family planning services gave a new direction to the work of health
information unit also; however the pretesting of the integrated system is
still on and therefore the old system or separate reporting continues.
Whether under the integrated system or otherwise, the availability of a full
time statistical assistant in each Upazila is an asset and, with proper
training could become the focus for development of a HIS for health and family
planning services at that level.
3.66     Support to Private Sector and Innovative Activities.  The Government
adopted a policy of encouraging private agencies take part in the national
efforts for population control and family planning; but in view of their
budgetary constraints it was difficult for them to allocate funds for these
agencies, particularly to test out new ideas. The first project therefore
provided for support to Private Sector and Innovative Activities; and FPW
developed a mechanism for sanction and release of funds to these agencies
through the appointment of subvention committees. Encouraged by the use of
funds for certain innovative activities by Bangladesh PP Association, family
planning through Swanirvar program, etc. the second project provided for
continuation of the assistance. The major beneficiary of the allocation was
again the project for integrating family planning in the developmental
activities of self reliant villages--under the Swanirvar program. In
addition, funds were allocated for about 54 projects during 1980-84. Some of
these were engaged in community distribution of contraceptives in urban areas
through their own field workers; a small amount was utilized to fund the
preparation and printing of literature, to draw religious support to
population activities; an innovative project was experimented with to
encourage deliveries at NCW centers so that the midwifery training of Fms
could be strengthened. The mechanism for sanction of funds included a
Technical Committee which scrutinizes the proposal, and a Subvention Committee
chaired by Secretary MOHFP which sanction the projects. Since there was uO
separate mechanism for monitoring the projects approved, the Family Planning
Services and Training Center (FPSTC) agreed to carry out the work, on FPW
request, though it was not within their mandate. The Subvention Committee
also laid down that no project should be funded for more than three years and,
by that time, the project should approach agencies like USAID who had a large
budget for support to voluntary organizations. The project was evaluated by
PDEU in 1984; the evaluation underlined the need to evolve a set of criteria
to assist the members of the Technical Committee in deciding which projects to
fund; insist that only ionovative projects are funded; strengthen monitoring
either through funding FPSTC or assigning the task to NIPORT or others. Added
to the above, there is clearly a need to define the role of NGOs in the rural
areas, so as to widen their sphere of participation. These issues are
addressed in detail in the third project.



- 42 -
3.67     Sterilization Surveillance Scheme.  The Government created in 1982
four Sterilization Surveillance Teams, (SST) to assist the MOHFP in monitoring
and Improving the quality of its national sterilization effort and thus
increase its appeal to potential contraceptive-using couples. The setting up
of SSTs was part of a total effort to improve quality of sterilization through
training of doctors, preparation and distribution of sterilization manuals,
supply of emergency equipment including oxygen cylinders to all sterilization
centers, and surveillance through periodic visits to centers performing
sterilizatio . During their visits to sterilization centers, the teams
provided both surveillance and inservice training to the HOs at UHCs, and the
MO/MSTs who carry out these procedures at UHFWCs, as well as to other
personnel who assist. A baseline survey carried out by the team .isted the
physical improvements to be carried out to THCs in order to make surgical
operations safe. Each surveillance team was made of one expatriate and one
local consultant; the project, especially, the recruitment and management
expatriate assistance was contracted to the World Health Organization and the
appointment and funding of the local counterparts was the respo.sibilitv of
the DG family planning. The expatriate coordinatcr of the group heads the
Dhaka team, the other three teams are headquartered in Chittagong, Khulna and
Rajsahi divisions. They all report to the DG (FPW). The combined effort of
all activities have resulted in the improvement of the quality of
sterilizations considerably, the number of deaths per 100,000 sterilization
coming down from 5.76 (1982) to 1.67 (1987). Annex IX. The rate for 1987,
might go up after completion of investigation of remaining reported deaths.
Even then voluntary sterilization mortality rates in Bangladesh will remain
comparable to the rates prevailing in other parts of the world. The finding,
though encouraging, must not be a reason for complacency. Sterilization
surveillance is being continued under the third project but with broadened
scope. The teams are redesignated as Family Planning Clinical Supervision
Team (FPCST); and they will look into qualitative aspects of clinical
contraception particularly sterilization, IUD and injectables.

IV. PROJECT EXECUTION
Organization ArranRements
4.1      The strengthening of BPDU by additional staff to handle the increased
civil works construction load under the second project was a condition of
effectiveness. The Government did not finally agree to the creation of a
separate post of Project Director for BPDU; ou the other hand, the Joint
Secretary (Administration), Health Division was entrusted with the
responsibility of overseeing the work of BPDU. The office was shifted to neat
spacious premises. While the BPDU continued under the health wing, over time
it developed procedures by which it dealt with both the health and Family
Planning wings in a smooth way. Overall, the BPDU functioned in a much more
efficient way during the second project than the first; its liaison with PWD
was much better; it spent considerable time in field supervision; coordination
of construction Pctivities with that of procurement and installation of equip-
ment and furniture was much better. There were initial delays in the start of
construction of the buildings, but these were beyond the control of BPDU.
4.2      The BPDU was assisted by a consortium of local and foreign
consultancy firms. The consortium hired for the first project was selected,
after following due procedures, for the second project also. This not only
ensured continuity but also led to other improvements, like better design
development and preparation of tender documents etc., since the firm was fully
familiar with the deficiencies and problems that occurred in the first
project. The consultants were responsible for site inspection and soil
testing, design of structures, preparation of draft tender documents,
preparing specifications for equipment and furniture and indents for their
procurement through the supplies directorate, and above all, for top
supervision of censtruction. As the thana health complexes under the second
project were only service institutions, and did not have a training component
as in the case of first project, their design was a comparatively simpler.
4.3      The construction work of the major civil vorks, excluding that of the
four medical assistants training schools, was handied by the PWD; the work
included calling and award of tenders. In order to overcome the problem of.
coordination in the Chief Engineer's Office arising of the distribution of the
construction load between various desk officers, the secoud project provided
for the creation of a population cell in the PWD to ensure speedy processing
of tender documents and contracts; to ensure that expenditure claims would be
submitted to the project finance cell on time; to anticipate and deal with
problems arising during construction in a speedy fashion, etc. The cell
operated quite efficiently; it liaised with the BPDU and the consulting firm
of engineers; all three made joint visits to construction sites, and
particularly those which had problems, and in many cases issued orders on site
to get over difficulties.
4.4      The high level coordination committee, under the chairmanship of the
chief engineer, met regularly to review progress and sort out problems that
hampered construction. Discussion on progress of IDA assisted projects took
place during the annual meetings of the superintending and executive engineers
convened by the PWD; a representative both from health and PC wings attended
these meetings. Problems arising out delays in release of funds or inadequacy
of funds were dealt with at the meetings.



- 44 -
4.5      Organizational arrangements for the construction of four MA training
schools were different. BPDU vas in the picture and was responsible for
making payments to contractors. The role that was performed by the BPDU in
regard to other civil works was performed by a team of Net.herland Engineers
assisted by local staff. The team engaged local consultants and, between the
two, undertook responsibility for site inspection, design of structure,
preparation of tender documents, tendering and award of contracts, supervision
during construction etc. Based on certification made by the consultants and
the Dutch team, payments were made to the contractors. The arrangement worked
well in view of full time attention by two expatriate Dutch engineers and also
the administrative flexibility they enjoyed, since they did not have to follow
GOB procedures in their dealings.
4.6      The second project provided ior strengthening of the Supplies
Directorate, since a problem similar to the one experienced in PWD arising out
of different desk officers dealing with different items of procurement,
created problems of coordination. A problem which arose in the first project
due to the splitting up of items under a tender package te different suppliers
depending upon the lowest bid of each item, was largely overcome in the second
project. Most of the procurement, except DDS kits, was done through the
Supplies Directorate. Coordination of procurement was done at project finance
cell; all indents were channelled through the PFC to avoid coniusion regarding
financing heads and agencies. This enabled monitoring of procurement by PPO
and quick submission of applications to IDA for issue of QAR. The population
cell in the Supplies Directorate was, however, discontinued after the first
three years of its operation.
4.7      The posts of PPOs in ministries other than that of MOHFP continued
under the second project. This has been found to be a useful mechanism in
accelerating the implementation of multi-sectoral activities. There were
changes of incumbents in all the four PPOs financed under the second project
and the training of new incumbents had to be ensured. They received both
local and foreign training. In the case of at least one PPO, there was more
than one change and disruption of work was caused through the vacancy of the
position for more than a year. In the case of womens vocational training
project, the merging of the semi-autonomous Women's Welfare and Rehabilitation
Foundation with a newly created department of Women's Affairs also created
temporary problems. A new reporting format for monitoring the activities of
the women's projects was introduced. There were problems of coordination
between the multisectozil projects and the FPW, both at tLe field and national
levels. National level coordination meetings, both at the ministerial and
secretarial levels were less frequent; at the field level, FPW issued
instructions to the PWAs to attend weekly/monthly meetings of women's
cooperatives, mother clubs and vocational training regularly, but these
instructions were not strictly followed. The fixing of targets by the
respective departments for their field workers separately, for example,
mothers clubs and vocational training centers, had their own targets, in
addition to targets for PWAs, and this made the work of coordination at field
level more difficult. As stated elsewhere the non-establishment of a
marketing and design development cell affected the functioning of the women's
projects adversely. The PPOs had problems arising out of budget cuts; a
substantial amount of their time had to be spent in getting fund allocations
and their timely release.



- 45 -
4.8      The resprisibility for the construction of UMFWCs under the project
vested with CHC. The functions included initiation and follow-up of acqui-
sition of land (the actual work of acquisition of land was dealt with by the
PCW secretariat in collaboration with site selection committees constituted at
Upazila level); the construction of centers; and monitoring the purchase of
furniture. The unit was to issue instructions to Deputy Commissioners,
Upazila family planning officers, deputy directors (family planning) and Union
Council Chairman to initiate and expedite construction, overcome delays, and
allocate funds. Though the unit was headed only by an Engineering Advisor to
start with, it was expanded under the second project to include four executive
engineers, one for each division, and one assistant engineer for each
district. The executive engineers were provided with a jeep each, and the
assistant engineers with a motor cycle for facilitating their quick movement.
The headquarters of the executive engineers were decentralized to the
divisional level and were located at Dhaka, Comilla, Rangpur and Jessore.
4.9      The CMC was assisted by local consultants.  The consultants were
responsible for providing technical assistance to the project committees
through a specified number of field visits to each site at specific intervals;
certifying the quality of construction; preparing monthly progress reports;
and bringing the problems of construction to the attention of the Chief
Engineer, CMC, To facilitate their role, the consultants appointed field
engineers, supervisors, and also a management team at the national level.
4.10     The UHFWCs under the second project were originally planned to be
constructed using the Project Committee System (PCS) evolved after pretest of
the same through the construction of eight pilot centers. Under the system, a
project committee, under the chairmanship of the union council chairman, was
to be constituted for the construction of UHFWC. Other committee members were
to include the member of the ward in whose jurisdiction the UHPWC was located,
the school teacher and some other local influentials. The FPA was to be the
member secretary. All funds released to the project committee were to be
deposited in a local bank and withdrawals were permissible only under the
Joint signat"re of the chairman and FPA. A major objective of the system was
to ensure people's cooperation in the construction, maintenance and use of the
UHFWCs. The funds earmarked for construction for each district, were to be
released to the Deputy Commissioner who would deposit them in one of the
nationalized banks under what is termed PL accounts. Under this, the Deputy
Commissioner could carry forward the unused funds for subsequent years and
release them for construction as and when required. The project committees
were to be paid an advance and subsequent installments were to be released at
prespecified stages of the construction progress. The engineering consultants
had to certify the progress and quality; the channel for fund flow was through
the FPW system at thana and district levels. To ensure smooth functioning of
the Project Cousmittees, the project committee chairman and FPAs were called in
batches, division wise, for an initial training during which the construction
features, construction procedures, payment and fund release mechanisms, etc.
were explained. In addition, the Deputy Commissioners also convened periodic
meetings at his level to review progress, sort out problems and find
solutions.



- 46 -
4.11     However, the experiences with the first phase of construction with
the project committees was not satisfactory in many of the districts for
reasons specified in para. 4.20. Therefore, the Government, in consultation
with the Association, agreed to switch over to the contract system for the
second phase in those districts where the project committees were not
functioning satisfactorily and continue with the PC system in other districts.
However, under the third and subsequent phases, all constructions were awarded
on contract basis.
4.12     The CHC had the benefit of a full-time Norwegian consultant engineer
for more than three years during the plan period. The consultant not only
helped with the design, monitoring and supervision, but also made extensive
field visits to identify bottlenecks in construction and inform the CMC.
4.13     The project finance cell set up under the first project was continued
and strengthened, through the appointment of additional accounts officers.
Learning from the experiences of the first project and through continuous
monitoring of its activities by the Resident Mission and visiting supervision
missions, its functions improved considerably during the second project
period. The frequent changes in positions of PFO sometimes caused dislocation
of work. The PPO called the various project officers and PPOs regularly for
inservice training. Moreover, his accounts officers liaised with the project
directors to ensure timely flow of applications. After initial delays, the
?roject finance cell audited and submitted the audit certificates as per
procedures laid down by IDA. A problem persisted in auditing of the
statements of expenditure; while IDA's procedure specified a simple system,
the auditorslaccounts officers at the PFC who were accustomed to the regular
audit system of the Government spent considerably more time in field audits
than was required. In addition, PCW entrusted the PFC with some vigilance
functions, not related to IDA-assisted projects, whenever cases of
malpractices were brought to the notice of the Government. The GOB also
wanted the PF cell to monitor disbursements, reimbursements for not only IDA-
assisted projects but also of UNFPA and USAID projects. Over the period, the
PFC was transformed as an agency to look after all foreign assisted projects.
4.14     No delay occurred in regard to the submission of withdrawal
applications for operating costs and constructions of UHFWCs. However,
problems continued with PWD as expenditure statements were not submitted on
time. The Project Finance Cell account3 officers visited PWD district offices
regularly and also convened or attended meetings of PWD engineers to impress
upon them the necessity to submit withdrawal applications on time. These
activities met with only partial success.
4.15     Auditing.  Two types of auditing were to be carried out; under the
first, all local currency expenditures were to be audited by the PFC and reim-
bursements in the third quarter were conditional on submission of audit state-
ments for the first quarter, and so on. In addition, the accounts were
subject to general government audits. In spite of initial delays, the audit
requirements were met in a substantial way. The project finance officer took
extra steps to contact the government-audit departments and expedite the
annual auditing of IDA-assisted projects.



- 47 -
Coordination
4.16     The major responsibility for coordination of the project activities
vested in the MOHPP. Under the first project, top level coordination took
place at two levels; one where the Minister for Health and FP convened
quarterly meetings of secretaries and officials of all participating
ministries for reviewing progress and sorting out problems. The other meeting
was at the secretary level where the secretaryladditional secretary, "W.
convened monthly meetings of all population program officers, including PFC,
Directorate of Supplies and BPDU.  Vhile the ministerlal level meetings were
discontinued sometime in 1983, the secretary level meetings were dislocated
for considerable periods. The latter were held regularly under the leadership
of the additional secretary, FPW; meetings of project directors of all mW
projects were held one day, succeeded by another meeting the next day of
multisectoral projects. The advantages of interaction between mN officials
and multisector agencies at project office level were lost in the process.
The coordination of related activities like IM, research, etc. was not
effective. The meetings of the National Population Council, the high level
body for policymaking and program review also did not take place, till the
body was reconstituted in 1983 (see para. 5.03). On the whole, the
coordination activities at various levels should have attracted more
attention.
4.17     Construction.  The construction load of major civil works under the
second project, excluding the UHFWCs, was greater compared with that of the
first project. To ensure speedy and smooth implementation of this component,
the BPDU was strengthened, a population cell was created within PWD and archi-
tectural consultants were appointed to assist the BPDU. Two additional
precautions were taken in that a master plan for the construction of civil
works was prepared and approved as a condition of effectiveness of the
project. The selection of sites for the constructions to be undertaken in the
first year of the project was also another condition of credit effectiveness.
4.18     In spite of all these measures, the construction component got
considerably delayed, both at the start and completion stage-  Initial delays
were caused due to delays in approval of PPs; appointment of architectural
consultants; the cost rationalization exercise in 1980-81 due to cuts in
second plan expenditure; and a governmental decision that the buildings
located at Upazila levels should be semi-permanent in nature. After months of
discussion, an interministerial meeting headed by the Ministry of Planning
decided that the functional buildings of the training centers would be pucca
and the staff quarters of semi-permanent type. This delayed the work of the
consultants regarding design, site surveys and soil investigation. The first
batch of tenders for thana health complexes could be called only in February
1982; and for FWATIs only in March 1982.
4.19     Though there were site-related problems that hindered construction,
problems attributable to site acquisitions were rare. The sites for most of
the THCs were already available. In the two districts of Mymensingh and
Rangpur, however, two of the originally selected sites had to be abandoned and
new sites acquired. The decision to locate PWATIs in the premises of existing
thana health complexes minimized site selection delays; though in Comilla a
new site, already available, was chosen. Delays occured in earmarking the



- 48 -
space within the THC; site plans had to be prepared and approved by both
Health and PP. The strained relationships between the two wings arising out
of integration, delayed this process. At least in two cases of THCs,
construction was delayed after its start, due to litigation regarding small
strips of acquired land. In three out of four, sites were readily available
for locating MAT Schools.
4.20     The first project had a major problem through introduction of price
escalation clause in the contract documents; the clause was therefore deleted
in the tender specifications for second project. The PWD also wanted separate
tenders for electrical works; however, the issue was sorted out by having a
single tender for civil, electrical and sanitary works, and allocating the
money earmarked for electrical works to the superintending engineer
(electricity), who controlled electrical works.
4.21     No delays were attributable to the procedure in getting IDA's 'no
objection' for award of contracts; the procurement section of the Resident
Mission had been empowered to issue this, after scrutiny of documents.
4.22     There was no shortage of cement or other essential building materials
during the project period; the PWD was to supply cement and steel and
initially PWD had enough stocks of these materials.  However, the Martial Law
Administration took a decision in 1982 that, for all future contracts, the
contractors were to supply all materials, and the practice of PWD stocking
materials was to be discontinued. The contracts for Tarash and Bamoi
specified that contractor supply materials like cement and steel; however,
works slowed down after prices escalated after contract signing and the
contractors began negotiating with PWD for supply of materials.
4.23     Contractor-related problems also delayed construction; retendering
had to be done in two cases. There was an instance where a single contractor
was awarded more than five contracts; and probably due to difficulties in
finding sufficient working capital, many of his works got delayed; the Chief
Engineer subsequently llnited the works to be awarded to a single contractor.
Incorporation of additional works beyond the provision in tender schedules due
to variation in local site requirements also delayed works in some cases;
negligence by contractors, particularly during finishing stages, was common.
4.24     In spite of the problems, most of the FWATIs were completed in less
than 12 months; the thana health complexes within 18 months. The construction
schedule of the 43 facilities is given in Annex 10-12. It will be seen from
the tables that the interval between date of completion and date of
commissioning much more than the time taken for construction. The gap is
attributable to delays in getting electricity connections and delays in
procurement and installation of furniture and equipment. In cese of FWATIs, a
major part of delay was due to reluctance on the part of the iraining Officers
to take over completed buildings, as a take-over would result in a shift from
distric; to thana headquarters, which most of them disliked.  In addition, the
Training Officers felt that the accommodation provided for their residtnce was
below their expectations. During the cost rationalization exercises, the
Government had reduced the scale of accommodation permissible to their staff
of various grades.



- 49 _
4.25     The 19 THCs were the last batch among the 358 THCs to be constructed;
as such most of them were in remote areas with poor accessibility. This con-
tributed to construction problems and to cost escalation as well. The TIC at
Sullah had no clance of receiving electricity connections for some years;
consequently the X-ray machine for this complex was not ordered.
4.26     Drawing from the experiences of the first project, the BPDU and the
consultants were given responsibility to transport, install and test the
equipment befor4 they are handed over to the staff of the THC. The procedure
helped in the commissioning of the buildings in a more complete shape than the
first project.
4.27     UHFWCs. As stated earlier, the UHFWCs under the project were planned
to be constructed under the Project Committee Systems. After an initial
promising start, the system did not function effectively, in spite of govern-
mental action to simplify procedures regarding fund flow. While there are
many reasons for this, the more important ones are: (a) subordination by a
number of chairmen of public service to private gain; (b) problems in the flow
of funds from the district to the union; there was no shortage of funds with
the Deputy Commissioner and the procedures for fund flow were also
streamlined, still it did not work successfully; tc) while 70-80Z of the
construction was completed as per schedule, delays occurred at the finishing
stage; (d) there were continuing problems of cost escalation arising out of
delays in construction, attributable to negligence on part of chairmen and to
delays in fund release. Payments for cost escalation had to be approved by
the CMC and which caused delays. The experience of a changeover to contract
system was also not satisfactory in the beginning. Though the contractors
were all prequalified. there was considerable variation in their performance.
An evaluation of tenders received pointed the possibility of collusion among
the contractors, since everyone quoted a near uniform rate over value
tendered. Just like the Project Committee, works were delayed at the
finishing stage. Some esring contractors were very influential and the CMC
found it difficult to take action against them. Many of the incomplete works
had to be entrusted to some of the good contractors for completion. It was
only towards the end of the project that the CMC was able to screen the
contractors and eliminate the undeserving ones. There were problems created
by the division of responsibility between the CMC field engineers and
consultant field engineers; coordination was not to the desired extent.
4.28     The UHFWC component suffered due to poor maintenance of completed
facilities; there was no provision in the budget for maintenance. In addi-
tion, some design related factors contributed to poor quality and complicated
maintenance work. Lack of provision for lime terracing and construction of
partition walls without foundation were the main defects. The poor quality of
timber used for construction also added to the maintenance problems. The
combined effect of all the above resulted in CMC having to undertake a one-
time repair of about 500 UHFWCs, before handling them over to the Upazilas for
routine maintenance. The average cost for the repair was about 10-12S of cost
of construction.
4.29     In spite of all the problems, some foreseen, some unanticipated and
some beyond control, the CMC was able to complete 1,035 UHFWCs during the
project period; a creditable achievement in one respect. The works commenced



- 50 -
in four phases; first phase (237) through project committee (PC); second phase
(298) 134 through PC and 164 through contract; third phase (193) through
contract; and fourth phase (307) through contract. The average time taken for
completion was about 24 months, about 2-1/2 times the required period.
4.30     The lessons learnt from the second project have been analyzed and
many corrective steps have been taken. These include some changes in the
design like the elimination of outside plaster to ensure use of good quality
bricks, which can be checked any time; use of angle iron for door and window
frames; sloping roof and lime terracing; and foundation for partition walls.
The objections raised by users about the lack of compound walls was sorted out
by connecting the clinic and staff quarters through compound walls on either
side; this arrangement will prevent misuse of latrines and tubewells by the
public. All contractors have again been freshly prequalified; their previous
performance had been taken as one of the main criteria for prequalification.
A monitoring chart that can be used both by the CMC and contractor has been
prepared, printed and appended as part of each contract. The role of
consultants has been redefined and the responsibility for construction at
field level now vests only with CMC engineers. With the improvements already
put into practice, the new batch of construction is said to be proceeding
satisfactorily. The completed buildings have been handed over to Upazilas;
routine maintenance of the first batch by Upazila engineers will start from
1988-89, under CMC supervision.
Project Costs and Disbursements
4.31     Costs. A comparison of the actual cost with that of appraisal in
dollars is difficult in view of the continuing exchange rate depreciation of
Taka against the US dollar. The cost of civil works exceeded the appraisal
cost (Tk 1,084 million as against Tk 970.0 million) part of the increase was
due to the increased number (1,035 against 700) of UHFWCs constructed (see
Annex 13). However, for the same quantum of civil works as at appraisal, the
actual cost was less than the appraisal by 10.22. Moreover, the project
actually paid for 25,500 women years of NWA salary support against 16,500
provided in appraisal.  Similarly, the expenditure on DDS kits was US$7.6
million against US$4.0 million provided.  The construction cost at appraisal
was 48.32 of total; in actual it came to 56.1, primarily due to an increase
in the number of UHPWCs established. The revised cost estimate of the project
compared with that of appraisal is given in Annex 14.
Disbursements
4.32     As in the case of the first project, disbursements also lagged, the
primary reason being that the civil works were behind schedule by more than
2-1/2 years. Disbursements for the non-civil works components were as per
schedule. As for IDA, the disbursement by December 31, 1983, the original
closing date, was only US$7.9 million, i.e. 24.6Z of the credit amount.
Disbursements thereafter picked up and rose to 60Z by December 31, 1984; 811
by December 31, 1985; the credit amount finally disbursed by July 1986 was
US$30.8 million, resulting in a cancellation of US$1.2 million (see Annex 15).
The grants from Australia, CIDA and FRG were disbursed fully. Netherlands met
the full cost of construction of four MAT Schools, as per their memorandum of
understanding with GOB. Details of credit disbursements donorwise are given
in Annexes 16-21.

V. PROJECT CONTRIBUTION
Proiect Performance
5.1      The second project consolidated, strengthened and expanded the
activities initiated under the first project. The project period, including
extension by two years, ran parallel with the Government's Second Five-Year
Plan. The savings that arose out of the exchange rate devaluation of the Taka
against the US dollar and other currencies permitted project financing of all
the original components for the entire five-year period (1980-85). All inputs
originally envisaged in the project, barring four items, were mades the
deletion of four items did not affect the quality of the project, as two of
these were financed by other agencies. The construction component was not
only fully implemented; an additional 305 UHFPCs were constructed.  Almost
double the original allocation of US$4.0 million was utilized for supply of
essential drugs (DDS kits) needed for primary health care.  Hultisectoral
components of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting went about
smoothly; the women's projects components also achieved largely their
objective, in spite of the problems faced (paras. 3.46-3.53).  The financing
of Sterilization Surveillance Teams helped improve the quality of
sterilization operations, which had picked up during the project period.
Almost all project components have been evaluated and their results are
summarized along with their implementation status. The number of patients
served by each UNFUC is only about 20Z of the expected case load, resulting in
an under utilization of UHFWCs, for the present. As stated in para. 3.1, the
organizational climate during the entire project period was unfavorable and
there were other factors that had negative influences on the project. There
have been substantial and fruitful and GOB-Donor interactions during the
project period, both in Dhaka and at Paris Aid-Group meetings.
Project Contribution to Program Development
5.2      Within a few years after Independence, and during the First Five Year
plan Period (1973-78), the infrastructure of a reorganized family planning
program began to take shape. The First Population Project made significant
contributions towards the establishment of the program which was multisectoral
in nature, community-based and linked with the delivery of health services,
particularly maternal and child health services.  For the first time, GOB
announced a national population policy (1976) and made clear the Governments'
determination to control population growth as early as possib!e, and prefer-
ably, before the end of the century.  Population control was to be achieved
through a m.lti-pronged approach aimed at improving health particularly
through reduction of infant and child mortality; a communication program aimed
at influencing people towards acceptance of small family norm and use of con-
traception; delivery of contraceptive service to people at home; raising the
socioeconomic status of women; and enlisting community support for family
planning. Population Control activities were to be an integral part of
governmental efforts to improve the socioeconomic condition of its people. By
the end of the first project (1980), the basic elements of a rural infra-
structure for delivery of family planning and health services were in place.
These included two workers, a male and female, for all the 13,500 rural wards;



- 52 -
a communication program using mass media, domiciliary visits by field workers
for face-to-face education and use of community leaders; projects aimed at
improving socioeconomic status of women in about 42 thanas; a system for
domiciliary distribution of pills and condoms and institutional sterilization
services5 a structure for monitoring and evaluation; an involvement of NGOs in
national population control efforts. The Second Population and Family Health
Project assisted in continuing, strengthening and expanding the program
components torards greater efforts. The development of the program (1980-85)
and the second project contribution to the same are reviewed below.
Pro8ram Organization
5.3      At the highest level, the 'National Population Council' was reconsti-
tuted in 1983 as the 'National Council for Population Control' (NCPC), headed
by the President of the country and consisting of 12 cabinet ministers. The
NCPC provides policy guidelines and directives, approves strategies, programs
and other measures; it is assisted by an Executive Committee headed by the
Minister for Health and Family Planning (MOHFP), other members being the
Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and the Member, Planning Commission
incharge of Social and Economic Infrastructure. The Secretary, MOHFP, acts as
Member-Secretary in the Executive Committee.
5.4      In addition to the MOHFP, seven other ministries serve as channels to
disseminate family planning information and in some cases, to provide contra-
ceptive services. Each ministry has separate staff at headquarters
responsible for planning, budgetting and monitory population related
activities. They have also strengthened their field staff to carry out such
activities. The coordination of the multisectoral program is achieved through
National Coordination Committees, one chaired by the Hinister for Health and
FP, and the other by the Secretary, MOHFP.
5.5      The Population Planning Section of the Planning Commission assists in
the development of policy options for NCPC consideration and the formulation
of Five-Year Plan proposals for the population sector. It has, in addition,
two other responsibilities, one to influence other developmental ministrles to
take account of population-related variables in their planning and the other
to evaluate key program activities. The two functions are being carried out
by the Program Development and Evaluation Unit (PDEU) formed by integrating
the previously existing two units for population and developmental planning
and, external evaluation of population control program.
5.6      The organizational framework for the delivery of both health and
family planning services is located within the Ministry of Health and Family
Planning (MOHFP). The Ministry headed by one Minister in charge of both
health and family planning has two wings; the health wing with full
responsibility for planning and implementing the health program, and the
family planning wing with responsibility for planning and implementing MCH and
FP services and coordinating all activities, both Government and voluntary, in
the population sector. In addltion to the Secretary, Ministry of H & FP, the
FPW has a full time Additional Secretary. The current organization is the
outcome of a series of changes that took place during the period 1975-85.
5.7      At the district level, the Deputy Director (FP), is in charge of the
FP and MCH services; he is assisted by one medical officer in charge of MCH
and clinical contraceptives: The creation of the post of an Assistant



- 53 -
Director (IEM) is said to be under consideration. Functional integration of
family planning with health services is in operation at the Upazila level and
below. There are three main functionaries at the Upazila level, the Upazila
health and FP officer (UHFPO), the Upazila family planning officer (UFPO), and
a medical officer in-charge of MCHFP unit at the Upazila Health Complex (UHC).
The UFPO is in-charge of family planning activities, the UHFPO is in-charge of
the health complex and all health activities, and the medical officer (MCHFP)
controls the MCHFP unit at the UHC. According to the latest governmental
order, both the UHFPO and UFPO report to the Upazila Chairman who is
responsible for coordinating both PP and Health services, under the functional
integration set up. In pursuance of the decision of NCPC, a Upazila Family
Planning Committee chaired by the chairman of the Upazila Parishad, has been
constituted, in each Upazila. The committee consisting of elected
representatives and concerned officials as members will have UFPO as the
member secretary. The committee is responsible for taking all possible steps
for implementation of family planning program in the Upazila within the
decentralized set up.
5.8      The current organizational set-up is the result of a series of
changes that took place since 1976.  These changes had both positive and
negative aspects, and the Association and its cofinanciers have tried to
reinforce the positive aspects and reduce or eliminate the ~.mpact of negative
factors through the three projects they have been assisting so far. The
primary focus of IDA's contribution has been to: (a) decentralize powers to
and strengthen the district-level organization; (b) support the functional
integration (as against administrative integration) of family planning with
health service at Upazila level and below; (c) involve elected representatives
both at Upazila and union levels in promoting family planning and primary
health care services; and (d) strengthen the three tiers at Upazila, district
and directorate for supervision of the program. The Association has urged to
have a three member team at the district level headed by a Deputy Director
(FP) and supported by two Assistant Directors, one in-charge of MCHICC and the
other in-charge of IEM activities. The Association has urged that while
structural issues are important and gross anomalies in the structu.:e should be
removed, the main focus hereafter should be to ensure the stability of the
existing structure and to concentrate on improving the managerial aspects of
the program through better planning, supervision, training, monitoring and
evaluation and team work. For further details qee paras. 8.8-11.
Service Delivery Infrastructure
5.9      The institutional framework for the delivery of health and family
planning services in the rural areas consists of the Upazila health complexes
(UHCs) and the Union Health and Family Welfare Centers (UHFWCs). Each UHC
when fully established will have 31 beds, including those reserved for MCBFP,
and provide for inpatient, outpatient and outreach services. It is headed by
UHPPO and is staffed by nine medical officers including the four consultants,
and MO (MCHFP), one Upazila family planning officer (UFPO), and assistant
UFPO, health inspector, sanitary inspector and nursing staff. UHFWCs are
planned to be established to cover all the 4,365 unions and each will cater to
a population of 15-20,000, and will be staffed by one medical assistant, one
family welfare visitor, one pharmacist and one aya. While the UHFWC will be
first source of referral for field staff and be the focus for services like



- 54 -
antenatal care. postnatal care, family planning, treatment of common ailments
and child disorders, patients from UHPWCs will be referred to UHC, which, in
turn, will refer cases to subdivisional, district, medical college and other
specialized hospitals.
5.10     Family planning and primary health care service at the counnity
level will be delivered by a team consisting of a male health assistant (HA)
and a female family welfare assistant (FWA). The team will have the responsi-
bility for delivery of a priority package of FP/PHC services in a
supplementary and complementary manner. The female worker will be supervised
by the FPA and the male worker by the assistant health inspector (AHI). These
supervisors will operate from the UHFWCs, which will be the cornerstone for
coordinated delivery of institutional and outreach servi.ces under the overall
leadership of the medical assistant. An effective functioning of UHFWC is
therefore crucial to the success of governmental efforts for delivery of
FPIPHC services.
5.11     Considerable progress has been made todate in the establishment of
UBCs abnd UHFWCs. A total of 341 UHCs was reported to be functional by
1984-85, and their number is to increase to 397 by 1989-90. The total number
of UNFUCs (new construction) made functional is about 1,745 during 1980-88,
and this does not include the large number of rural dispensaries (about 1,275)
which are also being converted to UHPWCs in a phased manner.  It could be
reasonably assumed that in about 65Z of the rural unions, either full scale or
skeleton services are currently available.  An NCHFP unit exists in all the
functional UHCs. In addition NCHFP services are available in 84 MCWCs, of
which 48 are located at the district and subdivisional levels.
5.12     With the present level of infrastructure, institutional facilities
for sterilization are available in all functional UHCs, 84 MCWCs, subdi-
visional district and medical college hospitals and selected UHFWCs. This is
In addition to the facilities in the private sector and hospitals of other
governmental agencies like that of military, railways, etc. Facilities for
IUD insertion are available in all the above facilities, in all the 1,745
UHFCos; and in also those unions where a trained FWV had been posted,
irrespective of the availability of a constructed physical facility. The
total number of unions (including where constructed facility exists) where an
P7V has been posted so far is about 3,000. Almost all the UHFWCB and UHCs
could be utilized for delivery of injectable contraceptives. Institutional
facilities for MCB services in rural areas are available at all functional
UBCs, and also at the UHFWCs. In addition, the FWVs posted in other unions
and the 24,000 TBAs trained until 1985 offer limited MCH services. MCR
services in urban areas are delivered by 48 MCWCs located at
district/subdivisional levels and other hospitals located in urban areas.
5.13     Both the first and second projects have made a significant
contribution to the establishment of service delivery infrastructure. While
the recruitment and initial training of 13,500 FWAs were financed under the
first project, the second project provided for improving the quality of their
services through better training and supervision (paras. 3.4-3.8). The
establishment 1,035 of the 1,725 UHRFCs has been an entirely second project
contribution. Both the first and second projects have contributed to the
training of required number of MAs and PWAs (para. 3.23-3.24). The
establishment of MCHFP units in all functional UBCs was also a contribution
under the second project. The quality of sterilization services improved
considerably due to the institution of sterilization eurveillance system.



- 55 -
5.14     Vhile it is difficult to quantity the services attributable to the
project's contribution, evaluation studies have shovn that each functional
UHFWC has begun to cater to 202 for expected clients for MCH and FP services.
5.15     While the expansion of the services delivery system has been
impressive, the same cannot be stated about its utilization, particularly of
UHEWCs (para. 3.17). A manual for the operation of UHFWCs has been printed
and made available.  Improvement in services utilization will depend largely
on the establishment of rapport between mW and her clientele, initially
through planned home visits and the referrals that FWAs and HAs are able to
make to the UHFWCs. Supervision of UHFICs, which is weak, has to be
strengthened considerably. Many of the required actions are discussed in
paras. 3.17 and 8.15 and find a place in the third project.
5.16     A strategy for the delivery of priority MCH services that can make a
quick dent on the infant and child mortality has been agreed upon. This is
based on an expansion of the immunization program to cover all Upazilas by
1990; wide promotion of oral rehydration therapy to control diarrhea and its
institutionalizatioL at home level through educational efforts; and a program
for the trainivg of TBAs. The screening of high risk cases of pregnancy at
field level is also to be introduced. The immunization program now covers 190
upazilas and is proposed to be extended to another 270 Upazilas before 1990.
The promotion of ORT is a combined effort of both governmental and nongovern-
mental sectors; the BRAC, an NGO, has already trained 10 million mothers in
the preparation and use of ORS; all mW. and HAs have received training in ORT
and teachers mothers on use of ORS. A planned program for the training of
TBAs is underway. The establishment of the basic infrastructure has served as
a spring board for a rapid expansion of MCH services during the third plan
period.
Training
5.17     Recognizing that the success of the Government's population control
efforts will largely depend on the availability of a well trained and
motivated work force for program implementation, the GOB has made considerable
investments in building a network of training institutions. The orientation
in basic training of medical officers to commnity health and family planning
is proposed to be achieved through appropriate field training and the rotation
of medical undergraduates through model family planning clinics. In addition
to the model clinics in medical colleges, a number of selected clinics in the
NGO sector, particularly of BAVS, provides in-service training to medical
officers in sterilization techniques. The basic training and retraining of
field staff and their supervisors is being taken care by the 12 FWV training
schools, 8 MATCs, 19 Regional Training Centers, and NIPORT, and the National
Institute of Prevention srid Social Medicine (NIPSOM) in the health sector.)
NIPSOM caters to postgraduate training in health, in addition to inservice
training of medical officers working in Upazila health complexes. The output
of the training infrastructure has been quite substantial as far as can be
seen from Annex 3 to S. Experience over the second project clearly indicates
that the development of manpower requires attention to a number of related
factors, significant among them the way personnel are recruited and the
adequacy of training and management practices that would motivate staff to
identify with the goals and work hard towards their achievements. Vhile



. 56 -
training has to be treated as part of a total system, the improvement of
training itself requires a systems approach in that the components of
identification of training needs, curriculum development, training
methodologies, training evaluation, field training and training of trainers
have to be dealt with as a whole.
5.18     Most of the components of the training system have received support
either from the first or the second prcject. While the first project support
has been mainly for establishing infrastructure, the second project aimed at
improvement in quality of training. The quality of training has improved
considerably but there are still many deficiencies. A major weakness has been
the inability of NIPORT to serve its dual function as a health management
training institute, as well as an Apex Training Institute effectively. These
weaknesses are being attended to on a large scale during the third project by
strengthening of NIPORT staff, increasing its ability to supervise the work of
FPVTIs and RTIs through training trainees, developing appropriate curricula.
developing teaching aids and conducting training evaluation (para. 3.-28).
5.19     The training of FWVs and Mks has been temporarily discontinued and
eight of the FWVTIs are being utilized for the initial training of the newly
recruited FWAs. Similarly, the MAT Schools are being used for the training of
newly recruited Health Assistants. An issue has been raised as to whether the
training capacity already created is in excess of the requirements. While it
may appear so, the impression vill be different when looked from the
perspective of the totality of training needs. The issue is discussed further
in para. 8.14.
Information, Education and Comamnication (IEM) Activities
5.20     The IEt activities are directed to inform, educate and persuade
people of the benefits of a small and manageable family size from the indivi-
dual, family and national point of view. They aim to reach not only the
eligible couples, but also those at home and conity that influence their
decision-making. Basically the IEM program is designed to reach the people
through three different but mutually reinforcing approaches of mass media,
small group and family contacts.
5.21     The basic infrastructure for the communication program was developed
during the period 1976-80. It consists, essentially, of the various units of
the ministry of information and broadcasting, the health and family planning
field workers, I1K unit of the FPV; health education bureaus of health wing.
voluntary agencies, and the Swanirwar program. Though the three women's
projects also serve as major communication media, they are dealt with
separately. Each component of the IEK infrastructure has its differentiated
role, but there is also some overlap.
5.22     Mass media now reaches a large segment of the rural population; radio
messages are broadcast for 70 minutes a day though the national station; while
the 5 regional stations set apart 30 minutes a day for similar purpose. To
supplement the 10-35 individually owned radio sets per village and to increase
listening coverage, radio receiving sets are distributed to union councils,
mothers clubs, radio listening farms, etc. The country has now a film
laboratory set up under government sector exclusively related to production of
films on population related subjects. Bangladesh television devotes four



- 57 -
hours a mouth for population and health program. Information campaigns are
being held; bill boards and neon signs are put up in important places; large
quantity of pamphlets and leaflets are printed and distributed. Two other
significant activities are the use of folk songs (para. 3.36) and the
Swanirvar program for the population related activities (3.41 and 3.42). The
overall results of all these activities is that a fairly large population of
rural women have knowledge about family planning methods, condom (722), oral
pills (772). sterilization (792) and IUD (262), according to 1986 survey.
There is however a big gap between knowledge and use. Some studies have
reported fear of health consequences of contraceptive and objection from
religious leaders as major obstacles to use of contraception.
5.23     In order to get the maximum out of the existing infrastructure,
certain variables should receive attention; these are (a) coordination of
activities between the various units in regard to program planning,
implementation and evaluation; (b) the adaptation of messages to conform to
changing program needs and of consumers; (c) a target group oriented approach;
(d) mutually reinforcing aspects of mass media and family contacts; (e)
greater involvement of community influentials. The strategy should shift from
the earlier efforts to promote awareness to one of promoting specific behavior
changes. There should be a greater emphasis on NCH services; and also a
balance between top down and bottom up activities, with the latter receiving
greater emphasis, meaning that the communication activities should aim more at
community involvement and family contacts.
Economic Welfare of Women
5.24     Recognizing that enhancing the status of women is critical to a long-
term reduction in fertility a number of schemes aimed at two-fold objectives
providing gainful employment to women through income generating activities and
imparting non-formal education with emphasis on health, family planning.
nutrition and child care has been mounted. The three projects, which started
in 1976, cover about 100 thanas by 1985. Governmental action to enhance the
status of women provides for So nominated women members in the Parliament, in
addition to any elected members; union councils to provide for compulsory
female representative; reservation of 10? jobs in the governmental and quasi-
governmental sectors to female employees; 502 of primary school teachers for
women; legislation prohibiting dowry system; raising the age of marriage of
girls to 18. The department of women's affairs is in charge of initiating and
implementing other measure to enhance status of women.
5.25     The second project assisted in strengthening and expanding the three
women's projects to about 100 thanas. As stated earlier, evaluations have
shown that these projects have succeeded to a large extent; however a number
of difficulties that remain are to be solved if the projects are to mak. a
much more substantial impact (para. 3.54). The third project provides for
sorting out the problems identified, implementing remedial measures and
further expanding the project to cover additional thanas.
Monitoring. Evaluation and Research
5.26     The 7PW infrastructure for monitoring, evaluation aud research
consists of the MIS within 7PW with its special service statistics cell; PDEU
in the Planning Commission; the health information unit under the health wing;



- 58 -
the Population Study Center within the BIDS; the research wing within NIPORT
and the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. Apart from this, a number of other
agencies like the BPRP, PIACT Bangladesh, ICDDRB, Institute of Business Admin-
istration in Dhaka University are involved in population research. Areas
where significant progress has been made are in the monthly reporting of FP
and MCH statistics by the MIS: continuous evaluation of program activities,
particularly of training, field services delivery and multisectoral projects;
and contraceptive prevalence surveys at regular intervals. The NGO sector has
made significant contribution in research and evaluation. One area which has
been deficient is the availability of national level fertility datag a repeat
survey of the BPS (1975) could not be carried out over a period more than 10
years, through the second survey is now under implementation. The sample
registration system of the BBS is also to be strengthened so that annual
fertility data is available for program evaluation. A major weakness of the
system, particularly in research, has been the inability of FPW to coordinate
research and direct research activities into those areas where program-related
or demographic gaps still exist. To meet this deficiency, the National
Steering Committee for Population Research (NSCPR) has been set up recently
with NIPORT serving as its secretariat. NSCPR has to play a much more active
role than at present, if the major objective for which it has been set up is
to be realized. It should have some statutory powers to coordinate and
financial resources at its command. The IDA-assisted projects have been
instrumental in strengthening the MIS, external evaluation of program acti-
vities and establishing a coordinating mechanism.
Involvement of Non-Governmental Organizations
5.27     The Government has taken an active role in promoting NGO partici-
pation in the national efforts for population control. The major projects in
the NGO sector are the Social Marketing Project (SMP), the Bangladesh
Association for Voluntary Sterilization (BAVS), Bangladesh PP Association
(BPPA), Concern for Women, the Swanirvar program and a large number of
voluntary agencies. Almost the entire urban program is the responsibility of
NGOs. The Government also established a Subvention Committee which family
planning activities are earmarked to the NGOs, Government has expressed its
willingness to allocate roles to the NGOs in the rural areas also. Apart from
funding private sector and innovative programs through both projects, IDA has
maintained continuous dialogue with the Government for fuller utilization of
NGOs and also removal of obstacles that stand in the way of their active
participation.
Pinancial Resources
5.28     The allocation for the population sector in the Government's annual
development program has been rising continuously, from about US$5.2 million to
about US$50.0 million in 1986-87.  Annual figures of allocation and utili-
zation are given in Annex 22.  The projects contribution to the program have
been substantial; it has averaged about US$20 million during the second plan
period and probably, double that amount, during the initial years of the thS-d
plan period. The allocation for population as a percentage of total ADP has
increased from about 2? in second half of 1970 to an average of 2.92 during
1980-8S.



- 59 -
Contraceptive Acceptance and Use
5.29     The contraceptive prevalence surveys carried out since 1975, has
recorded a continuous rise in the use of contraceptives. Compared with the
baseline of 7.72 contraceptive use in 1975 (BPS), CPR has increased to 12.72
(1979), 18.62 (1981), 19.12 (1983) and 25.32 (1985). The use of modern
methods of contraceptives has increased from 8.92 (1979) to 18.42 (1985) (see
Annex 23).  That injectables are becoming popular is evidence from the
statistics furnished by NGOs who have been their major providers. The annual
acceptance of FP methods, based on performances of some and distribution of
others, is given in Annex 24. The figures reveal that the couple-years of
protection have been increasing continuously over the years. The percentage
of married women ever used modern contraceptive stands at 35.52 (1985).
Evidence from the projects run by NGOs show that there is a latent unmet
demand for contraception; CPR in most of NGO projects is about 35-402. In
spite of an increase in contraceptive use, the governmental program is much
below its target of achieving 37.5Z contraceptive use by 1985. Evidence
indicates, however, that many eligible couples would practice family planning
provided quality family planning services and supplies were available to them,
complemented by a much stronger MCH care. However, mother and child health
has not recorded much iAprovements; infant mortality continues at 125 per
1,000 (1984-85); percent children under two years covered by DTP was a
negligible 22, measles 0.8S and poliomyelities 22 (1984-85). Issues regarding
demographic targets are further discussed in para. 8.2 to 8.4.
Conclusion
5.30     The discussion above indicates that the major elements of the
national population control program are in place. A fairly vast
infrastructure hias been developed over the twelve-year period commencing from
1975. The project is intertwined with the program in all its major elements
and has been instrumental to a large extent, in developing the infrastructure.
Because of this, it is very difficult to separate the impact of the project
from that of the national program. In spite of shortcomings, the quantitative
targets fixed for the project were met, though with some delay. The
contraceptive performance has ;&1so been considerable. IDA and Cofinanciers,
along with UNFPA and USAID, maintained a continuous dialogue with the
Government and helped focus its attention on the population program through
periodic reviews of the program, identification of bottlenecks and solutions
to problems identified. The lessons learnt from the project have been
incorporated in the formulation of the third project.

VI. COVENANTS AND FULLFILMENT
6.1      The borrower implemented the project with due diligence and
efficiency, subject of course to the limitations placed by Government's own
administrative and financial procedures. Changes in the country's
environment within which the project operated, particularly economic and
political ones, havy had their impact on the implementation of the
project.
6.2      A large number of covenants were built into the project to ensure
that it would be implemented with due care and efficiency. The Government
adhered to the implementation of most of the covenants.
6.3      Appointment of consultants to assist the BPDU and CNC and
strengthening of BPDU and CMC were carried out. The superintending
engineer, BPDU, functioned as the director and a full-time director was not
appointed. The construction of UHFWCs was done in a phased manner; the
changes in >.e strategy for construction of UHFWCs were the result of
continuous ewiluation of the component coupled with the discussions with
the Association.
6.4      MCHFP units were established in all thana health complexes and an
operational manual for UHFWC was completed, though much behind schedule.
Evaluation of all project components and of the program was carried out at
intervals; the plan of action agreed upon to improve the performance of
FWAs was largely implemented.
6.5      Though a functional analysis of the health and family planning
program was carried out, the preparation of a health and population
manpower policy did not take place. Similarly, the analysis of the system
of maintenance for the vehicles was not done.
6.6      There were changes in the governmental plan for integration of
family planning with health services compared to what was agreed upon at
the time of negotiations. In 1980 the Government decided to integrate
family planning with health services at thana level and below in one step,
as against the phased integration agreed upon. The administrative
integration was given up in 1983 in favor of functional integration. The
national level and district level organizations were not disturbed much;
though the Martial Law Administration brought about some changes.
6.7      The covenants regarding procurement and project accounts auditing
were largely adhered to. Imported goods were insured; the revolving fund
was kept and operated as per requirements.

VII. ROLE OF THE BANK
The Bank's Goals and Role
7.1      The Bank's main population objective for Bangladesh is to promote
systematic and effective governmental efforts to improve the quality,
outreach and impact of the national population program and its associated
maternal and child health program. This goal is pursued in close
association with other donors, both to maximize external aid and to ensure
consistent rather than mixed, signals to the Government on important policy
issues. In pursuance of this major goal, the Bank's involvement for the
second project consisted of a number of major areas as given in Annex I.
Second Five-Year Plan for Population Sector and Project Formulation
7.2      Responding to the request from the GOB for early action for the
development of a second project, the Bank advised the FPW to formulate the
second plan proposals for the population sector (1978-83). An outline
prepared by the Government was commented upon during the supervision
mission of March 1977 and the Government then prepared detailed proposals
by October 1977. The population specialist at the Resident Mission and
representatives from the local office of some of the cofinancing agencies
participated in the various working groups set up by FPl to develop plan
proposals. Project identification took place in March 1977. The Bank led
an appraisal mission for the second project in April-May 1978 and post-
appraisal mission in October-November 1978. Representatives of
cofinanciers participated both in the appraisal and post-appraisal
missions. The appraisal report was also discussed at a meeting of the Aid-
Group Consortium in Paris, in 1979, in which GOB representatives also
participated. Some of the cofinanciers' representatives were present at
the negotiations for the project in April 1979. In short, both the
preparation of the Government's Second Five-Year Plan on population and the
development of the second project was a participatory effort by the
Government, the Bank and representatives of cofinanciers. (Also see paras.
1.13-1.25) .
Donor Coordination
7.3      As the chairman of the Bangladesh Aid Consortium and as a major
leader, the Bank took the lead not only in formulating the project but also
coordinating donor activities at various stages. The donor coordination in
the population sector for the second project was reflected through a number
of major initiatives.  First, in formulating the project (paras.
1.13-1.25). Secondly, when there was serious concern among the donor
community on poor performance in family planning during the first two years
of the second plan, the Dhaka representatives of some of the largest donors
of official development assistance to Bangladesh Population Control Program
got together and prepared the 'Draft of A Discussion Paper' to improve
program performance. While some donor representatives held different views
on the practicability of some of the specific recommendations made in the
paper, 'none of them denied its basic conclusion that continued high
population growth is the overriding constraint to the economic development



- 62 -
of Bangladesh and that the present control program, while having a positive
impact, is failing to produce the results that either the gravity of the
situation demands or prevailing circumstances permit'. The paper was
instrumental for a serious discussion between GOB and donor agencies, and a
number of initiatives that followed to improve program performance.
Thirdly, half a day was devoted during the Bangladesh Aid Group meeting in
Paris in April 1984 for discussion on population issues. The GOB presented
a status paper during the meeting. Fourthly, following the Paris meeting
in April 1984, meetings of the local consultative group on Population,
chaired by the Bank were held regularly at Dhaka to discuss progress in the
population sector. In addition, Bank office regularly provided
documentation on the project implementation to the cofinanciers to the
extent possible. The Bank's lending operation process provided another
avenue for coordination between the donors and dialogue with the
Government. Another opportunity used for coordination was the regular
meetings of the logistics Group set up by UNFPA and participated by almost
all donor agencies in the population sector; similarly meetings were
organized by UNICEF to discuss the implementation of the Expanded Program
for Immunization. The Government also undertook initiatives in donor
coordination; they convened meetings of donor agencies for discussion of
specific areas of program implementation. On the whole, donor coordination
during the second project was not only extensive but also intensive.
7.4      Supervision.  Both the Population Specialist and the various
Supervision Missions rendered considerable assistance in program
implementation. There were two supervision missions annually; one mission
consisted of Bank representatives, and local representatives of cofinancing
agencies could join if they desired; the second was an annual review
exercise consisting of Bank and headquarters representatives of all
cofinancing agencies. At least part of the supervision period was joined
by representatives of UNFPA and USAID. The annual review missions were
large, often consisting of more than 15-20 members; but they proyided
excellent opportunities to enlarge areas of common perception regarding
program contents, policy issues, and solution to problems identified.
7.5      The role of the Population Specialist extended much beyond
rendering help in project implementation. The post rendered valuable
technical assistance to the Government in policy and program formulation.
Just like the Second Five-Year Plan, the Resident Mission rendered
assistance in developing proposals for the Third Five Year Plan. Bank
consultants and the Resident Mission offered assistance to Government in
the preparation of an implementation plan for population (1980-85), based
on a similar exercise for the agricultural sector. Towards the end of the
second project, the PHN department delegated some powers of supervision to
the resident mission. For instance, the approval of tender documents was
decentralized to the Resident Mission; correspondence in this regard with
Washington was reduced to a minimum.
Procedural Problems
7.6      The Bank procedures, particularly related to cost escalation, etc.
were deleted from the tender clause for civil works under the second
project as these were difficult to administer under Bangladeshi conditions.



- 63 -
PWD wanted to supply materials and it was agreed to; however, the
Government by mid 1983 ordered that henceforth the contractors should
supply all materials.
7.7      Delays in project implementation were partly the result of a
number of complicated governmental procedures, and hence there has been
continuous dialogue between the GOB and donor community to simplify these
procedures. The Bank has taken a number of initiatives; convened LCG
meetings and conveyed donor suggestions to GOB. Procedural problems
connected with procurement, land acquisition, shortage of local currency
resources, project monitoring, etc., affected project implementation. The
population projects were benefitted in their fund release problems, after
their classifications under the 'Core Projects,' a mechanism adopted by GOB
to protect most important projects from budget cuts and find release
problem. Monitoring of projects by 'Implementation, Monitoring and
Evaluation Division' (IMED) and their reporting to ECNEC helped sort out
issues. Delays in the approval of Technical Assistance by Government were
very common; in addition, Government preferred Technical Assistance from
grant sources rather than from credits. The UNDP-funded study on the
approval process for Technical Assistance in Bangladesh had made a number
of useful suggestions. In short, project implementation problems are not
peculiar to population projects, they are generic to the system and cut
across projects. It is difficult to bring substantial improvements to one
part of the system; what is necessary is to help the GOB devise measures
that will simplify governmental procedures, generally, in regard to
preparation and approval of PPs, recruitment of staff, budgetary sanctions,
and decentralization of authority.
Overview
7.8      The Bank adopted a very positive role throughout the project; it
helped the FPW to sort out problems arising out of Government's procedures
and, in addition, adjusted Bank procedures to the exent possible, to avoid
implementation delays. All the c,financiers also adopted quite flexible
approaches in their own procedures. The project finance cell also played a
more useful, supportive and effective role than in the first project.
VIII. MAJOR ISSUES
8.1      Population control efforts by GOB, particularly the design and
implementation of the three projects financed by the Bank and a number of
cofinanciers, have evoked different responses from people within the
country and the donor community. Perceptions about the program have not
been uniform; on few aspects the differing perceptions have even bordered
controversy. In spite of this, both GOB and dor-or community have made
serious attempts during the past ten years to a-rive at a consensus
regarding policy approaches, program strategies, program contents, and
organizational aspects, etc. While a number of issues have been sorted out
to the satisfaction of most, some remain, and yet these are due, mainly, to
ideological differences which cannot be easily settled. The Project



_ 64 -
Performance Audit by the Operation Evaluation Department (OED) within the
Bank has analyzed some of the issues in great depth and have given their
own recommendati,ns. The following paragraphs discuss the major issues
that are or have been of concern and the approaches developed to meet them.
DemosraDhic Targets
8.2      The Government of Bangladesh has been seriously concerned with the
demographic prospects within the country that the First Five-Year Plan went
to the extent of stating that 'no civilized measure would be too drastic to
keep the population of Bangladesh on the smaller side of 15 crores (150
million) for sheer ecological inability of the nation's; with this in view,
the first plan aimed at a reduction in growth rate from 3Z to 2.8S by 1978
and called for a decline in fertility to a replacement level by the end of
the century. However, the National Population Policy (1976) revised the
target drastically to an achievement of NRR one by 1985 and thus containing
the population size to 120 m by the year 2000. Subsequently, GOB realized
that this revised target was too ambitious and set 1990 as the date for
achieving NRR one; the target was reflected in the Second Five-Year Plan.
Consistent with this goal, the objective was to reduce crude birth rate
from about 43 (1980) to 32 (1985), implying an increase in contraceptive
use from 14S to 38Z during the five-year period.
8.3      A performance evaluation by GOB of the first three years (1980-83)
which ran concurrently with the second project, showed that compared to
government target, contraceptive performance was running short to the
extent of 40.52 on sterilization, 57.4Z in pills, 44S in IUD and 28.5S in
condom.  The donor community, right from the beginning, considered GOB
targets as unrealistic by any standard; while the targets might reflect
governmental will and commitment to population control, difficulties in
implementation and lack of achievement might demoralize the workers in the
field, lead to malpractices and even to coercive tactics. By mid 1983,
there were serious discussions, within the Government and also between GOB
and donor community on fixing more realistic dumographic targets. Evidence
from the experience of various NGO programs had revealed that there is a
latent unmet demand for contraceptives and the governmental program could
perform better if quality family planning services and supplies were made
available to people, complemented by stronger health, and particularly, HCH
care. A consensus was therefore reached that the first ol,jective of the
program should be to reach national CPR of 352 or better by 1990; secondly,
it should aim at NRR one by 2005; and thirdly, maintain NRR one or lower
till such time as zero population growth is reached. The population
program was to be oriented into 3 phases to reflect these targets; in fact
the Third Five-Year Plan (1985-90) was based on the above consensus.
8.4      While the Contraceptive Prevalence Survey (1985) shows a CPR of
25.32 (any method), an analysis of the contraceptive performance during
1985-88 indicates that the program has to perform much better if the
targetted CPR of 40? is to be achieved by 1990.  The Contraceptive
Prevalence Survey planned for 1988 should give a clearer indication of
where the program stands. Two alternative approaches are possible under
the circumstances; to lower the target for 1990 to an achievable level or
to initiate steps to improve program performance. Discussions in paras.
3.09 and 3.17 clearly indicate that the performance of the family planning



- 65 -
field workers MFVAO) and of the UHeFWC are suboptimal and could be improved
with greater efforts. Hence, the approach by the Bank and Cofinanciers
should be to influence and urge the Government towards better utilization
of the facilitieslpersonnel created so far, so that a CPR, close to the
target, is achieved by 1990. The failure to achieve the target of NERR one
by 2005 will have serious demographic consequences for the nation; it is
difficult to contemplate a situation when the scarce resources are to be
stretched to support an additional 50 m population, by 2050, if the
achievement of NRR one by 2005 is delayed by another ten years (see Annex
XXV).
Balance Between FP and MCH Services
8.5      Another contentious issue has been the balance between PP and MNH
service. While the recruitment, training and utilization of PWAs for
family planning education and services delivery were comparatively easier,
and helped to meet the latent demand for contraceptive services, the
delivery of community MCH services required fully trained FWVs and a
physical infrastructure from where they could function. The establishment
of FWVTIs, UHFWCs, and MCHFP units at upazila health complexes was a major
attempt to develop the infrastructure for mounting an accelerated delivery
of MCH services.  Added to this was the training of TBAs: both their
training and functioning, however, depended largely on the availability of
trained FWVs.  It should be remembered that when the first project was
initiated, (1975), there --as only one trained FWV for every Upazila health
complex, functioning from UHC headquarters and by the end of the second
project (1985) their availability increased to over 4000, with most of them
functioning at union levels.  Heanwhile, UNICEF had also mounted an
immunization program using the health assistants and BCG technicians; but
the coverage was extremely limited. Increasing inputs were also made for
control of diarrhea through the training of health and family planning
workers in ORT; local production of O.R. salts; and NGO utilization
(particularly BRAC) for training of village women in preparation and
administration of home-made O.R. solution. The purpose of the above
discussion is not to deny that there has been an imbalance between family
planning and MCH services, but only to demonstrate that efforts were on
hand to improve delivery of MCH services; a certain amount of delay was
inevitable due to delays in the establishment of the required
infrastructure.
8.6      In order to promote an accelerated delivery of MCH services during
the third plan period, the GOB established an MCH task force comprised of
national experts and donor representatives. The Task Force recommended a
National Strategy for a comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Program.
The report has been accepted by the Government and its recommendations
found a place in the third project. Accordingly, MCH services have now
been prioritized with the oblective of reducing infant and child mortality
over the next 5-10 years; planning and coordination committees have been
established at national, district and Upazila levels; GOB-donor agreement
exists on the services to be delivered, strategy for the delivery of
service, etc. The MCH component has been built into the third project to
ensure periodic review of its progress in implementation, identification



- 66 -
and remedying of problems. Adequate budgetary support also exists. Thus
the beginning of comprehensive MCH services has now been made and further
progress will depend upon the implementation of present services,
efficiency of functioning of the infrastructure and its expansion in a
phased manner over the next several years.
Contraceptive Mix
8.7      Another contentious issue that developed during the second project
period was that the contraceptive mix was getting skewed in favor of
sterilizations. A number of factors contributed to this perception,
particularly the proposed increase of sterilization acceptors in the
contraceptive mix from 251 in 1980 to 431 in 1985; the compensation system
to sterilization -ceptors and for referrals and service providers; and the
reported preference for sterilization by women with three or more children,
who belonged to age group of thirty and above. As for the contraceptive
mix, a greater stress on temporary methods is essential for many reasons.
First, even if all women with three or more children were to accept
sterilization, it will not be sufficient to bring down the birth rate to a
level to reach NRR one. Secondly, the young age of the population will
substantially add to the numbers of young eligible couples in the near
future and they would not like to accept sterilization. Thirdly, the
infant and child mortality are not likely to come down substantially before
1995 and serve as a motivation for younger couples to accept terminal
methods. As such, there is an urgent need to influence the younger age
groups to accept contraception, which calls for the promotion of temporary
methods on a much larger scale. Injectables have been popular as evidenced
from the NGO projects and need find better reflection in the governmental
programs. Some of these are reflected in the third project.
Organizational Issues
8.8      No other issue has attracted wider attention than the one related
to the organizational framework for the delivery of family planning and
health services. During negotiations, GOB had agreed upon a phased
integration of FP with health services at the Upazila level and below,
linked up with the establishment of UHFWCs and starting from July 1983; in
spite of this, a decision was taken in 1980 in favor of an immediate and
full integration of family planning with health service at Upazila level
and below. The overriding reason stated to have prompted the decision was
the anxiety on the part of the GOB to improve supervision of field workers,
lack of cooperation between the divisions in spite of a number of steps
taken, plans of both health and PCFPD to expand staff both horizontally and
vertically, thus diverting scarce resources which could be utilized for
service delivery. The governmental decision met with stiff resistance from
the staff of both the divisions and could not be effectively implemented in
practice. The Government, therefore, after considerable deliberations,
decided on a functional integration which provided for some administrative
links at Upazila levels to deliver FP, MCH and primary health care services
in a coordinated and complementary manner. Vhile functional integration
was generally acceptable, the establishment of a link between the UHFPO and
the UFPO posed insurmountable problems. Simultaneously, the Government
decided on the district level reorganization for the country as a whole,
with the creation of 64 districts and decentralization of powers to the



- 67 -
Upazilas. The Martial Law Administration reduced the district level staff
in family planning from three to one (the position of deputy director alone
was retained); it also abolished the positions of four divisional directors
at the national level created originally to improve supervision. Two other
grievances of the UFPOs also surfaced at this time; the first was the delay
in fulfillment of an earlier assurance given to them about the upgrading of
their position to class one, and the second was the dissatisfaction arising
out of the denial of the Upazila membership, which was given to UHFPO.
Controversies also raged over the drawing and disbursing powers of UPPO and
control over finances for sterilization, IUD, etc.
8.9      There was no easy way out of the difficulties; attitudinal and
socio-political factors, more than anything else, were the most formidable
and stood in the way of even reasonable solutions. However, the Government
moved ahead patiently, and over the last 3-4 years, sorted out most of the
problems. The establishment of a link between UHFPO and UFPO was sorted
out by making both the officers report to the Upazila chairman, who was
made the controlling officer. About 402 of posts of UPPOs have been
upgraded to class one and action to upgrade others is under way; the
membership of Upazila council was ultimately restored to UFPO; and job
functions were also defined with maximum possible clarity.
8.10     The idea of functional integration has also been criticized by
some, since the proposals have not worked satisfactorily enough over the
last three years. The Association, however, feels that any integration is
complicated under Bangladesh circumstances and will take time before
matters settle down. The reports on 'An Assessment of the Management of
the Bangladesh Population Program' by the Management Sciences for Health,
Massachussets, in 1984 and the "Report of the Task Force on PP Program
Performance and Strategies for Improvement', Ministry of Health and PP
(September 1986), have discussed organizational issues and come to the
conclusion that there is no easy alternative to functional integration;
they have made a number of suggestions to make it work better. Even at the
risk of repetition, a case for functional integration in Bangladesh context
is clear and is determined by many factors, significant among them being
interrelations of PP, MCH and PHC; medical support needed for FP services,
sharing of common physical facilities; difficulties encountered by PCW to
recruit medical officers of its own; need for effective utilization of the
large workforce; improving credibility for FP services; improving
supervision, team work, etc.
8.11     What is tberefore needed at this stage are persistent efforts to
make the present arrangements work, and towards this the Government should:
(a) avoid further organizational changes; (b) evolve measures to rebuild
the confidence of the staff through assurance of near stability of the
structure and facilitate interaction at all levels and between levels;
(c) sort out remaining gross anomalies in the administrative sphere, if any
(the powers of MO/MCH need to be looked into); (d) improve supervision of
the program; and (e) improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the
structure. A major aim for the next 3-4 years should be to build the
Upazila health complex into an effective work group and this will require
actions well beyond the administrative, financial and personnel aspects of
functional integration. The steps that require particular attention are
prioritization of services to be delivered, rational allocation of



- 68 -
functions among the health and FP teams, team training, integrated
supervision, development of integrated work routine for UHFWCs, team
planning, and development of an integrated recording and reporting system
and their use for local level program planning and evaluation. Attention
to the above factors will help create an environment that is conducive to
team work and will progressively reduce the influence of those factors that
promote divisive and compartmentalized thinking.
litilization
8.12     The performance audit by the OED has raised a number of issues on
the utilizatit'n of facilities built; underutilization of UHFWCs and UHCs
are evidenced from the evaluation studies and field visits and need
correction at the earltest. The audit has also questioned the
appropriateness of the design for UHFWCs in that they have been
overdesigned.  A similar observation has been made on a possible
countrywide overcapacity being created in terms of physical infrastructure
for training. Because of these observations, a reiteration of the factors
that influenced the formulation and design of facilities and their current
state of utilization is in order.
Design of UHFWCs
8.13     The URFWC is the cutting edge of the Government's program for the
delivery of family planning and primary health care services; it is also
designed to be staffed by a team of one medical assistant, one FWV and one
pharmacist.  The UB7WC has six rooms, three to be used by the MA, FWV and
pharmacist; a fourth room is designed for use by field workers as and when
they visit the union and also by their supervisors, FPA and AHI who are to
operate from the center; both EPA and AH$ have no other office
accommodations. There is another room for minor surgeries and emergency
admissions before the patients are shifted to UHCs; a recovery room with
two beds is attached to this. Experience in Bangladesh haa clearly
indicated that decentralization of sterilization facilities improves
sterilization acceptance; as such selected UHFWCs in each Upazila are being
used for conducting sterilization operations on a mini camp basis. Prior
to establishment of UHFVCs, sterilizations were carried out in the premises
of primary schools or union council officers; in most cases these were
dilapidated, which affected the quality of care. There is also the
proposal for screening of pregnancy cases and referring the high risk cases
to selected institutions for delivery. Under this proposal UHFWCs are most
likely to be the first source of referral for those cases that could be
handled by the mws; this would require the utilization of the room
designed for rinor surgeries, etc.   The waiting room is designed to be
used, additioaally, for training and meetings organized by multisectoral
agencies. All the above factors have been taken into consideration while
determining the size of UHFWCs which under the circumstances is quite
reasonable. Catering for anticipated requirements up to 2,000 is a
reasonable approach. It is also difficult, if not impossible, to start
small and add later within Bangladesh context. The Association does not
feel that a review of the design is needed at this stage. There is an
emerging opinion to post a medical officer to each UHFWC; both the
Association and cofinanciers feel that the posting of a medical officer to
UHFWC will distort the services rendered in favor of curative treatment.
If ultimately the Government decides to post a medical officer to the union
level, even the Present UHFWC may not satisfactorily meet the requirements.



- 69 -
8.14     Training Infrastructure.  The training infrastructure consists of
12 FWVTIs, 8 MATSs, 19 RTCs and NIPORT. It was a conscious decision to
train both FWVs and MAs in rented premises, to start with, and shift the
training to the new buildings when completed; in the absence of this
decision, it would not have been possible to develop the infrastructure
within such a short period. The training of FWVs and MAs have been
temporarily suspended and the premises are utilized for training of newly
recruited FWAs and HAs. While evaluating the size of the training
facilities created so far, a number of factors should be considered,
important among them beings (a) these are the only facilities available to
both the health and family planning wings for training of their workers;
(b) the field workers and first line supervisors of both the wings together
number about 36,000 at present and these numbers will be increased to about
50,000 by 1990; (c) the field workers who receive only two months of
initial training have to be retrained at periodic intervals to meet the
changing needs of the program; (d) field workers, comparable to FWAs and
HAs employed by many developing countries are 18 months trained nurse-cum-
midwives and 12 months trained health inspectors. This comparison will
only highlight the future training needs of FWAs and HAs; (e) it is quite
likely that the FWV-FWAs team will have to shoulder increasing
responsibilities for maternal and child health and this would mean
upgrading skills and knowledge of FWAs far beyond their present
capabilities, requiring heavy retraining; and (f) the 39 centers along with
NIPORT and NIPSOM have to be treated as a training system, for
traininglretraining of all staff from district and below. An evaluation
based on above criteria would indicate that the training infrastructure so
far created will not be excessive to the needs. The fact that a training
facility is created for a particular category should not stand in the way
of its utilization for training others; the approach should be flexible to
match training capacity with training needs.
UHFWC Utilization
8.15     A major criticism of the projects and the program is about the
current underutilization of UHFWCs; in fact, each facility could cater to a
much larger number of clients. One reason attributed to low utilization is
the location of the centers away from human settlements. Site selection
criteria had suggested that the sites should be close to human habitations
or growth centers, but might have been overlooked in some cases, in an
anxiety to procure donated land. The third project has already initiated
steps to correct this through a system of inspection and certification by
CHC engineers, based on strict guidelines. Lack of drugs has been quoted
as another reason: but the allocation of four DDS kits every year to each
center without break in supplies, should guarantee a reasonable flow of
drugs to the centers.  The full utilization of UHFWCs in fact, depends upon
other factors. Both the PWV and HA should develop a rapport and confidence
with the comunity, make them understand the nature of services available
and their relevance to improvement of individual and family health. The
experiences with family planning and immunization programs in the
subcontinent, including Bangladesh, have demonstrated that the
institutional services will not be fully utilized in the initial stages,
unless complemented and supplemented by outreach services. Rural women in
Bangladesh are not used to prenatal, natal and postnatal care; they do not



- 70 -
understand the significance or utility of these services. For the next few
years, both the FHV and HA should so develop their pattern of work as to
deliver a mix of institutional and outreach services. Similarly, FWAs
should identify pregnant women and encourage them to go to UHFWCs for care.
In spite of all governmental instructions. evaluation reveals that neither
MA of FWA move out of .he center.  The proposed satellite clinics are not
held. The supervision of UHFWCs should therefore be strengthened so that
the staff are given support and guidance to perform the expected functions.
The quality of services offered should also improve, and better human
relations should govern the relationship between staff and clients.
Experiences of Munshigang, ICDDRB and other projects have shown that the
UHFWC utilization could be considerably improved if some of the above steps
are taken. The establishment of a link between UHFWC and women's projects
will also improve their utilization. In short, the emphasis over the next
several years should be to improve the functioning of UHFWCs, through the
development of an appropriate T and V system which includes: (i' definition
of priority functions of the UHFWC, casks to be performed and their proper
distribution among the personnel concerned; (ii) development of monthly
work routine for the UHFWC to include the functions of not only MA, FWV,
AHI and PPA but also the HAs and FWAs; (iii) holding of monthly staff
meetings of the staff for review of the previous month's program and
programming for the next month (the meetings provide excellent
opportunities for group supervision); (iv) ensuring that the staff meetings
are attended invariably by senior staff from among FPO, MO (MCH) and FWV
(Sr.); (v) utilization of the regular staff meetings for training and
developing suitable Technical Modules for the purpose; (vi) building up the
satellite clinics into the work routine for the center and make them truly
functional; and, (vii) welding the UHFWC staff into an effective team.
System of Incentives
8.16     The GOB has created a system of payments to compensate clients,
those who refer clients, and service providers; in addition, rewards for
outstanding workers and punishment to non-performers were also announced in
September 1983. The payments system takes four formss compensation to
sterilization acceptors (Tk 175); IUD acceptors (Tk 15); payments to
doctors and support staff for sterilization (Tk 20 and Tk 12 respectively);
fees to workers and general public for referring sterilization and IUD
cases (Tk 45 for sterilization and 15 for IUD); awards to field workers who
exceed targets of contraceptive performance and punishment to those who
fail to achieve targets, including termination of service. The system
raised thorny issues among the donors, as some of them felt that the
combined effect of the system will impinge on the principle of voluntarism
in contraceptive choice, malpractices and coercion to accept sterilization,
neglect of follow-up, inadequate information on other methods, and above
all neglect of health responsibilities, particularly MCH. Some others have
been generally supportive of the system, as long as appropriate safeguards
against coercion, misinformation, neglect of other family planning methods,
and other health activities are maintained.
8.17     There has been no conclusive evidence to show whether some of the
payments are counter-productive. Survey of tubectomized women at clinics
managed by BAVS indicated that in 961 of the surveyed cases, cash or in-
kind compensation was not a reason for choosing sterilization. An



- 71 -
overwhelming (75Z) of respondents also reported that they were thinking
about getting sterilized for a month or more. The sterilization
surveillance teams, during their visits, had also not noticed evidence of
such coercion. USAID, which has been monitoring the system closely also
felt that options for sterilization are completely voluntary. A
government-funded study by the Program for the introduction and Adoption of
Appropriate Technology (PIAAT) had revealed some of the dangers of the
referral system in that clients get only limited information regarding
contraceptive methods and side effects. Governmental field workers
sometimes neglect follow-up of clients referred by general public. In
order to have more reliable and valid information on the subject, GOB
agreed, during negotiations for the third project, to carry out a detailed
study on client compensation, worker referral and service provider fees,
etc. The results of the study which was guided and supervised by two
internationally famous researchers, confirmed that sterilization decisions
in Bangladesh are firmly founded on the principle of informed choice and
also on the principle of prior thought about sterilization.  There was been
no evidence that sterilizations are performed on people who do not want to
limit their family size.  The study, however, found evidence of a
relatively high incidence of regret among women who experienced the death
of a child, subsequent to their sterilization, or who had only two
chlldren. The study also pointed out that the 'agent' who functions under
the referral system is a potential threat to voluntarism. The role of
agents needs review, either to modify the system or phase it out. The
major issues have now been reduced to two, viz, (1) the need to discourage
people with only two children for sterilization; and if they still want to
get sterilized, strengthen the follow-up services for client and family;
(2) modify the system of referrals through agents. The Government is
taking corrective action.
8.18     As for rewards and punishment for workers, the PCW has either
withdrawn or is not enforcing the orders of punitive action proposed for
those who fail to meet their targets in family planning. The Government
has also expressed its willingness to modify the system of awards to
include performance in family planning and MCH. In fact, they convened a
number of meetings of donor-representatives in 1984 to evolve performance
criteria; the USAID made available short-term technical assistance to
arrive at a feasible solution. However, the discussion did not produce
conclusive and feasible proposals. The issue is complicated for want of
clarity in definition of job-functions, selection of definitive function in
FP and MCH as performance indicators, difficulties in measurement, grading,
etc. The present recording and reporting system at the field level are not
adequate to get accurate figures of performances. Probably, these have to
wait until a clearer idea of priority functions in FP and MCH emerges, and
the finalization and introduction of the integrated recording and reporting
system, now under pretest. Though announced, the awards are yet to be
implemented and the field workers complain about it.
Quality of Contraceptive Services
8.19     As stated in para. 3.64, the quality of sterilization operations
raised important issues at the beginning of the second project. Apart from
the relatively high mortality, what vas important was that both the
morbidity and mortality were from preventable causes. Since the



- 72 -
continuation of the same level of mortality might have had an adverse
effect on the acceptance of sterilization in the long run, GOB quickly
responded and agreed to set up the Sterilization Surveillance Teams (SSTs);
they also involved the World Health Organization (WHO) in the recruitment
and management of the four expatriate doctors in the SST.. Annual review
of the function of the system was also undertaken which showed that the
system has produced beneficial results. The Government has since agreed,
under the third project, to extend the system to cover other clinical
contraceptive services particularly of IUD and injectables. The SSTs have
been redesigned as Family Planning Clinical Supervision Teams (FPCST); they
are being strengthened through the addition of nursing personnel.
Cofinancing and Donor Collaboration
8.20     The performance audit by OED of the first project raised a number
of issues regarding cofinancing, donor coordination, supervision, etc. The
resolution of these issues after detailed consideration involves an element
of judgement; there can be no single corre.; solution to the issues.
Whatever solution is arrived at will depend mainly on the circumstances
prevailing within Bangladesh and the donor agencies. The interest of the
program should be the overriding consideration and the Audit feels this has
been sacrificed to some extent to attract cofinancing.
8.21     Tha Audit feels that by the time the third project was formulated,
ideological considerations among donors became more pronounced and diverse,
making recommendations within a single project more difficult. The
dialogue with the Government became more constrained, and the Bank was
sometimes perceived as supporting what was not essentially good for
Bangladesh. While these observations are justified to some extent, it
should not be forgotten that the formulation of both the second and third
projects were the result of a greater degree of participative action
between GOB and donor agencies than the first project. In fact, the
participatory approach has improved overtime. Considerable inputs were
made by the Bank and some donor agencies even during the formulation of the
population sector plan for the Second and Third Five-Year Plans; this
resulted in a narrowing of perceptions on the input. The projects were
carved out of the plan proposals. The main ideological issue that divided
the donors and the Government was the one related to the system of
compensation and referral payments; on balance between FP and MCH, there
was no difference of opinion on the need for stronger MCH services, the
issue was one of timing and how?  Even the recommendation of the Task Force
on a National Strategy for MCH was the result of joint thinking between GOB
and donors. The criticism of an inadequate dialogue with the CGvernment is
therefore not justified; a look at the project components would also reveal
that they reflect GOB priority needs under Population Control.
8.22     It is true that the Bank's supervision system did not meet in
full, the information needs of all cofinancing agencies; in a way, no
supervision system can cater to the needs in full. Some of the donor
agencies made it up by having their own independent review; though this
might have taxed local institutional capacity to some extent, the situation
would have been much worse if each one of the donors had their own separate
projects and supervision mechanisms.



- 73 -
8.23     The Audit has also raised issues regarding she  integrated* nature
of the population projects, especially how well they are integrated in
terms of population efforts and financing. That the population program of
Bangladesh and the Bank financed projects are integrated in terms of its
design cannot be in doubt. It comprises proved elements of both 'Family
Planning' and 'Beyond Family Planning' measures, viz, delivery of FP
services, diverse comunuication activities, elements aimed at reducing
infant and child mortality, those aimed at improving the status of women.
While improving female literacy in the long run is built into Bank financed
primary education projects, an element of non-formal education for women is
built .nto the population projects. The projects also expect that
synergistic effects between the various elements of the program will
produce both short-term and long-term impects, greater than what is
possible by attention to a single element. While the PCR of the first
project stated that the field programs of different ministries involved in
population have not been knitted into an effective network for synergistic
interaction, continuous efforts are being made to strengthen the
interaction. The functioning of UHFWCs as planned will improve
coordination between FP, NCH and PHC; the PWAs are already participating in
the comunuication program; steps have been initiated in the third project
for better knitting together of the comunication activities; linkages are
proposed between %CW and women's projects at the point of services
delivery. The Regional Training Centers have taken up responsibility for
training of multi-sectoral staff, which might lead to more effective team
work. While continuing and greater attention to above will help, the lotg-
term synergistic effects will be felt only when infant and child mortality
starts coming down and when the status of the female population improves.
There are already indications that contraceptive acceptance in villages
covered by women projects are higher than those in control villages and
that fertility of those participat4ng 4-ia the women is coming down faster.
8.Z4     On the financing side, while coordination is essential,
cofinancing need not be the sole mech%anism for achieving this. lHowever, a
general agreement among the donor comunity on the essential elements of
the program, and donor financing of the critical elements either through
cofinancing or separately is highly desirable. Looking back, it is
doubtful whether the commonality of approach now prevailing would have been
possible, but for the cofinancing arrangements worked out by the Bank
during the first project and continued tbereafter for the subsequent
projects. Coordination by other means, without cofinancing, might not hav'
produced the same degree of results. It is quite possible that ideological
considerations might have been the predominant factor governing the choice
of their project, if the ten major donors had dealt with the Goverrment
separately in their fiancing of population sector. The balancing in
financing of the critical elements also would have created problems.
Experience reveals that, in spite of problems arising therefrom,
cofinancing is worth pursuing and serves the larger interests of the
program.
Supervision
8.25     Bank supervision of the project continued rather intensively
during the second project implementation; the size of the project and
implementation problems required this. In consultation with the



- 74 -
cofinanciers, it was agreed that there will be two bupervision missions in
a year, one in the beginning of the year consisting of representatives of
Bank as well as all representatives of cofinanciers representing tsieir
headquarters, and the second a Bank mission in the middle of the year.  it
vws left to the option of local offices of cofinancing agencies to
participate in the second supervision mission or not. For the total number
of supervision missions during the period 1980-85, see Annex XXVI. The
suggestion made by OED that part of supervision responsibilities be
delegated to the field was implemented particularly on procurement.
Another suggestion to involve donor agencies in supervision of coLponents
they fiiance is being increasingly adopted in practice. The FRG now takes
responsibility for periodic review of the training components they finence;
the Canadians for the W men's Projects; the British for Innovative Projects
they financeg both the Norwegians and Dutch for the Management Development
Unit. In addition, the office of the Population Specialist at the Resident
Mission was strengthened by the addition of one locally recruited
Population Project Officer. The office has been further strengthened
during the third project by the addition of a full-time MCH Specialist,
which position is financed fully by the cofinanciets. Apart from the
annual combined review mission, other supervision missions are now smaller
in size.
Project Design and Bank Strategy
8.26     The Bank's approach to the project design, under the first project
has been questioned, at least in some respects; the advantages and
limitations of various approaches have also been discussed. Whatever be
the case, it is felt that the *integrated* approach chosen for the
Bangladesh program still remains a sound judgement. In spite of
innumerable difficulties, the approach has helped to build up a fairly
extensive infrastructure for delivery of FP and PHC services; established
women's development program; and an intensified communication activities.
The contraceptive prevalence rate among eligible married women has gone up
to about 30Z, not an insignificant achievement. Broadly satisfactory
policies are in place in both the population and health sector. Hence,
instead of debating on the design of the project, the continuity of which
has been maintained through the three projects, the Bank strategy for
Bangladesh for the future should concentrate on the following issuess
(a) The multi-sectoral program, which is currently in place, is based
upon the best information available in late 19709 and what was
then considered best for Bangladesh.  Experience over the past ten
years does not necessitate a reconsideration of the program and
its main strategy. However, it calls for the adoption of *Action-
Research' principles in the implementation of the program, meaning
thereby a continuous evaluation of the program and application of
correctives to problems identified. This approach calls for
establishing a fairly satisfactory system for monitoring,
evaluation and research, and the major elements of the system are
in place. Regular contraceptive prevalence surveys at 2-3 yearly
intervals are being carried out; PDEU has significantly increased
its capability for evaluation of programlproject components; after
initial delays, the Second Bangladesh Fertility Survey is on



- 75 -
ground.  What is necessary over the next several years is to
strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capability, analyze the
results of monitoring and evaluation decide which changes in
design and strategy are needed, and incorporate the findings into
the project.
(b) There has been general agreement on the physical and personnel
infrastructure at Upazila level and below for delivery of health
and FP services. Though not fully covered, a fairly vast
infrastructure is in place. The Bank strategy now should be
twofold: to assist the Covernment complete the establishment of
the infrastructure by the end of the fourth plan period and work
with the Government to achieve much more from the infrastructure
already established. The under-utilization of facilities should
be corrected.
(c) The Bank should assist Eangladesh to achieve NRR one during
2000-2005; any delay in its achievement is going to be highly
detrimental to GOB's economic development efforts in the long run
and will have adverse effects on the quality of its future
population. With a little more efforts, it should be possible for
GOB to achieve CPR of 352 by 1990. An analysis should then be
made in consultation with GOB to decide whether any additional
approaches of demand creation over the existing ones will be
necessary to achieve CPR of 60X by the year 2000. If additional
approaches are needed, the Bank should mobilize financial support
for their implementation; and special attention should be made to
improve female literacy through the Bank funded Primary Education
Projects.
(d) The NGO sector has been a very useful supplement and complement to
the governmental pLogram. While their activities are generally
limited to the urban areas, they have useful functions to perform
in the rural areas. The Bank strategy should be to assist GOB
delineate areas where NGOs can be effective and seek their
partnership in the national population efforts.
(e)  The Bank also should start a dialogue with the Government over the
next few years on how tc. extend essential health care to
Bangladesh's largely underserved population at affordable costs to
the Government and individuals.
(f) The Bank should also continue to adopt the participatory approach,
with GOB and cofinanciers, in daveloping programs for the
population an' health sectors for the Fourth Five-Year Plan and
subsequent ones. It should work to continue the cofinancing
arrangements so that financial assistance to the program is
assured on the required scale; such assistance will be required at
least until 2000 AD. Major donors, other than those in the
cofinmncing circle, should also be drawn into the participatory
approach. The Bank leadership in project formulation, financing
and donor coordination should be maintained; however, efforts
should be made to transfer this responsibility to GOB in an
increasing measure.



- 76 -
(g) Experience has shown that a stable organizational framework for
delivery of PP and hiealth services is needed. An organizational
chart that looks attractive and efficient on paper may not be the
one that will work best in Bangladesh. Attitudes and ability or
otherwise to control resources seem to be overriding
considerations of an acceptable organizational structure. The
present stability should be maintained and improved upon;
attention should be paid to correcting gross anomalies where they
exist. The strategy should be to build the present staff into an
effective team, by concentrating on those factors that promote
team planning and team work and by eliminating to the extent
ossible, those that create divisive tendencies.



- 77 -
IX. LESSONS LEARNT AND RECOMWENDATI INS
9.1      The project implementation was a learning process by itself; a
many useful lessons were learnt, which were incorporated in the design of
the third project as can be seen from Sections III to VIII. A few of-her
lessons which have wider applications to project design and implementation
are:
(a) Integrated projects wh'.ch are somewhat complex in design should have
in-built capacity of a high order for project monitoring, evaluation
and research. The findings from monitoring and evaluation should be
carefully reviewed and results fed into the program/project planning
and implementation strategy. A flexible approach is to be adopted
both by the Bank and the GOB during project implementation.
(b) Population control projects, whether designed as an integrated
project or a larger number of separate projects, usually cut across
various Government ministries and will require a high degree of
coordination among implementing agencies. Conscious efforts should
be made not only to build structures for coordination but make them
work.   A clear definition of roles and responsibilities, training
for participating agencies and their staff, periodical reviews to
assess progress and resolution of problems and, above all,
involvement of participating agencies during the plannIng stage
itself are useful steps to make coordination more effective.
[c) A participatory approach between the Government, Bank and donor
agencies during various phases of planning, definition of program
strategy and program/project development will be highly useful. The
initiative and leadership should come from the Government.
Id) The position of population specialist in the Resident Mission has
been useful not only to bring about donor coordination and project
monitoring, but equally to provide technical assistance to Government
in the population and related sectors.
(e) The project design should anticipate and provide for measures to
improve the management aspects of the program/project and fuller
utilization of facilities created, as in the case of UHFWCs.
Improvement in management practices cannot be achieved in a one-shot
process; continuous effects spread over a period of years is
necessary.
(f) As mentioned in the first project PCR, population control program
should be viewed in a longer time frame of at least 20-25 years and
persistent efforts are needed to achieve results. When once the
critical areas for support are identified, Government should be
assured of continuous support in these areas.

X. CONCLUSIONS
10.1     The second project has helped GOB to establish a viable populacion
control program with its major components of FP and MCH services delivery,
commnication, training, monitoring, evaluation and research and women's
development program. More than 5O0 of all rural unions have institutional
facilities for delivery of FP, MCH and PHC services; male-female teams of
field workers exist in all the 13,500 rural wards. About 25Z of married women
within the reproductive age group were practicing contraception by 1985. GOB-
donor interaction increased over the years resulting in the development of
near-common perception in many program areas.
lO.t     The programlproject implementation has not been without problems.
Coordination between the various project elements needs to be improved
considerably to achieve synergistic effects. The utilization of union-level
and Upazila-level facilities needs to be improved. Management practices at
all levels need upgrading. Further changes in the organizational structure
should be avoided and stability of the present structure assured. Effective
program implementation requires close and continuous attention spread over a
number of years; dramatic results cannot be expected. Persistence and
perseverance should be the keywords for action; there should be no room for
pessimism and inaction.
