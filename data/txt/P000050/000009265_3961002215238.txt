Aolunt:                 SDR 30 million (US$41 million equivalent)
linns:                  Standard IDA terms, with 40-year mahtrity
Co-Financing:           Sweden (SIDA), France (CCCE), Denmark (DANIDA)
arojec Obiectives:
Ihe objectives are to:
(1) preseve or restore srface access to large portions of the country by road and rail, and restore
port operations to support economic activities;
(2) promote transport sector employment, particularly by training small contractors in labor-intensive
rad maintenance;
(3) strengthe sectoral institutions, eqpecially to manage contracts for roatd works, and operate the
CFL railway and the port of Lobito; and
(4) support sectoal policy implementation.
The project would have the following components:
(1) AJoqdand bri4ggm2nen1 to facilitate the early reopening of the primary road network,
aiming at the urgent rehabilitation and preservation of the paved-highway network, including:
* repaL or replacement of about twenty five bridges, in strstegic locations on te main road
network;
* resurfacing or periodic maintenance, including rehabilitation of destroyed sectdons of about
700 lklometer of the most important paved roads to stop their further deterioration, which
would requi cosdy rehabiitation to repair,
* consultant services for supervision of woks;
* detailed design studies for futer road rehabilitation; and
* creation and operation of a training and contract _magement unit for labor-intensive road
maintenance to promote small contractors and generate employment in road mantenac.

(2)                co cop nst o tising of technical stance, and emergency repai ani provision of spa
pauls and equipment for the port of Lobito to improve port orations and provide adeouate port
eevices for a region wita high potential in agriculre.
3) A mleincluding institutional and finanial assistance to satisfy cureat demand and
improve oprationl performaco and services.
(4) An mstihutionad develoiment componet mincluding tanort studies, project coordination, and
assistance for the impleman of acton plans to improve the performance of the commercial
agencies benefiting from the project.
I}enfits and Ridks
The project would have considerable economic and social imnacts by providing basic tansport
services to the regions with the highest agricultural potential, thus allowing populations who fied the
war to retum to those areas; alleviating the need for later reconstton of the roads; decreasing the
transport costs on major arteries, thus benefiting numi and urban poor, and inrsg employment
in road minteace. Although envi    tally benign, the project would help improve the roads'
direct environmental impact through improved drainap and by removal of wrecks.
TMh risks result from the govemment's limited capacity to provide local financing for the project,
and weak institutiona capacity to manage the project. Unfamiliaity of project staff with Eunk.
procedures, and a potentially unsable political eanvirment also could cause sigificant dela;.
Technical assistance, the introduc.i  of cost recovery meases, an eady stwrt in procurwma_. and
use of contact  to execute most of the project should reduce these risks.
Proiee Cos
The total cost is estimatd at the equivalent of &Sout US$64.9 million, witi, 77 percert-US$SO.1
m;ilion- in foreign exchange. The detiled cost estimatse in prices as of January 1992 are shown

1.01          Angola, one of the largest countries in sub-Saharan Africa, has an area of 1.2
million square kilometers and a population of 10.6 million, growing at 2.8 percent per year. With
a GNP per capita estimated at US$620 (1989), Angola is wealthier than most sub-Saharan African
countries 1/. Angola also has excellent long-term development potential because of fertile land
and abundant mineral resources. Since Independence in 1975, however, the economy has become
highly distorted by the mass exodus of skilled personnel, and by civil war with rationing and
deficient economic policies. The oil industry, developed as an enclave, has grown rapidly and
now represents about half of the GNP. By contrast, the non-oil sectors have performed poorly;
growth has been negative and output is significantly less today than in the early 1970s.
Manufacturing industries are crippled by a lack of raw materials, spare parts, and maintenance.
Commerce is hurt by rationing, state ownership, and rigid government controls, but informal
markets do flourish. Agricultural production and distribution have been severely curtailed by the
civil war. Although Angola was an important net exporter of agricultural products before
Independence, in recent years it has become increasingly dependent on food improrts and food aid
to supply urban populations which have burgeoned because of the civil war.
1.02         War has been the dominant fact of life in Angola for decades. In 1991, however,
there was- encouraging movement toward peace. On May 31, 1991, a peace agreement was
signed by the two main rival parties. The comprehensive agreement set a detailed timetable for
integration of the two armies into a national Angolan army, for the opening of the political
system, and for the organization of multiparty elections at all levels of government before the end
of 1992. So far, the process has been implemented well and respected by all sides. If successful,
the peace and democratization process would substantially improve the prospects for better
economic management-including the reallocation of a large share of public resources from
military to development uses.
1.03         In 199 1, the government initiated a process of economic reform. The government
implemented related reforms, focusing on the foreign exchange rate, public sector wages, and a
reduction of consumer subsidies. The official exchange rate was devalued to a base rate of 180
New Kwanza per dollar, and in April 1992 to -a rate of NkzSS0. In addition, banks were
authorized to buy and trade foreign currency at the free market rate-about Nkzl800 in April
1992. The government also discontinued ration cards for public employees-except the subsidized
distribution system for the five basic goods. Other measures included an increase in the
minimum salary and cuts in the personal income tax. Although it wiUl take time to assess the
effects of these reforms on the enormous economic distortions, the measures are clearly important
and in the right direction.

1.04          In addition to the wae-induced migration from the countryside in the east to the
coastal cities in the west, and the large. loss of skilled Portuguese settlers at Independence, a state
interventionism explains Angola's poor economic performance. State interventionism is evident
In traditional transport functions, but also in activities such as trucking, driving schools and spare
part distribution. Although some govermmental institutions need strengthening, a gradual
government disengagement from many of these activities is desirable. Because the private sector
already participates significantly in some of these activities, the immediate reform need is to avoid
government preference for parastatals. More realistic exchange rates are beginning to resolve
some of these constraints. For exLnple in trucking and internal air transport, about half of the
goods and passengers already are carried by orivate operators. To manage the continued
transition to plivate sector control, private sector expansion and the corresponding contraction
of the public sector must be clearly linked. Improved infrastructure is a key to this process.
1.05         The population largely bec:-ise of the war, has left large parts of the main
agricultural areas in the hinterland of the country, a situation that created severe population
pressures in a few coastal ciies. This urban growth has been most dramatic in the relatively safe
large cities along the coast. It is estimated that the population of Luanda, the capital city, tripled
from 450,000 to 1.3 million from 1975 to 1985, and the Lobito-Benguela conurbation grew from
about 200,000 at Independence to more than 800,000 today. Lobito and Benguela were separate
cities a few years ago, but the war brought a proliferation of small communities around the citiesi
and rapid, unplanned settlement in the low hills parallel to the coast. T'his urban settlement
problem is another reason why adequate conditions-and communications-for resettlement in the
interior need to be restored.
1.06          A recent economic review of Angola has defined the actions and priorities for
economic recovery (Report No. 8906-ANG of June 29, 1990). Studies by the Southern Africa
Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC) have further identified the problems of
transport infrastructure. Needed infrastructure rehabilitation is a main concern; the task requires
long lead times and careful preparation.
B. Project Background
1.07          Angola's *ong-lasting civil strife destroyed much of its urban and transport
infrastructure. Inadequate funding for maintenance and rehabilitation caused further damage.
Controlled prices, ineffective cost recovery, and unclear institutional responsibilities-causing a
loss of local technical arl managerial capacity-made the situation worse and decay and
decapitalization are widespi-ad in the sector. Infrast .-ire inadequacies are now a major
bottleneck to economic development and improvemic      ae quality of life. Thus, restored
capacity and projects to make infrastructure operatir   ;-effective are urgentlv needed.
1.08          The adequacy and reliability of Angola's infrastructure-highways, ports,
railways, and facilities in major population centerb-are fundamental to the country's economic
recovery. Angola's earlier well-developed transport and urban infrastructure fostered the
development of significant agricultural production and processing, and other industry and
commerce. In addition to the destruction of transport infrastructure associated with civil war,
large maintenance backlog has resulted from insufficient institutional capacity coupled with
minimal physical and financial resources in the last fifteen years. Rehabilitation instead of



3 -
outright reconstruction is still possible with a substantial cost advantage. Ihe cotuitry needs
immediate help through sizable rehabilitation investments, organizational restructuring, human
resource development, management and oparations improvement, and other related inputs.
1.09          The Bank's overall strategy is to support a rapid economic transition and help
improve basic access to social services for most Angolans, while ensurL'ng that the country's
environment is protected. This would be accomplished by striving for fisc 1 improvement and
financial stabilization; promoting policies and programs to channel investments into econo aic
growth and diversification and to improve social services; creatin,g an enabling environment for
private investment, including the rehabilitation and reconstructlon of key infrastructure; and
assisting human resource development and capacity building of essential institutions.
Infrastructure-transport In particular-is a key to the early part of this restructuring. The road
and rail systems are needed especially to help revive agricultural production, and allor a
reduction in the need for imported food and a resumption of agricultural exports. There    tu@
Bank is supporting a short-term emergency program for these systems for the next two to  ee
years, and preparing a long-term reconstruction phase of the five to eix years until the year 2000.
1.10          Infrastructure maintenance and reconstruction and the resumption of stalled
transport operations have been made possible by the May 1991 peace agreement. Salvaging and
rehabilitating the most important parts of the transport infrastructure to restore normal operations
is clearly a high priority for Angola. These activities should begin as rapidly as possible,
coordinated to make the best use of all potential resources. The Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Engineering (IRE) project approved by the Board in July 1991 is helping Angola prepare a
medium-term program of infrastructure rehabilitation. The IRE also helps with immediate
improvement to the ports of Luanda and Namibe and their related railways. For the overall
recovery process to be initiated over the entire country, it is now vital that immediate access be
provided to other main productive areas.  The proposed project is therefore needed to
complement the IRE project for the sector's most urgent needs.

U        .. THE TRANSOT SCT
A. 3    ransr SLvste.m
2.01          The present configuwation of Angola's basic infrastructure-though not its
condition- has been unchangw4 since Independence.  In 1975, the infrastructure was a
comprehensive mix of rail, highway, air, and shipping. A distinctive, rail-port corridor system-
northern, central and southern-supported by feeder road networks predominated. Additional
highways provided basic north-south provincial links, and access to national borders. During the
war, the air sector, which linked the key provincial cities, was dhe only dependable means of
passenger and light-freight transit over much of the country, because of security risks.
2.02         In 1990, Angola's transport infrastructure comprised 75,000 kilometers (km) of
roads and tracks, 2,500 km of railways, 6 ports, and 31 airports. An estimated 57,000 :ootor
vehicles, 40 locomotives, 11 long-distance ships, and 10 short-haul vessels, and 21 &rcraft
operated infrequently and inefficiently. The rail and port systems previously ran eastward from
Lnanda to Malanje (a distance of 430 km) In the north; Lobito to Luau (1,350 km), on the
Zairian border in the central heardand; and Namibe to Menongue (750 kin) in the south. Regions
are linked to these corridors by 8,000 km of paved highway and 12,300 km of secondary roads,
which-with the air services-provide the main means of north-south travel. Coastal shipping
accounts for 180,000 tons of freight between the four main ports and has the potential for
substantial growth. The Cabinda enclave is dominated by the oil industry and the non petroleum
infrastructure is small.
2.03         Responsibility for the transport sector is shared by two ministries: the Ministry
of Public Works and Urban Development (MINOPU) and the Ministry of Transport and
Communications (MINTEC).  Of these, the first ministry is responsible for the road
infrastructure, while MINTEC has the responsibility for all other transport activities. MINTEC
has directorates for railways, air transport, road transport, and ports and maritime transport.
MINTEC is also responsible for the transport parastatals-20 trucking and bus companies, the
agency for transport equipment and spare parts (Abamat), car and truck repair shops (Manautos)
and driving schools (Condautos), four railways (of which one is largely privately owned), the
three main ports, three shipping lines (Angonave, Cabotang, and Secil Maritima), and the
national airline.
2.04         MINTEC's statistics show recent total freight traffic handled by parastatals
amounting to about 2 million tons, with about another million tons moved by private operators.
In 1990, the number of passengers carried was some 53 million, most of them-86%-by bus.
In terms of passenger-km the situation was very different; bus services produced some 306
million passenger-km, rail transport 259.4 million passenger-km, while air transport contributed
990 million passenger-km. The total income for MINTEC-controlled transport operators in 1990
was an estimated Kz21,389 million (about US$356 million at the official exchange rate of Kz61)
per U.S. dollar, but substantially less at parallel market rates of exchange). Of that total, 25
percent came from road services and 42 percene from air transport, with the remainder divided
among the other modes. Most transport modes covered direct operating costs-with the major
exception of the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB).



B. Road Infrastructure
2.05         Argola's highway infrastructure remains essentially unchanged in coverage since
Independence, except for a 250-km stretch of new coastal road from Luanda to Sumbe. The civil
war in subsequent years caused the departure of most of the skilled Portuguese highway
personnel-and the continuing deterioration of the highway network.
2.06         Yet an efficient highway system is critical for Angola's economic recovery and
further develcpment. The roads provide the basic economic, administrative, and strategic links
between the national capital, the provincial capitals, ar. the municlpal centers. These roads also
provide access to railroads, to port and airport facilities, and to international border crossings.
2.07         In 1990, Angola's main highway netwolk totalled about 20,300 km, of which
8,000 were paved, and 4,000 were surfaced with gravel. In that year, the highway system
carried about two-thirds of the nation's cargo, and most short-haul passenger movements were
by road. Known as the "National Basic Highway Network", these roads are the main
responsibility of the Angola Higlway Institute (INEA), the new national highway agency created
as of November 1990 under MINOPU. The structure of the new agency resembles that of the
former autonomous highway commission of Angola which was abolished in 1975. For fifteen
years, responsibility for highways shifted among several government departments and ministries.
The civil war made the highways unmanageable.
2.08          INEA was created following a study by a Portuguese consulting firm retained
by the Ministry of Construction (the previous Ministry of Public Works and Urban
Development). INEA's staff consists of one graduate engineer, a technical specialist, an
expatriate technician, nine engineers, a geologist, an economist, a lawyer, nine technicians, and
nineteen administrative support staff from the existing staff of MINOPU and other government
agencies and enterprises.
2.09         The study considering INEA's creation concluded that the new highway agency
would need 2,570 employees to rehabilitate and mairn ain roads using its own staff. Most of them
would be based in pl jvincial offices, with 150 in the Luar"a headquarters, and 280 in regional
offices. The survey found that existing qualified candidates could fill only a small portion of the
needed positions. This lack of qualified candidates was beyond the reach of a human resource
development effort, so an alternative approach was needed.
2.10         INEA was created to manage the planning, design, construction, rehabilitation,
and maintenance of Angola's highway network. The long-term goal is to become an autonomous
organization, fully funded from user charges collected mostly through increased fuel taxation that
the government is considering. Because policy makers also expect most highway maintenance
and rehabilitation work to be performed by contract, INEA would not hire staff or buy equipment
for in-house operations. Until the contracting industry develops sufficiently in Angola, however,
INEA would have to contract with foreign contractors and the execution of some routine
maintenance may be left to INEA's in-house labor and equipment. Ultimately, INEA's staff
would consist only of engineers and other professionals, surveyors, laboratory technicians, and
materials and construction inspectors.



-6 -
2.11         Given these operational constraints and objectives, the recently approved IRE
project (para 1.10) provides for consultants to conduct a highway management study and prepare
a highway rehabilitation and maintenance progr;am for the National Basic Highway Network. The
project will also have INEA set up the departirents it requires. The consultants are to further
identify ways that INEA can improve management and operations. Another objective will be to
initiate a staff development program to train INEA personnel and staff of local road contractors.
The IRE component for the National Basic Highway Network also envisions final design and
preparation of tender documents for the complete reconstruction of high-priority road sections-
estimated at about 700 km-to be identified in the above program (in addition to this proposed
project).
C. Railways and Ports
2.12         The railways and three main ports of Angola are all under MINTEC with a
separate National Directorate for Railways and another for ports and maritime transport. The
railway directorate is responsible for the two main railways fully owned by the government-
Caminho de Ferro de Luanda (CFL), and Camninho de Ferro de Mocamedes (CFM and the state
ownership of the Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB). 2/ 3/
2.13         The Lobito Transport Corridor. The port of Lobito serves central Angola-
including more than one-third of the population-and is the only port with an international rail
connection. Before Independence the port was one of the most important shipping terminals of
south-central Africa. By 1973, port traffic exceeded 2.6 million tons, more than half of Angola's
total shipping tonnage. Transshipment of minerals from Zaire and Zambia-especially copper,
magnesium, zinc, and cobalt-was 60 percent of port traffic.
2.17         The CFB railway covers 1,336 Iam, and extends from the port of Lobito to
Benguela, 33 km down the coast, then crosses the Angolan plateaus serving 99 market towns on
the way to the mineral belts of Zaire and Zambia. Freight rail activity has been severely
curtailed since Independence because of the civil war. The railway is closed to international
traffic, and national traffic-mostly in Benguela province-has fallen by about 70 percent to some
230,000 tons per year. Only recentdy have trains been allowed to pass at very slow speeds on
the 400 km of line from Lobito. Reactivation of the Lobito transport corridor is a major
government objective, to provide immediate access to what used to be one of the most important
areas for agriculture. IDA and other donors are actively helping to prepare an important
rehabilitation program for the corridor. This program is now under study by foreign consultants
financed by IDA under a separate PPF. Benguela-somewhat smaller than Lobito-is the
provincial capital and has a small airport that serves the two cities. A recendy built military
airport could serve international traffic if needed.
2.18         The Luanda transport corridor. This includes the port of Luanda and a 423-km
railway line to Malanje (CFL). Since the war started in 1975, only in the last few months has
2 See Annex 5.1
3 See Annex 16 for a summary of the financial performance of railways and other MINTEC
parastatals, and the main traffic flows for the railways and the three main ports-both for .1990.



-7 -
somewhat regular rail service been established from Luanda to the inland teminal of the CFL.
The main coffee-growing area of the province of Uige is north of this line and a cotton-producing
area Is around Malanje. Tbe total export volume of coffee, cotton, and sisal from these areas
exceeded 400,000 tons before Independence, but by 1590 had declined to some 75,000 tons.
During 1991 the line became operati" nal in its entirety. Tariffs were increased and management
reorganized. In 1992, the CFL is covering its costs for the first time since 1984, traffic of unit
trains of containers has started and contracts already signed are straining the carrying capacity
of today's CFL.
2.19         TDNaMibe trn=rt cgridr. This includes fhe port of Namube (formerly
Mogamedes) and a 756-km railway mainline between the port and Menongue-of which only a
400-km section to Matala is now operating. This railway-still called Caminho de Ferro de
Mocamedes (CFM)-carried several million tons of export iron ore to a special ore terminal
(Sacomar) near Namibe. This terminal is not in use now, but could be reactivated relatively
quicldy. CFM's current traffic is mostly products to or from the important agricultural area
around Lubango-some 200 km from Namibe.
D. Sector Ilsues and Strate
2.20         The transport sector faces several critical issues.
Q)    Sectoral institutions lack technical proficiency. Investment planning,
budgeting and programming are weak across the sector and will be
strengthened under the IRE; a three-year rolling public investment
program for the transport sector and an annual work program for IEA
will be prepared yearly by November 1 and submitted to IDA for its
review, comments and agreement (para.4.01 vi); maintenance of
infrastructure and equipment, operations, and enforcement of appropriate
regulations (especially truck axle load regulations, see pam. 4.01 iii) are
weak.
(ii)   The sector must contend with demands that far exceed its technical
capacities and physical capacities including those which might be
currently under-utilized. The needs for repair of infrastructure destroyed
by the civil war are huge. These repairs which will, at best, take a
decade to complete are hampered by land mines on roads, railway tracks,
and bridge sites. De-mining of road surfaces and railway lines has taken
place but will need to be thoroughly completed at all project sites before
the proposed works are carried out (see paras 3.19 and 4.01 v).
(iii)   Cost recovery and resource mobilization are inadequate-fuel taxation is
very limited-end price and incentive mechanisms are distorted.
(iv)   There is a lack of foreign exchange with which to purchase spare parts.
(v)    Regulations are restrictive, and property rights uncertain.



-8 -
2.21          The proposed strategy for the infrastructure recovery has the following elements,
by order of priority: (i) removal of identified bottlenecks to economic activity, which should
provide the quickest development response; (ii) deregulation and market liberalization, where
appropriate; (iii) cost recovery and price or tariff decontrol to ensur' that investments are
sustainable; (iv) mobilization of resources for the sector at levels con. dcdble with the current
economic situation and prospects; (v) maintenance of existing infrastructure assets; (vi) recovery
and eehabiitation of existing infrastructure in response to expansion of economic activity; (vii)
control of excessive axle weight; and (viii) further expansion of existing capacity, if and when
required.
2.22          The IRE and the proposed project together provide for in-depth study of these
issues, and preparation of long-term strategies to address them. As a complement to IRE, and
in addition to the project's physical investment component, the proposed project will provide for
a first phase of institutional and poliLy improvement-which may take nearly ten years. The
project will also implement axle weight control for which a proposal was agreed upon during
negotiations (paras 4.01 iii and 4.02 i). The government has also prepared, and as a condition
of effectiveness will sign, a Letter of Transgort Sector Policy (para 4.02 iii), containing general
principles such as: (a) maintenance of newly rehabilitated infrastructure will be given first priority
in the govermnent capital budget for the sector; (b) a larger share of civil works in the transport
sector will be executed by private contractors; and (c) steps will be taken to liberalize and
privatize the transport sector and in particular the road transport industry, and port cargo handling
activities.
E. Donor Experience in the Transport Sector
2.23          Because this proposed operation is only the second for the Angolan transport
sector, MDA's experience is too limited to provide guidance. Transport projects have been or are
being financed by European bilateral donors and the European Community but their experience,
alike that of IDA is also limited. The main issue so far is that donors need to coordinate their
efforts to ensure that the most urgent priorities get the highest attention, that programs are as
consistent and as mutually supportive as possible, and that the burden on scarce personnel and
institutional capacity is reasonable. Under the project, a mechanism will be put in place to ensure
close donor coordination in the transport sector (Annex 15).
F. Rai.'nale for IDA Involvement
2.24          The proposed project addresses one of Angola's highest priority needs - the
rehabilitation of the country's battered infrastructure base - and is essential to the economy's
recovery.  It fits well into the Bank Group's strategy for the country, which stresses
reconstruction. This project would ccmplement the on-going [RE project which was conceived
prior to the peace agreement in 1991, which gave access to much larger parts of the country; it
would strengthen existing institutions in the infrastructure sector and introduce basic principles
of cost recovery. The Bank also has a unique catalytic role to play in assisting the government
in the design, financing and implementation of this high priority recovery program. The project
would thus enable the Bank to play an important coordinating role in the transport sector where
donor interest is strong, but so far not well coordinated.

A. ProJect Concept and Comnition
Prolect ObleStives
3.01         The Government of Angola prepared a transport recovery program-see Annex
1-to tackle the most urgent needs in the sector (para. 2.21), and requested help from the Bank
and other donors to implement it. Consistent with the Bank's strategy for Angola (para. 1.09),
and as a complement to the IRE Project (para. 1.10), the proposed project would provide
financing to this program. The objectives of this program would be, first to preserve or restore
surface access to large portions of the country by addressing the most urgent infrastructure
rehabilitation and maintenance needs- to provide support to the resumption and continuation of
economic activities by ensuring minimal functioning of road, rail, and port transport.operations,
and to promote employment in the private sector through the development of small and medium
enterprises using labor-intensive technologies in road maintenance. Second the program would
help improve and develop an institutional framework for the sector-especially to manage main
roads and operate railways and the port of Lobito. Third, the program would support the first
phase of sectoral policy implementation, especially for cost recovery.
3.02         The road and bridge rehabilitation would help reopen the most important trunk
roads-to complement initial actions financed by the government in the last few years. Most
important, the effort would postpone any need for major reconstruction of the program roads.
This would allow the government to direct scarce local and external resources to the rehabilitation
of other essential infrastructure. As a result of the program, about 2,500 km of the main paved
roads would be in good conditicn and an additional 't,5n km would be reopened to traffic. This
component would help promote the private sector and develop employment in several ways. First
contractors hired for road rehabilitation (paras. 3.05 ii, 3.17 and 3.19) are expected to
subcontract labor-intensive-tasks such as the clearing of vegetation and erosion control, and
routine maintenance-to small and medium local contractors, especially since they will have to
maintain the roads during two years. Second, the program would train existing and potential
small contractors in labor-intensive road maintenance works-enhancing their future opportunities
as road contractors (para. 3.05 iv). And the program would initiate and give impetus to road
maintenance practices under contract, which can generate permanent private-sector employment.
3.03         The port and rail components are to restore and operate-in the short- or medium-
term-transport facilities on the two port-rail corridors of Luanda and Lobito (up to Kuito) as
economically as possible. These facilities would provide minimal transport to the central plateaus
which have the hig'iest agricultural potential.
Project Description and Status
3.04         The proposed project covers the first phase of the program referred to in paras.
3.01-03, and has four components: road and bridge rehabilitation; Lobito Port rehabilitation; CFL
railway rehabilitation; and studies, institutional development support, and project coordination.
In total the program meets requirements of about US$149.2 million, of which the proposed
project covers US$64.9 million. The difference consists of about US$84.3 million of second
phase project items (mainly roads) and the CFB railway for which funding has not been assured



- 10 -
yet. The CFB railway is intended to be financed under a separate project now under preparation,
with funds provided by IDA under a PPF.
3.05         The road and bridge rehabilitat!on component provides for the early reopening
of the main paved highway network (Annex 2) and would include:
(i)    Repair or replacement of about 25 strategically located bridges destroyed
or damaged by the war (See Map 23568 R). The work includes repairs
to existing bearing structures (piles and abutments), disposal of debris
from the destroyed bridge parts, and in most cases, supply and erection
of new metallic structures to replace destroyed bridge spans. In some
cases, because of cost or technical constraints, the old bridge structure
will be repaired.
(ii)   In a first phase, the resurfacing or periodic maintenance of about 700 km
of the most important paved roads to prevent their destruction 4/. This
includes clearing vegetation on the carriageway, shoulders, and ditches;
repairing drainage structures and shoulders; patching pavement potholes
and mine holes; repairing or reconstructing spots or short sections of
pavement; treating the pavement with a systematic single or double
surface dressing; and maintaining these roads over a two-year period
after the resurfacing work is completed.
(iii)   Consulting services to supervise works described above and train the
staff of the INEA in zontract management. The staff of INEA would
participate in supervision. The corresponding consultants' services are
estimated to be about 160 staff-months. Consultants would also provide
detailed design studies for complete rehabilitation of an additional 600
km of roads.
(iv)   Support to a labor-intensive road works scheme by creating and operating
a training unit in INEA for contract management of labor-intensive road
maintenance works-initially clearing vegetation along roads rehabilitated
by the project, and along the main roads in the city of Luanda (Annex
3). The main objectives would be to train and promote small and
medium enterprises (SMEs) for road works, and generate employment
in road maintenance. This subcomponent consists of technical assistance
(three experts for three years) for training, promotion, and management;
refurbishing of a training center in Caxito (90 km north of Luanda),
including houses for experts and counterparts, lodging for trainees, and
office space; provision of tools for the training brigades; and operation
of the training center and brigades for three years. This subcomponent
will be started early under financing from an advance under the Project
Preparation Facility (PPF). Some SMEs are expected to be used as
' A second phase of resurfacing an additional 900 km of main road would also be implemented as
part of the transport recovery program, depending on the timeliness of external funding.



subcontractors by large contractors for part of the resurfacing and
maintenance works described above. Financing for other labor-intensive
activities-in addition to the resurfacing and maintenance-is expected to
be made available by domestic and other external sources, once the
approach has demonstrate the merits of contracted-out labor intensive
works.
3.06          The Lobito Port operations rehabilitation component aims to improve port
operations and adequately provide port services for a region with high potential in agriculture
(Annex 6.1). It consists of:
(i)    Institutional assistance for the port's operations and management in:
administration and finance, operations and statistics, spare parts
procurement, maintenance of equipment and infrastructure, and training.
This assistance will help the Lobito port implement an action plan with
appropriate performance targets (para. 4.01 ii and Annex 6.2);
(ii)    Provision of spare parts and of a limited amount of new equipment.
(iii)   Repair of the settlement of paved areas behind two berths, and of the
electrical system, including consulting services for detailed designs,
supervision of works, and maintenance training.
3.07          'Te railway rehabilitation con =one provides for emergency assistance to the
CFL, pending the conclusion of IRE-financed feasibility studies and subsequent decisions on the
long-term future of the railways (Annex 5.1). This component would include immediate
assistance to einable the CFL to improve its services. Such assistance would be justified by the
short term need for transport services, even if the railway was to be closed in the long term. Its
help would include institutional assistance for transport operations to assist CFL in implementing
an action plan based on performance targets, and track maintenance (two experts for one year
each). The assistance also will provide for track rehabilitation including the provision of 10 km
of rails, about 14,000 steel sleepers, and about 80,000 cubic meters of ballast and subsequent
track maintenance works; rehabilitation of station and structures; and overhaul of rolling stock,
including eighteen coaches, three main line locomotives, and twenty 4rop-sided wagons to be
converted to container carriers.
3.08          The institutional assistance component will be part of a first phase of the
institution building process in the road, port, and rail subsectors initiated under IRE. In addition
to the assistance provided in the road, port, and rail components as described above (paras. 3.05-
3.07), with the objective of promoting well performing transport entities, the following taport
studif (terms of reference in Annex 8) will be conducted:
(i)    A  road transport privatization and liberalization study (nine staff-
months);
(ii)    A study of intermodal transport facilitation, including the regulations for
maritime transport, port institutions, customs operations, and the freight-
forwarding and insurance industries (twenty-two staff-months).



- 12 -
Technical assistance will also be provided to help the National
Directorate of Merchant Shipping and Ports implement the port
institution framework study's recommendations (twelve staff-months).
A transport facilitation committee comprising representatives from the
ministries concerned (finance and transport), government agencies
(customs, central bank, transport parastatals), and private operators will
be created to review and discuss the conditions and barriers for transport
and trade, follow-up on the study's recommendations, and formulate
recommendations to the government to transport and facilitate trade.
3.09         The pro3ect coordination component will provide one technical assistant to help
the Ministry of Planning with overall project coordination (para. 3.13 and Annex 10).
3.10         The Transport Recovery Project components were conceived and prepared
between September 1991 and April 1992 as follows:
(i)    The road and bridge rehabilitation components were identified in
coordination with INEA and its Bulgarian technical assistance by four
missions: one by the World Bank which visited about 800 km of roads
in September-October 1991; one by a World Bank consultant who
surveyed about 1,000 km of the road network in December 1991; one by
two consultants from the Portuguese Economic Cooperation Agency
(Instituto para a Cooperagao Economica-ICE) who surveyed most of the
project roads in January-February 1992; and one by a bridge expert who
surveyed the bridge sites in February-March 1992. Design was initiated
by the above consultants and experts. For the road works, final design
is to be caried out by the consultants to be hired for work supervision,
based on the condition of the road shortly before work is started-as is
usual for this type of road rehabilitation or periodic maintenance. For
the bridges, the bridge expert who surveyed the sites conducted
preliminary design, and consultants will be hired to complete designs for
the bridges needing repair.
(ii)   The port component was identified in September-October 1991 by a
World Bank mission, and its preparation was completed in February
1992 during the appraisal mission-in conjunction with the Port of Lobito
Authority, which had-prepared a detailed investment plan. Detailed
design of the civil work is to be carried out by consultants before the end
of 1992.
(iii)   The component for the CFL was identified and completed during two
World Bank missions in October 1991 and Febmary-March 1992, based
on a detailed rehabilitation and investment plan prepared by the CFL
management.

B. Project Cost and Financing
3.11         The project cost is estimated at the equivalent of about US$64.9 million including
physical (5 percent) and financial (11 percent) contingencies, with a foreign exchange cost of
about US$50.1 million (77 percent), (tables 3.1-3.2). The foreign exchange cost will be financed
by IDA (US$41 million), the Swedish International Development Agency-SIDA--(US$3.3
million, t, be administered by the Bank), the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperaton
Econowmique-CCCE (US$3 million), and the Danish International Development Agency-
DANIDA (US$3 million).
3.12         The government's contribution of US$14.6 million-not counting taxes-or about
US$6 million in disbursements per year is to cover local expenditures. For the rail and port
components these local expenditures will be refnanced from revenues generated by the agencies
benefiting from the project. For the road component, local expenditures will be financed from
revenues generated by a tax on fuel-at least US$15 million per year starting in 1993 (paras
4.01 i and 4.02 i). This amount was calculated as the minimum required for covering both local
expenditures of the project and minimal maintenance of the main roads-about US$500 per
kilometer per year. An action plan for cost recovery through road user charges has been
prepared by the government and was agreed upon during negotiations. As a condition of credit
effectiveness, the government will take appropriate measures to ensure a level of taxation on fuel
of the equivalent of at least US$15 million per year. To ensure prompt availability of local
funding the government will operate and maintain a project account to be managed by MINPLAN
and replenished on a monthly basis at a level equivalent to US$1 million (para 4.01 xi).

C. Project Superrision and Implementation
Ptoject Coordination. Management. and Responsibilities
3.13         The Ministry of Planning (MINPLAN) will be responsible for the overall
coordination of project implementation, with support from the implementation unit established
under the IRE within its National Directorate of Investments (paras. 3. 15-18). This unit will be
strengthened to cope with its new responsibilities (Annex 10).
3.14         Direct responsibility for overall project implementation rests with hMNOPU for
the road and bridge rehabilitation component, including the training of SMEs In labor-intensive
road maintenance works; and MINTEC for the port, rail, and transport study components. Each
project component will be the responsibility of a component codinator. MINPLAN's National
Directorate of Investments will be responsible for overall project coordination, and will chair a
roiet s1tering cnmmittee already established under IRE. The committee includes the four
component coordinators, as well as representatives designated by the Ministry of Finance and the
Angolan Central Bank-and will meet twice a month to guide the execution of the project. Each
component coordinator will develop six-month action plans and schedules for each component
in coordination with the agencies concerned, submit them for review by the steering committee,
and forward them to IDA for comments.
3.15         Inplementation agreements will be signed before the credit becomes effective
(para 4.02 ii) These agreements will provide for delegations to individual component coordinators
for technical management of a given component includes the authority to manage, monitor,
arrange for audit and report en the execution of these components. As with the IRE, MINPLAN
will delegate to the National Directorate of Investments responsibility for overall project
coordination, monitoring, auditing, and the reporting of operational and financial performance
to the government and IDA; such reporting will be done as agreed upon during negotiations-and
included in the implementation agreements. The technical agencies-INEA for the road and
bridge component, the Port of Lobito for the port component, and CFL for the rail component-
will report to the project implementation unit about bidding preparation and processing, and
contract monitoring through their respective component coordinator.
3.16         The project implementation unit established for the IRE will provide
administrative support to the overall project coordinator and to the project steeing committee.
Technical assistance in place for the IRE until December 1995 includes a general advisor, a
training advisor, an administrative and financial advisor, and an environmental advisor. This
team of experts is expected to help in the project implementation and overall coordination of the
project. To facilitate coordination of-and provide guidance to-the transport agencies involved,
one additional staff person-a traport expt-will be hired from the same consulting firm that
provides the personnel for the IRE. The responsibilities and procedures of the project
implementation unit, and the terms of reference for the transport expert were agreed upon during
negotiations. The transport expert will be in place shortly after effectiveness. This expert will
be responsible for coordinating and monitoring all of the projec, pardcularly compliance with
component action plans and schedules, procurement monitoring, and technical assistance-and
records and accounts in the individual components and for the overall project. He or she will
establish reporting procedures and periodic auditing arrangements as agreed between the
government and IDA.

ProJect Implementatin
3. 17        The project will be implemented over three years beginning during the end of
1992 (see table 3.4 and Annex 11). All road rehabilitation will be done by experienced
contractors under consultant supervision. Bridge structures, track materials, equipment and spare
parts for the Port of Lobito will be provided on a CIF basis under supplier contracts. Transport
on site and erection of bridge metallic structures will be done depending on the urgency, in part
by Empresa lacional de Pontes-a construction parastatal which has acquired extensiva
experience in bridge replacement while repairing a number of bridges destroyed during the war-
under financing by the govermnent, and in part by contractors bired after international
competitive bidding JICB)-in all cases under supervision by a project-financed consultant. The
Completion Date for the project is December 31, 1995.
3.18         The Port of Lobito civil works will be carried out by experienced contractors
supervised by consultants. Railway track rehabilitation will be executed by CFL maintenance
crews supervised by project-financed consultants. These crews have experience in similar works,
will later on carry out track maintenance, and will be financed entirely by the government.
3.19         Initiation of works at each project site will be subject to a prior de-mining
operation to ensure the safety of work crews. The national de-mining program carried out by
the Ministry of Defense has already covered the surface of main roads and railway tracks. An
addi-tional de-mining program will be carried out under INEA's responsibility along the project
roads and on bridge sites. Contracts of work, at each site, will be reviewed and will include a
certification of completion of the mine removal program (para 4.01 v).
3.20         Contracts are expected to be ready for signature for road works and the supplying
of bridge structures by the date of credit effectiveness. The procedures to recruit consultants to
supervise these works and civil works under the railway component will be completed for the
consultants to be in place before the works begin, and even help with bid evaluation, under
financing from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF). This is a condition of disbursement for
civil works (para 4.03). Certification of the legal ownership of land for the training center for
road works (para 3.05) is also a condition of disbursement (para 4.03) for the civil works of the
housing and office facilities for the training unit.
Procurement
3.21         Procurement will be assured by each agency involved in project implementation
with assistance from consultants and the central project implementation unit in MINPLAN (paras.
3.15-16). A Bank procurement seminar was held in Angola in September-October 1991 with
attendance by staff from most of these agencies. Nearly all project procurement will be subject
to prior IDA review. About ten contracts with a total aggregate value of US$45 million,
including contingencies-representing 80 percent of the Bank-financed project procurement-will
be awarded based on ICB, in accordance with the Bank's prourement guidelines. Whenever
practical, contracts will be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost at least US$300,000 for
goods and US$1 million for civil works to permit efficient procurement. Prior review of bid and
contract documents will be required for all consulting service contracts and for equipment and
work contracts above US$75,000. Annex 1 1 has a detailed implementation schedule.

3.23         Major civil works for rehabilitation or periodic maintenance of paved roads,
including subsequent maintenance of the roads concerned over a two-year-period, and bridge
reconstruction or repair work on these roads would be subject to ICB with prequalification. Road
works would be sliced into two to three lots and bridge works in four to five lots-of which two
may be incorporated in the road work lots-based on geographic location of work sites. After
prequalification, potential bidders will be allowed to bid for one or n-ore lots.
3.24         Contracts for the supplies of IDA-financed bridge structures, spare parts, and
equipment would be awarded after ICB, except for proprietary spare parts for locomotives
supplied by only a few well known suppliers, which will be subject to limited international
bidding up to a cumulative amount of US$1 million. The list of suppliers to be invited to bid will
be agreed upon by the Bank.
3.25         Contracts of less than a cumulative cost of US$800,000 for minor repairs to
bridges, embankments and buildings and the construction of housing and office facilities for the
training unit; and less than a cumulative cost of US$100,000 for goods and tools-unlikely to
attract foreign suppliers-may be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding and advertised
locally, with the provision that foreign firms may bid and that the bidder may request a portion
of paiement in foreign currency. These contracts will cover mainly repairs to railway bridges
and embankments; railway stations, houses and office buildings; office equipment, furniture and
furnishings, and cars for consultants; and hand tools for the training unit. In addition, local
shopping for contracts under US$10,000 up to a total of US$100,000 will be allowed to purchase
minor supplies for the training unit. Goods under ICB shall be exempted from pre-shipment
price inspection by a third party inspection firm.
3.26         Consultants for detailed design, work supervision, and studies will be selected
following the guidelines "Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, and by the World Bank
as Executing Agency" (August 1981) for contracts with consulting firms-using a short list of
firms. Individuals may be retained for specific technical assistance assignments, such as the pilot
training component for the promotion of labor-intensive road maintenance works. A procurement
transport expert for project coordination will be hired from the firm which is already providing
project coordination for the IRE (para. 3.16).
3.27         The agencies responsible for project implementation will use the Guidelines
"Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" (May 1992) and in particular, the Bank
Sample Bidding Documents, Letters of Invitation and consultant contract. The contracts with
payments in foreign currency extending over more than one year and all contracts with payments
in local currency will contain a provision for price adjustment.
3.28         Civil works, parts and other supplies, and consulting services financed under
parallel financing agreements by other donors would be procured under the procurement rules
of those donors.
3.29         To collect and record procurement information the executing agency will prepare
comprehensive quarterly reports to the Bank, indicating revised cost estimates for individual
contracts and the total project, including best estimates of physical and price contingency
allowances and physical execution and payments made; and revised timing of procurement

actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for individual
contracts. The borrower also will provide a completion report within three months of the credit's
Closing Date.
Disbursements under IDA Credits

All disbursements will be fully documented.
3.31         To ensure prompt availability of project funds, the government will open a special
account in U.S. dollars at a banking institudon acceptable to IDA. An initial deposit of US$1
million-about two months of project spending-will be made by IDA to fais special account when
the credit becomes effective. The government will submit monthly requests for replenishing the
fund. In addition, the government will establish a project account for counterpart funds.
These disbursement arrangements were agreed to at negotiations.
3.32         The esdmated schedule of disbursements is based on the project implementation
schedule-and includes a six-month delay from the end of the physical execution of the project
and the last payment to allow for delays in determining price variations in contracts. This
comparatively rapid schedule is justified by the fact that the components of this high-priority
urgent rehabilitation project are simple and well defined; and that this will be carried out by
contractors and consultants, and that the preparation of bid documentation is already well
advanced. Angola does not yet have a disbursement profile. The Closing Date for the Credit
is June 30, 1996.

Accountingy. Auditing. and Reporting Reauirements
3.33       Project accounts will be maintained by the National Directorate for Investments in
MINPLAN-in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles-to record all project
revenues expenditures, assets, and liabilities. Separate accounts will be kept for each component
and will be available for inspection by IDA during project supervision. The executing agency
will prepare quarterly reports on project progress covering accounting, budgetary, financial,
physical, and costing aspects with contributions from the agencies involved in project execution
(see Annex 10). Not later than three months from the end of each financial year, MINPLAN will
prepare an annu.l report following the same format. MINPLAN will prepare a project
completion report in a form satisfactory to IDA not later than six months after the project closing
date.
3.34       The project accounts, including the special account, will be audited annually in
accordance with international guidelines by independent auditors acceptable to IDA.  The
auditor's report together with the project accounts financial statements and management letters
will be submitted to IDA not later than six months after the end of each fiscal year.
3.35       Every year, INEA will prepare a detailed road maintenance and rehabilitation work
program for the following year-at the same time as the preparation of annual budgets.
Project Supervision
3.36       The detailed supervision plan provides for a first-year detailed review among the
government (MINPLAN, MINTEC and MINOPU), the agencies involved in project
implementation, project co-donors, and IDA-to be carried out no later than one year after
effectiveness (see para 4.01 vii), and to be coordinated with the mid-term review for the IRE (see
Annex 12). This review will (1) monitor project implementation and performance of the
ministries and agencies involved in project implementation, (2) monitor implementation of the
action plans for the Port of Lobito and the CFL, (3) review and discuss the INEA proposed road
program and budget for 1994, and the proposed three-year (1994-96) Public Investment Program
for the transport sector to be prepared under the IRE, (4) discuss and agree on additional steps



-22 -
required for improved cost recovery in the transport sector (5) discuss and agree on civil works
to be carried out during the coming years of project implementation, taking into consideration
the following criteria: actual and expected traffic; degree of road deterioration; and classification
within the transport network; and (6) discuss and agree on an updated project financing plan,
including all available cofinancing sources. The review will benefit from the results of the
sectoral studies carried out under the IRE and may lead to revisions of the project components.
derIdggos
3.37       A detailed timetable and schedule of physical works has been prepared for each
major project component (see Annex 11). Key indicators have been identified for maintaining
important project objectives and expected achievements (see Annex 9).
D. Project-Related Environmental Issues
3.38       The proposed project is classified as a "B" project with some possible limited
environmental effects. An enviromnental analysis was carried out with the assistance of a
consultant for the road component during project preparation. Its findings were that, first, the
project would have substantial positive social and environmental effects by providing better
conditions on major transport routes that would benefit the rural and urban populations; by
improving road drainage, which in turn would limit erosion; and by providing for the removal
of war-caused wrecks left alongside the roads and on the sites of destroyed bridges. Second, the
analysis recommended that attention be paid to the design and execution of civil works to alleviate
the potential risk of disturbances caused to people and the natural environment.
Effet on Prolect Desian
3.39       Environmental disturbances that might be caused by the civil works during-or as
a direct consequence of--their execution will be addressed through appropriate work-detailed
design, provisions in contract documents for work, and work supervision (Annex 13). Suitable
safeguards will be incorporated into bid documents and contracts for works to minimize potential
environmental damage caused by road works, especially regarding drainage facilities, risks of
erosion, handling of quarries and borrow pits after construction, anti-erosion planting, handling
of camps and workshops. On the other hand, the project may have a positive effect on the
environment by repairing road and track draib age, currently in bad shape-particularly in erosion-
sensitive areas. In other respects, the road and rail track rehabilitation will follow the existing
alignments and will have little effect on current land use.
E. Economic Evaluation and Risks
3.40       The rehabilitation of the transport infrastructure is a prerequisite to economic
recovery in Angola. Direct economic benefits would be both reduced operating costs for
transport, and the generation of traffic from local trade and farming.



- 23 -
Benefidlarle
3.41       The overall project beneficiaries will be (1) a large proportion of the Angolan people
who will have restored access to large are-s of the country, (ii) the agricultue-(staple and
export)-and the inhabitants of major cities and semi-urban rural centers throughout the country
who will enjoy the benefits of enhanced food security and cheaper food prices. Immediate direct
beneficiaries of the project will be people-mostly unskilled-who will be hired to execute project
works: (i) about 4,000 to 5,000 workers are expected to be employed by contractors over two
years, and (ii) an additional 4,000 workers could be employed over the medium-to-long term by
SMEs trained under the project.
Economic Analysis
3.42       For all project components an overriding selection criterion is the immediate
restoration of main transport links.
3.43       Road and bridge component. About 75 percent of project spending is for the road
and bridge component. The road sections selected are both needed to restore a main transport
link, and repairable within two to three years-thus saving the much higher cost of a later
complete reconstruction. Some 1,400 km were identified, cost-benefit estimates conducted, and
a set of first-priority road works proposed. lle benefits for these roads were lower vehicle
operating costs and, in some cases, a saving in future reconstruction costs. The savings in
vehicle operating costs were only based on the savings for heavy vehicles, a most conservative
assumption. No savings for light vehicle traffic were included because of the difficulties of
estimating this potential traffic (see Annex 14).
3.44       Periodic maintenance and rehabilitation of roads. The following project benefits
have been quantified in calculations of the economic rate of return:
(i) Lower vehicle operating costs for estimated traffic volumes after the
rehabilitation and subsequent maintenance of project roads; and
(ii) Savings in future rehabilitation costs through the prevention of excessive
deterioration in road conditions.
The economic rates of return for individual road sections range from 20 to 38 percent, with 31
percent for this project component.
3.45       Bridges. The following project benefits have been quantified in economic-rate-of-
return calculations, mostly in combination:
(i) The cost of additional vehicle operating costs to circumvent a bridge
whenever possible;
(ii) The cost of using improvised systems of ferry crossing whenever possible;
and
(iii) Lost value-added for the traffic that would not travel under any of the above
arrangements.



-24 -
Economic rates of return for individual road sections with one or several bridges range from 27
to 72 percent, with 45 percent for this project component.
3.46       Railway component. The CFL railway is facing serious constraints because of track
conditions, and the limited availability of locomotives and rolling stock. A higher-cost alternative
for customers is road transport, in part over unpaved roads that have been in disuse for a long
time. For the evaluation of benefits, costs of alternative road transport for freight have been
compared with direct-operating expenses for the railway for the years 1993 to 2001. On that basis
the economic rate of return has been estimated at 18 percent.
3.47       Etm nQ. For the Port of Lobito three types of benefits have been identified.
First are reductions of ship time in port-directly through improved service time, or indirectly
through reduced waiting time. Second is the reduction in dwell time for containers. Third is the
reduction in damage and cargo losses leading to lower insurance costs. Although this port is not
seriously congested, a resumption of normal economic activities-even moderate traffic-will
quickcly lead to ship delay times justifying improved cargo handling facilities. It is important not
only to make better use of existinlg berths, but also to increase the capacity for container
handling-to reduce freight and insurance rates. On the basis of ship time and container time
alone, the economic rate of return is 17 percent.
3.48       Overall economic rate of return and risk analysis. The overall project economic rate
of return is 30 percent, covering about 90% of the project cost. A risk analysis was conducted
for individual project components to test the economic-rate-of-return sensitivity to construction
costs, traffic growth rate, and induced traffic. Test results show that under worst-case
assumptions, economic rates of return would decline to not less than 11 percent for any individual
project component, or is still above an opportunity cost of capital of 10 percent.
3.49       Unguantified benefits. The above economic-rate-of-return estmates do not take into
account additional benefits that cannot be conveniently quantified. Those benefits are increased
production over and above the amounts that are implicit in a return to a normal level of traffic,
lower food prices in urban centers, increased exports of agricultural produce, and increased basic
services-health, extension, and education-in rural communities. Rural access to these services
is presently limited by poor transport.
Flngncial-Analysis
3.50       Financial accounting.    Financial information is not available owing to weak
financial management and record keeping which is essentially based on cash transactions.
Inventories and actual depreciation are not currently kept up to date. Assets-when they are
registered-at historical cost do not reflect current value. In most cases no balance sheet or funds-
flow statements are available for past years. Ongoing studies under IRE include reviews of the
existing institutional aspects including accounting and financial practices, and the resultant
recommendations will be implemented under technical assistance and training programs included
in the project and the proposed Lobito Port Transport System Rehabilitation Project currently
under preparation.



-25 -
3.51       Financial Projections. Financial projections-based on a rigorous cost reduction and
normalization of policies concerning operating expense-are intended to determine the actual
revised tariffs expressed in U.S. dollars (see Annexes 5.1 and 6.1). The steps towards financial
regularization, including the introduction of improvements in the accounting systems, the
establishment of financial objectives, the achievement of financial targets and their deadlines are
detailed in the above Annexes and are included in the action plans which were agreed upon
during negotiations (Annexes 5.2 and 6.2).
Project Sutainability
3.52       Cost recovery is a major goal of the project, and a major factor of project
sustainability. Low tariff levels prevail in the transport sector-especially on the roads. Fuel
taxation will be raised to take effect in 1993 to cover the cost of maintenance of main roads, and
provide counterpart funding for the project's road component (para. 4.02 i). The problem is
exacerbated mainly in the railway and port subsectors by the overvalued, artificial official
exchange rate (para. 1.03). The issue of cost recovery has already been raised by the IRE, and
decisions on tariff adjustments have already been made and implemented, initially by new tariffs
in January 1992. The project proposes to address cost recovery systematically and permanently
through a two-pronged strategy. The first is to implement rigorous cost-reductions and
normalization of operating expenses with periodic and annual targets. These targets have been
defined through both the action plans and financial covenants agreed upon during negotiations
(paras 4.01 ii and 4.02 i and Annexes 5.2 and 6.2). These action plans will include-in addition
to financial targets, performance improvements and staffing reductions. The second step is to
implement cost accounting in U.S. dollars converted at the commercial fiuctuant kwanza rate of
exchange. Tariffs would have to be reviewed as often as needed-determined by results of the
periodic dollar cost-accounting system which includes appropriate steps for the effective
accounting for inflation.
3.53       The project will be a first step in the development of a road maintenance capacity
in Angola. Whereas the IRE will provide for the design of an overall framework for road
management, the project will provide for an actual start-up of maintenance activities in two ways:
firstly, experience will be acquired in road maintenance under contract, as maintenance of roads
repaired under the project will be done by contractors over a two-year period after the repair
work is completed. Secondly, small contractors will be trained in labor-based road maintenance,
which will allow INEA to expand road maintenance to the rest of the m-ain road network over
about three years. Most importantly, resources will be mobilized through an appropriate cost
recovery mechanism to provide funding for road maintenance.
Project Risks
3.54       The risks inherent in the project result from the government's limited capacity to
ensure adequate local financing, and the Angola's transport agencies and ministries weak
institutional capacity to manage the project-both of which could delay project implementation and
thus lead to further deterioration of the transport infrastructure and services. Unfamiliarity of
project staff with Bank procedures, and a potentially unstable political environment could also
lead to significant delays. The project design reduces the potential consequences related to these
risks. As for the counterpart funding issue, the government will provide fur the local costs only
through a project account managed by MINUNLAN (para. 3.12), the larger part being for road

mantenance activities, and cost recovery mechanisms have been developed to help generate the
resources needed. The government will improve collection under the fuel tax to cover Its
counterpart funding of the road component and its annual contribution for road maintenance
(para. 3.12). As for the weak institutional capacity, the bulk of project-financed road works will
be carried out under contract and supervised by consultants, which will limit the resk associated
with INEA's current institutional weakness.

TRANSPOR RECOV ELQ^CT
Road and Bridge Rehabilitation Comgonen
I.    Condition ofthe Basic Paved Jload Networks
Most paved roads are badly deteriorated, some completely destroyed, following years
of maintenance neglect and war damage. Some roads that have had almost no traffic in the
last few year because destroyed bridges prevented access to them - are still badly damaged
by the climatic effects. Of roads that were built or rebuilt recently, some are in good
condition and others are in poor or medium condition - in urgent need of petiodic
mainenace and spot repairs. 'Me project is focused on the recently built or rebuilt roads.
2.    A field survey was conducted from December 1991 to February 1992 on the roads
being considered for the project. Road deterioration was categorized in four ways:
1.    Pavement deformation because of settlement in or under the road foundation
2.    Pavement surface deterioration mainly because of natural aging of the
underlying surface - cracks, loss of aggregates - wear and tear to the
pavement edge - some of the damage was caused by military tanks
3.    Potholes and destruction of the base course of some of the foundation; this
damage caused by the war - land mines - or by poor drainage
4.    Large-scale destruction of pavement.
3.    Using the broad categories listed above - and depending on the degree of deterioration
on pavement, base, foundation, and shoulders - INEA classified the road sections as follows:

I.    Project Selection Criteria for Road Sections
4.     The main roads were classified according to traffic volume, using the most recent
systematic traffic counts - 1970 traffic counts:
(i)    Road in good condition - rehabilitated, rebuilt, recently built - or subject to
ongoing rehabilitation work; these roads are not included in the project.
(ii)    Road mostly in regular to medium condition - possibly with some sections in
poor condition, and short sections destroyed - for which prompt periodic
maintenance or spot repair would prevent further deterioration and a need for
total reconstruction. Such roads that gave access to economically important
regions were considered for the project. Among these roads, priority was
given to those with the highest economic rate of return. And the rehabilitation
of damaged bridges on these roads is given priority.
(iii)   Road with substantial portions in poor condition or destroyed and in need of
reconstruction - first requiring feasibility and technical studies, which are
likely to be begun in three to four years and provided through the IRE or
under this project.
(iv)   Road that has relatively little potential traffic volumes or is inaccessible to
heavy trucks in the near future.
M.   Selected Road Component
5.     Using the above-described criteria, the road sections were identified according to
fitness for the project (see table A2. 1), and grouped in 6 lots for the awarding of work
contracts. Lots IA and 2 were selected in priority 1 for the project, given overall financial
constraints, whereas lots 1B, 3A, 3B, and 3C (as a priority 2) are not part of the project. The
government is expected to continue its search for financing for the remaining lots.
IV.   Selected Bridges to be Rebuilt or Repaired
The bridges to be reconstructed or repaired were destroyed or unfit for regular traffic
loads, located on the priority roads section identified in Section HI above and on other roads
serving regions with strorg economic potential. Depending on the condition of the existing
bridge, possible solutions are to (i) repair the existing structure, or (iH) reconstruct one,
several, or all bridge spans - using new metal structures and, whenever possible, re-using
existing foundations and piles or abutments. The list of bridges selected for repair or
reconstruction and the proposed solutions is in table A2.2:

Labor Promotion and Training fl=  Sub-comuonent
I.    Backround
The objectives of the project road component are to halt the deterioration of important
portions of the primary road network and to conduct emergency repairs to ensure reliable access
to these roads. For the long term, the IRE project a!ms to prepare a large-scale program of
financial and institutional assistance that will enable MINOPU and INEA to rehabilitate the
primary road network and maintain it in acceptable condition.
One part of the project road component is to erect metal bridges and repair damaged
bridges-thus providing reliable access to major arteries. These works will be executed by an
experienced national parastatal firm (Empresa de Pontes), and by contractors hired
internationally.
3.    Other production targets are:
(i)    Clearing of vegetation on and along the roads
(ii)    Cleaning of ditches and other drainage structures
(iii)   Removal of vehicle carcasses remaining from the war
(iv)   Repair of drainage structures preventing access
(v)    Periodic maintenance and spot repairs of surface damage.
Activities (i) and (ii) are suitable for immediate measures by labor-based brigades. Activities (iii)
and (iv) require some mechanical input. Activity (v) requires substandal mechanical input.
I.    Project Conce
4.    The benefits of using locally available resources - especially labor - in terms of foreign
exchange savings, income distribution, and increased domestic value-added are well known and
need no furtier analysis at this point.
5.    A considerable part of the project road and railway work is suitable for-and may be
restricted to-labor-based methods. However, at present the institutional framework, knowledge,
and skills required to use large inputs of labor do not exist in Angola.

6.     A demonstration and training project can ease the constraints on the use of local
resources. Such project will demonstrate work on the roads, training of potential local
contractors, training of supervisors of different levels, and training of administrators In
appropriate accounting and administrative methods. The site of the training center will be Caxito
in Bengo Province. The training will focus on appropriate technology, appropriate training, and
"hands on" approaches. The staff of INEA will be trained in control, contract management,
measurement, cost estimates, and cost accounting.
7.    The creation of private small contracting firms requires substantial assistance uing start-
up. Thus, as part of their training, contractors will receive help in getting organized, setting up
.vork sites, and in arranging control systems and cost accounting functions. At a later stage, the
contractors may need financial credit system for the purchase of tools and minor equipment.
8.    The project has three components: (i) practical training and production; (ii) theoretical
training; and (iii) promotion and support.
m.   Project Objectives and Descrigtion
9.    The overall project objective is the dissemination and promotion of labor-based methods
to achieve rapid-but still rational-employment of labor in road maintenance.
10.   The objectives of practical training are to:
(i)    Produce as much work as efficiently as possible
(ii)   Provide hands-on demonstration of labor-based techniques
(iii)   Train personnel on-site
(iv)   Demonstrate administrative and control systems.
11.   This component could quickly start works to stop the deterioration of the road network.
To demonstrate and train, skilled staff and workers are needed. Although the overaU goal is to
use contractors for the work and to keep salaried personnel to a minimum, wages and salaries
will have to be paid for the personnel working at the training project. Task work and piece work
wiUl be used as much as possible.
12.   The objectives of the theoretical training are to:
(i)    Train potential contractors and public sector managers in labor-based
management and control
(ii)    Train public sector staff in tendering and contracting procedures and in job
supervision works
(iii) Train supervisory personnel from all sectors in appropriate techniques.

13.   The key concept in labor-based work is "appropriate technology". 7%e corresponding
concept in training is 'appropriate knowledge". ITe training provided must be tailored to the
exact needs of positions in the organization. Close coordination between the demonstration
project and training Is essential.
14.   Special care must be taken in the recruitment of trainees to avoid wasting scarce resources
on non-trainable people. The national Bureau of Employment will assist in the selections.
15.   The objectives of promotion and sunport are to:
(i)    Convince decision-makers that labor-based techniques are a competitive
production alternative
(ii)   Increase use of labor-based methods
(iii)   Help local authorities and entrepreneurs in the start-up of labor-based work
(iv)   Coordinate with other labor-based activities.
16.   One of the most difficult parts of a labor-based project is getting decision-makers to
accept these techniques as viable alternatives to machinebased work. It is necessary to actively
promote the use of labor through demonstrations, seminars, and video presentations. To alleviate
public sector administrators'fear that such projects might prove too difficult, new initiatives
should be supplemented with advice, report forms, accounting systems, payment systems, and
supervision. To avoid duplication effort, donor and government-agency projects that have labor-
based components could be coordinated joindy.
17.   Funds may not at first be available from public sources except the project. One of the
objectives is to train contractors to compete for contracts apart from the project. But, to ensure
that trained contractors can get work, some contracting work will be financed as part of the
project budget-directly or under subcontracts with the contractors recruited inturnationally.
IV.   Project Implementation and Issues
18.   Because of the emergency nature of the project, serious institutional constraints should
be overcome pragmatically. Particularly important is the timely payment of wages and contracts.
The LPT will be developed within the INEA, and will be turned over to proper local authorities
when-after three years-the needed competence has been developed.
19.   The existing institutional capacity of the INEA and MINOPU does not permit rapid
expansion into new areas. Relying on this existing structure would produce unacceptable results
or even failure. The project thus must be connected to the highest possible levels - to the
Director General of the INEA.
20.   Because the capacity of local staff available to the project is limited, much of the required
know-how must be provided by the expatriate technical assistance (three experts for three years

each, see para 3.05 Civ) of main report). The speed with which this help can be obtained is a key
to project success.
21.   The project will be implemented during three years. The project management shall be
responsible for procurement. The INEA will be responsible for coordination of the LPT with
other project components and activities.
22.   Potential risks are a lack of high-level commitment to the LPI; a lack of mid-level
administrative capacity resulting in delays of payments, slow procurement, and allocations; and
a preference for building a large force of government employees instead of using contractors.
V.    Project Cost and Flnancing
23.   The cost of the LPT component is estimated at $2.65 million - 48 percent of which is
local, as shown in table A.3. 1.

24.   External donors - IMA and SIDA - will fince the foreign portion and some of the local
portion as follows: (i) technical assistance (3 experts for 2.5 to 3 years), including their housing;
(ii) lodging and office facilities for the Caxito training center; (iii) furniture and office equipment;
(iv) vehicles, equipment, tools, and spare parts for the taining brigades. The tools, office
equipment, and other imported items needed to set up the organization and quickly start the road
maintenance brigade wiUl be provided by IMA under a PPF advance. Other donor(s) may provide
separate financing. The government will fimd most local costs, including salaries for local staff.

VI.   Social and Environmental Iffect
25.   Labor-based techniques in civil works put less stress on the environment than the use of
equipment. Project promotion of the use of labor can contnbute an increased standard of living
and give the population a sense of participation and responsibility for the work. Project plans
call for erosion protection.
26.   The training of skilled staff is an important input for the economy, given the current
shortages of skilled staff. In addition to this, the LPT would directly contribute to the
improvement of the road system - which will lead to direct savings in transport.
VIII. E*esd Reslt
27.   Training is the main objective of the LPT; a total of 200 persons will be trained to
organize and supervise labor-based road maintenance contracts, as follows: Year 1, 40;
Year 2, 40; and Year 3, 75
28.   In addition to this, the LPT will attempt to contract or sub-contract for the scheduled
project work or for other work as part of the demonstration. Expected physical output is as
follows: vegetation encroachment cleared and ditches cleaned on 500 km of roads; and road
surface patched on 150 kn of main roads.

I.    Railway Network
1.    The railway network in Angola comprises three independently managed and unconnected
systems: (i) Caminho de Ferro de Luanda (CFL); (ii) Caminho de Ferro de Benguela (CFB); and
(iii) Caminho de Ferro de Mocamedes (CFM) 1/. These sysms connect the seaports of
Luanda, Lobito, and Namibe to the main centers of Malange, Huambo/Kuito, and Menongue
respectively and thus are in a position to handle much of the Angolan export-import freight and
inter-city long-distance passenger traffic. CFB is also connected to the southern African railway
network through the Zaire Railways and was used, until 1975, by land-locked countries such as
Zaire and Zambia for access to the port of Lobito for their exports and imports. CFL and CFM
are parastatals and 90 percent of the shares in CFB are held by TANKS Consolidated Investments
P.L.C. - Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) and 10 percent by the Government of Angola.
Basic data about the three systems are given in table A.S. 1. 1.

2.    Status of infrastructure and assets. The track for all the railway system is in very poor
condition requiring substantial replacement of sleepers. CFM and CFL also need considerable
replenishment of ballast. Although locomotives on CFB have been recently overhauled, those
on CFL and CFM have not been overhauled for the last fifteen to twenty years. On all the
railways, in general the condition and availability of wagons is satisfactory, but passenger coaches
need refurbishing (Annex 5.2, para 1.3.2). The telecommunications systems for CFM and CFB
need rehabilitation. Maintenance facilities are generally satisfactory on all the railway systems.
II.    Transgort Demand and Traffri
3.    Traffic volumes and ogerating ratio. CFL and CFB were closed to long-distance passen-
ger and freight traffic for most of the period since 1975. The traffic on these railways was
restricted to suburban passenger traffic and some short-distance freight. As a resu+, the
operating ratio (operating cost/revenue) on both the railways had been much above 100 percent -
about 200 percent for CFL and more than 500 percent for CFB. CFM, on the other hand,
continued its operations - except for the 6 million ton-per-year iron ore traffic, which had to be
discontinued. Despite the poor infrastructure, passenger and freight services between Namibe
and Matala have been maintained at more than 750,000 passengers and 200,000 tons per year.
Tne operating ratio on CFM has remained mainly below 100 percent - at around 85 percent.
Details of past traffic, costs, and income for the three systems are given in table A,5. 1.2
4.    Traffic forecast for CFL. The demand for freight traffic on CFL includes
(i) petroleum products for Sonangol from Luanda to Malange and Lucala; (ii) loaded containers
from Luanda to Malange and the return of empty containers; (iii) imported food grains such as
maize and rice, and also fertilizer, cement, construction materiais, and so on, in covered wagons
as bulk material from Luanda to Lucala and Malange; and (iv) wood and agricultural output from
Malange and other stations en route to Luanda. Yearly long-distance freight and passenger
traffic, suspended until August 1991, is estimated to go up to 150,000 tons and 580,000
passengers by the year 2000. Contracts already signed for freight transport indicate that freight
traffic could reach this forecast by 1993.
5.    Traffic forecast for CFM. The present pattern of traffic on CFM is expected to continue
with the traffic level showing an increase to about 250,000 tons by the year 2000. In addition,
export of granite would offer a freight traffic of 100,000 ton per year. The long distance
passenger traffic, currently suspended, is expected to go up to 1 million passengers yearly by the
year 2000.
6.    Traffic forecast for CFB. The demand for freight traffic on CFB includes (i) petroleum
products from Lobito to Huambo/Kuito; (ii) loaded containers from or to Huambo/Kuito and the
return of empty containers; (iii) imported food grains such as maize and rice, and also fertilizer,
cement, construction materials and so on, in covered wagons as bulk material from Lobito to
Huambo/Kuito; and (iv) transport of wood, eucalyptus and agricultural output from
Huambo/Kuito and or other stations en route to Lobito. Yearly long-distance freight and
passenger traffic, currently suspended, is expected to go up to 545,000 tons and 360,000
passengers yearly by the year 2000.

m.   Strategy for Revival of the Rail Network - Current Status
7.    The low levels of freight traffic expected on all the railway systems makes it necessary
for them to adopt more innovative strategies to enable them to become commercially viable. A
feasibility study for developing such a strategy for CFB is already in progress and is expected
to be completed by August 1992. The studies for CFL and CFM are expected to begin by June
1992 and finish by January 1993. The CFB study has been financed by the World Bank under
the project preparation facility (PPF). The CFL and CFM studies would be financed under the
Infrastructure Rehabilitation Engineering (IRE) project, financed by the Bank and currently under
implementation. Based on the recommendations of the study and the Bank appraisal, the rehabili-
tation and restructuring of CFB is proposed to be taken up as a component of the Lobito Port
Transport System (LPTS) rehabilitation project.
8.    Simultaneously, CFB and CFL have also commenced the first phase of rehabilitation of
their railway systems - track, signalling and communication system, locomotives, and rolling
stock - so, as to enable them to resume and sustain a minimum of passenger and freight opera-
tions. CFM has also initiated the first phase of rehabilitation to enable it to get a better share of
the freight traffic. Part of the first phase of rehabilitation for CFL and CFM is being financed
under IRE. CFB rehabilitation is at present internally financed. All the three railway systems
are also preparing and implementing action plans to achieve higher levels of operating efficiency,
more specif ally related to locomotive and rolling stock availability, utilization, and reliability.
IV.   CFL Component
Introduction
9.    Although the rehabilitation of CFL was scheduled to follow the feasibility study results,
the return of peace to Angola in 1991 and the accompanying expectations gave an urgency to
commencing freight and passenger services on CFL - and after a few minimum repairs, passenger
service between Luanda and Malange was resi-ied in August 1991. However, a major part of
the track remains in bad condition and the operations on CFL would be difficult to sustain
without substantial rehabilitation. The Transport Recovery Project is aimed at providing the
minimum critical inputs for maximizing freight and passenger traffic on CFL, ensuring safe
operations on a sustained basis, preventing further deterioration of the assets and establishing the
basis for commercially viable operations.
10.   The rapidly changing economic, commercial and political environment in Angola, is
already beginning to impact on the performance and the business strategy of CFL. Eir, the
environment is becoming increasingly competitive with the easier entry of road haulers for freight
and passenger traffic. As a result, CFL has already been forced to cut back considerably on the
suburban and short-distance services and which only a few months ago were the major source of
its revenues. The competition will also force CFL to restrict the increases in its tariff rates on
long-distance traffic - passenger and freight. Second, the recent devaluation of Nic has not only
brought the cost of imported inputs close to their real cost, but has also brought a demand for
higher wages and salaries by the staff of CFL - and higher local expenditures at all levels. The
pressure of increasing costs is forcing CFL management to appreciate the need for tariff
adjustments, a deep restructuring of the railway, and drastic cost reductions. L=, market-
oriented government policies, some in place and others expected soon, mesh with a policy aimed



- 47 -
Annex, S. I
Page 4 of 11
at the elimination of subsidies to public sector enterprises - giviLg additional urgency to railway
restructuring and efficiency improvements.
11.   Under the 1992 CFL Action Plan defined by the management in November 1991, CFL
is operating a long-distance, Luanda-Malange, passenger train three times a week. The
occupancy ratio of the passenger trains is expected to be very high, averaging about 80%. A
tank train carrying fuel is also being operated between Luanda and Malange on a three-times-a-
week basis. Suburban traffic between Luanda and Viana has been cut only to three trains per day
in either direction, mainly for CFL's staff transportation needs. Container transport between
Luanda and Malange, has not started yet, but is awaiting completion of an agreement with road
haulers for movement of containers beyond Malange.
Corporate Objectives and Strategy
12.   The proposed package of investments is economically justified. In addition, CFL has to
achieve financial viability in the shortest possible time - financial viability meaning a return on
capital of at least 6 percent after meeting operating expenses and providing for adequate depre-
ciation. This objective requires (i) maximizing the rail share of freight and passenger traffic -
particularly between Luanda and Malange - mainly by focusing on the creation of adequate capa-
city, and increased effective marketing, reliability, and security of operations; and (ii) minimizing
investment on the fixed assets such as track, bridges, signaling and telecommunication quarries,
and workshops and other maintenance facilities through judicious phasing; (iii) minimizing
investment by setting up appropriate systems for the operations and the traffic offered; and (iv)
restructuring the railway, mainly focusing on institutional, organizational, aad financial actions
to turn CFL into a financially viable and autonomous entity. For CFL to achieve this objective
requires several distinct sets of actions, including (i) forecasting traffic and ensuring the rail share
through effective marketing; (ii) formulating and implementing of appropriate government
policies; (iii) restructuring of the railway; (iv) improving operating efficiency and resource
productivity through more effective management, and (v) improving CFL-government under-
standing through an appropriate performance agreement.
Business Development
13.   Detailed freight and passenger traffic forecasts are shown in We A.5kIA 3. Despite the
forecast traffic that logically belongs to the rail transport, ensuring that this traffic uses the
railway would require effective marketing, precisely identifying users and their transport needs;
coordinating with complementary road transport for a better rail-and-road marketing policy;
offering matching train schedules, particularly if return traffic is involved; and offering long-term
special freight rates.
Policy and Institutional Framework
14.   Both rail and road transport have definite roles to play in the transport sector.
Government policies have to ensure that the relative roles of the two modes are determined by
the respective total distribution costs for different types of traffic and traffic hauls. This requires
(i) freedom for both modes in marketing, setting tariffs, and reforming management; (ii) equal



- 48 -
Annex, 5.1
Page 5 of 11
access to foreign exchange for maintenance needs and augmenting their capacity; and (iii) no
direct or indirect subsidy to any mode - which means implementing plans for adequate cost-
recovery policies for both modes.
15.   To make the railway commercially viable, the government, as the sole shareholder, is
considering (i) establishing a board of directors-including professionals from the transport and
finance sectors and user groups-with adequate management powers; (ii) defining and approving
statutes that define CFL as an autonomous and commercially viable entity; (iii) reviewing or
introducing appropriate legislation to define the respective roles of government and CFL; and (iv)
entering into yearly performance agreements with CFL defining the responsibilities of government
and CFL for the year.
Railway Restructuring
16.   The restructuring would focus on: (i) improving long-distance freight and passenger
traffic, giving up the suburban passenger traffic and short-distance and less-than-block train
freight traffic, and stopping rail services to all the five branch lines; (ii) closing of non-
commercial stations and redundant maintenance depots and buildings; (iii) segregating, scrapping
and removing old wagons and coaches; (iv) projecting the CFL equipment needs for the year
2000 based on an optimal operating plan and storing in good condition assets which are
temporarily surplus; (v) operating only block trains and eliminating marshalling and shunting
operations in intermediate yards; (vi) retirement of surplus staff in a phased manner and finally
reducing the staff to a level compatible with the traffic and the operating efficiency; and (vii)
reducing the number of departments - and the levels of authority and decision-making in each
department - and relating departmental budget to railway performance.
17.   Accoanting. On the basis of recommendations resulting from the feasibility study, restruc-
turing would focus on: (i) upgrading the existing financial and accounting practices to an
integrated and transparent accounting and costing system, such a system incorporating effective
accounting for inflation and enabling timely extraction and circulation of balance sheet, income
statement, cash flow and management reports on budgets and costs; and (ii) establishing appro-
priate financial objectives and financial performance targets as detailed below in paragraph 18.
18.   Financial, In conjunction with the consultant's work referred to earlier in paragraph 17,
the following financial objectives and performance targets would be established (i) normalization
and rationalization of operating expenses through implementation of continuing cost reduction
policies; (ii) introduction of market, inflation and cost recovery based tariffs that are, in terms
of their structure and levels, designed to generate annually, revenues sufficient to cover the
operating, maintenance and overhead expenses and depreciation or debt service obligations
(interest and repayment of principal) whichever is higher; (iii) internal cash generation sufficient
to cover annually, the debt service obligations and a return on capital; (iv) achievement in the
near term of a working ratio (operating, maintenance and overhead expenses excluding
depreciation and interest divided by operating revenues) of 80 percent in 1993, 65 percent in
1994 and 1995, and establishment in consultation with IDA of apprupriate financial performance
targets for 1996 and thereafter; and (v) preparation by CFL its Balance Sheet reflecting its

Page 6 of 11
financial condition and showing details and appropriate values of its current assets, fixed assets
(which have been identified, inventoried and properly revalued), accumulated depreciation,
current liabilities, long term debt (which have been identified and properly revalued) and equity,
its Income Statement for the year showing operating revenues, operating, maintenance and
overhead expenses, depreciation and interest charges, and its Cash Flow Statement detailing
sources and application of funds.
Efficiency Improvements
19.   To ensure the sustained financial viability of operations, CFL needs to introduce systems
to (i) improve the rail share of long-distance traffic; (ii) induce effective availability and use of
resources, locomotive rolling stock and spare parts stock; (iii) increase reliability and security of
operations - the transport of goods without damage, pilferage, and delay and of passengers
punctually and in comfort; and (iv) respond fast to changing market conditions.
Govemment - CFL Relationshi,
20.   The government needs to exercise its responsibility as the sole shareholder more
effectively - without diluting CFL's autonomy - and ensure that (i) CFL works according to a
well-formulated strategic plan; (iii) CFL has the resources needed to implement the plan, and (iii)
CFL's performance is periodically reviewed until it is privatized.
21.   A future performance agreement should specify for CFL: (i) the operating norms to be
achieved; (ii) passenger and freight traffic forecast; (iii) assets and staff to be used, (iv) budgeted
revenue, expenditure, and working capital; and (v) expected progress in the implementation of
this project, IRE, and other projects financed or guaranteed by the government. Under the
agreement, the government should ensure (i) availability of funds for project elements to be
financed by the government; (ii) availability of the necessary foreign exchange; and (iii)
modification of legislation as necessary to facilitate implementation of staff rationalization plans.
The Project
22.   Proect elemnts-CFL. The CFL compofent of this project comprises (i) line rehabilitation
including rehabilitation of stations and other structures and replacement of 10 km of 45 kg/m rails
in critical sections, (ii) replacement of about 14,000 steel sleepers to begin the process of
reconditioning the distorted sleepers; (iii) making up the marginal deficiency of ballast of about
80,000 cubic meters; Civ) conversion of 20 drop-sided wagons for carrying containers; (v)
refurbishment of 18 coaches; (vi) rehabilitation of 3 main-line locomotives; and (vii) operational or
supervisory support comprising an operations specialist for 12 months, and two track rehabilitation
engineers for 12 months each.
23.   Proiect cost and financing. The total cost of the CFL component is estimated to be US$6.86
million with - a foreign exchange component of US$6.46 million and a local component of US$0.4
million. The entire foreign exchange component would be financed by IDA and other donors.
Details of the project elements and their costs are given in table A.S. 1.4,

Annex, S. I
Page 7 of 11
24.   Project implementation. The project would be implemented during a period of three years
starting in 1993. The preparation of technical specifications and bid documents would be supervised
by specialists provided under the technical assistance component of IRE for CFL. The actual
overhauling work of locomotives and coaches wowald be done in the railway workshops under the
supervision of experts proposed to be provided as part of the technical assistance. All work relating
to track rehabilitation and sleeper change, ballasting and change of rails would be done
departmentally with partial technical assistance.
25.   Procurement. For the IDA-financed portion, the rails and track materials are proposed to be
procured using ICB basis, locomotive proprietary spare parts using limited international bidding or
direct negotiation for proprietary spare parts, and technical and supervisory support on the same basis
as for hiring consultants. Procurement packages for goods would be (i) rails; (ii) steel or wooden
sleepers, (iii) track fittings; (iv) ballast, (v) locomotive spare parts; (vi) parts for conversion of
wagons to container wagons; and (vii) purchase of spare parts for refurbishing of coaches.
26.   Expected performance. Passenger and freight traffic between Luanda and Malange would
be completely restored, the expected traffic by the year 1995 being 125,000 tons or 50 million tons-
km per year for freight; and 390,000 long-distance passengers or 125 million passenger-km per year.
The operating ratio is expected to drop from the current level of 150 percent to 80 percent. Table
A.5.1.5 gives units and tariffs in 1992 US$ with tariff adjustment and the financial projections for
the period 1992-2000.
V.    CFM CompDonent
27.   Project elements-CFM.  This component has not been included in this project bIt on
confirmation of the requirements by the feasibility study under the IRE project, a reallocation of
funds may be envisaged at the time of the first-year review for (i) replacement of 10 km of 45 kg/m
rail in critical sections; (ii) replacement of about 50,000 wooden sleepers; (iii) making up the
marginal deficiency of ballast of about 50,000 cubic meters; (iv) rehabilitation of 5 main-line
locomotives, and (v) operational or supervisory support comprising one operations specialist for 12
months, and two track rehabilitation engineers for 12 months each.

TRANSPORT RECOVERY PROJECT
CAMINHO DE FERRO DE LUANDA (CFL)
PLAN OF ACTION - 1992 to 1995
1.    Maximizina market share of freight and oasuenaer traffic between Luanda
and Malanae
1.1         As a direct consequence of the war, the operations between Luanda and
Malange had to be discontinued. As a result, CFL lost a high percentage of its
market share to the highway system. Following implementation of the Bicesse
Agreements and completion of the work of clearing mines from the track, and
repairing track and bridges, the train operations between Luanda and Malange
started from August 28, 1991 and have continued since then. Traffic forecasts
and the actions required to be taken to sustain these operations are discussed
below.
1.2         Freiaht and Passencer Traffic Taroe  for 1993 to 1995:         T h e
freight and passenger traffic targets for 1993 to 199S is given below:
Freight (Tons)                        1993         1994        1995
Miscellaneous (Up)                   10,100       11,600      16,600

1.3         Develonment of transport cavacitvs
1.3.1       Locomotive and rollino stock recuirement: Considering the present
condition cf tho track, traffic projections, and turnaround of rolling stock, the
number of locomotives, wagons, and coaches required in sound operating condition
would be as follows:
1993        1994         1995
Locomotives                            9            9           9
Boxcars                               11           11          11

1.3.2       Locomotive and Rollina stock availabilitys        The current status
of the rolling stock is as follows:
Number   Operational   Inoperable   Repairable
of Units
Locomotives          17          9            8             3
Boxcars            200         107          93             20
Tankers              60         23          37             11
Container Cars       25         25                         20
Flatcars             52         25          27             15
Open Cars           141         60          81             20
Coaches              95         10          85             20
Baggage Cars         18          4           14             7
1.3.3       Action Plan:       Taking these numbers, the plan for repairing is
given in the following table.  The surplus stock would be kept in good storage
and the old stock in bad condition would be scrapped.
1993        1994
Locomotives                            1
Tankers                                4
Container Cars                        11           12
Coaches                                             8
Baggage Cars                                        4
Note: CFL locomotives were bought in 1966 and have never undergone
major repairM. The coaches also need overhaul.
1.4         Improve efficiency, reliability and safetv of operations:   Efforts
will be needed to make customers more confident that the service iu reliable so
that they prefer to use CFL rather than the highways. Clearly many factors will
be involved in achieving these objectives:
-     improving overall track condition
-     complying strictly with train departure and arrival schedules
-     freight safety.
1.5 Effective Marketina:
1.5.1       Passenger traffic:       The main thrust would be to attract low-
income travelers, whose basic needs are as follows:
-     traveling with baggage
-     no major need of speed
-     no major comfort demands
-     low travel cost

annelx 5.2
Page 3 of 7
1.5.2       Freoiht traffic:  The following actions would be taken:
* Major users           -    An exhaustive survey will be made of
potential customers, their needs,
expectations, willingness to pay
fares, and so forth.
-    Marketing would be directed toward
companies that offer large amounts of
freight over long periods of time,
and  freight  contracts  would  be
negotiated. The freight rates would
be lower for long-distance traffic.
Packaging systems would permit rapid
handling and fast car turn-around.
* Tariffe               -    A current listing of present fares
charged by highway competitLon would
be   kept   so   as   to   increase
maneuverability.
=    Each  user will be  treated  as  a
separate case.
* Tyne of Trains        -     Small freight customers and general
freight  in  particular  would  be
avoided since they usually lead to
low turn-around of rolling stock and
high administrative costs.
-     Preference would be given to clients
whose freight lends itself to unit
trains.
* Door-to-Door Service -    Considering the llmitations of rail
transport itself and, in an effort to
help clients, contracts would be
developed with small road companies
w,.o can deliver goods to client
warehouses from rall terminals.
2.    Imiorovina Operational and Financial Performance
2.1   The targets of operational and financial performance to be achieved during
the period 1992-1995 are indicated in table A,5.2.1.
3.    Investment_
3.1   For the period 1992-1995, the investment strategy will be aimed at
achieving the following objectives:
-     halt deterioration of Lnfrastructure
-     have immediate effects on the transport capacity
-     have immediate effects on lmproving rail safety
-     have ismediate effects on improving maintenance capabiLity
-     improve control and lower operating costs.
3.2  The major actions to be taken to achieve the above object17ea would
includes: (i) identification of the critical sections and prLoritizti.on; (ii)
independent inspection of the quality of rehabilltation work; (LiL) praparing a
schedule of completion of work; and (iv) Lnvolvement of the prlvate sector in the
various tasks as much as possLble.  The techno-economic viabLilty study is
expected to define the major approaches to be followed.

4.    CFL Oeerational and Financial Administrative Reoraanization
4.1   The entire administrative-financial area of the CFL is still operating with
completely obsolete and inefficient processes. A thorough change-over will be
required.
4.2   Qrcanizing CFL for Lona-Distance Traffic: Moving to a different commercial
strategy will entail a change in administrative and commercial procedures.It will
be essential to introduce a simple, reliable, efficiTet and rapid system that
can:
-     control all rolling stock and their locations
-     provide on-time billing
-     provide on-time collection
=      'determine  in  full  detail  the  freight  rates  charged  by  the
competitors.
Since the number of customers will fall drastically in terms of quantity but
increase greatly in terms of billing, data processing systems will have to be
installed. In 1993, the entire system can be studied and brought on line.
4.3   Close Commercially UnDrofitable Stations:  The change in the company's
commercial strategy will have an impact on the number of stations that remain
open. CFL has 32 stations along its tracks. These can be subdivided into the
following categories:
12 Commercially viable stations
6 Traffic support staticbns
14 Stations of no commercia' interest
Stations, having no commercial dealings, wiL'.l be closed to rail traffic or in
some cases, turned over to the track department for use as permanent track
maintenance facilities. This objective will be achieved in 1992.
4.4   Close Surplus CaDacitv or Make It Profitable:  As a direct consequence of
changing the commercial strategy, several facilities and capacities along the
line will go out et use. These will be rented to obtain additional income. This
activity will be concluded in 1993.
4.5   Unit Train Policy: Changes will be made in the types of train, depending
on the interest of customers, available stock and type of freight. In 1992,
contracts will be concluded with time frames to 1995 and in each case the type
of unit trains would be determined.
4.6   Improving the Decision-Making Process: This activity entails reorganizing
the company from a standpoint of down-sized structures and improving work methods
and procedures. In 1993 we intend to design a new system and in 1994, start the
work of training, retraining and hiring of additional staff so that the system
can start operation in 1995.
4.7   More Efficient Personnel and ProductivIs  At this time CIL has
approximately 2,100 employees. This number is too high for the length of track
in operation. By the end of 1993, the intention is to reduce the staff by 450,
leaving the final number at 1,650. This objective can be achieved as follows:
-    Eliminate personnel attached to CFL security and contract that
service with a specialized firm;



- 59 -
Annex 5.2
Page 5 of 7
-    Reduce the cleaning work force drastically and, as with the
preceding item, contract this service wherever necessary with a
specialized company;
-    Grant retirement to those who meet the age qualification.
-    Review the rules pertaining to track maintenance personnel.
-    Reduce the number of employees working in administrative areas and
services by improving organizational structure and using new data
processing systems.
-    Reduce drastically the number of buildings and grounds employees,
keeping only those who maintain buildings and other structures, and
use the services of private contractors for larger works.
-    improve the skills of remaining employees by work training programs.
-    Demand compliance with work contract obligations, specifically in
work schedules and absenteeism.
-    Develop the lists of commercially valuable stations and stations
that support rail traffic and those of no commercial value, and
close the latter.
4.8   The intention is to reduce employees by 135 in 1994 and by an additional
112 in 1995. Reaching these objectives depends on both internal and external
conditions, that is:
Internal Comipanv Conditions
-    Improvements in organizational system
-    More thorough use of data processing
-    improved maintenance systems for both the tracks and rolling
stock.
-    Higher technical qualifications of the present labor force and
introduction of mechanized systems and reduction of manual
systems.
External Factors:
-    A personnel reduction policy also implies an increase in the
quality of the labor force. It would, therefore, be necessary
to make changes in wages as follows:
1992        1993        1994         1995
a) Average Wage
per year (US$)       700          890         1,039        1,130
b) Payroll as
Percentage of
Billing               65%          50%         45%          40%
c) Other Personnel
Expenditures as
Percentage of
Billing               14%          12%         10%           8%
d) Number of Workers    2,100        1,650       1,515        1,403
4.9   Institutional Factors
4.9.1 By-laws: The by-laws were approved by the Council of Ministers in April
1992. Modifications will be made as required during the implementation period.
4.9.2 Railroad Regulations:  By 1994, all the railroad regulations will be
completed and approved.

4.9.3 AEgete: In 1993, an exhaustive survey of assets will be made and recorded
ln the appllcable records offices.  In 1994 and 1995, their values will be
determlned and reassessed.
4.9.4 Contract Programs A performance agreement wlll be signed between CFL and
the Government of Angola by December 1992. This document will, lnter alia, cover
the followings
- Tariff pollcy
- Tax policy
- Foreign exchange allocation polLcy
- C-verage of losses in components of the CFL that are
reactivated at the request of the government
- Policy on use of profits and losses
- Determination of who will be liable for payment of charges
arioing from damages caused by acts of war.

TRANSPORT RECOVERY PROJECT
Port of Lobito Component
I1.          Introduction
1.           Lobito is a natural harbor on the west coast of Africa, offering a large protected
anchorage in Lobito Bay and a wide, deep entrance channel from the Atlantic Ocean. The bay
is 5 kms long and between 1 kilometer and 2 kms wide. It is protected from the Atlantic Ocean
by the five-kilometer-long sand spit, Restinga de Lobito, which slopes steeply toward the bay.
The bay's southeast shore, toward the mainland has a miuch flatter bottom slope. Thus the
navigable section of the bay is nearest the Restinga, where the maximum water depth is almost
40 meters. The entrance channel at the end of Restinga is 23 meters deep in the middle and wide
enough to permit an easy approach for ships. The entrance is, however, constantly narrowing
because of sedimentation at the end of the sand spit. At present, the minimIum widu between
the 12 meters contours is approximately 300 meters.
2.           The Port of Lobito has a total deep water quay length of 1,122 meter equivalent
to six berths, and a 155-meter-long coastal quay. The main port area comprises 208,000 square
meters with 55,500 square meters behind the 570 meter-long North Quay and 125,000 square
meters behind the 552-meter-long South Quay. Sheds and warehouses contain approximately
27,640 square meters of covered storage for ordinary general cargo, 14,110 square meters of
which are along the South Quay. One grain silo with a capacity of 20,000 tons including
conveyor belts and a bulk loader at the quay with a capacity of 400 tons per hour is also
available.
3.           In January 1989 a ten year development plan for the Lobito Port Transport
System, prepared by SATCC, was presented at a donor's conference in Luanda, where the donors
pledged US$ 68 million for the project. The Lobito Port Transport System (LPTS) comprises
the Port of Lobito and the Benguela Railways. The main goal of the system is to handle medium-
term transit and national traffic demand with existing facilities more or less by maximizing their
availability and utilization, by creating a commercially viable entity free from reliance on
government support or interference and by ;stablishing managerial, operating, and staff
development systems that will induce professional excellence in the system's operations. A
rcond objective is to establish a basis for future upgrading and expanding the system as needed
to efficiently cope with projected long term demand.
4.           An advance under Project Preparation Facility agreed to by the World Bank in
May 1990, is helping the Port of Lobito undertake a feasibility study to enable the Lobito
Corridor Authority to begin a full rehabilitation and upgrading of the port and the inland transport

system. The selected consultant, TRANSMARK-PARTEX, begun providing services in early
February 1992, and the study should be completed in September 1992. Given the complexity of
the LPTS, it is not foreseen that recommended improvements or investments resulting from the
study will take effect in less than three years.
5.           Although the scale of operations is small compared with the peak year of 1973,
and additionz; heavy investments is needed in infrastructure, equipment, and institutional
development, the Port of Lobito can become commercially viable if, (i) the Port of Lobito and
the government remain committed to the goal of commercial viability; (ii) the government eases
the r .gulatory controls imposed, to provide greater autonomy and operational freedom; (iii) the
Port of Lobito is properly restructured; (iv) investments to rehabilitate the existing assets and for
new assets are undertaken only after a rigorous technical and financial analysis consistent with
commercial viability; and (v) an action plan to increase operational efficiency and resource
productivity is formulated and implemented.
6.           The rapidly changing economic, commercial, and political environment in Angola
has already begun to affect the performance, attitudes, and business strategy of the Port of
Lobito. The recent devaluation of the New Kwanza has resulted in demand for higher wages and
salaries by the Port staff and higher local spending at all levels. The pressure of increasing costs
is making management appreciate the need for restructuring the port and undertaking drastic cost
reductions.
H.           Current Status and Issues
7.           The port, which currently employs a staff of about 2,250, urgently needs help to
operate the next few years, particularly with regard to the handling of containers, repairs and
maintenance of equipment, and technical assistance to improve operational and administrative
systems.
8.           Traffic through the port peaked at 2,6 million tons in 1973 and has, sinr , 1979,
fluctuated between 600,000 and 390,000 tons. In 1991 the port handled 461,000 tons oi general
cargo, mainly imports (92%), of which 140,000 tons were liquid petroleum products. The
containerization ratio in year 1991 was 15 percent and the port handled a total of 6,219 TEUs
(full imports/exports and empties). In total 663 vessels called at the port in 1991, most being
small cabotage and fishing vessels; most of the general cargo traffic was carried by 219
multipurpose and ro/ro vessels.
9.           Although high proportion of the non bulk traffic through Lobito can be
containerized, only about 4 percent was containerized 1987. By 1991, however, almost 7 percent
was containerized, with container penetration increasing at about 35 percent yearly in the previous
five years. The critical determinant of future container traffic is the speed of penetration rather
than the overall growth of traffic. The penetration, in turn, is determined by the access to and
the effectiveness of inland transport and transshipment facilities in handling containerized cargo.
One major obstacle to a faster pace of containerization in the Lobito area has been the lack of
access to the hinterland served by the port. Container traffic has increased from 1,115 TEUs in



- 64 -
Anneic 6.1
Page 3 of 7
1987 to 6,219 (54,000 tons) in 1991; 25 to 30 percent of the containers are shipped on coastal
vessels.
10.          The traffic projections up to the year 2000 are based on a conservative growth
rate of imports at 5 percent per year for dry cargo and 10 percent for petroleum products. The
export volume, which has been very low, is expected to grow at a rate of 10 percent per year,
with an additional 125,000 tons of timber by 1995. The overall forecast projects that container
traffic will continue to grow rapidly to reach almost 12,000 TEUs by year 1995.
11.          One major problem affecting the ship-to-shore operations of containers is the
setdement of considerable portions of the paved areas behind berths 5 and 6. The port has in
recent months repaired the inner crane rail beam, which now will allow the only quay crane to
handle twenty-foot containers to move along the major length of the quay. The pavement,
however, is still unsuitable for operating heavy equipment, and the problem of these settlements
has to be permanently solved.
12.          Cargo-handling equipment is old and has not been well maintained. This is mainly
because of a lack of spare parts and a shortage of foreign currency to acquire required parts.
Equipment availability is currently around 29 percent for fork lift trucks and between 35 and 45
percent for tractor and trailers. The extremely low equipment availability particularly is
hampering the container operations, and, as of February 1992 the port has only one operating
heavy machine to handle containers at the quay apron and in the stacking yard. For general
breakbulk cargo operations, the situadon is similar. Only two of more twenty Hyster forklift
trucks (4.5 tons) are operational.
13.          In the past the working ratio - operating cost excluding depreciation/operating
income - exceeded 100 percent, which means that the estimated operating ratio would have been
much higher, showing a deficit for the port activities. Tariffs, common for all ports in Angola,
have recently been revised and new tariffs took effect on January 15, 1992. Ship services
(pilotage, tug-services, and harbor dues) and stevedore services (ship-to-shore handling) are now
invoiced in foreign currency and would - based on the 1992 - traffic forecast for the Port of
Lobito generate US$12 million in foreign currency. 1/ Total revenues, including services
invoiced in local currencies (yard handling and storage) would, however, stiUl not allow for
acceptable working and operating ratios because of the exchange rate applied, although this rate
was recently modified to 1 US$ = 550 Nkz. The port will therefore, with current tariffs and
exchange rate, not be in a position to allow for proper maintenance and depreciation on assets,
and need to be subsidized by the Government for the shortfall. More seriously, however, is
scarce allocation of foreign currency for the port to acquire required spare parts for repairs and
maintenance of equipment. This has been a serious constraint in the past resulting in deferred
maintenance and a huge amount of equipment broken down. The port would for the period up
to 1995 need around 0.5 million US$ dollars per year in foreign currency to acquire spare parts
for keeping the existing old equipment in operation. Improved access to foreign currency has
L/ Based on calculations carried out by Port of Lobito's finance department.

been addressed in the Action Plan 1992-1995 (Annex 6.2  where the port will be allowed to
retain US$ 0.5 million equivalent of its foreign currency earnings per year to acquire spare part
and replacement equipment. The annual revision of the tariffs will correct for exchange rates
applied.
m.           Institutional and Staff Develogment
14.          If no immediate action is taken to improve cargo handling efficiency at the Port
of Lobito, traffic through the port most likely would stagnate at the current level. Any furter
increase in traffic would result in rapidly rising ship waiting time, and would cause severe
congestion in the port. The need to act in next th-ee years has been discussed with the port
authority. The lort's management must move to meet the new conditions in inernational
shipping and cargo handling technologies. One prominent shortcoming has been a lack of
attention to developing the staffing capacity, in management skills and skills of various other
levels. Tenluical assistance in different capacities is thus urgently required.
IV.          The Pronec
15.          The objective of the project component for Port of Lobito is to help the port
improve the container traffic operations and to enhance the management skills to operate the port
efficiently - particularly for the increasing container traffic. In
general, the project will contribute to the important objective of developing improved transport
links for the hinterland served by the port.
ProAect Scope
16.          The project will provide financial assistance for the following components:
(a)    Civil and Electrical works
The port infrastructure urgently needs repairs and maintenance,
particularly in resolving the settlement in the areas behind berths S and 6. Also
the electrical system has to be upgraded temporarily until the long term program
for the port materializes.
(b)    Equipment and spare Darts
The port of Lobito has been allocated only USS 150,000 in foreign
currency in the past three years to acquire spare parts, which is insufficient to
maintain and repair equipment. The consequence of deferred mantenance is the
currently non-operational fleet of fork lift trucks and tractor and trailers. The
urgendy needed spare parts would be adequate to put most of the required
equipment into operation for the next three yeas. Ihis component also Includes



- 66 -
Ann& &1
Page 5 of 7
some workshop equipment to carry out the repairs and maintenance of hydraulic
and electrical components. Although the acquisition of spare parts and the
rehabilitation of existing equipment will allow the port to operate more
efficiently, the port still suffers from a general shortage of equipment to handle
and operate container traffic, which is increasing steadily. Proposed for the
emergency program are two heavy forklift trucks or equivalent equipment - 42
tons with telescopic spreaders - to handle full containers, and three tractors
including six trailers to transfer containers between the quay apron and the
stacking yard. The port of Lobito is, together with the ports of Luanda and
Namibe, also hampered by the poor communication between the ports and ships
and the harbor master offices. This component thus provides for improved radio
communication as well.
(c)    Design. Supervision and Technical Assistance
Shortcomings in operations and maintenance are evident in most port
activities, and the importance of maintenance and its cost are not fully recognized
by the government and the port management. Weaknesses in institutional,
administrative, and managerial procedures are a greater bottleneck than the lack
of spare parts and skilled staff. Technical assistance is needed to introduce
improved operational and administrative systems that would increase productivity
and reduce ship waiting and service time and cargo dwell time. Technical
assistance is also required to help identify and purchase spare parts and to
supervise repairs and maintenance of equipment. The program provides for
technical assistance in ports administration and finance; ports operation and
statistics; identification and procurement of spare parts; equipment repairs and
maintenance; and civil works maintenance.
Consulting services are provided to assist in the detailed design and supervision
of repairs and maintenance of civil and electrical works - and of technical
specification and bidding documents for new equipment.
The technical assistance team will provide on-the-job training. A small
component is also included for other urgent training needs to be determined in
the first year.
The total project cost, including the contingency allowance, is estimated at US$
7.11 million, of which US$ . 35 million would be the foreign exchange
component.
Implementation
17.          The project is expected to be implemented within three years and completed by
the end of 1995.

Annex 6. 1
Page 6 of 7
Inefits
18.          The proposed project will have three types of benefit. First, the project will
increase the capacity of Port of Lobito, allowing it to accommodate the expectA3d growth in
containerized cargo at least until 1995, instead of reaching full capacity by 1993. Second, the
project will facilitate the continued increase of general break-bulk cargo through Lobito, with
accompanying savings in ship turnaround time, onward transportation and other costs. Third,
institutional reforms, spare parts, and a few pieces of container-handling equipment, wil improve
productivity in both container and general-cargo handling. Quantifiab!a benefits would be (i)
reduction in ship service time and waiting time and avoidance of the increased costs or lost
revenues from extra cargo handling or having to route traffic through other modes of transport,
(ii) reduction in the average dwell time of containers, and (iii) lower insurance costs. These
benefits are necessarily linked: for instance a reduction in dwell time provides direct savings to
the importer in the form of lower capital and demurrage costs, but also increases the capacity of
the container traffic, allowing greater containerization - reduced insurance and handling costs -
and lower berth occupancy in the conventional cargo area (reduced ship-waiting time).

TRANSPORT RECOVERY PROJ=CT
ort of Lobi
Action Plan 1992-1995
1.    The port component of the Transport Recovery Project (TRP), co-financed by CCCE,
DANIDA anc. iDA, will include the following immediate investments: (i) repairs to berths S and
6, including heavy-duty pavement adjacent to the quay apron; (i) upgrading of part of the
electrical system; (iii) additional heavy container handling equipment and urgent required spare
parts; (iv) consultant services; and (v) technical assistance and training (administration and
finance, port operations and statistics, equipment repairs and maintenance). The total cost is
estimated at US$7.1 milion.
2.    The project, to be implemented between 1992 and 1995 will increase the capacity of th.
port allowing it to accommodate expected growth in traffic, particularly container traffic, at least
until after 1995.
3.    Central to a successful implementation of the TRP component and to improved port
efficiency is a fundamental change in the management of the port and the relationship between
the government and the port, which is reflected in this agreed action plan for the period 1992-
1995.
4.    Lobito Port is aiming at achieving commercial viability, a sufficient return on capital after
meeting all operating expenses and providing for adequate depreciation. This commercial viability
objective requires a focus mainly on:
(i) improving the efficiency of port management by applying modern management
practices, defining indicators, and setting performance targets; (ii) improving port
operations and technical services and promoting port safety and environmental control;
(iii) promotinj human resource development; and (iv) improving maintenance of port
assets.
5.    To meet the demand for greater autonomy and higher efficiency for the port, the
following major actions have been agreed upon:
(a) a Board of Directors will be appointed by the govornment and greater autonomy and
operational freedom, supported by appropriate, measurable objectives and indicators will
be elaborated for the port;
(b) the port wil be allowed to retain USS 0.5 million equivalent of its foreign currency
eanings per year to acquire spare parts and replacement equipment;
(c) the port to be allowed to open an overseas account in convertible currency to be used
for (b) above;



- 70 -
Annex 6.2
Page 2 of 6
(d) cost based tariffs to be revised once a year and timely approved;
(e) budgets for each year to allow for adequate provisions to carry out maintenance of
equipment and infrastructure as well as to meet the local cost component of the TRP
project;
(f) the port to change the management structure to enable the organization to respond
promptly and effectively to changes in maritime technology and commerce - including
the preparation and adoption of a revised organizational structure that incorporates such
principles as delegation, clear lines of communication, individual accountability, and
responsibility;
(g) cost accounting, budgetary control, operations and maintenance, marketing and other
management reporting systems will be revised to address the refinements resulting from
the improved management structure;
(h) clear financial and other performance targets for all departments, units, and
individuals to be set, with ar,propriate monitoring procedures to ensure that the targets
are achieved;
(i) procedures and facilities - with the appropriate resources - tc ensure the strict
observance of regulations on safety and environmental protection to be introduced;
(j) preblems of asset management and maintenance to be addressed and the institutional,
organizational, staffing and technical constraints to introducing improved maintenance of
assets to be identified, particularly for equipment and infrastructure maintenance.
(k) a staffing plan to be prepared to ensure that the work force meets the port's
requirement in terms of numbers, skills, and abilities with a policy ensuring that the - )rt
recruit suitable qualified personnel and develop employee motivation, discipline, and
accountability.
6.     An overall progr?mn for the restructuring activities is shown in Appendix 1. The program,
which will commence ir imediately, includes the following detailed components:
(a)    Business portfolio, The business plan will focus on serving container traffic,
rationalizing the cabotage activities, and implementing a rigorous collection of
receivables policy.
(b)    Port infrastructure: The focus is on improving the use and maintenance of
existing port facilities.
(c)    Operating assets: The focus is on making an inventory of existing equipment to
conduct a rehabilitation program, and segregate, scrape, and remove from port
assets old equipment and facilities. Port equipment requiremen. up to the year
2000 will be identified on the basis of traffic projections and efficient handling
systems and an optimal investment plan.



-71-
Page 3 of 6
(d)    Operations: Focus on improving planning and supervision of ship-to-shore and
yard operations, reducing cargo dwell time, and facilitating cargo offtake by
different modes of transport. Operations would include analyzing options for
restricting the current activities to those that are essential for efficient port
management and seeking alternate arrangements - including private sector
Involvement for different services. Experience from the privatization of terminal
operations in port of Luanda will be monitored and evaluated before such a set-
up will be introduced in Lobito.
(e)    Staff rationalization: Redundant staff will be retired tn phases to the level needed
to operate the port efficiently. It is envisioned that the port will operate the
forecasted traffic up to 1995 with no more than approximately 2,000 employees.
(f)    Accounting: On the basis of recommendations resulting from the ongoing and
progressed feasibility studies of the transport/port agencies, the port will employ
consultants by April 1, 1993 on terms of reference satisfactory to IDA (i) to
upgrade by December 31, 1994 the existing financial and accounting practices
to an integrated and transparent accounting and costing system and management
information systems, which would also incorporate appropriate steps for the
effective accounting for inflation and which would enable the timely extraction
and circulation of balance sheet, income statament, cash flow, and management
reports on budgets and costs; (ii) to establish appropriate financial objectives and
financial performance targets as detailed below in paragraph (h) section -
financial; and (iii) to train the port accounting staff  in all of the above
activities.
(g)    Financial:  In conjunction with the consultants' work referred to earlier in
paragraph (f), section - accounting, the port will establish the following financial
objectives and performance targets: (i) normalization and rationalization of
operating costs through implementation of continuing cost reduction policies; (ii)
introduction of market inflation and cost recovery based tariffs that are both in
terms of their structure and levels designed to generate annually revenues
sufficient to cover the operating, maintenance, and overhead expenses and
depreciation or debt service obligations (interest and repayment of principal)
whichever is higher; (iii) internal cash generation sufficient to cover annually its
debt service obligations and a return on equity; (iv) achievement in the near term
of a working ratio (operating, maintenance, and overhead expenses excluding
depreciation and long term debt interest divided by operating revenues) of 75%
for year 1993 and 65 % by 1995; and (v) starting in 1993 preparation by the port
annually as at December 31, of its balance sheet reflecting its financial conditions
and showing letails and appropriate values of its current assets, fixed assets
which have been identified, inventoried and properly revalued less accumulated
depreciation, current liabilities, long term debt and equity which have been
identified and properly revalued, and equity, its income statement for the year
showing operating revenues, operating, maintenance and overhead expenses,
depreciation and interest charges, and its cash flow statement showing sources
and application of funds, and forward these statements to IDA after audit
annually within six months after year end.

The comparison of total empties to full containers In the past five years shows a ratio of between 0.42 and
0.68. This high ratio Is mainly because of the Imbalance between Import and export cargo. Up to 1995 this
ratio is not likely to decrease significantly. In estimating the total containers to be handled to year I 995,a flat
ratio of 0.6 has been applied. The total, Including full and empties, forecast to be handled In 1995 Is thus
7,396 x 1.6= 11,834 TEUs.

Freight-Forwarding and Insurance Studies
10.           Obiectives. The proposed freight-forwarding part of the study is intended to:
(i)    Encourage the growth of domestic transport intermediary professions
- freight-forwarding, port handling, customs brokerage, and ship
agency - by increasing international network coverage, financial
responsibility, and professional liability.
(ii)    Review the preferences in Angolan terms of trade (exporting
FOB/importing CIF), diagnose the rationale for current practices, and
evaluate the financial effect of current trade practices on Angolan
trade balances (nonfactor services).
(iii)   Propose training programs for domestic freight-forwarding entrants,
offer a strategy for developing domestic freight-forwarding capacity,
estimate potential gains in future trade balances from reversing present
terms of trade, and propose options for reaching the objectives
described in (ii) above.
11.          To achieve the objectives, the consultant should:
(i)    Evaluate the current financial and operational efficiency of the freight-
forwarding industry and transport-intermediary professions.
(ii)    Evaluate the influence of current terms-of-trade contracting practices
in nonfactor seivices - foreign currency flows - and the potential for
improvement through increased efficiency and penetration of domestic
freight-forwarding.

- FIATA, UNCTAD, and others - and proposz the most suitable
long-term approach for Angola.
(v)    Draft, prepare, and substantiate changes in the commercial law to
produce more cost-effective and updated liability provisions, terms and
conditions of carriage and general freight-forwarding related practices.
(vi)   Substantiate freight-forwarding and training proposals in a coherent
program suitable for potential FIATA or UNCTAD implementation.
12.          Objectives. The proposed insurance part of the study is to:
(i)    Evaluate the financial effects of introducing competitive insurance
practices in imports and exports.
(ii)    Evaluate the prospects for privatization of ENSA, the national
insurance company.
(iii)   Review insurance regulations and propose regulations better suited to
world market conditions.
13.          To achieve the objectives, the consultant should:
(i)    Review insurance regulations and draft regulatory proposals to
encourage free market competition.
(ii)   Evaluate the effects of liberalization of the insurance market on the
cost of imports and exports.
(iii)   Evaluate the prospects for privatization of ENSA and draw plans -
including a financial plan - for further evaluation by the GOA.
(iv)   Summarize short-, medium-, and long-term recommendations for the
liberalization and privatization of insurance.
14.          The study of freight-forwarding is expected to require about five staff-months
of consulting effort within three months - and the study of insurance is expected to require
about five additional months of consulting effort within the three-month period from the
notice to proceed to the draft final report.

Coordination. Monitoring. and Reporting
Coordination and Execution
1.         Eleven ministries, national directoraL. s, state enterprises, and other governmental units
will benefit from the project in Angola, and will be involved in the coordination and execution of its
four main componentc. They are listed below:
(i) Ministry of Planning (MINPLAN)
-    National Directorate of Investments and Construction,
(ii) Ministry of Transport & Conununications (MINTEC)
-    Bureau of Planning
-    National Directorate of Railways
-    Luanda Railway (CFL)
-    Lobito Corridor Authority
-    National Directorate of Merchant Marine and Ports
-    Port of Lobito
(iii) Ministry of PubUc Works & Urban Development (MINOeU)
-    Angola Highway Institute (INEA)
Direct charge for general coordination and specific project components rests with three
ministries. The Ministry of Planning (MINPLAN) is project coordinator. The Ministry cf Public
Works and Urban Development (MINOPU) is responsible for the road and bridge component, and
for the training of SMEs in labor-intensive road maintenance works. And the Ministry of Transport
and Ccmmunications (MINTEC) is in charge of the transport study component, the Luanda Railway
and - with the Lobito Corridor Authority - the Lobito Port component. Each project component
will be the responsibility of a specifically designated component coordinato. MlNPLAN's National
Directorate of Investments and Construction wil be responsible for ovdll prioect coordinatin, and
will chair a Rroject steering gi    . The committee will include the four component coordinators,
as well as representatives designated by the Ministry of Finance and the Angolan Central Bank - and
will meet twice a month to guide, coordinate, and facilitate project execution. Each component
coordinator will develop a six-month action plan and schedules for each component, submit them for
annual review by the steering committee, and forward them to IMA for comments.
2.         Implementation agreements will be signed before effectiveness. These agreements will
stipulate responsible ministries and will give individual component ccordinators ample powers to
manage, monitor, audit, and report on the execution of their respective individual components. They
should include: (i) identification of the ministry or agency responsible for executing each project
component, (ii) descriptdon of necessary coordination mechanisms, and Cil) assignment of local

counterparts to be made available to work and receive training under the project. The government
has designated the Ministry of Planning as its official representative in connection with projects
supported by the International Development Association. For the project, MINPLAN will grant
araple powers to the Nadonal Directorate of Investments for overall coordination, monitoring,
auditing, and the reporting of operational and financial performance to the government and IDA as
frequendy and in as much detail as was agreed upon at the credit agreement negotiations and specified
in the implementation agreements. Following are the four expected implementation agreements and
the participants:
(i)   Road and Bridge Rehabilitation Inplementation Agreement
-    MINISTRY OF PLANNING, with the
-    MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT
-    Angola Highway Institute (INEA), Coordinatr and IMlemendng AgenS
(ii)  Lobito Port Operations Rehabilitation Imnplementation Agreement
-    MINISTRY OF PLANNING, with the
-    MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATIONS
-    Lobito Corridor Authority, Coordinator
-    Port of Lobito, Implementing Agency
(iii) Luanda Railway Recovery Inpi;ementation Agreement
-    MINISTRY OF PLANNING, with the
-    MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATIONS
-    Bureau of Planning, Coordinator
-    Luanda Railway (CFL), Imhementing Agency
(iv) Institutional Support (Transport Studies)

3.         The Project Implementation Unit established for the Infrastructure Rehabilitation
Engineering (IRE) Project within the Directorate National of Investments and Construction of
MINPLAN, reporting directly to the Minister of Planning, will provide secretarial administrative
support to the overall project coordinator and to the project steering committee. Members in place
for the IRE until December 1995 include a general adviser, a training adviser, an administrative and
financial adviser, and an environmental adviser. This team of experts is expected to help with project
implementation and overall coordination also of this project. To facilitate coordination of-and provide
guidance to - the transport agencies involved, one additional staff person-a transport exgcr- will
be hired from the same consulting firm that provides the personnel for the IRE. The responsibilities
and procedures of the project implementation unit (PIU) - and the terms of reference for the
transport expert - were agreed upon during negotiations. The transport expert will be in place before
the project begins. The transport expert will be responsible for coordinating and monitoring all of
the project, particularly for monitoring compliance with component action plans and schedules,
procurement monitoring, and technical assistance-and records and accounts in the individual
components and for the overall project. He or she will establish reporting procedures and periodic
auditing arrangements as agreed upon by the government and IDA.
Accountinegand Audits
4.         The government will establish consolidated project accounting, together with individual
component accounting. The PIU will maintain records and accounts for all project components, while
the component coordinators will maintain records and accounts for every element in each component.
Accounting should adhere to accepted accounting principles and should record all project
expenditures, commitments, reimbursements, and the status of project funds. Accounts will be
subject to annual audit by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and submitted to IDA no later than
six months after the close of the financial year. The audit report will include a separate paragraph
on the auditors' opinion about the amounts withdrawn from the projewt Special Account. Reporting,
accounting and auditing arrangements were agreed upon at negotiations.
Reporting and Monitoring
5.         Each component coordinator should submit to the project steering committee quarterly
execution reports for each project component - summarizing progress achieved, problems
encountered, solutions proposed, and changes or adjustments to be made. The committee will review
progress against plans and take appropriate corrective actions. Agendas and minutes of committee
meetings will be prepared by the PIU and transmitted to IDA to facilitate project supervision.
rroject Reporting Requirements
6.         The Borrower will prepare quarterly and annual progress reports to be submitted to
IDA. The quarterly report will be submitted not later than one month after the end of each reporting
quarter and the annual report no later than March 31 of the following year. The annual report will
include a synthesis of the quarterly reports and a forecast of activities and expenditures for the
following year. The proposed reporting format's objective is to merge the reporting requirements of
all project activities.

Progress Reports
7.         The progress reports shall contain information about works implemented, productivity
indicators achieved, and actual financial performance. This information will have to be matched with
the target achievements, shown in the operating action plans, the key indicators (Annex 9) and
detailed timetables (Annex 11). The required information is outlined below:
7.1.        ='orks implemented. The main activities to be reported are:
(i)   The physical progress up to and during the reporting period, by component,
including:
-    Main activities programmed, monitored, and implemented for each
component.
-    Status of contract award; contract reference and amount; dates of
approval, effectiveness, and completion; amount invoiced during review
period cumulated, and payment dates; explanation for any delays; amount
of updated forecast final payments compared with initial forecast.
-    Cost of each type of work.
-    Follow-up on technical assistance.
-    Status of studies.
-    Other key information that is not provided by the quantitative indicators.
(ii)  The estimates of physical progress and payments to be made in the next quarter.
(iii)  Progress on procurement of goods, materials, equipment, and services - status
of procedures, contracts, implementation rates of contracts, and status of invoices
and payments.
(iv)  Problems with procurement of civil works, information on difficulties
encountered and unforeseen events that have affected the implementation of the
program and solutions proposed.
(v)  Explanation of any deviations from the targets and implementation schedule -
and description of the corrective measures taken or being prepared.
(vi)  Expected changes in project completion date, if any.

Annex 10
Page 5 of 6
7.2.       PrQductivity indicators: The following reporting is recommended:
(i)   Productivity or efAiciency indicators - for each component, efficiency indicators
as stated in the component's Action Plan.
(ii)  Information on key staff changes in each component, or among consultants or
contractors.
(iii)  Status of action on each covenant of the Credit Agreement.
7.3.       Financial Performance. This portion of the report should cover:
(i)   Financial information on budget execution.
(ii)  Financial information on cost-reduction and cost-recovery policies, tariff
adjustments in U.S. dollars, and new kwanzas - compared with targets.
(iii) Financial information on each project component indicating the original estimated
cost; the revised cost, if appropriate; the actual expenditure; the planned
expenditures; and actual and planned withdrawals from the credit account;
(iv)  Status of action on each financial covenant of the Credit Agreement.
Final Report
B.         The Borrower will prepare a final report to be submitted to IDA not later than six
months after the closing date.
9.         The main objective of the final report is to reinforce the self-evaluation capacity of the
Borrower and IDA's operating departments and to facilitate dissemination of lessons learned through
the project. The report will examine and assess:
(i)   The performanct by the Borrower and the Association of their respective
obligations under the Credit Agreement and whether the Association could have
been more helpful.
(ii)  Results that can be expected from the project, compared with expectations at
appraisal - and whether the original expectations were realistic.
(iii)  Whether in retrospect, the project was worthwhile and could have been done
better.
10.        For project components for which a tate of return was estimated during appraisal, the
report should contain a revised estimate of the rate of return of the project analyzing the reasons for
physical or economic deviations. The revised rate-of-retur calculation, however, should be as simple
as possible and should aisorb only a minor portion of the time devoted to report preparation.
Information supporting this analysis should be included as an annex.

Environment Assessmeit gnd Mitigation Measures
1.           Angola's road and railway network is characterized by substantial physical
deterioration which harms both the provision of adequate transport services and the environment.
A lack of maintenance has resulted in extensive erosion, water stagnation, and increased hazards
for users; war activities have caused a large number of burned vehicle carcasses along roadsides,
and debris from destroyed bridges in river beds.
2.           Rehabilitation of this irfrastruczure is more likely to have a substantially positive
effect on the environment than a negative one, especially through the following works:
(i)    Removal of burned-out vehicle carcasses from roadsides.
(ii)   Removal of bridges debris from river beds.
(iii)   Clearing of brush and vegetation from road pavement, shoulders, and
ditches.
(iv)   Cleaning and repair of drainage facilities, and repair of damage caused
by erosion.
(v)    Restoration of destroyed road signs.
3.           Civil work projects, however, may harm the human and natural environment, if
not appropriately designed and executed. Poorly designed or executed work can lead to (i)
pollution of ground water and streams, (ii) borrow pits left in hazardous or erosion-prone
condition after completion of work, (iii) hazardous or ugly materis abandonned on workshop
sites or along roads or track, (iv) erosion risks caused by inappropriate dirt deposits and drainage,
and (v) traffic hazards during the works. Measures will be taken during design and execution
to minimize such risks. These measures will consist of clauses in (i) the terms of reference for
consultants hired for detailed design and work supervision, and (ii) the contrActs for work. Ihe
clauses will call for (i) proper design, operation and closing down of workshop and living sites
and storage facilities to prevent pollution, and (ii) adequate treatment of material deposits to limit
erosion and facilitate revegetation, and restoration of borrow pits and quarries after completion
of work.

Economic Evaluation
1.           Angola faces an immense reconstruction effort, but at the same time many
constraints to a widespread, short-term program. For this reason the project selection has been
based on a mix of economic and terhnical criteria. At the same time, data needed foi a normal
economic analysis have been limited - pardy by the earlier d storted exchange rate and also by
limitations in other information. For example, there have been no regular road traffic counts
since independence, nor any recent countrywide road condition survey.
2.           For all project components an overriding criterion for selection has been
investnents that could be carried out in the next two to three years and are urgently needed to
immediately restore main transport links. Thus, during the recent project preparation, all ports
and at least part of each railway system have been visited, and about 3.000 km of the pavA road
network - with the highest traffic potential, of the 8,000 km of paved roads in Angola - Iazve
been surveyed by either the appraisal team, teams of consultants, or both. Of twenty-seven sain
war-damaged bridges, nineteen have been inspected and six overflown at low altitude b-
helicopter. Two additional bridges could not be found by the helicopter pilots and survc,
engineer.
Road and BridgSe Rehabilitation Component
3.           As part of the creation of the INEA, main roads were classified in three ways,
based on expected future traffic:
Estrada Nacional (EN)            Average daily traffic
(vehicles per day)
100-199                          100-5,000
200-299                           50-800
300-399                          less than 100
One of the earliest actions in the project identification was to find - within the two first classes -
- the road sections needed to restore a main transport link that also could be completed within
two to three years. Roads that were already in good condidon, in need of complete
reconstruction, or subject to works already under way were eliminated at this stage. By this
process some 1,400 km were identified and cost-benefit estimates conducted for them. A set of
high priority road wcrks was thus proposed for the immediate project. ITis road rehabilitation
would produce a reduction in vehicle operating cost and - in some cases - a saving in future
reconstruction costs.



- 97 -
Annex 14
Page 2 of 7
4.           The savings in vehicle operating costs were only calculated for heavy vehicles -
in turn based on 1991 costs for a few of the most important road transport parastatals. Thus no
savings  r light vehicle traffic was included. These cost savings were in turn applied to traffic
est!nates derived from traffic counts of the 1970s. A separate table of these is provided (Annex
4). The current cost per ton-km is about US$0.19 or the equivalent of a cost per vehicle-km of
US$2.00. Savings have been estimated at about US$0.50 per vehicle-km for the heavy vehicles
included in the calculations. For the individual road sections the cost and benefits are shown in
table A 14.1.
5.           For bridge reconstruction the vehicle benefits have been calculated separately on
the same base of vehicle cost. These benefits and restoration costs have been computed for road
sections - with one or several bridges - mainly using the cost of additional distance for diverted
traffic, but in some cases also combined with extra costs for passage of only the lighter vehicles
or the costs of crossing the water course by ferry or canoe. First priority has been given to
bridges on roads proposed for resurfacing. For these bridge components in the project the cost
and benefits are shown in table A 14.2.
6.           The project has given priority to road resurfacing of lots IA and 2-and lot 3A,
funds permitting, including bridges on these roads - and bridges on lots 1B, 3B, and 3C. With
some 600 km of the main roads known to be in good condition; a program of 1,400 km of which
500 km are under this project; and another 300 km under reconstruction, using other financing,
there should be at least 2,300 km of roads covering two north-south roads in good condition as
a result of the project. The north-south roads would be Luanda-Sumbe-Lobito and Luanda-
Dondo-Alta Hama-Huambo-Lubango and the east-west links Luanda-Uige, Sumbe-Quibala,
Lobito-Huambo-Kuito, and Namibe-Lubango-Matala allow though-traffic at the end of the
program.
Railway Component
7.         - For the CFL railway - the investments have been related to the difference
between rail and road transport in transport costs. Road transport costs used for reference are the
same as those indicated above. The rail cost is the entire operating cost for the rail line - less
depreciation - based on separate forecasts for passenger and freight traffic. Passenger traffic in
this estimate has been expected only to cover the marginal cost of the service. In view of the
somewhat uncertain long-term future for this railway, the estimate only covers traffic for six
years - with a residual value for locomotives. The bases for the cost-benefit estimates are in
table A14.3.
Lobito Port Component
8.           At curreat traffic levels, this port has no congestion problem and only modest
ship time in port. Increased economic activity in the area and restoration of part of CFB could
increase traffic volume and thus lead to increases in service time and waiting time for free berths.
The proposed short-term investments in the port will increase the number of berths available and
also - by making more cargo-handling equipment available - decrease service time per berth.
This will also reduce the dwell-time for containers in the Lobito area. The savings have been



- 98 -
Page 3 of 7
quantified as ship cost savings - at international ship cost rates of US$6,000 per day in port -
and container savings, at container rental rates of US$S per day. Ibe basis for the cost-benefit
estimates are shown in table A14.3.
Sensitivity Tests
9.            To test the sensitivity of the vairous project component economic rate of return
calculations, separate estimates have been made, allowing for a possible increase of 10% in
investment costs or a decrease of 20% in estimated benefits (in real terms). The results of these
estimates are shown in table A 14.4.

Donor Coordinatiol
1.           Given the large sectoral needs for infrastructure rehabilitation and institutional develop-
ment, financial assistance to the transport sector of Angola will be provided by a large number of bi- and
multi-lateral donors. Donor coordination will be required to (i) ensure optimal use of resources, (ii) avoid
duplication of efforts and instead provide mutual support and cross-fertilization, and (iii) avoid
overburdening the weak local planning capacities. As is usual in other countries, donor coordination is
likely to be strong before and immediately after the project/program formulation and appraisal, and less
so afterwards. There is an obvious need for permanent donor coordination.
2.           Donors should meet - preferably every six months, and at least once a year - to review
progress in project implementation, discuss sectoral and project issues with government - and possible
measures to address such issues, and inform or consult each other on intended changes in the scope of
their assistance. These meetings should coincide with project supervision missions, and the planned
project implementation review. Donors who are not concerned with the current project but have
expressed interest in future involvement in the sector should be invited to attend the meetings and express
their views.
3.           The government will report on the total program incorporating several donor components,
using a format to be agreed upon between donors and the government, so that each donor is aware of
developments - financial and otherwise - affecting the totality of the program.
