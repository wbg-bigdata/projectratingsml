APPRAISAL OF S=AH PORTS PROJECT
SLIMARY AND CONCLUSIO7JS
i.        This report appraises a project for the construction of two new
ports in Sabah, and the provision of port equipment and the training of
port personnel. Sabah is one of the two states of East iMalaysia and is
situated in the northern part of the island of Borneo, 1,000 miles to the
east of West Malaysia. It is mountainous and covered with dense tropical
forests, a topography which emphasizes the importance of ports in the State's
transport system.
ii.       Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, where the new facilities are to be
constructed, are two of the largest ports in Sabah, handling some 60" of its
imports and 80S' of its exports. The existing facilities in both ports are
too small to handle even the present cargo volume. Furthermore, they are
too weak to support loads required by modern, efficient cargo-handling opera-
tions and are deteriorating rapidly. Consequently, port congestion is
increasing,
iii.      The project consists of:
(a) the construction in each of the ports of IXota Kinabalu and
Sandakan of about 1,750 ft of quay; a transit shed, ancillary
services, administrative and workshop buildings; consultant's
services for detailed engineering and construction supervision,
further soil investigations and hydrographic studies;
(b)  cargo-handling equipment at Kota Kinabalu, Tawfau, Sandakan
and three minor ports; and
(c) training schemes for Sabah Ports Authority (SPA) personnel.
The total cost is estimated at US$22.11 million equivalent, of which the
proposed loan, which would be made to SPA, would cover the foreign exchange
component (US$16.1 million).
iv.       The project is based on a USAID financed feasibility study made by
the consultants, hing & Gavaris (USA) for SPA. The detailed design will be
prepared by the same consultants who vill also assist SPA in evaluating the
bids and supervising construction. Contracts for the construction and supply
of equipment will be awarded on the basis of Bank guidelines. SPA will be
responsible for project execution.
V,        The ports of Kota Kinabalu and Tawau are already administered by
SPA under the jurisdiction of the State Minister of Communications and Works.
SPA is scheduled to take over Sandakan on July 31, 1971 and five other ports
during the next 18 months. Although the organization has so far been well



- ii -
nianaged, it recently experienced difficulty in filling senior staff vacancies
due to a shortage of experienced professionals throughout the public sector.
Should the problem recur temporary expert assistance may be needed to assist
and train SPA officers.
vi.       Traffic forecasts are difficult to establish due to lack of past
statistical records.  The proposed project aill, however, yield a satisfactory
economic return of 18, at Kota iUnabalu and 41V  at Sandakan even on the basis
of conservative traffic forecasts. Main benefits will be faster turnaround
of ships and lower handling costs.
vii.      In order to maintain a strong financial position, SPA agreed during
negotiations to achieve by 1977 an overall financial rate of return on net
fixed assets in use of not less than 7% and aim for a similar rate at each of
the project ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan.  Furthermore, SPA undertook
not to incur long-term debt unless net cash revenue is and will remain at
least 1 3/4 times the maximum debt service requirements. It will also
endeavour to ensure that each of its minor ports break even financially on
wharf operations.
viii.     The project is suitable for a loan of US$16.1 million to SPA over
20 years, including a four-year grace period. Substantial issues on which
agreement was reached during negotiations are summarized in Chapter 7.

APPRAISAL OF SABAH PORTS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Malaysia, in conjunction with the Sabah Ports
Authority (SPA), has requested Bank assistance in financing a project to
rehabilitate and expand the ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, provide
cargo-handling equipment for these ports and four other smaller ones and
finance training schemes for SPA personnel. Increasing congestion at these
ports, due to the rapidly deteriorating condition of their inadequate facil-
ities, threatens the growth of vital economic activities.
1.02      In 1963 and 1967, Messrs. Sir Bruce White, Wolfe-Barry and Partners,
Consulting Engineers, (London) presented reports to the Government of Malaysia
on the development of the ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan which pointed
out the inadequacy of the existing port facilities to handle expected cargo
growth and the measures required for improvement. In 1968, Messrs. R. Nathan
Associates (Washington D.C.), in their UNDP-financed report "Transport
Development in Malaysia", for which the Bank was executing agency, confirmed
the inadequacy of the existing facilities at both ports. Subsequently, at
the request of the Government, USAID commissioned King & Gavaris (USA)
consulting engineers, to prepare feasibility studies and preliminary designs
for rehabilitation and expansion of these ports. The report, issued in
September 1970, forms the basis of the proposed project. The project com-
prises, in each of the ports of Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, construction of
about 1,750 ft of quays, storage areas and ancillary buildings and services
at each port; cargo-handling equipment for these and four other ports, and
training for SPA personnel. Total costs are estimated at US$22.11 million
equivalent* The proposed loan of US$16.1 million equivalent would cover the
foreign exchange component.
1.03      The loan will be made to SPA and guaranteed by the Federal
Government. This will be the first Bank Group Transportation Project in
1alaysia.
1.04      A mission consisting of Messrs. Roberts (Economist), Rodley
(Financial Analyst) and Scheiner (Engineer), visited Sabah in November/December
1970, and appraised this project.
2. BACKGROUND
A. Country and People (Map 1)
2.01      Malaysia consists of 13 states; U1 are located in West Malaysia
and the remaaining two some 1,000 miles to the east. Sabah is in East Malaysia
and covers an area of about 30,000 sq miles (roughly the size of Austria) and
shares the northern part of the island of Borneo with the state of Sarawak,



- 2 -
and with the indopendent oil-rich sultsnate of Brunei.  To the south lie fouar
provinces cf Indonesia which cover most of the island's territory.
2,02      Sabah is predorinantly mountainous and covered with dense tropical
forests. It is traversed by several mountain ranges running in a south-
western to north-eastern direction in the western half of the state. The
swampy coastal plains are traversed by numerous rivers and streams, which are
frequently navigable only for shallow draft boats which are the sole means of
communication to many of the interior settlements. This topography makes
overland communication difficult and expensive, and emphasizes the importance
of ports in the Statets transport system.
2.03      Sabah's   population is estimated at about 650,o00 and growing at
3.7% per annum. Density is 22 per sq mi and the populated areas are generally
confined to the coastal plain. Kota Kinabalu, the capital, has some 4.O,000
inhabitants and Sandakan has some 50,O00 inhabitants.
B. The Economy
2.04      The Sabah economy conforms to the classic pattern of developing
tropical countries, exporting primary agricultural products and importing all
its consumer goods, capital equipment and supplies. It is in a much earlier
stage of development than West Malaysia.
2,05      In 1969 Sabah's exports were valued at MY  521 million (about 12% of
the Malaysian total), equivalent to about M$ 800 per capita.  The figure
represents a 20% increase over the value of 1968 exports, and nearly a 200%
increase over the 1959 figure. Timber represents the single most important
export, amounting to I'$ 376 million in 1969, or 72% of the value of total
exports. Consultants, financed with bilateral aid from the Canadian Govern-
ment are studying Sabah's forestry reserves and conservation policies. A
report is expected towards the end of this year.
2.06      Labor, especially skilled labor, is in short supply, particularly
on the east coast, where the rapid growth of the timber and palm oil indus-
tries absorbs most of the available supply. The 4alaysian Migration Fund
Board is encouraging the migration of agricultural labor from West Malaysia
to Sabah by incentives, such as a guaranteed daily wage at least 20% higher
than in West Malaysia. Nonetheless, there are not enough immigrants to
satisfy the demand and, unless the regulations against migration from outside
Malaysia are eased, labor supply may constrain future expansion of the export
industries.
2.07      There is no direct statistical evidence regarding the growth in
per-capita income, and the rapid growth in exports is not considered a
reliable index because of capital movements of uncertain size.
2.08      A Canadiia forostry expert advising the Sabah Government considers
that, despite the omergence of competition In timber from Kalimantan, Sabah
can achieve a growth in timber exports of at least 5% per annum, Based on
this, and evidence of active diversification of exports and export markets,



-3-
there is no reason to doubt the important contribution wihich Sabah will
continue to make to the Malaysian economy.
C. The Transport Sector
2.09      The development of Sabah's economic potential is dependent upon,
inter alia, improved access to the interior.  However, shortage of skilled
labor limits the rate of road building and, also, it is difficult to find
economic justification for highway construction because of high cost and low
traffic volumes. The high cost of road construction results from the rugged
terrain and soil and weather conditions. Low traffic volumes reflect the low
density of population and the concentration of economic activity in a few
isolated centers around the coast.
2.10      Of the I$ 700 million earmarked for the State under the Second
ialaysia Plan, roughly one-third will go to the transport sector.  Ports form
a vital link in the internal transport system, as well as in external trade,
because of the dispersion of population around the coast. Accordingly, the
Sabah Government, with the concurrence of the Federal Government, gives top
priority in its transport investment program to the maintenance of adequate
port facilities.
2.11      The Government generally establishes the priorities of highway proj-
ects on the basis of economic return, giving high priority to feeder roads and
roads for land development. As the mair, conters arc L.ot yet conr:ctAd by high-
ways, ro-ds bctaerc.n those cerntors :lso ruceiv_- fairly high pricrity bccadse
of their importanco .s an a1tcrnLtiv:, in passenger transport, to ships (which
are too slow) and to aircraft (which are too expensivo for many people).
Recently, there has been a rapid growth in urban traffic. However urban roads
are not given high priority unless it can be shown that congestion is causing
economic loss.
2.12      Air transport is given high priority because it provides the only
fast means of travel between main population centers within Sabah and between
Sabah and West Malaysia.
Ports
2.13      Although marine passenger service has declined, ocean and coastal
shipping remains the most important transportation mode. Imports of consumer
goods, capital equipment and supplies form the largest proportion of traffic
volumes over the wharves and are also transshipped from the major ports to
the minor ports. Timber, the largest volume commodity, is loaded in the
stream, and palm oil generally loaded either in the stream or at special
facilities.  Sabah's major ports, Kota Kinabalu, Sandakan, Tawau and Labuan,
are regularly served by ocean-going and coastal vessels of several shipping
lines. A number of the smaller ports have mainly local traffic, though a few,
such as Lahad Datu have important timber volumes. Coastal and feeder service
shipping are the area's primary means of transportation between East and Wlest
N4alaysia and from Singapore. The rivers in the state are widely utilized,
not only for passenger transportation bUt also for commodities, especially in
areas where roads are non-existent.



Roads
2.14      The present road system, though small, is not insignificant.  There
are some 300 miles of asphalt roads, 1,000 miles of gravel roads and 300 miles
of dry-weather roads and this network is being expanded at about 9% per anmnm.
The Twest coast population centers are well-connected by road systems but those
of the east coast are more or less in isolation. A 200 mile highway linking
Sandakan with Kota Kinabalu is being financed with bilateral aid from Australia,
and is expected to be completed in 1972.
Railways
2 .15     The only railway line in East Malaysia is that of Sabah State
Railways wthich extends for only 100 miles on Sabah's west coast. In 1969
the railway carried 750,000 passengers and 90,000 tons of cargo.
Air Transport
2.16      The Malaysia-Singapore Airlines (N4SA) provides most air services
to Sabah.  Its modern jets serve all the major states in Mlaysiats ter-
ritory and link them with numerous countries in Asia and the Southern Hemi-
sphere, making it an important airline in the area. It has been agreed be-
tween the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore that MSA will be split between
them. However, this is not expected to affect services to Sabah. Sabah's
major international airport - Kota Kinabalu - can handle trijets and is being
expanded to handle large four-engined jets. Sabah's domestic air route net-
work includes regularly scheduled flights between towns on the west and east
coast.
3. PORT ORGANIZATION, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS
A. Organization (Chart - Annex 1)
(i) Administration
3.01      SPA was set up in December 1967, on the advice of a United Nations
Port Advisor, to provide, maintain and manage efficient port services and
facilities in the State. SPA has effectively operated the port of Kota
Kinabalu since December 1968 and the port of Tawau since January 1970. The
State Government agrees to SPA extending its operatians to Sandakan port by
July 31, 1971, followed by Lahad Datu, Semporna, Kunak and Kudat by the enid of
1971 and Labuan by late 1972 (Map 2). This timetable is largely determined
by SPA management's staffing capability.



3.02       SPA is directly responsible to the State Minister of Communications
and Works who, in turn, is responsible to his Federal Government counterpart
in respect of Federal financed projects. SPA is managed by a Board consisting
of a chairman, deputy chairman and eight members, twro of whom must be public
service officers. Port users are adequately represented on the Board. Its
budgets do not require Government approval but the State ministerts consent
is required to borrow money.
3.03       The Federal and State Governments of Malaysia are upgrading the role
of Malays and other indigenous people, such as the Kadazans of Sabah. In
November 1970, in pursuance of this policy the position of chief executive of
SPA, which was then a dual one termed Chairman/General Manager and was held by
a foreigner, was abolished and the incumbent's contract terminated with com-
pensation. Four full-time posts - Chairman, Deputy Chairman, General Mlanager
and Assistant General lanager were created and filled by indigenous nationals.
These executives are assisted by a Secretary/Chief Accountant, a Management
Services I'anager, a Police Conmanding Officer and a Port Engineer.  Day-to-day
operational control is exercised by a port manager at each port.
3.04       Between November 1970 and March 1970, besides making appointments
to the newly designated posts, SPA had also to fill three vacancies arising in
other senior positions.  This situation wfas only overcome with State Government
help and after considerable delay. The staffing situation is now considered
adequate although four of the newly engaged staff lack port experience.
3.05       The policy of accelerating the employment of indigenous nationals in
top Government and quasi-Government posts is partly responsible for difficulty
in recruiting professionals in the public sector throughout Malaysia, and SPA
may find it difficult to attract experienced and qualified staff should
vacancies arise in the future.  The problem is further aggravated by the
general reluctance of West Mlalaysians to move to Sabah. Temporary expert
assistance may become necessary, should the situation again deteriorate, to
assist and train inexperienced senior staff at SPA. During negotiations, SPA
undertook to consult wlith the Bank prior to introducing any material organiza-
tional changes or when replacing key personnel and to review the situation with
the Bank wi-th a view to agreeing on appropriate remedies, including the use of
temporary expert assistance.
3.06       The SPA Act provides the Board with wTide powers of delegation and,
in practice, all decisions, other than those involving major policy, are taken
at Chairman or General Mianager level. It was also agreed that the Bank will
be consulted prior to filling vacancies occurring in these posts.
(ii) Accounting System
3.07       SPAts general accounting system is good and separate accountability
is maintained for each port as well as consolidated results of SPA as a whole.
The system is designed on commercial lines and a fairly satisfactory form of
budgetary control exists. Ilowever, this will be improved with the introduction
of a costing system which SPA plans to institute with assistance from Port
Swettenham (West Malaysia). During negotiations an assurance was obtained that
a modern commercial costing system will be implemented by January 1, 1973.

B. Facilities
3.08      Kota Kinabalu (Map 3):  This port provides a principal entry for
import cargo for the Iwest coast and an exit point for export trade - mainly
rubber. The port is located in a well-protected deep-water bay.
3.09      The existing T-shaped wharf, used by petroleum tankers and general
cargo vessels, provides an outshore berth 647 ft long for vessels with a
maximum draft of 24 ft and an inshore berth 480 ft long for vessels with a
maximum draft of 15 ft.  The wharf's concrete deck and approach bridge are
founded on timber piles which are in poor condition because of marine borer
attacks. These attacks have reduced the wharf's ability to carry heavy loads.
The structure cannot be economically repaired to a standard to support modern
cargo-handling equipment. Further details of facilities are given in Annex 2.
3.10      Sandakan (Hap 4):  Formerly the capital of British North Borneo,
Sandakan is Sabah's most populated city. It is served by only one highway
which, in 1972, will link with Kota Kinabalu - 200 miles awiay. The port
serves as the major exit for logs which are shipped in the open roadstead and
for transshipment of general cargo to the smaller east coast ports.
3.11-     Sandakan's harbor is situated in a bay which provides a sheltered
deep-water anchorage. A mud bar 1L miles wide restricts entry to vessels
having a maximum draft of 22½2 ft at LT OST.  The tidal range is 9i ft, enabling
vessels of 28 ft draft to enter the harbor at high tide.
3.12      The port area is located in the middle of Sandakan's business
district with consequently limited possibilities of expansion.  The existing
T-shaped wharf is 40 ft wide and provides 740 ft of outshore berthage and
365 ft of inshore berthage for vessels of a maximum draft of 21 ft and 15 ft
respectively. The existing wharf - a concrete deck founded on timber piles -
is in poor condition because of marine borers. It cannot be economically
repaired and medium and heavy loads are unloaded from vessels into landing
craft which are unloaded at various places along the coast, in order to avoid
overloading the wharf. Further details of facilities are given in Annex 2.
Tankers discharge petroleum at a specialized jetty near the planned new port.
3.13      Tawau:  The facilities cc.aist of a T-shaped wharf, built in 1961,
which is 0  ft wide and provides 650 ft of outshore berthage which can be
used by vessels drawing 20 ft.  The inshore berth, 450 ft long, is subject to
appreciable silting but could be maintained to a depth of 16 ft at LWOST-.
The wharf and the approach bridge are built of concrete and are in satis-
factory condition.
3.14      Other Ports:  SPA plans to take over five  other ports during
1971/72. Technical details on these ports are given in Annex 3.
C. Operations
3.15      F,ota Kinabalu:  SPA. is in charge of all cargo-handling operations,
port maintenance, adm-inistration and security.  W.-Aith the exception of ware-



-7-
house labor and cargo-handling equipment drivers, it does not directly employ
labor; stevedores and wharf labor are hired by SPA from contractors on a daily
basis   Labor, mainly farmers from nearby villages, works a single shift of
three parts, 7:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 pam., and 6:00 p.m,
to 10:00 p.m. Arrangements are occasionally made for work beyond 10:00 p,m.
and overtime is paid after 5:00 p.m.  Because of the labor shortage in Sabah,
SPA's and the shipping agents' efforts to introduce two shifts rather than
one long shift, wqhich might increase output by 20-25%, cannot materialize.
It is expected, however, that with an anticipated increase in prepalletized
cargo, comrpletion of the planned port facilities and the introduction of
efficient port operations the output will increase by about 20%. SPA intends
in future to engage a nucleus of peimanent stevedores supplemented by contract
workers as required. Ships employ shipst gear and SPA supplies mobile equip-
ment for cargo-handling on shore.
3.16      Because of limited transit shed space, SPA currently encourages
direct deliveries at ships' side with consignees and exporters providing
their own shore labor and trucks. This practice slows port operations because
the narrowness of the T-shaped wharf restricts traffic movement. Trucks ean-
not be brought alongside in sufficient numbers to suit ships' operational -
requirements and cargo-handling equipment cannot operate efficiently. Non-
direct cargo is handled by tractor/trailers between vessels and storage areas
up to 2,000 ft away.
3.17      The proposed project will provide ample working space in the future
and enable SPA to increase its transit storage services--and restrict direct
delivery procedures. IMeanwhile, SPA is improving cargo-handling operations
at the present site and the project provides funds for training to achieve
this objective (para. 4oI).
3.1£      The port has about reached the practical limit of its capacity9 and
congestion is increasing. In 1969, 44 out of a total of 450 ships were
delayed an average of 30 hours each.  In the first 10 months of 1970, 77 out
of 355 ships were delayed an average of 33 hours each.
3.19      The M;larine Department of the I-inistry of Transport is responsible
for maritime and navigational operations including tugs and pilotage, com-
munications with vessels at sea, lighthouses and other navigational aids.  The
Customs Department of the Ministry of Finance exercises all customs functions
within the port but has no control over transit sheds and cargo-handling areas.
Their working hours are adjusted to meet port needs.  Good working relations
prevail between SPA and the Iarine and Customs Departments.
3.20      During the year about 80 tankers of varying sizes, discharge petro-
leum over the wharf into a nearby tank farm. During busy periods, in order
not to disrupt other cargo operations, tankers use the wharf at night and
general-cargo vessels which make way for them at the oil companies' expense,
are reberthed before 7:30 a.m. The proposed project does not include special
oil-handling installations because, at a later stage, a separate oil unloading
jetty will be built. Until then, tankers will continue to use the existing



- 8 -
wharf. Should a structural failure occur at the old wharf, tankers could
discharge at the proposed new wharf which will incorporate the necessary
take-off points for such an emergency.
3.21     Upon completion of the new wharf SPA is expected to return most of
the existing facilities to the Government but will retain the transit sheds
for long-term storage purposes.
3.22      Tawau:  The division of responsibility for operations at Tawau,
the only other port at present controlled by SPA, is similar to Kota Kinabalu.
There is currently little congestion. Traffic flow will improve with planned
curtailment of direct delivery operations when transit shed space is increased
in the near future.
3.23      Sandakan:  Three Government departments:  Marine, Customs and
Public Works, exercise certain functions within the port: the Marine Depart-
ment controls all maritime and navigational operations; Customs collect dues
and the Public lWorks Department is responsible for construction, repair and
maintenance work.
3.24      There is no single organization responsible for cargo-handling.
Consignees, ships' agents and exporters are responsible for the stevedoring
and wharf handling of cargo. Most of the cargo is handled by trucks and hand
trucks and the use of the limited storage space available is not planned or
efficiently controlled.
3.25      SPA's operational experience in Kota Kinabalu and Tawau has improved
cargo-handling operations in these ports and it is expected that operations in
Sandakan and other ports will improve soon after take-over and the intro-
duction of similar systems by SPA.
3,26      The existing road system serving the proposed new port site is in-
adequate. During negotiations the State Government undertook to complete
planned access roads prior to the opening of the port.
3.27      Other Ports:  The port of Labuan and the minor ports of Kudat, Kunak,
Lahad Datu and Semporna, due for take-over by SPA in the near future, are
currently operated and controlled like Sandakan.
3.28     Relations between employers and employees in the ports are generally
good; there are no labor unions in Sabah.



4. TIHE PROJECT
A. Description
4.01      The project consists of: (i) building tiwo new ports- one at Kota
IKinabalu, adjacent to the existing port, and providing the following
facilities (Map 5 and Annexes 4 and 5):
(a)  a deep-water berth 700 ft long with an alongside depth
of 30 ft at LNOST for oceangoing vessels;
(b)  two berths each about 400 ft long with alongside depths
of 24 ft at LWOST for feeder service vessels;
(c)  one berth, 250 ft long wqith an alongside depth of 18 ft
at LVIOST for coasters;
(d)  one transit shed of 70,000 sq ft and adequate open storage
areas and necessary ancillary services;
(e)  cargo-handling equipment comprising 18-6,000 lb forklifts,
10 - tractors, 48 - 3 to 6 ton trailers and one 10 ton
mobile crane;
(f)  consultant services for detailed engineering and con-
struction supervision; and
(g)  furtlher soil investigations and hycrographic studies
in conjunction with the detailed engineering.
and the odler at Sandakan, located three miles to the south-west of the ex-
isting port and providing the following facilities (Hap 6 and Annexes 4 and 5):
(a)  a deep-water berth 700 ft long with an alongside depth
of 30 ft at LIOST for oceangoing vessels;
(b)  twio berths each about 400 ft long with alongside depths
of 24 ft at LWOST for feeder service vessels;
(c) one berth, 250 ft long with an alongside depth of 18 ft
at LWJST for coasters;
(d)  one transit shed of 90,000 sq ft and adequate open
storage areas and necessary ancillary services;
(e)  cargo-handling equipment comprising 15-6,000 lb forklifts,
8 tractors, 42 - 3 to 6 ton trailers and one 10 ton mobile
crane;
(f)  consultant services for detailed engineering and supervision
of construction; and



_ 10 -
(g) further soil investigations and hydrographic studies
in conjunction with the detailed engineering.
ii) provision of cargo-handling equipment comprising 18-6,000 lb forklifts,
15 tractors, 62 - 3 to 6 ton trailers and one 10 ton mobile crane, at Tawau
and three minor ports, and iii) the provision of training for all port
operational personnel by port experts.
4.02      The new facilities at both Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan will handle
all traffic forecast for about 10 years after completion and will be designed
for container traffic loads which could develop in the area in the late 1970ts.
The planned facilities can be easily expanded should traffic growth warrant
it.  Land at the new site in Kota Kinabalu is already vested in SPA.  The
Sandakan site is State land and will be taken over by SPA when its jurisdic--
tion is extended to this port later this year. During negotiations confirma-
tion was 6btained that adequate land areas for expansion will also be vested
in SPA.
Engineering Consultant Services and Further Studies
4.03      King and Gavaris, consulting engineers, have been engaged for com-
pletion of the detailed engineering, preparation of tender documents and
supervision of construction works.  During negotiations it was agreed that the
consultants will train at least two engineers during the construction period
for eventual maintenzance of the project ports. It is not expected that SPA
will have its own engineering department in the near future.  Further soil
investigations and hydrographic measurements are being undertaken, concur- -
rently with the detailed engineering, in order to incorporate the results in
the final designs.
B. Subsoil Conditions
4.04      At Kota Kinabalu subsoil conditions are not very favorable.  Borings
on the site of the planned wharf indicate that the seabed is formed of soft
clay varying in thickness from 20 to 30 ft underlain by weathered sandstone
and shales. This layer, in varying thickness of 20-50 ft is quite hard and
compact, and is underlain by the bedrock at depths varying from 50 to 120 ft.
For these conditionss which cannot economically support earth fill, wharves
will be founded on piles 60 to 130 ft long. The inshore part of the wharf
is, however, to be placed on fill using an existing coral reef as a base. -
4.05      At Sandakan borings on the site of the planned wharf and in nearby
areas, indicate soil conditions similar to Kota Kinabalu with the following
exceptions: (a) the bedrock layer is at a depth of 80-100 ft and piles
90-110 ft long will be required; (b) the foreshore slopes more gently and
deep-water is further offshore; and (c) the entire structure will be founded
on piles consequently the cost is higher than the Kota Kinabalu project
(Table 1).
4.o6      Sabah lies on the edge of the circumpacific earthquake belt and



- 11-
slight tremors may occasionally occur. The piled stractures and the earth
and rock embankments for both ports will be designed to resist the lateral
accelerations caused by such tremors.
C. Cost Estimates
4.07      The total estimated cost of the project is kI$ 66.994 million (US$22.11
million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$16.1 million equiva-
lent. A summary follows and details are given in Table 1.

4.o8      The cost of the civil engineering works proposed is based on known
costs of labor and materials in West Malaysia and Singapore but not in Sabah,
since no major port construction works have been undbrtaken there recently.
In view of the uncertainties regarding the possible rise of construction costs
in the area (in view of the mining and other deVelopments in Sabah) a contin-
gency of 15% was taken for prices. A contingenpy of 10% for quantities was
taken because further soil investigations and hydrographic studies for the
detailed designs are still being carried out. The cost estimates adopted are
considered realistic. The foreign exchange required is about 73% of the total
estimated construction cost. This is high bocause Sabah lacks construction
materials such as cement, reinforcement steel, and bitumen. Bitumen and some
types of mild steel bars are available from Wegt Malaysia. However, producers
in Japan, Korea and Taiwan can offer these materials at lower c.i.f. landed



- 12 -
prices.  Such construction materials are not subjected to import restrictions,
other than normal import duties. During negotiations the State Government
gave an assurance that the temporary import of labor from IJest M4alaysia or
elsewhere will be permitted should this be required.
D. Financing
4.09      A Bank loan of US$16.1 million is proposed to finance the estimated
foreign exchange component of all items.  SPA will provide the local currency
estimated at I$ 18.2I1 million from internally-generated resources. Retro-
active financing from September 1, 1970 may be required to a maximunm of
US$300,000 equivalent for engineering services and soil investigation. In
order for SPA to implement the project it was agreed during negotiations that
SPA will take over Sandakan before disbursement for the Sandakan part of the
project.
E.  Construction, Procurement and Disbu-rsement
4.10      SPA will be responsible for the execution of the project.  Because
it lacks engineers it requires PWD technical support for effective liaison
with the consultants. During negotiations the State Government confirmed that
this will be provided. Contracts for construction and supply will be aw-farded
on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank
guidelines and will be subject to Bank approval.
4.11      Based upon the estimated foreign exchange component of total cost,
disbursements from the loan account will be 73,; for all civil engineering
works, the actual foreign exchange costs of engineering consultant services,
60/o for all soil investigations and hydrographic tests, the c.i.f. landed cost
of imported equipment and the actual foreign exchange cost of training schemes.
4.12      Construction is expected to start by December 1971 and the project
to be completed by late 1974 (Table 2).  Assuming loan effectiveness on
September 1, 1971 disbursement is expected to be in accordance with the
estimated schedule in Annex 6. SPA may prefer the withholding of retention
money. However, the phasing of expenditures shown in Annex 6 assumes the
contractor will submit letters of guarantee in lieu of retention money.
4.13      It is recommended that any surplus funds available on completion of
the project be canceled.
F. Alternative Schemes
4.14      The consultants and the mission evaluated various other construction
schemes both for Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan, but they were found to be opera-
tionally inferior to and economically less attractive than the proposed ones.
The principal alternative schemes are outlined in paras. 5.09 and 5.10.
G. Other Investments
4.15      In addition to the investment program described in para. 4.07 SPA



* 13 -
is expected to incur IM$ 4.146 million in capital expenditure during 1971-1977.
Of this sum IM$ 1.1 million is for a transit shed and capital dredging at Tawau
in 1971/72. The balance comprises small additions and replacements, mainly of
cargo-handling equipment, at this and other ports.  No major development is
currently envisaged before 1975.  During negotiation it was agreed that
SPAMs capital expenditures (excluding the project) shall not exceed M$ 1.5
million in any fiscal year of the period of project construction without prior
Bank approval.
5. ECONOMIC EVAIUATION
A. Traffic
5.0o      Present and forecast traffic volumes are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
and summarized below. Comparable data for earlier years are not available.
1968   1969   1970    1975    1980    1985
(I000 tons)
Kota Kinabalu:
Dry Cargo                      239    267    305      368     457     567
Bulk Petroleum                  61     54     71      114     184     296
Sandakan:

5.02      Logs are loaded in the stream at Sandakan and palm oil either in the
stream or at a special facility and therefore neither commodity influences
port capacity requirements. However, as explained in the financial evalua-
tion, both have an important effect on future SPA revenues.
5.03      Dry cargo, excluding export commodities and imports of automobiles,
is forecast to increase at 4% per annum at Kota Kinabalu and 5% at Sandakan.
Export commodities, and imports of automobiles and petroleum products were
forecast individually.
5.04      Total dry cargo is forecast to increase at about V,2% per annum at
Kota Kinabalu and 5% at Sandakan. At these growth rates the proposed project
will provide sufficient capacity to 1984 at Kota Kinabalu and to 1981 at
Sandakan. If an 8'3 growth rate is assumed, the project will provide sufficient
capacity to 1980 at Kota Kinabalu, and to 1979 at Sandakan.
5.05      The principal uncertainties influencing the traffic forecasts are:
(a) the rate of growfth of Sabah's exports, particularly timber; and
(b) the extent to which per capita income and consumption will be
affected by the growth in exports,



- 14 -
5.06      It is estimated that there is a 75% probability that the growth rate
of dry cargo traffic will be within a range of 1h14 to 8% at Kota Kinabalu and
5% to 8¼ at Sandakan.
5.07      Further details of the forecasting approach are given in Annex 7.
B. Analysis of Alternative Port Development Schemes
5.08      To do nothing at either port would lead to failure of the present
wharves and would mean a severe reduction in foreign trade, the negative reper-
cussions of which cannot be measured. Such a course of action is not considered
feasible and, therefore, a simple "lwith-and-without" comparison was not possible.
Such a comparison would have shown substantially higher, but spurious, benefits.
Accordingly, the methodology compares each project with the next most economic
alternative.
5.09      At Kota Kinabalu, where the present wharf has a maximum useful life
of 10 more years, the alternatives analysed were:
(a) To construct a deep-water wharf immediately, (the proposed project).
(b)  To defer a deep-water wharf until 1981, and to eliminate traffic
congestion in the interim by construction of minimum lighterage
facilities.
(c) To construct minimum lighterage facilities immediately and full
lighterage facilities in 1981.
A comparison of the costs of these alternatives is given in Table 5 which shows
that alternative (a) is the least-cost solution, and alternative (b) the next
most economic solution.
5.10      At Sandakan the principle alternatives considered were:
(a) To construct a deep-water wharf at a new site (the proposed project).
(b) To construct full lighterage facilities at a new site.
(c) To construct a new deep-water wharf at the existing site.
One further alternative, transport of goods by road to and from Kota Kinabalu,
was considered but rejected because of the very high recurrent cost.
5.11      Construction of a wharf at the existing site was found to be more
expensive than either of the other alternatives because of the additional
costs associated with:
(a) demolition of the existing wharf;
(b) construction and operation of temporary lighterage facilities;



- 15 -
(c)  the unconventional construction methods necessitated by
the congested site and the continuing port operations.
Evaluation of the proposed deep-water facilities is therefore based on a
comparison with full lighterage facilities at the same new site.
C. Benefits
5.12      The benefits of the proposed facilities at Kota Kinabalu are:
(a) faster turnaround of ships. The proposed wharf wrill have
higher productivity than either the minimum lighterage
operation or the present wharf, and this will speed the
turnaround of vessels   The manner of calculating the
benefit is shown in Table 6;
(b) lower handling cost. The proposed wharf will have lower per-ton
handling costs than either the minimum lighterage operation
or the present wharf (Table 7). The c;lculsticn of benefits
is shcTm, in Table 8;
(c)  alternative costs.  The proposed wharf iill avoid the
costs associated with the next most economic alternative.
These include the capital costs of minimum lighterage
facilities and of a deep-water wharf at the end of the
present wharf's useful life. Paso included is the cost
of major repairs to the present wharf; and
(d) if the lighterage alternative were adopted it is believed
that cargo damage, a normal feature of lighterage operations,
would be incurred.  The proposed facilities will avoid this
cost, estir,mated at 11 of the value of imports and exports.
The next most economic alternative assumes construction of a deep-water wharf
after about 10 years.  A1ll of the foregoing benefits cease, therefore, at the
end of this period.
5.13      The benefits at Sandakan are of a similar nature to those at Kota
T.Unabalu, but are projected to continue for the assumed 30-year economic life
of the alternative facilities. Details are shown in Table 9.
5.14      Provision has been made in the design of the proposed wharves at
Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan for container traffic (see para. 4.02 above). The
extra cost involved amounts to I$ 500,000 at Kota Kinabalu and M$ 600,000 at
Sandakan. Since no container traffic is presently foreseen for Sabah there
is no return on this investment. However the use of containers has been under
consideration by a shipping company operatin- feeder services to Sabah, and
the investment is therefore considered a wise precaution.  It will have the
incidental benefit of providing capacity for other types of heavy loads.
5.15      Take-off points for the discharge of petroleum products will be



- i6 
provided at the proposed Kota Kinabalu wharf for use in the event of a
structural failure of the old wharf. The benefit from this minor investment
is intangible. It is felt to be a necessary insurance pending construction
of a petroleum jetty.
D. Economic Return
5.16      The foregoing benefits yield an internal economic return of 18% for
Kota Kinabalu and 41% for Sandakan. These rates of return are calculated on the
incremental investment over the next most economic alternative.  The return on
total investment in the project which would have resulted from a with-and-with-
out comparison would have been substantially higher.
5.17      The figures of return were tested for adflsitivity to changes in the
values of the principal variables.  The most sig ificant conclusions are:
(a)  the return figures are most sensitive to variation in the capital
costs of the projects but, even assuming a 20% capital cost overrun,
the return on both projects remains above 14%.
(b)  the return figures are relatively sensitive to variation in the costs
of the alternative projects.
(i)  at Kota Kinabalu, the probable range of variation in the
alternative costs is relatively narrow and, therefore would
be unlikely to reduce the return to less than 15%.
(ii)  at Sandakan, on the contrary, the feasible range of variation in
the alternative costs is wide. However, even if the alternative
lighterage facllities could be built for only 50% of the cost
estimated, the return on the proposed deep-water wharf., at 13%,
remains satisfactory.
(c)  at Sandakan a combination of a 20% capital-cost overrun and a 50%
reduction in the costs of the alternative project would reduce the
internal economic return to 10%. The probability that this might
occur is estimated to be less than 20%.
(d)  at Kota Kinabalu the sensitivity of the return was tested to variation
in the usable life of the present wharf. It was found that the return
declines slightly with each additional year that the present wharf
can be used. But even if it could be used for a further 15 years the
return would only be reduced to 16%.
(e)  since there is no lighterage at present in Sabah, estimates of cargo
damage with lighterage are subject to a large element of uncertainty.
However, even if such cargo damage is eliminated from consideration,
the return on a deep-water wharf at Kota Kinabalu is 13%.

(f)  the return figures are relatively insensitive to variation,
within a feasible range, in handling costs and ship turn-
around time,
(g) the return figures are inseositive to variation, within a
feasible range, in the traffic forecasts. The benefits
affected by variations in traffic volumes are those arising
out of handling costs and ship turnaround time and variations
in these, as noted in sub-para (f) above, do not have much
impact on the return. Also the feasible range of variation
is very narrow in a downward direction (see para. 5.06).
(h) in view of the importance of alternative project costs to
the economic viability of the proposed Sandakan wharf, the
economic viability of the alternative lighterage facilities
was tested against the next most economic alternative wihich,
as explained in para. 5.10, is construction of a deep-wiater
wharf on the existing site.  The lighterage facilities were
found to have a 12% return.
-.18      It is concluded that the proposed investments are justified and,
in the case of Sandakan, urgently required in order to avoid the heavy costs
to the region which would result from the collapse of the present wharf.
6. FfTl'ATCIAL EVALUATION
A. Present Financial Situation
6.01      As SPA did not start operating until December 1968 little reliab1e
data on past port finances are available. All ports were formerly adminis-
tered by various Government departments and many port costs cannot be iden-
tified. Furthermore former port tariffs bear little relationship to SPA's
existing ones. However, despite the absence of data prior to 1969, enough
SPA data exist to form a reliable basis for future projections.

are contained in Tables 10 ance 11 respectively, and results for years ending

Debt/Equity Ratio                                  0/100            0/100
6.03      The operating ratio of both Kota Kinabalu and Tawau are satis-
factory. The financial return on net fixed assets in use is high in Kota
Kinabalu because most structures are old, in poor condition and consequently
low-valued. The calculation of Tawauls operating ratio and return on net
fixed assets excludes revenue from the imposition of a M$ 1 per ton charge
on timber loaded in the stream as virtually no related expenses are incurred
and this trade could be successfully carried on even if no wharf facilities
existed. Tawauls revenue and expenses in 1969 were small since SPA did not



- 19 -
take over this port until Tovember 1, 1969.
6.04      SPA's current financial situation is sound. No long term  debts  -
exist. The only issue is that of income tax liability. In 1969 SPA was in-
formed that income tax exemption for statutory authorities had been withdramn
by the Federal Government. An appeal has been lodged but the matter is still
unresolved. SPA .aade no income tax provision in its 1969 accounts but this
omission has been rectified in the accounts of 1970 and future years which
form the basis of this appraisal.
B. Rates and Charges
6.o5      SPA's rates, established in 1968 and slightly modified early in
1969, are uniformly applied to both SPA ports. The structure is a simple
one with only broad cargo category distinctions. Details are given in Annex 8
and include a comparison with charges applied by Kuching Port Authority in
neighboring Sarawak which shows SPA's rates to be generally lower. For
example, a vessel of 2,000 gross registered tons discharging 400 tons of
general cargo would pay about 285o less at SPA ports, mainly because-stevedore
wages are lower in Sabah. Certain rates e.g. stevedoring were cost-related
at inception. SPA intends to introduce a costing system which will enable
tariffs to be reasonably based upon the cost of related services. This iwas
confirmed during negotiations.
6.o6      SPA has power to alter rates at its discretion.  Ministerial inter-
vention can only be applied under the SPA Act which provides that, after
consultation with SPA, the State 2aUnister of Co%munications and TJorks
may give SPA "direction of a general character relating to the interests of
the State".
6.07      Dissatisfaction has been expressed by timber industry representatives
concerning SPA's charge of M$ 1 per ton on tizber loaded in the stream on the
grounds that it is not cost related because no port shore facilities are
involved in the operations. SPA has currentl-y no intention of reducing the
charge. The effect on SPA's finances by a reduction is considered in para.
6.12.
C. Future Earnings
6.o8      Based unon traffic projections and current charges, forecast 1971-77
income accounts for the project ports of NXota Kinabalu and Sandakan are given
in Tables 12 and 13 respectively. Forecasts for Tawau are in Table 14 and -
the five minor ports to be taken over in Table 15. Details of the apportion-
ment of SPA HIeadquarter expenses are showm in Table 16.  An analysis of the
fixed assets of each port is given in Table 17. Bases and assumpticns used
are in Annex 9.



- 20 -
6.09      Operating ratios for Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan are satisfactory
and both ports are expected to maintain an adequate level of profitability.
In 1975, the rate of return on net fixed assets in use falls as low value
facilities are replaced by new expensive ones. The rates are 6.5% and 7.3%
respectively in 1977 and should continue upwards as increasing use is made of
the new structures.  The other major port, Tawau, is expected to continue
showing good results with an operating ratio around 68% and a return on net
fixed assets in use exceeding 20%.
6.10      Relevant data for the minor SPA ports, excluding timber revenue,
are suanarized below:
Lahad
Kudat  Kunak   Datu   Semporna   Labuan
1973   Operating Ratio            97%      300     90%    144%       93%
Rate of Return            0.7%   1254%    1.8%  Negative    2.6%
l975  Operating Ratio             97%      25%     91%    141%       96%
Rate of Return            1.Oc%    17%    2.0%) Negative    1.6%
1977   Operating Ratio            9670    24%      92%    138%       97%
Rate of Return            1.4%    20%i   2.0%  Negative    1.6%
Note:  Including timber revenues all ports are viable (Table 15).
The reason for Kunak's low operating ratio is that no cargo-handling or
storage operations are to be carried out by SPA; supervision and administration
expenses are therefore minimal. The other minor ports however are expected
to employ SPA labor and provide warehouse facilities as at the major ports.
Projected staffing, on which these forecasts are based, seem excessive and a
reassessment is needed. It may be possible to link two or more ports together
for administrative purposes and so avoid over-employment of supervisory
personnel. During negotiations, SPA confirned its intention to review
staffing needs at these ports to ensure maximum economr of management costs.
D. Future Financial Situation
6.11      Consolidated forecast income accounts, cash flow data and balance
sheets of SPA during the project period 1971-1974 are given below in sumnary
form. Details (including projections up to 1977) are shown in Tables 10, 11
and 18. Bases and assumptions used are given in Annex 9.

6.12      The above Summary Cash Flow shows that during project construction
the project represents 95% of SPAts total capital investment and about 30% of
the entire program is financed by internally generated resources which depend
considerably upon revenue from port charges on timber loaded in the stream,
as the following table shows:
M$ Million
Net Revenue (After Income Tax)    1971  1972  1973  19714  1975  1976  1977
SPA Total                        3.2   5.9   6.4   6.9   6.5   7.2   7.6
Less "Alongside" Operations      2.1   3.4   3.7   4.1  3.5   4.1  4.3
Stream Timber Operations         1.1   2.5   2.7   2.8   3.0   3.1   3.3
Should SPA reduce timber charges a temporary cash shortage could arise during
1971-1974. However, providing the reduction is not more than 50% SPA could    I
manage without further borrowing.  SPA is unlikely to reduce charges beyond
this level because timber exporters and shippers are deriving benefit from
the use of SPA anchorages for which some charge is justified. However, during
negotiations SPA undertook not to incur long term debt without the Bank's
prior agreement unless net cash revenue is at least 1 3/4 times the maximum
debt service requirements.
6.13      Subsequent to project construction, cash resources are expected to
rise by about M$ 13 million, of which over 1'1$ 9 million is from timber
operations. As no further major port expansion is envisaged for several years
after project completion, such cash accumulation is not required. Therefore
consideration should then be given to paying the State Government an equity
return or reducing port charges. During negotiations SPA agreed to review
with the Bank their cash requirements so as to determine their fiscal policies
upon completion of the project.
6.14      The project ports and SPA overall are expected to attain the follow-
ing financial rates of return on net fixed assets in use (the calculation of
which excludes stream timber revenue):
FY1975    FY1976    FY1977
(i)  Kota Kinabalu                 4.6       6.o        6.5
(ii)  Sandakan                      5.2        6.4       7.3
(iii)  SPA Overall                   5.6       6.7        7.5
During negotiations SPA agreed to achieve, overall, not less than 5% in 1975;
6% in 1976 and 7% in 1977 and thereafter. SPA further confirmed their
intention to aim for a similar return at each of the two project ports and
endeavour to ensure that the ports of Kudat, Kunak, Lahad Datu, Semporna and
Labuan would break even financially on wharf operations, in order to avoid the
subsidization of these ports.
6.15      During negotiation SPA also agreed to continue employing qualified
independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank and holding adequate
insurance coverage.

7. RECONI4ENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement nas reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  consultation with the Bank, prior to introducing
material organizat±onal changes and replacing key
personnel, with a view to agreeing on appropriate
remedies including the use of temporary expert
assistance (para. 3.05);
(b) port access roads at Sandakan will be constructed before
the project is completed (para. 3.26);
(c) the temporary importation of labor will be permitted
(para. 4.08);
(d)  the existing Sandakan port will be taken over by SPA
before loan disbursement (para. 4.09);
(e) the Bank's prior agreement wTill be obtained for capital
expenditure exceeding 14$ 1.5 million in any fiscal year
(para. 4.15);
(f) long-term debt wTill be restricted (para. 6.12);
(g)  aftor project complotioa,, oash requirements wilal,hlb
reviewed with the Bank so as to determine SPA's fiscal
policies (para. 6.13); and
(h)  agreed financial rates of return will be achieved (para. 6.14).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$16.1 million
equivalent to SPA guaranteed by the Federal Government over 20 years including
a grace period of four years.

APPRAISAL OF SABAH PORTS PROJECT
Existing Facilities and Conditions
A. Kota Kinabalu
1. Description of the Port
The present port is located in the northern end of the town.
The harbor is approached from the north through the islands of Pulau Gaya
and Pulau Sapangar, which divide the bay into the Bay of Gaya to the south-
west and the Bay of Sapangar to the northeast.  Both bays provide access
and anchorage for vessels up to 40 ft draft and all dangers are well marked.
The southwestern approach to the port is barred by shoals and reefs and is
only accessible to small craft.
2. DescriDtion of the Present Port Facilities (see Drawing)
The present wharf, built in 1957, is located some 300 ft from
the shore to which it is connected by an approach bridge 40 ft wide and
270 ft long. The wharf is at right angles to the approach bridge, is 40 ft
wide and consists of a concrete deck on wooden piles. It provides an out-
shore berth 647 ft long which can be used by vessels with a maximum draft
of 24 ft and an inshore berth 480 ft long on the north side of the approach
bridge with a water depth varying from 18 to 24 ft at LWOST. These berths
are not subject to appreciable silting. Smaller craft are accommodated at
the south inshore berth which is 117 ft long, at the ends of the wharf and
along the approach bridge.
A mooring dolphin is located 90 ft west of the wharf with a
catwalk connection. It is used for docking and undocking operations and
for mooring vessels overlapping the wharf. Another infrequently used dol-
phin is located some 250 ft from the western extremity of the wharf.
The fender system consists of wooden piles supporting horizontal
timbers running the length of the wharf, separated from it by cylindrical
rubber bumpers. This system has recently been renewed, using the existing
piles.
Oil pipelines run underneath the wharf and approach bridge to the
tank farm outside the port area. In addition, the wharf provides ships'
water lines and lighting.
An infrequently used meter gauge railway runs along the wharf and
the approach bridge with a turntable at their junotion.



ANNEX 2
Pa-ge 2
A 13,000 sq ft building housing the Customs, the Marine Department
and a passenger room is located near the entrance gate to the port area.
A transit shed, located at the inshore end of the approach bridge,
has a storage capacity of 28,000 sq ft and contains the offices of the
supervising personnel of the Sabah Ports Authority for this port, the Cus-
toms officials, clerks, etc. and a special cargo crib. An extension with
a storage capacity of 8,400 sq ft and a temporary open-sided, covered area
of 6,000 sq ft were recently added.
Other buildings include, a vehicle storage shed, a port workers'
canteen, etc.
The following mobile equipment are available but inefficiently
used:
16 forklifts - 6,ooo lb capacity
10 tractors - 0 hp
46 trailers - 6,000 lb capacity
1 mobile crane - 10 ton capacity; and
1,200 pallets.
The port owns no floating craft crane; seaborne services are
imdertaken by the Marine Department.
The tank farm of the Shell and Esso Oil Companies is located
outside the port area and immediateJy to the east of it, on an area of
approximately four acres.
A considerable area to the north and east of the existing wharf
was reclaimed between 1962 and 1965 by the Sabah Department of Public W4orks.
Of the reclaimed area, part has been sold to commercial interests for ware-
house construction but some 16.5 acres are still available for port use.
Of these, some seven acres west of the tank farm can be used for open
storage purposes and the construction of more covered storage in this area
is contemplated.
3. Condition of Present Facilities
A survey of the existing wharf and approach bridge, carried out
in October 1966 under the auspices of the Sabah Public Works Department,
indicated marked deterioration of the wooden piling for the wharf, access
bridge and fenders, due to teredo worm infection. The inspection shoved
an approximately uniform degree of penetration of these marine borers
concentrated in the area between low and high water levels. In general,
the depth of penetration was found to be about one inch to a maximum of
1½g inches with several cases of greater penetration up to 2½ inches,
particularly at the access bridge where the average penetration was 2
inches. Inspection also showed that many piles had been spliced in the
underwater area and a number of piles showed splits that had been repaired
with steel bands, in the area between water level and the underside of the
deck.



2
Page 3
i1urther condition surveys carried out in December 1968 and August
1969, showed that the deterioration was proceeding at an accelerated rate
with marine borer action now frequently extending throughout the full-
water depth. Effective pile diameters had been reduced at least three to
five inches in various areas of the wharf and access bridge. Increased
splitting was noted, particularly on the fender piles, due to ship's berth-
ing. The condition of the underuater splices on all piles also showed
marked deterioration. An examination of the concrete deck structure found
it to be in fairly good ccndition; small cracks were found in some support-
ing beams and pile caps, with reinforcement exposed in one small area.
The deck and structural portions of the wharf superstructure and
approach bridge are in acceptable condition and require only proper main-
tenance and minor repairs. However, the substructure condition of both the
wharf and the access bridge presents a very serious problem. The wooden
piles 15-20 inches diameter, as originally designed, had an allowable load-
ing of approximately 20 tons each. The action of marine borers over the
years, which has accelerated since 1966, resulted in a reduction of the
effective pile diameter in the area between the sea bed high water eleva-
tions and has resulted in a reduction of the load bearing capacity to an
estimated 14 tons. This, in turn, has reduced the permitted uniformly
distributed live load on the wharf deck and access bridge to approximately
150 pounds per sq ft. It may be expected that the bearing capacity of the
piles vill be further reduced by the accelerating action of marine borers.
Even at the present time, the condition of the foundation piles creates
some danger of partial collapse which may be caused by accidental ship
impact, excessive loading, or other reasons.
The limited load capacity of the wharf, the likelihood of further
deterioration, the restrictions necessary during cargo operations and placed
on improving cargo-handling by containerization methods, taken together with
the limited useful life of the facility makes it  evident that improved
facilities are mandatory as soon as possible. This is the unanimous con-
clusion of a1l previous studies of Kota Kinabalu port.
B. Sandakan
1. General
Sandakan, formerly the capital of British North Borneo and the
most populous city in Sabah, is located on the east coast at 050-50'N,
1180-07aE. It has a population of about 50,000. It is served by only one
highway which is the beginning of a direct cross country link to Kota
Kinabalu - 200 miles away and is expected to be completed within the next
few years.
Sandakan's hinterland consists essentiaIly of the basins of Sabah's
two major rivers with the Sandakan Peninsula separating their mouths. These
rivers are navigable by small draft vessels and, owing to the lack of roads,
are vital means of communication.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
The valleys are heavily forested and very fertile. In the
Kinabatangan Valley, although no specific surveys are as yet available,
it is estimated that some 250,000 acres may be suitable fo r agricultural
purposes. The Labuk Valley's natural resources were the subject of a
detailed survey in 1966, by a TJNDP team and their recommendations are
gradually being implemented. There are some 950 sq mi of undeveloped
land available for agriculture. The area has potential for four basic
crops - rice, rubber, palm oil and its derivatives, and cocoa. An agri-
cultural development program has been initiated. (The success of this
program will have an undoubted impact on the throughput of the Port of
Sandakan, even though one of the main commodities concerned, palm oil,
will be handled through facilities other than the wharf).
Sandakan's port serves not only its own hinterlazil, but also as a
port for the transshipment of cargo to other parts of the east coast, es-
pecially Lahad Datu, Semporna and Tawau. Should the road network eventually
link these ports to Sandakan, as projected, some of the cargo presently ex-
ported through them will also pass through Sandakan.
2. The Port
The Sandakan harbor is spacious and has at least seven fathoms
of water offshore providing ample anchorage. However, a mud bar about
Lk miles wide fronts its entrance and limits entry to vessels with a
maximum draft of 25 ft at LaWOST. The ordinary tidal range is approximately
5L ft and vessels with a draft of 28 ft can enter the harbor at high tide.
3. Present Port Facilities
The port area is located in the middle of Sandakants business
district and occupies an area of some 32 acres with very limited possi-
bilities for expansion without costly expropriations or reclamation.
The present wharf, built in 1965, is  .0 ft wide and provides
740 ft of outshore berthage with a depth of 21 ft and 365 ft of inshore
berthage with a depth of 15 ft which has recently been dredged. It is
connected to the shore by a reclaimed land area on an 8,0oo sq ft transit
shed is located. The inshore side of the wharf on the western end has a
depth of 9 ft and is sometimes used for small vessels.
The wharf-side shed is mainly used for the storage of transit
cargo for the east coast ports of Tawau, Semporna and Lahad Datu. However,
its area is insufficient and part of the cargo must be stored in the two
other sheds on the inshore part of the port area. Both sheds have a com-
bined area of 28,000 sq ft and are used for the storage of rice and general
cargo. An office building used by the Custcms and the Marine Department is
located near the port entrance. Only one 5-ton mobile crane and one 6,000
lb forklift are available in the port.



AI,DZX 2
Page 5
The small jetty at the extreme west end of the present port area
is used exclusively for barter trade by small vessels; the Marine Depart-
ment intends to install a fence to sep,arate this area from the port. This
would further diminish the port's insufficient open storage area, but is
mandatory for security reasons.
Tankers bringing bulk petroleum products discharge their cargo
at the new Government Petroleum Jetty, in the vicinity of the new planned
port, which can cater to vessels having drafts of up to 28 ft. This jetty
will also be used for palm oil loading. Petroleum products from smaller
vessels, as well as drums, are discharged over an adjacent, privately-owned
petroleum jetty. Tank farms of two major oil companies are located in the
immediate vicinity and palm oil facilities are under construction nearby.
There are numerous other jetties in the harbor, the largest of
which belongs to the Fishing and Industrial Company and is located near
Tanjong Papat. The harbor also contains a 150-ton capacity slipway used
for repairing security force launches.
The wharf consists of a concrete deck supported by wooden piles
which are in poor condition because of damage by marine borers.
The wharf's fender system consists of steel piles supporting
walings running the length of the wharf and separated from it by cylindri-
cal rubber bumpers.
Mooring dolphins are located about 100 ft from each end of the
wharf and are used for docking and undocking operations as well as for the
mooring of vessels overlapping the wharf.
4. Condition of Present Facilities
A condition survey of the existing wharf carried out in October
1966, under the auspices of the Sabah Public Works Department, indicated
marked deterioration of the wooden wharf piling, due to the action of
teredo marine borers. That inspection showed marine borers penetration of
the piles, throughout the wharf area.  Some piles were considered completely
unserviceable and replacement was recommended. Actual amounts of penetra-
tion measured at that time are not available.
Further conditions survey carried out in April 1969, and August
1969, showed that the deterioration was accelerating, with marine borer
action extending frequently extending throughout the full water depth and
penetrating deeper into the piles. Indications were that effective pile
diameters had been reduced about five to eight inches (a situation even
worse than that at Kota Kinabalu).
Pile repairs were carried out during the latter part of 1969 by
the Sabah Public Works Department and consisted of installing, concrete-
filled steel sleeves around many of the piles. These repairs, which were
inadequately executed, will not prevent further deterioration and will not



ANNEX 2
Page 6
restore the original bearing capacity of the pile. The wooden piles, 15-20
inches diameter were originally designed, for a bearing capacity of 20 tons.
The reduction in the effective pile diameter is concentrated mainly in the
area of the tidal range and, notwithstanding the sleeving carried out, has
resulted in a reduction in the load-bearing capacity of the piles, which
is now estimated at about 14 tons, the same as at Kota Kinabalu.
An examination of the concrete deck structure showed it to be in
rather poor condition with extensive spalling of the deck underside and some
minor spalling above. Pile caps and beans also showed widespread spalling.
Cracks are common in underside of the slab area and in beams and pile caps.
In a number of places, open cracks were noted, the reinforcement was ex-
posed and corrosion was well-advanced. In addition, the retaining wall
at the edge of the reclamation adjacent to the wharf has apparently set-
tled and numerous cracks exist.
New fender niles were installed during 1969, together with a new
waling beam and rubber bumpers. The fender piles are of steel.
The reduction in pile bearing capacity together with the poor and
deteriorating condition of the concrete structure and sea wall, present a
serious problem and have now reduced the uniformly distributed live load
permitted on the wharf to below 150 pounds per sq ft. Because of inade-
quate repair works in many cases, the action of marine borers on the piles
'Will generally continue, and the concrete deck structure can be expected
to deteriorate further.
The limited load capacity of the wharf, the likelihood of further
deterioration of the deck structure, the restrictions necessary during cargo
operations, the limited useful life of the facility and the definite danger
of wharf collapse which may be caused by accidental ship impact or excessive
loading, make it evident that improved facilities are mandatory as soon as
possible. This is also the unanimous conclusion of all previous studies
of the port of Sandakan.

Transit Shed and Open Storage Area Requirements
Kota Kinabalu
1.        In 1969, of the general cargo handled, 15% arrived in small boats,
was handled by the vessels' crews and did not require port stevedoring ser-
vices.  Of the balance:  50% of all imports and 90% of exports were shipped
directly.
2.        In 1976, when the new facilities are fully operational, the ratio
is expected to change as follows:
15% of cargo by small boats not requiring stevedoring services;
20% imports by direct delivery; and
30% exports by direct delivery.
3.        Based on past experience and future traffic forecasts, about 40%
of the indirect deliveries will be stored in open storage and 60% in tran-
sit sheds. Assuming 305 working days per year and a storage time of seven
days on the average, 10 sq ft are required for storage of one BiU of
Lading Ton (BLT) of gereral cargo and 40% of the storage area, either in
a shed or in the open, is required for the movement of goods.
Port of Sandakan
In 1969, all cargo was handled by stevedores, 40% of imports and
90% of exports were handled by direct delivery.
With the addition of the new facilities, ratios of direct and in-
direct delivery are expected to be similar to those at Kota Kinabalu, ex-
cept that all cargo will be handled by stevedores.

hafand Cargo-Hiandling Oatut
1.        The number and length of berths required depend upon several
considerations, some of which are interrelated, including:
(a) total cargo tonnage and type of cargo;
(b) type of vessels frequenting the port;
(c) ratio of liquid and dry bulk, bagged, baled, pre-
palletized, preunitized and containerized cargo;
(d) discharge and loading rates;
(e)  availability of labor, number of shifts, etc.; and
(f)  physical condition of port facilities.
2.        Sabah's ports are frequented by vessels of many countries and are
ports of call for conference ships on their Far Eastern run. Regular ship-
ping services for passengers and cargo £rom W4est Malaysia and Singapore are
provided by Straits Steamship Company. Scheduled cargo services to and
from Bangkok, Hong Kong and Japan are provided by Norweigian Asia Line.
Blue Funnel Line and Ben Line cperating to and from Europe have ships cal-
ling at the ports monthly. Other lines operating cargo services include
Kie Hock Shipping Company, Guam Guam, Pacific International Line. Almost
all vessels call both at Kota Kinabalu and Sandakan.
Ton - Definition
3.        Except where otherwise specified, cargo tonnages and handling
rates mentioned here are based on a Bill of Lading Ton (BLT) calculated in
accordance with the following definition:
For the purposes of calculating charges on cargo the tcnnage
shall be deemed to be weight or measurement whichever is
greater. Conversion for cubic measurement shall be at
40 cu ft per ton and for weight at 2,240 lbs per ton. Where
the custom of the trade recognizes alternative conversion
rates in assessing tonnage such conversion rates will apply.
Cargo-Handling Output - Present and Future
4.        In 1969, average output per gang hour was 13.5 BLT/hour.  The
introduction of the new port facilities together with improvement of cargo-
handling operations and the introduction of prepalletization and unitized
loads for 10% of dry cargo, will raise gang productivity to 16 BLT/gang
hour, i.e. an overall productivity increase of about 20%. Regular port
working time: 305 days per year, 12 hours per day.

Port of Kota Kinabalu
5.        In 1969, 718 vessels entered the port of Kota Kinabalu, of which
313 were oceangoing or larger coastal vessels, 77 were tankers discharging
bulk petroleum and 328 were vessels of small size whose cargo was handled
by their own crew - not requiring port stevedores - either over the access
bridge or over the wharf, when not occupied by larger vessels. The tankers
will continue discharging alongside the existing facilities as long as these
remain operational.
1969      Cargo:  267,000 BLT - 24,000 (small boats)   = 243,000 BLT
output per working day 243,000: 305 = 797 BLT/day
output per working hour 797 : 12     =  66.4 BLT/hour
1976      Cargo:  384,000 BLT - 38,000 BLT (small boats) = 346,0oo BLT
output per working day 346,000 : 305            = 1,134 BLT/day
output per working hour 1,134  : 12             = 94.5 BLT/hour
number of gangs required 94.5  : 16             = 5.9, say 6 gangs

Wharf Output - Present and Fature
1969      267,000 BLT were handled at the existing facilities : 1,122 ft
long, i. e. 237.9 BLT/ft wharf/year. The newJ facilities planned
are 1,720 ft long. All boats, including the small ones, will
use the new facilities.
1976      Cargo:  384,000 BLT, available berth length : 1,720 ft., i.e.
223.2 BLT/ft wharf/year.
1985      Cargo:  567,000 BLT, available berth length : 1,720 ft, i.e.
329.6 BLT/ft wharf/year.
6.        The wharf-handling output, after opening of new facilities, will
increase by 20%v over 1969 and will reach 237.9 x 1.20 = 285.5 BLT/ft wharf/
year.  The balance:  329.6 - 285.5 = 44.1 BLT/ft wharf/year (15%) will have
to be handled during overtime should the pattern of cargo and shipping not
have changed by the early 1980's.  W-e assume, however, that in the late
1970's the percentage of unitized load and prepalletized cargo will increase,
that some containerization will commence and that overtime will not have to
be worked.

Port of Sandakan
7.        In 1969, some 2,h00 vessels entered Sandakan harbor, of which 870
were small barter-trade craft, mostly from the Philippines, which handled
some 5,400 tons of cargo over two small jetties in the harbor area. 160
tankers discharged some 80,000 tons of oil in bulk at specialized jetties
and loaded some 140,000 tons of oil in trums there for transshipment to
other ports. Some 1,030 vessels at anchorage handled some 1.8 million tons
of cargo, almost all logs.  (All of above 2,030 vessels did not affect
cargo operations over the existing wharf.) 371 oceangoing or large coastal
vessels handled some 262,000 BLT alongside the existing wharf. All cargo
was handled by contract stevedores. Tankers, log-carrying vessels and
small barter trade boats will continue their operations in a similar system,
even in future.
1969      Cargo:  262,000 BIT/from 317 vessels, i.e. 706 BLT/vessel
output per working day     262,000 : 305      = 859 BLT/day
output per working hour        859 : 12       = 71.6 BLT/hour
1976      Cargo:  417,000 BLT
output per working day     417,000 : 305      = 1.367 BLT/day
output per working hour    1.367   : 12       = 113.9 BLT/hour
number of gangs required   113.9   : 16       = 7.1 gangs
1985      Cargo: 650,000 BLT
output per working day     650,000 : 305      = 2.131 BLT/day
output per working hour    2.131   : 12       = 177.6 BLT/hour
number of gangs required   177.6   : 16       = 11.0 gangs
Wharf Output - Present and Future
1969      262,000 BLT were handled at the existing facilities 1,100 ft long,
i.e. 238.2 BLT/ft wharf/year.
The new facilities planned will provide some 1,800 ft of full
width berth.
1976      Cargo:  b17,000 BLT, i.e. 417,000: 1,800 = 231.7 BLT/ft wharf/year
1986      Cargo: 650,000 BLT, i.e. 650,000 : 1,800 = 350.0 BLT/ft wharf/year
8.        As seen above, the present wharf cargo-handling output is expected
to increase by 20% by 1976, i.e. 238.2 x 1.2 = 285.8 BLT/ft wharf/year.  The
balance 350 - 285.8 = 65.8 BLT/ft wharf/year (22%) will be handled by over-
time, should the pattern of cargo and shipping not have changes by the early

1980's. We assume, however, that in the late 1970's, the percentage of
unitized loads and prepalletization will increase, that containerization
will commence and that overtime will not have to be worked.

ALAYSIA
APPRAISAL OF SABAH PORTS PROJECT
Forecasting Approach
Introduction
1.        A breakdown of traffic statistics by comiodity for the
project ports is not available for years prior to 1969. It was not
possible, therefore, to determine by analysis whether there are
logical reasons for expecting past traffic trends to persist in the
future.
2.        As an alternative, a forecast of minimum volumes was estab-
lished by:
(a)  developing individual forecasts for imports of
petroleum products and automobiles, and exports
of primary commodities; and
(b) projecting in total the remaining traffic, consisting
largely of imports and transshipments of consumer
goods and machinery and equipment, at rates based
on population growth and increased per capita income.
3.        The population of Sabah 1960-1970 is shown in Table A.  The
natural increase during those years has averaged 3% per annum and is
increasing. Net migration has averaged a further 0.7%. Only 12% of
the population is over 45 years of age, and 44% is under 15. This
provides some assurance that the present rate of increase will be
maintained over the forecast period.
4.        No reliable data was available regarding per capita income
and its rate of increase. The indication from the rapid increase in
export income which has occurred in the last 10 years was not confirmed
by other indicators.
Forecasts
5.        Taking into account all the factors mentioned in paras. 3 and
4 above, undifferentiated dry cargo was forecast to increase at:
(a) 4% per annum at Kota Kinabalu; and
(b)  51 per annum at Sandakan.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
The difference of 1 percentage point recognizes that:
(a)  the rate of immigration to the east coast will be
higher than to the west, because the shortage of
labor is more acute there; and
(b)  the dynamic timber and palm oil industries are
located on the east coast and, in consequence,
per capita income will grow more rapidly there
than on the west coast.
6.        A number of alternative forecasting bases were tested for
autcmobiles, and a reasonably good relationship was established between
total vehicle registrations and total road mileage (see Table B). It
was, therefore, assumed that total motor vehicle registrations would
increase at the same rate as total road mileage which, in turn, was
projected at an annual rate of 9% - about the same as in 1969.
7.        Petroleum products are forecast to increase at:
(a) 10% per annum at Kota Kinabalu; and
(b) 12.5% per annum at Sandakan.
These rates are based upon discussions with the oil companies. Assumptions
are that:
(a) Diesel oil, which forms about 50% of total consumption
of petroleum products, will increase at 12% per annum
at Kota Kinabalu and at 15% per annum at Sandakan.
Diesel oil is used in the timber and wood products
industries in Sandakan, and at both Kota Kinabalu
and Sandakan for generation of electricity, the
consumption of which has been increasing at 10 to 20%
per annum in recent years.
(b) Other petroleum products, mainly motor gasoline,
aviation gasoline and jet fuel, will increase at
8% per annum at Kota Kinabalu and 10% per annum
at Sandakan.
8.        Timber is forecast to increase at 5` per annum from 1975 through
1985. From 1970 through 1975 the rate of increase is forecast to
decline from 6.1% in 1970 to 5% in 1975. The average for these years
is 5.7% (Table C). The 5% rate of increase is based on discussions
with a consultant who is advising the Sabah Government on forestry
policy.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
9.        The Sabah Government is exerting pressure on forestry conces-
sionaires to move towards further processing of forest products. It
has established a figure of 15-20% of total log production as the
industry's 1980 target for plywood and veneer production. The achieve-
ment of such a production volume presents many problems for the industry,
not the least being the disposal of low-value by-products. The cost of
transporting such products to market appears to be prohibitively high.
For this reason, the Government's target appears unrealistic and exports
of plywood and veneers were forecast instead to increase at 6% per annum,
1 percentage point faster than the increase in log production.
10.       Palm oil exports are based on data regarding acreage and yields
by estate, together with present rates of plantings. Plantings have been
projected at declining rates, as shown on Table D, and production was
forecast on the assumption of a five-year period from planting to maturity.
11.       Exports of palm kernels (Table D) were forecast at 14% of the
palm oil volume, and it was assumed that the volume elsewhere than at
Sandakan and Tawau would be insufficient to justify marketing.
12.       Exports of rubber, and the assumptions underlying the forecast
are shown in Table E. The gro-wth from 1970 to 1975 reflects the steadily
increasing proportion of high-yield trees, which will reach 100% by 1980.
The price of rubber is not expected to improve from present levels
because of the need to avoid substitution by synthetic rubber. In the
short term, prices will deteriorate from present levels. As a consequence
of this price trend, labor for tapping will continue in short supply and
production will remain at less than half of potential output. The labor
shortage, which will become acute on the east coast, will cause rubber
production to cease in the Sandakan area by 1980 and at Tawau by 1985.
On the west coast, however, the labor supply will remain adequate (taking
account of the increase in high-yield trees) to maintain production
at the 1980 level.
13.       The forecast for coconuts, cocoa, hemp and fish is shown
in Table F.
(a) The area under coconuts is continuing to expand at
about 5,000 acres per annum at present. However, it
is anticipated that shortage of labor and-diversification:
into more profitable crops will result in production of
copra stabilizing at present levels.
(b) The forecast for cocoa beans is based on data regarding
acreage and yields by estate, together with present and
anticipated rates of plantings.



ANIEX 7
Page 4
(c)  Exports of fish are expected to be maintained at the
1970 level throughout the forecast period. There has
been a problem of over-fishing which is believed to
have been solved by stricter regulation.
14.       Forecasts for the minor ports (Table G) reflect the same
considerations as outlined above. General cargo is forecast to increase
at 5% - 6% per annum except at Labuan, which is expected to lose the
substantial volume of oil-drilling supplies to the new port at Nuara
(Brunei). At present these supplies are transshipped at labuan for
onward forwarding to Brunei. This volume was therefore deducted from
both imports and exports to arrive at the forecast volumes. Thus
exports decline to zero by 1972 and imports are reduced from 113,000
tons in 1970 to 40,000 by 1972. These forecasts have been used only
for purposes of calculating SPA revenues.

ANNEX 9
Page 1
.MALAYSIA
APPRAISAL OF SABAH PORTS PROJECT
Bases and Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
1.      That a loan of US$16,In million equivalent will be made to SPA
effective October 1, 1971 at an interest rate of 71% per annum for a period
of 20 years including four years grace.
2.      That SPA will be liable to income tax at a standard rate of 40% of
net income until 174 and 45% thereafter.
3.      That SPA shall assume responsibility for other Sabah ports on the
dates shown below:
Sandakan              July 1, 1971
Kudat                 January 1, 1972
Kunak                 January 1, 1972
Lahad Datu            January 1, 1972
Semporna              January 1, 1972
Labuan                January 1, 1973
4.        That the fixed assets of the ports listed in 3 above shall be
vested in SPA by the Government on the dates stated, without charge as an
equity contribution. The value of land to be taken over by SPA at these
ports is based upon data furnished by the Sabah Land Office. Other fixed
asset values are mainly based upon cost data supplied by the Sabah Public
Works Department, suitably depreciated by Bank staff. These assets are
analyzed in Table 18.
5.        That upon completion of the IBRD projects at Kota Kinabalu and
Sandakan, SPA shall discontinue use and ownership of the immobile assets
at the old port sites except as follows:
(a)  SPA shall retain ownership and use of Kota Xinabalu old
port site warehouses.
(b) SPA shall have occasional access to and use of the old
Kota Kinabalu wharf for petroleum tankers only, as and
when necessary, until the proposed new oil jetty is
constructed.
It is further assumed that by December 31, 1974 the Government shall re-
assume ownership and be responsible for the maintenance of those assets
which SPA no longer needs to own.



ANNIEX 9
Page 2
6.        That the interest-free Government grant of M$ 2.2 million to SPA
shall not be repaid nor shall further grants be made to SPA from Govern-
mentts unreleased balance of M$ 1.2 million before December 31, 1977.
7.        That interest will be earned on cash surpluses at 5% per annum.
8.        That capital dredging at Tawau wharf will be undertaken during
1971/72 at a total cost of M$ 600,000 from SPA's own resources.
9.        That a 5% salary and wages increase for all SPA personnel shanll
occur in 1972 and 1975.
10.       That SPA Headquarter expenses shall be apportioned broadly on
the basis of cargo throughput (excluding timber in the stream) and the
charges borne by the ports at the rates shown in Table 16.
11.       Financial forecasts of earnings are based on SPA's current rates
and charges and it is assumed that during the period 1971-77 any rate
adjustments consequent upon a review and relation to costs will not reduce
the overall level of the rate structure.
12.       Expenditure forecasts for ports not yet taken over by SPA are
largely based upon SPA's experience at Kota Kinabalu and Tawau, SPA's
assessments of personnel needs at these ports and the traffic forecasts
in Annex 7.
