APPRAISAL OF THE KATHMANDU TOURISM PROJECT
SUMMARY
i.        This report appraises a project to provide additional hotel
accommodation in Kathmandu, for which an IDA credit of Us$ 4.2 million
is proposed. The project has two components -- the remodelling and
extension of the existing 90-room Hotel de l'Annapurna into a 241-room
hotel of first class international standard; and the construction of a
new second class hotel of 120 rooms, to be called the Yak and Yeti Hotel.
ii.       Nepal has many attractions for the foreign visitor, including
magnificent scenery, opportunities for climbing and trekking, and a
rich cultural heritage. Kathmandu is the main entry point of foreign
tourists, as well as being an important tourist destination in its own
right.
iii.      Some 46,ooo non-Indian_/ foreign tourists visited Nepal in
1970, arrivals having grown steadily at an average rate of 37% a year
since 1965.  Although gross receipts of foreign exchange from tourism
probably did not exceed US$ 2 million equivalent in 1970, prospects for
further expansion are considered excellent. International tourism is
by far the most promising means open to Nepal for earning hard currency.
With the Asian Development Bank project for the improvement of Kathmandu
airport in progress, the main constraint on the growth of tourism is the
shortage of suitable hotel rooms. The additional accommodation to be
financed by the proposed credit lies well within even the most conserva-
tive estimates of future demand, and average annual rates of room occu-
pancy of 75% for the Hotel de l'Annapurna and 70% for the Yak and Yeti
Hotel are expected.
iv.       The sponsor of the Hotel de l'Annapurna sub-project is the
Hotel de l'Annapurna Pvt. Ltd. of which the three shareholders are mem-
bers of the Royal family. The shareholders of the Hotel Yak and Yeti
Pvt. Ltd. are a British citizen experienced in the hotel business and an
Indian citizen, both having many years' association with Nepal. Suitable
arrangements will be made for the management of both hotels.
v.        The total investment in the two sub-projects, including land,
contingencies, the valuation of the existing assets, interest and other
charges during construction, and working capital is US$ 7.37 million
equivalent. The proposed IDA credit of US$ 4.2 million would cover the
1/ Indians are not shown in the immigration statistics. An estimated
4,000 Indians arrived by air in 1970.



- ii -
total estimated foreign exchange costs of the project. The balance of
the required financing would be provided by the sponsors. Cost esti-
mates have been reviewed during negotiations, to take account of recent
instability in the sub-continent, and currency changes. No significant
changes to the estimates were required, ample contingency allowances hav-
ing been provided.
vi.       Contracts for civil works and the supply of equipment will be
awarded in accordance with IDA's guidelines for international competi-
tive bidding.
vii.      The sub-projects will be carried out by the sponsors, with the
assistance and supervision of the Nepal Industrial Development Corpora-
tion (NIDC). Each sponsor will select a suitably qualified project man-
ager to supervise construction on their behalf. The NIDC will act on
behalf of the Government in channeling the IDA credit to the sponsors of
the two sub-projects, and in so doing will receive a service charge from
the Government. It is proposed that the IDA funds should be relent
through the NIDC for a term of 24 years, including a 4 years' grace period,
at a rate of interest of 7-1/2% per annum.
viii.     The Hotel de l'Annapurna is expected to achieve a financial rate
of return on a discounted cash flow basis of between 8.8% and 10.6% on the
total investment, depending on the assumptions made on rates of room occu-
pancy and on the date of opening of the extension. The rate of return for
the Yak and Yeti Hotel on the same basis ranges from 7.4% to 9.4%. Debt
service cover is adequate for both. On the lending terms proposed, the
return on equity would range from 10.0% to 15.2% for the Hotel de l'Anna-
purna, and from 7.6% to 12.3% for the Yak and Yeti Hotel.
ix.       Best estimates of the economic rate of return are 20% for each
hotel. The differences between the financial and economic rates of return
are due to adjustments for taxes and to the inclusion of an estimate of
the net benefit accruing as a result of the expenditure of hotel guests
on shopping and sightseeing outside the hotels. The whole project will
create about 500 additional jobs, and the net direct foreign exchange
earnings are likely to be of the order of US$ 2.8 million equivalent per
annum at full operation.
x.        The project is suitable for an IDA credit of us$ 4.2 million.
The borrower would be the Kingdom of Nepal.



EPAL
APPRAISAL OF THE KATHMANDU TOURISM PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Nepal has long recognized the opportunities
offered by the expansion of tourism. In the fall of 1970 it asked IDA
for assistance in developing the sector.
1.02      A project identification mission visited Nepal in February
1971, followed by a preparation mission in March, and an appraisal mis-
sion consisting of Messrs. Hayman, Renkewitz, and Vera in July. These
missions confirmed that Nepal could greatly increase its foreign exchange
earnings from tourism, provided more good hotel accommodation was built.
After reviewing several hotel projects, two were selected for immediate
consideration.
2. BACKGROUND
A. The Country and its Economy
2.01      The Kingdom of Nepal is a land-locked country bordering on
Tibet in the north, and India, its main trading partner, in the east,
south, and west.  Roughly 800 km long and 170 km wide (about the same
total size as Greece), it is divided into three distinct physical
regions extending in an east-west direction for the length of the coun-
try. These are the relatively fertile Terai plains in the south; the
hill country of central Nepal, including the Kathmandu Valley; and the
Himalayas, the world's highest mountains, in the north. The central and
northern regions are crossed by deep valleys running generally from north
to south. The country's resources are few and the terrain over much of
its area makes communication extremely difficult. Nepal's population of
some 11 million is estimated to be growing at about 2.2% per year --
roughly the same rate of growth as the GDP. Per capita GDP of about
US$ 70 equivalent a year is among the lowest of the developing countries.
Over 90% of Nepal's population is engaged in agriculture which, including
forestry, accounts for around 70% of GDP. The countrj is still in the
first stages of economic development, consisting of many loosely-linked
valley economies. A large part of the population remains outside the
money economy.
2.02      Nepal's foreign trade is dominated by its relationship with
India, which takes about 90% of its total exports, mostly foodgrains



- 2 -
and other food products. Apart from merchandise exports, the country's
most important sources of foreign exchange are gurkha remittances and
pensions. While tourist receipts are still very small (officially esti-
mated at U1S$ 1.3 million equivalent in 1969/70, less than 5% of total
receipts of convertible foreign exchange), the prospects for growth in
tourist receipts seem better than for other sources of convertible cur-
rencies. Gurkha remittances and pensions will decline, with reduced
recruitment. Market prospects for jute and jute products are rather
uncertain. Other resources, such as musk and animal skins are believed
to be in danger of depletion.
B. The Tourism Sector
2.03      Nepal is a beautiful and exotic country which until recently
was forbidden to outsiders. The world's most tremendous mountains chal-
lenge increasing numbers of climbers and trekkers, while in the hills
and valleys a colorful way of life continues, largely unchanged for cen-
turies. In the jungles of southern Nepal are rare species of wild ani-
mals. The birthplace of Buddha at Lumbini is a center of pilgrimage.
2.04      The ancient cities of the Kathmandu Valley were created by a
unique mingling of cultures. Temples, monasteries, old markets, carv-
ings, and statues abound, around which revolves a complex calendar of
festivals, ceremonies and fairs in which Buddhist and Hindu practices
are often unselfconsciously combined. The many ornate palaces of the
Ranas are witness to an autocratic regime which was displaced as
recently as 1951.
2.05      The climate of Kathmandu is generally pleasant, and -does not
impose a seasonal pattern on tourist arrivals, except insofar as some
flights may be cancelled during the rains, particularly in June. This
difficulty should be largely resolved by airport improvements in the
region.
2.06      The main constraints on the growth of tourist traffic to Nepal
have been limited air services and the lack of suitable hotel accommoda-
tion. The former is being relieved by the ADB airport program and the
initiative of the airlines. The proposed credit would alleviate the lat-
ter.
2.07      Nepal has seen rapid and sustained growth in numbers of foreign
visitors. Excluding Indians, 46,0oo foreigners visited Nepal in 1970, an
average annual rate of increase in arrivals of 37% since 1965. Due to
the close ties between Nepal and India, Indian citizens do not complete
the same immnigration formalities as other foreigners, and consequently
are not included in the immigration statistics. The Department of Tour-
ism estimates that some 4,000 Indians visited Kathmandu by air in 1970.
In addition there are many thousands of unrecorded crossings of the long



- 3 -
land frontier between Nepal and India, which, if included in the statis-
tics, would greatly increase the total number of Indian arrivals.
Due to the cancellation of some tourist groups during 1971, attributed
to unsettled conditions elsewhere in the sub-continent, it is expected
that the total number of foreign arrivals during the year will be about
the same as in 1970
2.08      Seventy-nine percent of non-Indian foreign tourists reached
Nepal by air in 1970. Road improvements and the growing popularity of
"mini-trek" type holidays have however been accompanied by an increasing
proportion of road visitors, including many young people from Europe and
the United States.
2.09      Gross foreign exchange receipts from tourism were officially
estimated at US$ 1.3 million equivalent in 1969/70. Since a substantial
volume of tourist transactions is believed to pass through unofficial
channels, this is probably an underestimate, a more likely figure being
of the order of US$ 2 million equivalent in 1970.
2.10      There are at present 558 rooms in hotels classified by the
Department of Tourism throughout Nepal, of which 500 are in Kathmandu:
a variety of unclassified accommodation is available, which could appeal
only to the spartan. Another 124 rooms are currently being built in a
second class hotel some distance from town, and 15 in the form of bunga-
lows on the outskirts. There is also a proposal to add 170 rooms to the
existing first class Soaltee Hotel.
2.11      Visitors have in general been prepared to accept lower stand-
ards of accommodation and service in Kathmandu than they would expect as
a matter of course elsewhere. Only four hotels with 318 rooms between
them can be considered as offering services approaching medium grade
hotels in, say, Bangkok, Singapore, or Hong Kong.
2.12      The proposed project would add 271 rooms, almost doubling
capacity in the higher category hotels. It would provide Kathmandu for
the first time with a hotel comparable in standard to international
class hotels in other countries. The existing better class hotels are
very heavily booked during much of the year, therefore much of the new
capacity would provide for presently unsatisfied demand. With the pros-
pective growth of traffic high occupancy rates are expected.
2.13      Present scheduled air services link Kathmandu with Bangkok,
Rangoon, Calcutta, Delhi, Patna and Benares. Air routes from Kathmandu
westwards therefore at present involve a change of flight in India.
Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) ara considerin4g new routes, over
which they are planning to operate jet equipment. The runway of Kathmandu
airport will be extended under the ADB airport program to 10,000 feet by
the start of full operation of the hotel project, enabling aircraft of
the DC8/B707 type to operate without undue restrictions. Improvements
are also being made in lighting and navigational aids. Foreign airlines



-4-
will become increasingly interested in negotiating traffic rights to
Kathmandu, once the airport is improved, and once new hotel accommoda-
tion is under construction: more hotel accommodation of the appropri-
ate standard is a prerequisite for improved air connections. The geo-
graphical situation of Nepal gives special significance to interna-
tional air services.
3. THE PROJECT
3.01      The project consists of the refurbishing and extension of the
Hotel de l'Annapurna and the construction of the new Yak and Yeti Hotel.
These particular hotels were selected from several possibilities for a
number of reasons, which included their suitability to the needs of the
market, their probability of being implemented, their technical and
financial viability, the prospects for sound management, their size,
the experience of the sponsors, their state of preparation, and their
location.
A. The Sponsors
3.02      The sponsor of the Hotel de l'Annapurna is the Hotel de l'Anna-
purna Pvt. Ltd. The shareholders are H.R.H. 1st Queen Mother Kanti Rajya
Laxmi Devi Shah, H.R.H. 2nd Queen Mother Iswari Rajya Laxmi Devi Shah, and
H.R.H. Princess Helen Shah.  The company was formed in March 1971, with
an authorized capital of NRs. 20 million of which NRs. 6.4 million is paid
iup. The company owns the existing Hotel de l'Annapurna, which was oper-
ated under an interim management agreement by Hilton International up to
the end of 1971. Details of the current operation are given in Annex 4.
3.03      The Yak and Yeti Pvt. Ltd. has two main shareholders.
Mr. Radesham Saraf is an Indian citizen having substantial industrial and
trading investments in Nepal. Mr. Lissanevitch is a British national, who
has been living in Nepal for about 20 years. He has had many years of experi-
ence of the hotel and catering business, first in India, then for 12 years
as manager of the Royal Hotel, Kathmandu, and currently as owner of the
successful Yak and Yeti restaurant. For a further description of the
sponsors, see Annex 4.
B.  Description
3.04      The Hotel de l'Annapurna Pvt. Ltd. owns the freehold of the land
required. The Yak and Yeti sub-project will be on land that is partly free-
hold and partly leasehold, arrangements for the purchase of land for an
access road having also been agreed in principle by the present owners, the



- 5 -
NIDC. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that legal opinion
would be furnished that land title and conditions of leases meet the
requirements of the project.
Hotel de lAnnapurna
3.05      The existing hotel is located in central Kathmandu, near the
Royal Palace and within walking distance of the old city. The present
structure was opened in 1965 and has three floors offering 90 guest
rooms, one dining room, a small bar, and two small shops. The entrance
lobby and reception area are small and frequently congested. The exte-
rior appearance of the hotel, and the interior design of public and
guest rooms are modest.
3.06      The project will create round the nucleus of the existing hotel
new accommodation of first class international standard, while permitting
the present hotel to remain open. One hundred and fifty nine new rooms
will be built, and 82 of the present rooms refurbished to give a total of
241 twin-bedded rooms. Eight of the existing rooms will be eliminated to
make space for enlarged public areas. Central air-conditioning and a cen-
tral hot water system will be installed. A coffee shop, a main dining
room and a speciality restaurant will be provided, and lounge and bar
space expanded. A swimming pool with a patio bar will be built, and the
tennis courts relocated and improved. The hotel will have its own laun-
dry and drycleaning facilities.
3.07      Exterior design and interior decoration will be to a high stand-
ard, and careful attention will be paid to landscaping.
3.08      The sewage system which services the existing hotel is also ade-
quate for the extension. Electricity is available from the town supply,
and the hotel will have its own water purifying and softening plant, for
which an adequate supply will be available from the municipality.
The Yak and Yeti Hotel
3.09      The site for this hotel is in the grounds of an old palace,
which houses the present successful Yak and Yeti restaurant. It is
located in central Kathmandu, a few hundred yards from the Hotel de
ltAnnapurna. The grounds include a small lake, and the site lends itself
to attractive landscaping. Access to the present restaurant involves a
long detour around side streets, so the project provides for a new access
road directly from one of Kathmandu's main thoroughfares, on land to be
acquired from the NIDC. Preliminary agreement on the purchase of this
land was confirmed during negotiations.
3.10      The proposed hotel will have a basement and four floors, and
will offer 24 single rooms, 84 twin-bedded rooms each with a balcony,
and 6 suites each of which can be used as two double rooms. Bedrooms
will not be air-conditioned, but individual units will be provided for



suites and public rooms. Provision is made for a coffee shop and a bar,
together with access to the Yak and Yeti restaurant in the old palace.
3.11      Other facilities are to include a swimming pool, tennis courts,
a sauna, and a roof garden. The preliminary drawings by a Nepalese archi-
tect suggest that the exterior of the hotel will be simple and attractive.
Maximum use will be made throughout of local wood carvings and other
handicrafts, and the high standard of interior design evident in the pre-
sent Yak and Yeti restaurant will be maintained.
3.12      The hotel will be connected to an existing sewage system.  Elec-
tricity and water supplies from the municipality will be adequate, and
the hotel will have its own water purifying and softening plant.
C. Management and Staffing
3.13      The existing Hotel de l'Annapurna had an interim management
agreement with Hilton International Company, a subsidiary of TWA, since
March 1970.  At the mutual request of both companies, this interim agree-
ment was terminated at the end of 1971. A full management agreement is
still in force, providing for Hilton technical assistance during con-
struction of the extension, marketing and training services, and Hilton
management of the upgraded hotel on its completion. Hilton operates 52
hotels around the world, for which management agreements are broadly the
same. In the case of the Hotel de l'Annapurna, these provide for direct
costs being charged against the operation, Hilton receiving a basic man-
agement fee of 5% of total sales plus an incentive payment of 10% of
gross operating profit.
3.14      Hilton has introduced some training schemes for the staff of
the Hotel de lAnnapurna. These will be expanded in the future, to have
well-trained local staff available for the start of operation of the
extension. So far, four Nepalese supervisors have been sent to Hilton
hotels in the region for training.
3.l5      The extended hotel will provide employment for 465 persons, of
whom 15 will initially come from abroad. Such foreigners will work at
the supervisory level and will have had broad experience in hotel opera-
tions. The government's policy is to authorize the employment of for-
eigners if qualified Nepalese are not available.  Given Hilton Interna-
tional's experience in opening and operating 1 tels, the management
arrangements are considered satisfactory. If for any reason either
party should wish to withdraw from the agreement, similar arrangements
could be made with one of a number of other experienced hotel operating
companies. In view of the size and standards of the extended hotel,
the assistance of a specialized management company is considered essen-
tial, the arrangements being subject to IDA approval.



-7-
3.16      The management of the Yak and Yeti Hotel will not be assigned
to a hotel management firm. One of the two shareholders, Mr. Lissane-
vitch has broad experience in the hotel and catering industry, and man-
aged the Royal Hotel in Kathmandu for many years. His present restau-
rant is widely known and has an excellent reputation. Provision will be
made to hire well-qualified expatriate staff for managerial and profes-
sional levels. Of 290 employees, 30 already work in the existirg restau-
rant, and 7 will be recruited abroad. The assistant to Mr. Lissanevitch
holds degrees from Swiss and American hotel schools. Furthermore,
Mr. Lissanevitch's three sons are to be trained abroad in hotel manage-
ment. No major difficulties should, therefore, arise in the management
and staffing of the hotel. IDA will approve the qualifications and expe-
rience of the manager to be engaged.
3.17      The Government has been helped by the International Labour
Organisation in preparing a request to the United Nations Development
Program for assistance in setting up a Hotel Training School in Kathmandu.
Whilst both the Hotel de l'Annapurna and the Yak and Yeti Hotel can make
satisfactory training arrangements of their own, the establishment of
such a school will further improve the supply of qualified staff.

3.19      The compounded annual rate of increase of civil works costs
is estimated to have been between 8.5% and 9.0% in the last ten years.
Assuming that the increase in prices will continue at the same rate, a
provision of 15% of construction costs and 12% of siteworks costs is
included in the contingency allowance given in Table 5. In addition,
an allowance of 10% of the cost of construction and siteworks, and 15%
of equipment and professional services has been made to meet any costs
unforeseen at this time. This is appropriate in this case. since
detailed estimates must await the final design stage, and also because
of difficulties that may arise in the transportation of materials. Dur-
ing negotiations cost estimates were reviewed with the sponsors, and no
significant changes were considered necessary.
Amount of the Credit
3.20      The proposed credit of Us$ 4.2 million would cover the foreign
exchange costs of the project, which amount to 64% of the total project
costs plus interest and other charges during construction. Most building
materials, equipment and specialized labor are imported. The sponsors
would finance the remainder, as specified in paragraphs 5.01 and 5.03
below.
E. Execution
3.21      The proposed credit will be channeled from the Government to
the sponsors through the Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC).
For a discussion of the NIDCts organization and financial condition, see
Annex 3.
3.22      The NIDC was set up in 1959, is fully Government owned, and is
the country's only industrial development bank. In its first eleven
years it approved total loans of NRs. 140 million for 154 projects, of
which NRs. 55 million was actually disbursed for 115 projects. It has
appraised around 30 hotel projects, of which it has financed 13. It has
therefore, built up substantial experience of the workings of the hotel
industry in Nepal. The NIDC employs over 200 people, and many of the
professionals are well qualified.
3.23      The NIDC's financial position has been weak, due in part to the
management's inability to enforce timely repayment from scme of its bor-
rowers. Executive assistance from the ADB is under discussion, with a
view to putting into effect firmer policies in this respect.
3.24      The NIDC will be responsible for overall supervision, coordina-
tion with other government agencies, coordination with the sponsors, and
liaison with IDA. It will be required that the NIDC allocate enough
staff time from properly qualified engineers, procurement officers, and
accountants to ensure that each sub-project is effectively supervised.
Day-to-day supervision on behalf of the sponsors, and their liaison with
the NIDC, will be provided by a project manager for each sub-project,



- 10 _
their qualifications being subject to IDA approval. IDA will approve
final drawings for all construction works.
3.25      It is proposed that the cost to the NIDC in acting on behalf
of the Government in supervising and administering the sub-loans be
covered by a service charge. During negotiations, the professional
staff timae and other resources that the NIDC would need to commit in
order to supervise the sub-projects effectively were reviewed. The
NIDC estimated that their cost for providing these services on behalf
of the Government would be covered by a service, charge of US$ 20,000
equivalent per year during the first four years of the project, and
JS$ 4,000 per year during the rest of the life of the sub-loans. The
arrangements were accepted in principle by the Government and NIDC
representatives.  The risk of any possible default will be borne by the
Government and not the NIDC, since the NIDC will repay the sub-loans to
the Government only to the extent that it receives repayment frcti the
sponsors. The sub-loans will not be included in the NIDC's balance
sheets.
Construction Period
3.26      It is planned that construction would be completed within a
2-1/l-year period; the period of implementation for both sub-projects
would spread over 3 years, including defect liability periods of 9 months,
as shown Ln Chart 1.
Procurement
3.27      Civil works and equipment supply contracts costing the equiva-
lent of uS$ 50,000 or more for each separate project item would be
awarded under international competitive bidding in accordance with IDAts
guidelines. Items would be grouped to the extent practicable to encour-
age such competitive bidding. Local manufacturers of furniture would be
allored a preferential margin of 15% of c.i.f. costs of competing imports
or the existing rate of duty, whichever is lower. The two project man-
agers and their consultants would be responsible for evaluating bids, on
the basis of which evaluations the NIDC would recommend contracts for IDA
approval.
Only two qualified building conbractors are established in the
country, both of them employing specialized Indian sub-contractors, but
it is expected that many foreign contractors would submit bids. Whether
domestic or foreign contractors should win the bids, the foreign exchange
componen-t in total project costs would vary little, as both domestic and
foreign contractors need to import most materials, equipment and special-
ized labor. A pre-qualification system acceptable to IDA would be intro-
duced to ensure that only properly qualified contractors would be permit-
ted to submit bids for the construction of the hotels.  Detailed lists of
furniture and equipment will be submitted for IDA approval prior to pro-
curement;



- 11 -
Disbursement
3.29      The proposed credit would be disbursed on the basis of the c.i.f.
costs of imported equipment and furniture and the ex-factory cost of locally
produced furniture; the foreign exchange costs of technical assistance and
professional services; and appropriate percentage of civil works, and pre-
opening expenses. The estimated foreign exchange components are shown in
Table 3. These percentages would be adjusted as necessary so that withdrawa:
would be distributed over the project implementation period. A schedule of
disbursement is shown in Table 4. Savings, if any, after completion of the
project would be expected to be cancelled.
4.  JUSTIFICATION
A. Market Demand
4.01      The existing supply of accommodation has virtually reached satura-
tion, and the two leading hotels are heavily booked during peak seasons.
Nepal's tourist industry can therefore expect only very modest growth until
more hotel rooms of appropriate standard are available.
4.02      United States tourists make up the largest share of foreign non-
Indian arrivals, over 30% in 1970:  the British, French and German
accounted for about 11% each. Some of these would have been expatriates
living in neighboring countries, but most are visiting Nepal in the course
of a round-the-world or Far East tour. About 80% of foreigners come by air,
although a gradually increasing proportion have been coming by road.
4.03      Many tourists visiting Nepal at present are also visiting India.
As new air routes develop, and as Nepal becomes more of an accepted destina-
tion in its own right, the proportion doing so may well drop. In the short
term, however, Nepal stands to gain by steps India takes to improve its
tourist facilities. Having only 18,000 hotel roams suitable for foreign
tourists at present, India is constructing another 7,000 and the officially
stated intention is to build another 10,000 by 1973. Some 290,000 foreign
tourists visited India in 1970, and a target has been set of one million by
1978.
4.04      Nepal is also included in tours which go on to Bangkok and the
Far East. Thailand received some 629,000 foreign visitors in 1970, of whom
some 333,000 originated by nationality in America, Europe and the Middle
East (excluding American service personnel). Even if these tourist arrivals
to Thailand should grow at a conservative 10% per year, then by 1978 they
would amount to some 1.4 million.



- 12 -
4.05      Nepal can also appeal strongly to the Japanese market.  Though
Japanese arrivals are as yet few in absolute terms, Japanese groups have
been reaching Kathmandu in increasing numbers, both for sightseeing and
trekking. The importance of promoting Nepal in Japan is fully recognized
by the Department of Tourism. Some 330,000 Japanese went overseas on
vacation in 1970, an average rate of growth since 1966 of 40% per year.
Recent studies indicate that this figure could grow to between 2 and 2.7
million by 1978, on conservative assumptions. The great circle mileage
between Japan and Nepal is less than that from Japan to, for example,
Hawaii or Fiji.
4.06      World tourism expenditures have been growing at around 12% per
year. Further expansion is expected, as rising incomes in the main mar-
kets are accompanied by better transport and accommodation facilities,
more sophisticated travel marketing, more leisure time and earlier
retirement, and lower holiday prices in real terms. Nepal's share of
total tourist movements will probably remain so small that its success
in attracting tourists will be almost entirely determined by the hotel
and transport supply it can offer. Nevertheless, there are a number of
discernible trends in world tourism which suggest that market demand
for a destination such as Nepal will remain particularly strong. Such
trends include the tendency to move further afield as established desti-
nations become more congested and commonplace; group and charter fares
tending to lower the travel cost barrier to distant destinations; the
growing popularity of round-the-world travel; the growth in activity
holidays, such as trekking; and the increasing number of second holi-
days per year.
4.07      The Government has formulated a tourism policy which should
enable Nepal to realize its tourism potential.  Visas and trekking per-
mits are readily granted, but any steps which can be taken to improve
the facilitation of tourists still further should be encouraged. The
Go-.-er3r-ientIs civil aviation policy recognizes the central role that
both Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation and foreign airlines will have
to play ai supporting the growth of tourism.
4.08      Although Nepal is now an attractive tourist destination, some
futuire developments will enhance its appeal still further. The comple-
tion of the road to Pokhara and the improvement of its airport will
enable two-center holidays to be effectively promoted.  Pokhara lies
near a lak-e beneath the spectacular Machhapuchhare Peak, and is an estab-
lished center for trekking.  The expansion of the road network through-
out the Katbmlandu Valley will open up many beautiful areas to convenient
sightseeing.  Lu;bini, the birthplace of Buddha, lies some 130 miles by
air to the west of Kathmandu, a few miles on the Nepalese side of the
border with India.  Imaginative and ambitious plans are being made to
build a unique religious center there, for which funds are being sought
from many sources, including governments of countries with large Buddhist
populations.  Building such a center at Lumbini will publicize Nepal, and
a niimhe- of 'ilgrims will also wish to visit major Buddhist shrines in
Kathmandu



- 13 -
4.09      Hotels in Nepal face the risk that their occupancy rates are
vulnerable to political disturbances, strikes, or serious epidemics in
any one of the other countries which are included in the itinerary of
tourists visiting Nepal. This element of risk will decrease as new
air routes and more tourist facilities and promotion enable Nepal to
develop as a main destination instead of a stopover on a multi-country
tour. The 75% and 70% rates of room occupancy taken as the higher
assumption for the Hotel de l'Annapurna and the Yak and Yeti Hotel
respectively are considered to be achievable when good and bad years
are averaged together. The existing hotels that offer acceptable inter-
national standards have begun to show high rates of occupancy of their
available accommodation. The additional capacity provided by the pro-
posed sub-projects will achieve the higher rates of occupancy assumed
in the financial projections not later than 1978 if tourist arrivals
grow at less than 13% compound per year, even if the proposed 170-room
extension to the Soaltee Hotel is built. This rate of growth is far
below historical rates. The Yak and Yeti Hotel, by providing comfort-
able accommodation, well-managed, with good food, at prices below those
of the Hotel de l'Annapurna, will meet the needs of an important seg-
ment of the market not well catered for in Kathmandu at present.
B. Economic Justification
4!.10     The economic justification for the project is reviewed in
Annex 1.
4.11      The net benefits to the economy will consist primarily of
expenditures of additional guests in the hotels, less the cost of oper-
ating the facilities. The related investments are the capital costs of
the hotels, negligible additional infrastructure being required. Other
benefits included in the calculation of the economic rate of return are
those deriving from the expenditures of the additional tourists visiting
Nepal as a result of the project on visas, shopping, and sightseeing.
Taxes and duties have been eliminated from the financial costs, and the
5% Government sales tax added to financial benefits.
4.12      The best estimate of the internal economic rate of return
would be 19.9% for the Hotel de l'Annapurna, 20.8% for the Yak and Yeti
Hotel, and 20.2% for the two combined. The rates of return are sensi-
tive to the assumptions made on rates of room occupancy and the dates
of opening: a reduction of 5 percentage points in room occupancy,
together with a delay of 12 months in opening the new accommodation,
lowers the economic rates of return to 16-2% for the 1Totel de l'Anna-
purna, and 16.8% for the Yak and Yeti Hotel.
4.13      The effect of the economic rate of return of shadow pricing
foreign exchange and labor was tested. A shadow exchange rate of 14
rupees to the dollar, as against the official rate of 10.125, raised



- 1.4 
the rates of return by 5 percentage points for the Hotel de l'Annapurna
and 4 percentage points for the Yak and Yeti Hotel. A shadow wage rate
for semi and unskilled labor of 40% of actual wages raised the rates of
return by 3 percentage points and 2 percentage points for each hotel
respectively. Shadow pricing has however not been used to calculate the
best estimate of economic rate of return.
4-14      The project will directly create some 500 new jobs.  It will
moreover stimulate employment in the handicraft and tour operating indus-
tries, and will provide a base for trekking and climbing expeditions.
The latter employ relatively large numbers of porters in remote areas of
the country. Indirect employment effects cannot be quantified, but may
be substantial. Other benefits which could not be quantified include
those derived from increased embarkation taxes, landing fees, and
improved load factors for Royal Nepal Airlines.
41.15     When in full operation from 1978 onwards, the project is
expected to increase direct gross foreign exchange earnings by UE$ 4.8
million equivalent per year, more than double estimated gross tourism
receipts in 1970. Net earnings of foreign exchange may be estimated at
US$ 2.8 million equivalent per year, including US$ 0.3 million equivalent
per year in net receipts from shopping, etc. These earnings compare with
the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project of US$ 4.2 million
equivalent.

The equity contribution of the Hotel de l'Annapurna Pvt. Ltd. will
include cash to the equivalent of US$ 1.21 million as well as land
valued at the original price of acquisition of Us$ 0.08 million, exist-
ing assets valued at US$ 0.46 million, and working capital of US$ 0.10
million. Existing assets have been valued at their book values at the
time of opening. The required cash contribution will be provided out
of the profits of the existing hotel in the period fram 1971 to 1974
amounting to US$ 0.76 million equivalent as well as by cash contribution
of the order of US$ 0.55 million equivalent.



- 16 -
5.02      The long-term debt of US$ 3.28 million equivalent is to con-
sist of two parts. The IDA credit amounting to 7JS$ 2.88 million for
the foreign exchange requirements of the sub-project, and the capital-
ized interest during construction of Us$ 0.40 million. The capitalizing
of interest and other charges during construction is justified in view of
the relatively large scale of expansion proposed, and the risk of pos-
sible loss of business due to disturbance and inconvenience during the
construction period.
5.03      In the case of the Yak and Yeti Hotel, the equity contribu-
tion will amount to the equivalent of us$ o.74 million including cash
of US$ 0.60 million, land valued at the original acquisition price of
us$ 0.05 million and existing assets valued at US$ 0.05 million, as
well as working capital of US$ o.o4 million. The loan will comprise
US$ 1.32 million for the foreign exchange requirements and US$ 0.18
million for capitalized interest and other charges during construction.
5.04      The NIDC will act for the Government in on-lending to the
sponsors of the two sub-projects. Each sub-loan agreement will be sub-
ject to IDA approval. Each sub-loan will carry an interest rate of
7-1/2% per annum, plus a commitment charge of 1/4% per annum on the
undisbursed balance: these are the standard conditions available to
hotel projects in Nepal. The signature of the respective sub-loan
agreement will be a condition of effectiveness of that part of the
credit allocated to the sub-project.
5.05      The term of each sub-loan will be 24 years, including a
4g-year grace period to cover construction and the first full operating
year. Terms of this length, and longer, are not uncommon in hotel
financing. On the basis of the assumptions made in the financial pro-
jections, both sub-projects need a term of this length and the proposed
interest rate in order to be able to provide a return on equity which,
although, modest, is likely to prove attractive to the sponsors. The
assumuptions on tariffs and occupancy levels are in line with the
expected level of demand, and the probable development of competitive
accommodation. If these assumptions should turn out in practice to
have beer conservative in the event of continuing world-wide inflation
after the opening date, the improved profitability of the hotels will
enable them to repay their loans more quickly. This possibility is
aillowed for in the sub-loan agreements with each sponsor by the inclu-
sion of a requirement whereby additional dividends in excess of 20% of
the par value of the capital shares in any one year would be matched by
an equal payment towards the accelerated repayment of the loan.
5.06      Rach sub-loan agreement includes provisions for the securing
of each sub-loan by the NIDC on behalf of the government by mortgages
on fixed assets. Annual provisions for depreciation are expected to be not
less than 6.4% of total fixed assets for the Hotel de l'Annapurna and
4.9% for the Yak and Yeti Hotel.  It is required that not less than 20%
of net profits after taxes will be retained in the reserves of each



- 17 -
company. NIDC approval will be required before any additional long-
term debt is assumed. Ths exchange risk on the foreign exchange com-
ponent of the sub-loans will be borne by the sponsors.
5.07      The equity capital will be contributed according to a sched-
ule related to the financing requirements of eath sub-project. In the
case of the Hotel de l'Annapurna, it will be required that no dividends
are paid out during the period of implementation unless this schedule
is respected. This, as well as a commitment by the sponsors to provide
the necessary equity, was agreed during negotiations. In addition, per-
sonal guarantees, acceptable to IDA and the NIDC based on the latter's
evaluation of each sponsor's resources, will be required for each sponsor's
commitment to meet cost overruns. The NIDC would, in accordance with
its normal practice, be prepared to make a separate loan to cover up to
70% of such overruns. Both companies will be liable to Nepalese income
taxes amounting to 45% of taxable profits, but both qualify for the
5-year tax holiday for which approved projects are eligible in Nepal.
5.08      Owners equity in the Hotel de l'Annapurna, with the general
reserve, amounts to US$ 155,000 equivalent. The owners have also pro-
vided an unsecured loan of US$ 507,000 equivalent. The company has a
secured loan from the NIDC, of which US$ 25,ooo equivalent is outstand-
ing, due to be amortized by October 1974; and a small unsecured loan
from the Nepal Rastra Bank. Loans to the campany by its shareholders
will be converted into equity before signature of the sub-loan agree-
ments.
5.09      With the accumulation of retained earnings both companies
might find opportunities for profitable investment. Annual capital
expenditures other than replacement in excess of us$ 50,000 equivalent
will, however, be made only with the approval of NIDC.
5.1o      Accounts and financial statements will be kept by both com-
panies in a form acceptable to IDA and the audited accounts should be
presented within 6 months of the close of the financial year. Accounts
will be audited by a qualified independent firm of auditors acceptable
to IDA.
B. Financial Forecast
5.11      Forecasts of annual earnings, financial position and cash
flow for the first 21 years of the sub-projects are presented in Tables
10, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20, and details of the assumptions are given in
Annex 2.

5.12      Assumptions on operating costs and revenues are based on inter-
national experience, taking account of local conditions. Tariffs for the
Hotel de l'Annapurna are based on present tariffs, adjusted for the up-
grading of the facilities, and for price increases expected tay 1975.
Tariffs for the Yak and Yeti Hotel are related to the expected range of
tariffs of comparable hotels in Kathmandu in 1975. Details are given in
Annex 2.
5.13      The financial return estimated on a discounted cash flow basis
before direct taxes for the first 25 years of operation would lie between
8.8% and 10.6% for the Hotel de l'Annapurna, and 7.4% and 9.6% for the
Yak and Yeti Hotel, depending on the assumptions made on occupancy rates
and opening date. The effect of these assumptions on the rates of return
are shown in Annex 2. Whilst these returns are somewhat modest, they are
not unusual in areas where indirect taxation, construction costs and some
operating costs are relatively high, and where opportunities for conven-
tion business and sales to non-guests are limited. Return on equity
before direct taxes ranges from 10.0% to 15.2% for the Hotel de l'Annapur-
na, and from 7.6% to 11.3% for the Yak and Yeti Hotel, for the same set
of assumptions on occupancy and opening date. If it were assumed that
inflation continued at a compound rate of 3% per year over the life of
the project, the range of returns on equity would be increased from 12.7%

to 18.3% for the Hotel de l'Annapurna, and from 11.C% to 15.6% for the Yak
and Yeti Hotel.

6. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a)  arrangements acceptable to IDA will be made whereby
the NIDJC would act for the Government in making the
IDA credit available to the sponsors under appropri-
ate sub-loan agreements, and in supervising the
hotel projects (paras. 3.24, 3.25);
(b)  arrangements acceptable to IDA will be made for
project managerent during construction and for man-
agement of the hotels during operation (paras. 3.24,
3.15, 3.16);
(c)  evidence satisfactory to IDA will be produced that
the title to all freeholds, and the condition of all
leases are such as to meet the requirements of the
project (para. 3.04);
(d)  sub-loan agreements agreed by IDA will be concluded
with each sponsor by the NIDC acting for the Govern-
ment: each sub-loan will contain requirements that:
(i)  each sponsor will have a commitment, supported
by appropriate guarantees, to provide the nec-
essary equity including any additional funds
required to meet cost overruns (para. 5.07);
(ii) the sponsors' equity will be paid in according
to an agreed schedule: neither sponsor will
pay out any dividends during the period of
implementation until the scheduled equity pay-
ments for the given year have been made (para.
5.07);
(iii) not less than 20% of the net profits of each
sponsor will be added to retained earnings
annually (para. 5.o6);
(iv)  capital expenditures, except for replacement,
in excess of us$ 50,000 equivalent would be
committed only after NIDC approval (para.
5.09);
(v)  each sub-loan will be secured by mortgages on
fixed assets, held by the NIDC on behalf of
the Government (para. 5.o6);



- 21 -
(vi) neither sponsor will assume any additional long-
term debt during the life of the loan without
NIDC approval (para. 5.06);
(vii) dividends in any one year during the life of the
loan in excess of 20% of the par value of the
capital shares will be matched by equivalent pre-
payment of the loan (para. 5.05);
(viii) the sponsors will bear any exchange rate risk on
the foreign exchange component of the sub-loans
(para. 5.06);
(e) prior to signature of the respective sub-loan agreements,
evidence satisfactory to NIDC would be furnished that:
(i) any past loans to each sponsor by their respec-
tive shareholders have been converted into
equity (para. 5.08);
(ii) agreementhas been reached between the
NIDC and the Yak and Yeti Hotel Pvt. Ltd. on
the purchase of land for an access road (para.
3.09);
(f) accounts for each sub-project shall be in accordance
with modern commercial practice, and shall be audited
by a qualified firm of auditors acceptable to IDA
(para. 5.10).
6.02      A condition of effectiveness of the credit will be IDA approval
of the arrangements between the Government and the NIDC regarding the
supervision and administration of the project (para. 3.25).
6.03      A condition of effectiveness of that part of the credit allo-
cated to each sub-project will be the signature of the respective sub-
loan agreement (para. 5.04).
6.o4      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$ 4.2 million equivalent.

NEPAL
APPRAISAL OF THE KATHMANDU TOURISM PROJECT
ECONOM[C JUSTIFICATION
Introduction
1.        Throughout this appraisal each sub-project is considered
separately, and the effect on the operating results of each of any
conceivable failure to implement the other is ignored. This is justi-
fiable where, as in this case, the two hotels appeal to substantially
different markets, and where high occupancies are expected. It is
also assumed that there will be no significant diversion of business
from other hotels, given the acute shortage of accommodation.
2.        The net benefits to the economy will consist primarily of
expenditures of additional guests in the Annapurna and Yak and Yeti
hotels, less the cost of operating the facilities to be provided.
The related investments are the capital costs of the hotels. Addi-
tional investments in infrastructure and other facilities are negligi-
ble.
3.        At full operation, the new accommodation will generate some
34,000 additional tourist arrivals per year, nearly all coming by air.
Consequently, Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation may expect better load
factors, revenue from embarkation taxes will increase, as will that
from landing fees charged to foreign airlines as a result of the addi-
tional flights needed. Since such benefits would be impossible to
quantify with the present state of knowledge on the plans of the air-
lines, they are excluded from tha benefit stream of the project.
Revenue and Cost Assumptions
4.        Each additional visitor can be expected to make some pur-
chases during his stay in Nepal, other than what he pays for bed and
board. Gross per capita tourist expenditure on shopping in India was
US$ 51 in 1968/69, and tourists spent an average of US$ 48 on items
other than food, lodging, local transport and entertainment in Thai-
land in 1969. In the absence of expenditure surveys for Nepal, assump-
tions have been made which are believed to be rather conservative.
Given that expenditure on souvenirs etc. tends to be largely independ-
ent of the length of stay, and that Nepal produces an attractive range
of local handicrafts, an average of US$ 45 gross expenditure per tour-
ist including US$ 2 for a visa is possible and may well be exceeded by
the kind of tourist using better class aceommodation. The cautious
assumption has been made that this expenditure would result in a net



ANNEX 1
Page 2
benefit to Nepal of US$ 10 per tourist, equivalent to US$ 3 per tour-
ist bed-night.
5.        There is expected to be very little use of the room accommo-
dation by Nepalese, at least during the earlier years of the project.
Use of expatriates stationed outside Katbmandu, or while looking for
permanent housing, may be significant, but there is justification for
regarding much of this expenditure as foreign exchange. It is there-
fore assumed that 95% of room sales will represent foreign exchange.
Relatively more food and beverage sales will derive from Nepalese,
either individually or as official entertaining. Entertaining by
foreign embassies, airlines, etc. is treated as foreign exchange. It
is assumed that only 15% of food and beverage sales should be treated
as local currency.
6.        It has been assumed that the average length of stay will be
2.6 nights for the Hotel de l'Annapurna, and 4 nights for the Yak and
Yeti Hotel. Forty-five per cent of the Hotel de l'Annapurnals occupied
doubled rooms are expected to be occupied by 2 persons, as against 55%
in the case of the Yak and Yeti Hotel.
7.        The economic life of each sub-project is assumed to be 25
years. Provision is made for replacements during the lives of the sub-
projects.
Rate of Return
8.        The economic costs and benefits of each sub-project are sum-
marized below.17/ inancial results have been adjusted by eliminating
indirect taxes-  and import duties from costs and adding to the bene-
fits the 5% sales tax which is levied on hotel bills. US$ 10 per tour-
ist has also been added to the benefit stream to allow for the assumed
net benefit arising from expenditure on shopping etc. The costs and
revenues of the Hctel de l'Annapurna are the incremental costs and
revenues due to the project, estimated results for the continued opera-
tion of the existing hotel having been subtracted from the projected
results of the enlarged hotel.
1/ The taxes and duties currently applicable to hotel operations in
Nepal are shown in Table 22.

2/ Including sales tax and net benefit due to shopping etc. expendi-
ture.
9.        The above figures are taken to represent the best estimates.
They give an economic rate of return of 19.9% for the Hotel de l'Anna-
purna, and 20.8% for the Yak and Yeti Hotel, and 20.2% for the two
sub-projects combined. This calculation uses the official foreign
exchange rate, and the market price for unskilled labor. In view of
rates of between 12 and 16 rupees to the dollar being offered in the
gray market, and underemployment of labor, the effect on the rates of
return of shadow pricing was tested.  A shadow price of 14 rupees to
the dollar, as against the official rate of 10.125 rupees, raised the
economic rate of return by 5 and 4 percentage points for -the Hotel de
l'Annapurna and the Yak and Yeti Hotel respectively. Shadow pricing
of semi and unskilled labor at 40% of the wage rates raised the rates
of return by 3 and 2 percentage points respectively.
10.       The economic rates of return are reduced by assuming a lower
average rate of room occupancy than the 75% and 70% assumed in the pro-
jections for the Hotel de l'Annapurna and the Yak and Yeti Hotel respec-
tively. For example, reducing the average occupancy by 5 percentage
points lowers the economic rate of return of the two hotels by 1 per-
centage point each. Similarly, assuming a year's delay in the opening
of the hotels would reduce the returns by 2 percentage points for each.



ANNEX 1
l'age 4
11L.      The extended Hotel de l'Annapurna will employ 465 staff, 239
more than the existing hotel. The Yak and Yeti Hotel will employ 260
more than the 30 working in the existing restaurant. Although employ-
ment figures are scanty in Nepal, it is believed that these jobs are
badly needed. The hotel industry moreover provides opportunities for
advancement to higher levels of responsibility, and provides some basic
skills which are transferable to other service industries. The addi-
tional tourists visiting Nepal as a result of the project will also
stimulate employment in sightseeing and handicraft businesses. To the
extent that the hotels provide a base for trekking expeditions, they
will help to give employment to porters in the more remote and under-
developed regions of the country. No attempt has however been made to
quantify such indirect employment effects, but they may be considerable.
Direct Balance of Payments Impact
12.       The project is expected to increase gross foreign exchange
earnings by about US$ 4.85 million per year when both hotels are fully
operational, including the impact due to the expenditure of the addi-
tional hotel guests on shopping, etc. This compares with estimated
gross tourist receipts of US$ 2.0 million in 1970. The import compo-
nent of hotel operating costs are relatively high, but revenues are
almost entirely foreign exchange. During a typical year, direct net
foreign exchange earnings attributable to the project will be of the
order of US$ 2.45 million plus some US$ 0.34 million due to expendi-
ture on shopping etc. Once repayment of the IDA credit begins, this
favorable effect on the balance of payments will be slightly reduced,
by some US$ 0.1 million a year.

ASSUMPTIONS
FOR
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Operating Results
1.        Tables 10 and 18 present the forecast of operating results
over the first 21 years of the project. The forecasts are based on
Revenue and Cost assumptions described below.
Revenue Assumptions
2.        Total revenues include income from hotel guests and non-
resident guests. Revenue comprises income from rooms, food, beverage,
other operating departments, miscellaneous sales and rentals. Room
income from hotel guests is based on average room tariffs differenti-
ated according to single and double occupancy.

2/ Based on double rooms only, 20% of total capacity single rooms.
3.        Estimates for food and beverage income are based on ratios
prevailing in hotels of these types.

ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        The higher ratio for beverage sales for the Yak and Yeti Hotel
reflects the fact that the bar together with the restaurant will be the
main social gathering point in Kathmandu both for local customers and
foreigners.
5.        Income from other operated departments amounts for the Hotel
de ltAnnapurna to 2.6% of total revenues. Because of the smaller size
and the difference in the clientele this possible source of income has
been disregarded for the Yak and Yeti Hotel. Only in the case of the
Hotel de l'Annapurna rental income amounting to US$ 5,000 for a typical
year was included in total revenue.
Cost Assumptions
6.        Direct material costs for food, beverage and other items have
been calculated as follows:
Cost of Sales
Food       Beverage        Other
Hotel de l'Annapurna         37%           35%          50%
Yak and Yeti Hotel           42%           38%           -
The difference in the percentages between the two hotels reflects the
distinctions in the type of operation and the resulting pricing policy.
7.        Payroll and related expenses are expected in the typical year
of operation to be 20.1% of total revenues for the Hotel de l'Annapurna
and 21.6% for the Yak and Yeti Hotel. These percentages reflect the
relatively low wages of semi- and unskilled workers in Nepal.
8.        Indirect costs estimated as a percentage of total revenue
(22.8 for the Hotel de l'Annapurna and 29.9 for the Yak and Yeti Hotel)
include the following:
Administrative and General Expenses
Advertising and Sales Promotion
Commissions
Heat, Light, Power
Operating Supplies
Replacement of Operating Equipment
Maintenance and Repairs.
In the case of the Yak and Yeti Hotel they include also insurance and
auditing fees.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
9.        Insurance and auditing fees as well as director's fees for
the Hotel de l'Annapurna are shown separately due to the provisions of
the management agreement. They account for 1.6% of total revenue.
10.       Rental payments by the Yak and Yeti Hotel are shown sepa-
rately and are not included in indirect expenses. They amount to 1%
of total revenues.
11.       The management fee of Hilton International Company for the
Hotel de l'Annapurna amounts to 8.7% of total revenues. This is made
up of a basic fee of 5% of total revenue plus an incentive payment of
10% of gross operating profit.
12.       Average depreciation on total assets is about 6.4% per yea:
for the Hotel de 1'Annapurna and 4.9% for the Yak and Yeti.  The differ-
ence reflects the fact that the Hotel de l'Annapurna has an existing
building, and more equipment such as central air conditioning. Build-
ing and site development are depreciated over 33 years, mechanical and
electrical equipment over 15 years, furnishing over 10 years, and car-
pets, curtains, bedding, etc. over five years. Pre-opening expenses
and training are amortized over the first five years of operation.
13.       Commitment charge and interest during construction is capi-
talized for the time of disbursement, i.e. in the case of the Hotel de
1'Annapurna for three years and three months and in that of the Yak
and Yeti Hotel for three years.
14.       A projected Financial Position Statement, a projected Cash
Flow Statement for the two sub-projects based on the forecast operat-
ing results, are shown in Tables 11, 12, 19 and 20.
15.       The effect on the financial rates of return, estimated on
a discounted cash flow basis for the first 25 years of operation, of
differing assumptions about rates of room occupancy and opening date
are given below:

THE NEPAL INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION
1.        The Government-owned Nepal Industrial Development Corpora-
tion (NIDC) was established in 1959, and is the country's only indus-
trial development bank. It is able to make short- and long-term loans,
and participate in equity. It has also some non-banking activities,
such as a Consultancy Services Division, an Industrial Promotion and
Productivity Center, and two Industrial Districts.
2.        The Chairman is the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and
other directors are the Secretary of Finance, the Governor of the
Nepal Rastra Bank, and two prominent private businessmen.
3.        The staff totals over 200, of whom 80 are professionals.  The
general level of competence is good, and some professionals have
received training abroad, including at the Economic Development Insti-
tute.
4.        The resources of the NIDC, as at early 1971, stood at
NRs. 78,500,000 net of repayment, of which NRs. 35,680,000 was equity.
the balance being provided by loans from USAID, Kreditanstalt fuer
Wiederaufbau, ExIm Bank of Japan, the Government of India, and the Gov-
ernment of Nepal.

6.        In the first eleven years of operation, NIDC has approved
154 projects, for which the proposed loans totalled NRs. 140 million.
Of this, however, only NRs. 55 million was disbursed, for 115 projects.
Among these were 13 hotel projects, for which NIDC loans amounted to
NRs. 19 million. NIDC appraisals of hotel projects have shown some
attention to detail, and are in general conscientiously done.
7.        The main problem the NIDC has encountered has been its man-
agement's inability to insist on timely repayment from influential
borrowers. In early 1971, no less than 59 loans were in arrears,
interest and principal due amounting to NRs. 3.9 and NRs. 15.7 million
respectively. Loans in arrears included 4 hotel projects, of which
the Soaltee Hotel accounted for 99% of the amount due. The diffi-
culties of the Soaltee arose partly from the short term over which its
NIDC loan was granted. Since that time, however, the Soaltee has begun
to meet its obligations. The newly appointed General Manager of the
NIDC appears to be able and willing to institute much firmer policies,
and a general tightening up on NIDC's operations. Executive assistance
from the ADB is under discussion.
8.        NIDC's standard terms of long-term finance are an interest
rate of 7-1/2% per annum, paid semi-annually, plus a commitment charge
of 1/4% on the undisbursed balance. The term of each loan is determined
according to the nature of the enterprise concerned. A grace period for
the repayment of principal is granted on the basis of the length of time
required for the project to be in full operation. Loans are normally
secured by a mortgage on up to 75% of total fixed assets, or 80% for a
project in the Industrial Districts.

THE SPONSORS
The Hotel de l'Annapurna Pvt. Ltd.
1.        The company was formed in March 1971, with an authorized
capital of NRs. 20 million of which NRs. 6.4 million is paid up. The
shareholders are H.R.H. 1st Queen Mother Kanti Rajya Laxmi Devi Shah,
2nd Queen Mother Iswari Rajya Lamai Devi Shah, and H.R.H. Princess
Helen Shah.
Present Operations
2.        The existing Hotel de l'Annapurna comprises 90 rooms and
small inadequate public areas. Technical installations as well as
furniture and decorations are not up to the standards of an inter-
national four-star hotel. Lack of proper laundry facilities and
inconvenient kitchen arrangements require great efforts to maintain
hygienic standards.
3.        A high level of demand and limited competition has made it
possible to charge prices which have been out of line with the qual-
ity of the accommodation. The hotel has thus been a profitable
undertaking operating at an average annual room occupancy of 82%.
14.       Apart from a small secured loan from the NIDC amounting to
NRs. 565,904 (US$ 55,892) as of December 31, 1970 and an unsecured
loan from Nepal Rastra Bank of NRs. 17,555 (US$ 1,734) the hotel is
financed by the owners. Owners' equity together with the general
reserve amounts to NRs. 1,568,947 (US$ 155,129).  In addition, the
owners have provided an unsecured loan of NRs. 5,137,363 (US$ 507,394).
Being still exempt from income taxes under the hotel investment incen-
tive arrangements, profit (1970 NRs. 1,181,151 = US$ 116,756) and inter-
est on the unsecured sponsors loan amounted to NRs. 1,644,500
(US$ 162,400) resulting in a return on ownerst investment of 24.5%.
5.        The existing operation should generate from 1971 until 1974
cash to the order of NRs. 7.7 million (US$ 0.76 million) equivalent to
58% of the required cash investment in equity. The remaining US$ 0.55
million equivalent will be provided by the owners.
The Yak and Yeti Hotel Pvt. Ltd.
6.        The company has an authorized capital of NRs. 5 million and
an issued capital of NRs. 1 million. Mr. Radesham Saraf and his family
hold 65% of the shares, Mr. Boris Lissanevitch, the remaining 35%.
The company has no trading activities at present, having been estab-
lished solely to operate the new hotel. Application has been made to
raise the authorized capital to NRs. 12 million.



ANNEX 4

7.        Mr. Saraf is an Indian citizen who has built up substantial
trading and industrial enterprises in Nepal. He is a director of Saraf
Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., which exports commodities of Nepalese origin
such as musk. He is also Managing Director of a weaving mill in Bombay,
and of a Calcutta metal pipe agency.  He is a partner in Messrs. Himdoot
Fabrics of Calcutta, New Delhi, and Bombay, and in Messrs. Saraf Brothers
of Calcutta, a leading exporter of Indian goods.  He owns over 7 acres of
land in central Kathmandu, a multi-story building in Calcutta, a factory
and 20 acres of land in Bombay, a 100-acre tank farm in Calcutta and
residential property. He has so far made investments amounting to some
US$ 880,000 equivalent in Nepal and US$ 2.6 million equivalent in India.
8.        Mr. Lissanevitch is a British citizen who has lived in Nepal
for 20 years.  He has had many years of experience in the hotel and
catering business in Europe, in India, and for 12 years as manager of
the successful Royal Hotel in Kathmandu, which closed when the lease
expired. His restaurant sets a high standard of food, service, and
interior design, and is widely known outside Nepal. Mr. Lissanevitch
has a large circle of friends and contacts throughout the world, a
factor which is thought to be a considerable asset for the marketing of
the new hotel. His three sons are all to be trained in leading hotels
in Europe.

Interest Rates in Nepal
The following quotation from the IMF report on Nepal dated
September 1971 summarizes the latest available information on the
structure of interest rates in Nepal.
"The structure of interest rate was revised by the
Rastra Bank effective April 14, 1971. The most signifi-
cant changes involved increases in commercial bank
deposit rates, changes in their lending rates for cer-
tain important types of loans, and lower lending rates
for agricultural credits and Rastra Bank refinancing
loans to other financial institutions.
i'A few selected deposit interest rates are shown
below:

"The lending rates of the financial institutions in
the agricultural sector were reduced almost uniformll.
For instance, for short-term credits to institutions,
the rate was decreased from 8 per cent to 7 per cent
per annum; for medium-term credits to institutions,
from 7-1/2 per cent to 6 per cent per annum; and for
long-term loans for the same purpose, from 5 per cent
to 3-1/2 per cent per annum. The reductions in inter-
est rates for agricultural loans to individuals were
brought down in approximately the same proportion.
"The Rastra Bank's interest rates for refinancing
of commercial bank loans were reduced from 6 per cent
to a range of 4-1/2 per cent to 5-1/2 per cent per
annum, except for industrial requisites for which the
rate remained unchanged at 6 per cent. Similarly, the
Bank's refinancing rates for financial institutions in
the agricultural sector dropped from a range of 5-5-1/2
per cent to 2-6 per cent per annum; at the same time,
refinancing possibilities were extended to new types of
loans, such as long-term agricultural credits."



ANNEX 5
p'age 3
The Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC) is the
country's only development bank. Its long-term loans carry a stand-
ard interest rate of 7-1/2% per annum, plus 1/4% commitment charge
on the undisbursed balance. Loans are secured by mortgages on fixed
assets.
