MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDfT TO IDIA FOR
THE JHARIA MINE FIRE CONTROL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
1.    I subnIt, for your approval, the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for SDR8.6 million (equivalent to US$12 million) to help fitance a technical
assistance project which would assist Bharat Co'xing Coal Ltd. (BCCL) in the prepartion of a program to
control the mine fires in the haula coalfield anA to deal with the environmetal and social implications of
these fires. The credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 35 years including five years of
grace. The Govenmment of India would onlend the funds to BCCL at an interest rate currently set at 17%
per annum, with a repayment period of 14 years, including a grace period of two years.
Background
2.    IndIs resources of prime coking coal are concentrated in the Jhada coalfield in Bihar. This field
produces about 80% of the coking coal required by the Indian steel indusby. The mining of these coal
reserves Is now threatened by what is probably the world's largest concentration of mine fires. BCCL,
which operates the iharna mines, has identified about 70 major mine fires. Most of these were caused by
spontaneous heating of coal left in abandoned shallow underground mines where access of air was
relatively unrestricted. Efforts to contain these fires have been largely unsuccessful, and consequently, the
area above the fires subsided as the fires progressed; the resulting cracks in the surface provide additional
access of air which, in turn, accelerates the pace at which these fires spread.
3.    The Government and BCCL are not only co:ncemed about the potential loss of coking coal and the
ensuing need for more coking coal imports, but also abou. the damage these fires are inflicting upon the
envlrionmen The fires contribute to the already extensive air poliuot!n in the Jharia coalfield. Ihe collapse
of the surface above the fires leads to extensive damage to houses, infrastu.,re (roads and railways),
farm land and the loss of rivers and ponds. About one milion people live in the Jha.ia coalfield area (276
kirr). If the fire is not contained, more than 100,000 people will have to be resettled over the next 10 yeas
Lessons Leaned frm Previous Bank Operations
4. On May 10, 1985 the Board approved the JhaNla Coking Coal Project which provided financial
assistance for the development of an underground mine (Pootkee Bulliary) and an opencast mine
(Opencast Block II) in the ]haria coalfield The basic objective of this project was to introduce state-of-the-
art underground and opencast mining methods iLn CCL's area of operations. Support for the Pootkee
BulliMay mihe had to be canceled when it was discovered, during the early stages of project implementa-
tion, that the majority of the coal reserves of this mine were not suited for highly mechanized longwall
mining Implementation of the opencast mine is now about four years behind schedule, maindy as a result
of delays in land acquisition, cumbersome prmureent procedures and a rapidly spreading mine fire.
The main obstade has been difficulties in resetting people living in project areas. BCCL as well as nunmr-
ous ancillawy industies provide attractive employment opportunities and reatively high wages. As a
result, prices of agricultural products are relatively high, and fanners are reluctant to sel their land unless
BCCL offers jobs. BCCL, which is highly overstaffed, is reluct&nt to add more people to its payroLl



-2-
5.    Two main lessons emerged from these projecs
a) BCCL needs extensive technical assistance in areas such as the identification of coal reserves, land
acquisition, resettlement and the prevention of mine fires; and
b) support in managing the implementation of projects.
Few relevant lessons have emnerged from other coal proects. However, BCCL's efforts to contain the fires
in the Tharia coalfield have been hampered by imprecise delineation of the boundaries of fires; lack of
equipment; lack of an effective fire fighting organization and perseverance in fire fighting efforts; and the
lack of a clear strategy for dealing with the fires takng into account conuerci as well as environmental
and social concens.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
6.    The Jharia coalfield contains the world's largest concentration of mine fires. Over the past 15 years
BCCL has made numerous attempts - many with the help of bilateral agencies - to extinguish these fires.
The results have been discouraging. BCCL has now tumed to the World Bank Group with a request to
mount a global effort to find solutions to deal with these fires and mitigate their effects on the environ-
ment and the people living in the area.
7.    IDA's involvement in the proposed project would assist BCCL in adopting measures to (a) salvage
valuable coking coal reserves that are Incasingly blocked by fires; (b) prevent further environmental
degradation, damage to towns and infscture facilities; and (c) reduce the need for resetlement and
help manage the resettlement of a large number of people later, if necessary.
Project Objectives
8.    The main objective of the proposed project is to set the stage for investments aimed at extinguish-
ing or containing the spread of the mine fires in the jharia coaled. To achieve this objective, the project
would provide financia support for a detailed survey of the fires and the preparation of a program that
would indicate the most cost-effective approach for dealing with these fires taking into acoDunt econonmc
as weRl as socal and environental concems ('fire fighting program'). To ensure that BCCL receives the
best possible advice, an international conmltant with extensive evqerience in the xtnguishent and
control of coal mine fires wfll be selected. Timely Inplementation of the project will require ectensive
interaction between BCCL staff and the consultant BCCL staff wfll benefit from this interaction. To ensure
that BCCL will be able to cany out this kind of analysis after the work of the consultant has been com-
pleted, agreement wiD be reached with BCCL to set up a 'fire fighting cell' within the company. Initial
traing wil be provided by the consultant Key pieces of equipment for this cell will be provided under
this project.
9.    In view of the considerable adverse effects of these fires on the environment and the people living
in this area, the proposed project would also provide funds for the preparation of a program to that would
identify measues to nitigate the adverse environental and social effects of these fires ('environmental
management plan'); this plan would assist BCCL and the State Governmet in their prepartions for the
resettlement of a growing number of people, including tribals, that are curentdy living in areas endan-
gered by fires



.3-
Poect Descrption
10.   The proposed project would consist of two components:
a) development of a fire fighting progmm for the Jharla coalfield; and
b)  preparation of an envronmtalmanagementplan.
Agreed Actlons
11.   Agreement has been reached with the Govenment and BCCL on the following mapjr actions-
a)  GOI will appoint, no later an June 15, 1993, an advisory panel consisting of resetatives of
the State of Bihar and local NGOs that would advise DMCL in the review of the recommendations
contained In the fire fighting program and the envirotal management plan;
b) BCCL will set up, no later than AprU 15,1993, a state-of-the-art fire fighfting cel within its ofrgai-
zation;
c)  BCCL will appoint, no later than September 1,1993, a panel of experts that would review the
technical feasiblity of the recoummeations contained in the fire fighting program; and
d) BCCL will have Its annual accounts, including the specal account and the statement of expendi-
tures for the project, If any, audited and submit the audit reports to the Bank within nine months
of the end of the fisal year.
Environmental Aspects
12.   Preparation of the fire fighting progm would involve a review of all avilae information about
the mie fies, visits to fire sites, diling of boreholes (for deteminng the exact location of fires), aerial
surveys and report writing. The nain  me l issue concering this project are therefore the
environmental and safety aspecWs of borehole drlling.
13.   The ooreholes would be drilled wifi motorized, portable dring rigs capable of drillin verical
holes with a diameter of 100-300 mm. Only a few square meters of area are usually required at each site. A
major eno       l concer is the risk of spreading the fire through uve diling activity itself. To mini-
mize this risk, ordy expeieed operators would be employed in driling operations, and care will be
taken to seal boreoles
b            14.   To avoid injury to drilling crews appropriate attire wil be provided by BCCL In additon, provi-
sions wi be made to ensure the safW of driling personne from exsr to dangerous levels of cubon
monoxide from surface fires as well as fromdrling into the undergrund mine workin  Levels of
carbon monoxide would be systematicaly monitored at the drilng sites. Safety plans will be nade for an
appropriate response to any unforeseen subsidence involving the ddlling equipment Coal lndia has no
record of any fatal accidents at any of its several hundred drlling sites operated by Its own employees or
by conrtors. However, inor acddents do occur, usually as a result of carelessness
15.   DiDing activities will be resticted to land owned by BCCL In the event that drilling Is reqired
on land not owned by BCCL, there is legal provision in the Land Acquisition Act wbich would allow
BCCL to drill for the purpose of exploring the location of coal resources after a notfying the land owrs.
This would not involve complicated consation disputes, and She risk of any delays in prject uIple-
sentation is minimaL



-4-
Spedal Operational Emphaies
16.   The proposed project would support the Ba's emphasis on mitigating environmnl damage
and social upheaval associated with economic activity.
Project Benefits
17.   The proposed project would provide BCCL with access to state-of-the art experience for fighting
large mine fires. It would provide BCCL with the opportunity to
a)  salvage valuable coldng coal reserves that are blzked by fires;
b) prevent further environmental degradation, in particular damage to towns, infastructure (roads
railways, power transmission and telecommunication lines, etc.) and water supply facilities, as a
result of the spread of mine fires, and
c)  recluce the need for a major resettlement effort.
The precisc outcome of the proposed technical assistance to BCCl:s efforts in dealing with the mine fires
is difficult to predict. At a minimum, it will provide BCCL with a sound strategy for miidmizt the
commercdal, environmental and social cost of these fires Without the proposed project (and no further
follow-up in the implementation of its recommendations), Indias imports of coking coal would increase
by US$180 million each year; in iddition the annual costs of resettlement would be around US$35 million.
These estimates do not take into account the damages to the environment, the loss of reserves and the
increase in the cost of mining coal as a result of the fires.
Risks
18.   The project faces three riks: (a) a delay in the implementation of the project; (b) the possibility
that economically justifiable actions could be identified for only a small number of the fires; and (c) a lack
of commitment on the part of BCCL to implement the fire fighting measu  recommended by the consult-
ant.
19.   To minimize the risk of a delay in project implementation, the search for qualified consultants has
been initiated; the respective responsibilities of the international cnsultant and BCCL's staff for the
implementation of the project have been worked out
20.   Coal mine fires are difficlt and costly to extingsh. Excavation of the fire is in most cases the
only way to prevent re-ignition of the coal. Blanketing of underground fires tends to slow only their
further progress. In the case of large fires, the best option is to mine as much of the coal as possible and
allow the fire to bum itself out Excavation, blanketing and other, technically more sophisticated measures
will most likely be justified, on economic and environmental grunds, only for part of the fires. The fire
fighting program nevertheless will provide BCCL with a strategy for dealing with the fires in ways that
are cost-effective and environmentally sound.
21.   Delays in the implementation of the recommended fire fighting measures would greatly enhance
the risk of fires 'growing together' and thus making the effort to edinguish them more difficult and costly.
Eventually this would lead to the complete loss of India's ordy reserves of prime coldng coal and require
massive resettlement of people. It would be unlikly that the Govenment would permit such an economic
and environmental disaster to happen.

Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

The Mine Fires In the harla Coalfield
23. The Jharia coalfield is a sickle shaped coal basin loated In the State of Bihar in the northeastern
part of India. The field was discovered In the late nine.eenth century. It covers an area of 276 kmt and has
a population of about one million. About 11% of the population (110,000) are scheduled ¢astes and 8%
(8000) are scheduled tribes.
24.   Jharia coalfield contins India's only reserv  of prime coking coal. In addition, t contains also

An additional five billion tons of coal have been Identified in strata between 600 and 1200 metr The
configuration of coal reserves makes the Jhada coafeld a highly attractive area for mining. I has one of
the highest concentrations of thick coal seams in the world. Coal seams range fom 50 cm to over 30 m in
thickness. On average they are 3-4 m thid.
25. Until nationalization of the coal Industry in 1971, coal infing was almost excusively in private
hands. Mining took place in more than 850 separate mining leaseholds. Sine most of thse leaseholds
were small and irregular in shape, it was virtusly inpossible for many of these miOn to adhere to sound
mining practices, which Is one of the causes for the large number of mine fires in this coalfield. Af4r
nationalization, 8CCL quicldy combined these mines into 90 collieries.
Causes of the Mine Fires
26. The first report of a mintefire in the Jharia coalfeled dates back to 1916. The fire is still buning. In
subsequent years, more than 75 fires have started. Ordy five fires have been extnguished. At present
BCCL estimates that there are as many as 70 fires in the coalfelld. Overall, there are several hundred fire
sites, ranging in size from  1 to 2 km2 and covering an area of 18 km!.
27.    Mine fires are part of coal mning throughout the world. Almost all oalfields in the world face
underground mine fires at one time or another. Most of these fires are caused by spontaneous combustion
of coal left in mines for technical or commerl reasons. The Tharla coalfield is no ewepfti  However,
several feaures have made the mine fires in Jharla nquew concentration of several thk seas in cose
proximity, high propensity of coal to spontaneous combustion, easy access to the outcrop region from the
surface, and lack of an impervious alluvial soil cover.

The enormous heat created by coal mine fires is absorbed by the
surrounding rock strata. Unless a method isfound to dissipate that        
keat it will continue to ignite any coal with which it comes into                            nolam
contact. The process will continue until there is no more coal left or
the access of air is completely blocked. As fires progress, coal seams
collapse and the overlying strata break, developing cracks reaching
to the surface above. Additional access of air through the cracks
accelerates the progress of the fires below. 7he illustration above
shows a cross-section of a typical coal mine fire. Compared to a
burning oil well (see illustration at right), coal mine fires are
considerably more difficult and costly to extinguish. An oilfire can
be 'snuffed-out' through a powerful explosion, whicht deprives the
fire of oxygen for a short but sufficient time, thereby extinguishing
it.



-9-
28.    How mine fires start Parts of coal undergo chemical changes when exposed to oxygen. This
chenical process, which is generally referred to as "auto-oxidation' generates heat If the coal surface is
well ventilated, heat dissipates. In a restrcted environment, iuch as the one found in abandoned sections
of underground mines, the "auto(-xidation" process can raise the heat to a level where coal breaks into
active fire. This threshold temperature can be as low as 50-60C. If there are, in addition, small quantities
of sulfur in the coal, they would acceerte the auto-oxidation process. All abandoned or subsided mines
in the jharia coalfleld have an abundant supply of the components which are conducive to creating mine
fires.
29.    Subsidence accelerates the spread of fires. By far the most common underground mining
method in the Jharia coalfield is by 'bord and pillar. Using this method, miners develop a mine by
constructing roadways along coal seams leaving sizable pillars to support overlaying strata of coal and
rock. After an area is fully developed, the coal contained in the pillars is then gradually extracted. Stowing
of sand as well as other means are used to prevent a collapse of the 'roof'. In spite of these measures
roadways frequently collapse, resulting in subsidence of the surface area above.
30.    Cracks in the strata allow air to penetrate into the coal bearing areas. Exposure of the coal to air
starts a process of oxygenation, which eventually generates sufficient heat to set the coal on fire. As the
fire proceeds, further subsidence occurs, existing cracks widen and additional cracks develop in the
surface, making it easier for air to penetrate. Subsidence and cracks in the surface pose therefore not only a
threat to the people living in these areas, they tend to accelerate the expansion of fires.
31.   The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of plasticity in the subsoil and surface materials
Some degree of plasticity would tend to make cracks self-sealing and thus prevent the access of oxygen to
the fires. However, the heat generated by the fires tends to dry out the topsoil and remove whatever
plasticity was present in the soil. Wind and rain ensure that little, ff any, top soil is left in fire areas. To
replenish the top soil and seal the cracks, It has been proposed to pump silt containing plastic clay from a
nearby reservoir to the coalfield. From there it would be spread over fire areas to sead the surface. The
The)hariacoalfieldhas been tradionally the main source ofcoking coalforIndia's steel industby. During
thel980s BCCL'ssharedroppedfrom4lto28%.Bytheendofthis decade itwillspply only 14% of India's
projected demand. The shorfall has to be made up through an imcase in import.



-10-
proposal has technical merit. However, existing difficulties in acquiring land in such a densely populated
area would make it virhually impossible to implement.
32.   Heat accumulates In the strata around the fire. Fires spread continually laterally and vertically.
In order for a fie to spread, it is not necessay for any mine working to come in direct contact with a fire
area. Much of the heat generated by these fires is absorbed by the strata surrounding the fire. A fire can
raise the temperature of these strata to as high as 50DO C. The heat is sufficdent to set coal seams on fire that
are quite a distance away.
33.    The heat retained in the strata dissipates only slowly. It is estimated that It takes between 20 to 80
years for the heated strata to reach again anibient temperature, after a mine fire has been extinguished. On
occasion fires that have been thought to be extinguished have flared up again as a result of the heat
retained in the surrounding strata. In addition, the heat stored by the strata creates major difficulties in
opencast mining where blasting is necessary to break up the overlying rock. The heat contained by the
rock is such that drilled blast holes have to be cooled by pumping water through them continuously for
three or more days before explosives can be loaded into them without the risk of spontaneous detonation.
Impact of the Fires
34.    The presence of so many fires has a considerable impact on mining activities and the livelihood of
the people living in the area. These fires
*   affect the living conditions of about 150,000 people that live in the vicinity of fire areas. In most
cases, their dwellings, shops, service establishments, places of worship, community centers, etc.
have been undermined by the fire and could collapse at any time; they are constanty breathing
noxious coal burning fumes and dust;
* affect more than 30,000 houses. Compensation and rehabilitation of these families is expected to
cost in excess of Rs 9.6 bilion (US$350 million). If no action is taken, the number of people and
dwelings endangered by the fires wil rise by the year 2005 to 174,000 and 32,000 respectively.
The rehabilitation cost will rise to Rs 105 billion (US$370 miDion). The entire Kiirkend township
(population 20,000) and south and south-eastern parts of Iharia town (population of 100,000) wil
eventually be engulfed by mine fires;
*   affect 70 km of railway line, 75 km of national highways and colliery roads, 17 km of high voltage
transion lines, 39 km of sand supply ropeway and 70 km of water supply pipe lines. The
replacement of these infrastructure facilities is estimated to cost about Rs 2 billion (about US$67
nmillion);
*   will reduce BCCs coal production, mostly coldng coal, by abc-it 2.6 milion tons per year. The
economic value of this production loss would be Rs 4.0 blllion per year, raising the cost of coking
co.a -niports by US$180 million. Another Rs 600 million will be the annual loss of steam coal;
o   consume annualy about nine million tons of coal At present, about 375 nmllon tons of coal are on
fire. These fires severely hinder mining operations. The Director General Mine Safety does not
allow any mining undemeath or within a certan distance from the perimeter of a known fie area.
As a result, mine fires currently block more than 1.8 billion tons of coal;
e   result in gaseous enmssions equivalent to themal power generaton from plants with a total
capacity of 4,500 MW;
o contribute to pollution in the Jharia coalfield by adding dust, sulphur, particulate matter and

gaseous pollutants to an already highly polluted environment. A study of air pollution in a
representative village indicated that the population in the fire area has substantially lower pulmo-
nary functions than the population in the coalfield outside the fire area; and
e distuib the sub-soil water regime by starving surface vegetation of water at the roots. This is the
main reason for the decline of agricultural activities. While the mine fires cover only a relatively
small area, their ecological impact extends over a much wider area.
35.   In view of the massive environmental damage that has been caused by the fires, and possible
future damage that is likely to occur, if the fires are left unchecked, the project provides consultant sup-
port for the preparation of an environmental management plan for Jharia coalfield.

The illustration above shows that most of the mine fires in the Iharia coalfield have progressed to several
seams. As a result a tremendous amount of heat is accumulated in the strata surrounding these seams making
the task of extinguishing the fires more difficulIt and costly.

Fire Control
36.    Ways to extinguish or control mine fires. At present, the only known way to extinguish an
underground mine fire with a high degree of certainty is to excavate it, remove the unburned coal and any
other combustible materials, quench any burning or overheated materials and then restore the excavated
area to an appropriate contour. This approach is costly. In the iharia coahffeld this would involve consider-
able land acquisition and resettlement.
37.   Apart from excavatng a fire, the most frequently used strategy is to check its further expansion
through blanketing of the surface with sand and shallow pools. In addition, fire breaks in the form of
trenches or even concrete walls are frequently used to protect small towns or important installations
(roads, railroads, other infrastructure facilities). While theses methods do not by themselves extinguish a
fire, they have the advantage that they are less expensive than excavation. Since the fire continues to burn,
albeit at a significantly slower rate, coal companies gain sufficient time to mine reserves that would
otherwise be lost; in addition, they have the time to anrange for the relocation of people or reconstruction
of important infrastructure facilities.
38.    Although BCCL Is faniliar with these techniques, their efforts to extinguish or control fires have
been largdy unsuccessful. Only five relatively minor fires have been extinguished. BCCL has tred to
Inundate fire areas where this could be done without endangering ongoing operations or 'sterilig
workable coal. They have attempted to starve fires of oxygen by blanketing cracked and subsided areas
with soil and sand to block the access of air. Other methods have been attempted, including flushing fire
areas with nitrogen to cool the strata, grouting areas (to prevent the access of air) with cement, bentonite
and fly-ash slurries and excavating trenches through shallow-depth fire areas to form fire-breaks.
39.   Several consWaints have hampered BCCL!s efforts:
* lack of sufficient data for accurate delineation of fire boundaries;
o   lack of equipment;
e lack of perseverance with fire fighting efforts and a lack of an overall effective fire fighting organi-
zation; and
* difficulties in acquiring land and the resettlement of people.
In designing the recommendations of the firefighting prgram, these constraints will be taken into ac-
count.
40.    The effectiveness of efforts to extinguish or control mine fires depends critically on knowledge
about the precise location of a fire. Unlike a surface fire or an oil well fire which occur at the surface and
where the sources feeding the fire are known, there are no indications of the exact location of an under-
ground mine fire. A surface fire can be approached from all directions and doused with water etc. to
starve it of oxygen In the case of an underground fire there is no direct access to the location of the fire. It
is impossible to simultaneously shut out all the air intakes and exhausts. The surface over the fie area is
so hot that no equipment can be taken to seal the cracks at the center of a fire area. Effective blanketing of
the surface area or the construction of trenches requires a careful evaluation of the location and growth of
the fire.

The approach proposed under this project
41.    A two-phased approach is proposed to combat these mine fires. In the first phase (the proposed
Technical Assistance project) an expatriate consultant with proven experience in combating coal mine fires
would provide a systematic ('fire by fire') assessment of the least-cost options for the extinguishment or
control of the minefires in the Jharia coalfield. To arrive at the least-cost strategy for tackling a fire, the
consultant would take into account economic (loss of coal, infrastructure facilities, dwellings, etc.), envi-
ronmental (reducing air pollution, loss of access to water by the people living in the area) as well as social
benefits (reducing the need for resettlement). BCCL would guide the consultant in the sequencing of the
assessments of the fires.
42.    Many of the fires originated in old, abandoned mines which are poorly documented. Thus, prior
to the design of any scheme for fire control it will be necessary to carry out a survey of the Tharia coalfield
by drilling, aerial photography, thermal imaging, etc. since it will be essential to know, with a reasonable
degree of accuracy and before deciding upon a method, the nature, extent and rate of progression of a fire.
The survey would have to take into account the problems arising from land acquisition and resettlement
which will have a sometimes - decisive impact on the implementation of control methods and their
practicality in the Jharia coalfield context. To facilitate the work of the consultant, funds will be provided
for some identification drilling and survey work.
Detailed project description
43.    The proposed project would consist of two components, the development of a fire fighting
program for the Jharia coalfield; and the preparation of an environmental management plan.
44.    Fire fighting program. Progress of coal mine fires varies widely from fire to fire, and is therefore
difficult to predict; it depends on a number of factors such as geological conditions and the layout of
existing mine workings, which are often not well documented. Preparation of the fire fighting program
wil concentrate first on fires whose further progress is likely to cause the largest potential loss of coal and
poses the greatest threat to people, the environment and infrastructure facilities. As a first step, a broad
assessnent of aU the fires in the Jharia coalfield wiUl be carried out. This assement would include an
estimate of the extent of the fire, the number of burning seams, the quantity of coking coal or thermal coal
blocked by the fire as well as the impact of the fire on the environment and the people living in the
surrounding area, would permit the consultant to prioritize the more detailed investigation into each of
the mine fires.
45.    The in-depth analysis of each fire (or group of related fires) would be based on infornation that is
available with BCCL as well as additional surveys, as needed, to permit the consultant to recommend a
cost-effective approach for the extinguishment or control of the fire(s). The recommended approach would
be based on a detailed engineering plan for the recommended approach, an estimate of its cost and the
expectd benefits in terms of the value of the coal salvaged, the damage to the environment and Infra-
structure facilities as well as the resettlement of people that would be prevented by implementing the
recommended approach. The in-depth analysis would involve
* identification of all existing fire barriers, mine sump elevations by seam, faults, dikes, sills, barrier
pillars, existing trenches, opencast areas, solid coal, outcrops, etc.
*   evaluating the rate and direction of propagation for each fire (in five year increments);
e   identification of the extent to which inhabited areas and infrastructure facilities would be threat-
ened by the progression of fires;



- 17-
The in-depth analysis of each fire would be carried out in close cooperation with BCCL and the Central
Mine Planning and Design Institute, a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd.
46.   To the extent that people would be affected by implementing the recommendations of the consult-
ant, their representatives would be consulted before the recommendations are finalzed. In addition,
BCCL would convene a panel of experts which would review the technical suitability of tlhe approach,
rationale and engineering for the extinguishment or control of each fire. As soon as the work for a specific
mine fire is completed, BCCL would prepare a 'fire control project report which would allow the con-
pany to seek financing for the implementation of the recommended measures ('second phase'). In sum,
the consultant would, inter alia,
o   establish a coalfteld-wide baseline with both horizontal. -id vertical control;
• identify and locate all the fires on a topographic base map of the area;
* carry out a thermal infrared survey (TIR) of the Tharia coalfield;
o   clearly identify all the seams that are on fire in each fire area;
o present alternative options for dealing with each fire (including drawings on mine plans, imple-
mentation rationale, estimates of the various mateials that may be required, etc.)
o   evaluate the costs and benefits of the alteratives that seem to be most suitable for extinguishing
or controlling a fire;
o   assist BCCL in the preparation of the 'fire control project reporW; and
o provide staff training to enable BCCL to set up an effective 'fire fighting cell'. This cell should be
able to continue the work of the consultant, after the completion of the assgnment under this
project, with mindmal extemal assistance.
o   assist BCCL in designing a fire prevention program.
47.   The second phase. Surface and underground mine flres are a dynamic phenomenon and the
continuous growth of fires can quickly invalidate the recommendations for fighting a specific fire. It is
therefore critical that the proposed recommendations are implemented as soon as a sufficiently large
number of fire project reports have been completed. The Association will assist BCCL in finding low-cost
finance for these investments.
48.   Environmental management plan. Haphazard coal mining and the growing number of nmne fies
have caused extensive damage to the environment in the Thara coalfield area. In addition to supporting
BCCL in its efforts to extinguish or contain the mine fires, the project would also assist BCCL and the State
Govenment in mitigating the adverse effects of mirdning operations and the fires on the environment and
the people living in the harlia area. In preparing an environmental management plan a team of consult-
ants with expertise in the environmental effects of coal mining would
o   carry out a baseine survey covering the ]haria coalfield and an area extending about 15 kitome-
ters from the boundaries of the coalfield proper;
*   assess the magitude of the environmental and social impact of coal mining and the fires as a
result of past activities and the expected expansion of mining activities as well as the fires;
o   systematically evaluate alternative optons for mitigating these impacts, in pariular the need for
large-scale resettlement of people;



-18-
o   involve representatives of the local population in the evaluation process;
•   based on these analyses prepare a least-cost environmental management plan; and
train the staff of BCCL's fire fighting cell in the analysis of environmental and social issues related
to coal mining and the choice of mitigating measures.
Project Administration and Implementation
49.   Both components are intertwined. The evaluation of the likely environmental and socal impact of
the mine fires in the future will require close interaction of both consultant teams. aCCL! fire fighting cell
would be responsible for coordinating the work of the two consultant teams and ensuri   the timely flow
of information between them. The interaction of the staff of the fire fighting cell with te two consultlng
teams would, in turn, provide a unique opportunity for trning of BCCL staff. As a first step, BCCL has
agred to establish a fie fighting cell within its organization not later than April 15.1993. that is within a
month after the expected date of effectiveness of the proposed credit The fire fighting cell will therefore
have been established when the consultant teams start their preparatory work.
50.   The work for both components will be carried out by experienced international consultant teams
jointly with BCCL The preparation of the fire fighting program would be supported by an Intemational
consultant with extensive experience in the fighting of coal mine fires. In light of the large number of
tnbals living in the area, the preparation of the environmental management plan would be prepred by a
team of consultants that have, initer , considerable experience in thibal issues.
51.   BCCL would provide support staff as well as office and housing faclities in Dhanbad for the two
consultant teams. BCCL would also be responsible for transport of the consltant teams in the iharia
coalfield area. BCCL would arange meedngs with State and local authorities as well as representatives of
the local population and non-govemmental organizations to consult with them on the measures recom-
mended by the consultant teams. The chairman of BCCL would also convene reviews of the recommenda-
ions regarding the extinguishment of fires by the expert panel.
52.   Procurement. The consultants would be selected in line with the Banes Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants. Small items and services (not exceeding a contract value of US$200,000) will be procured
under local competitive bidding; local shopping could be used for the procuremnt of items or services
whose contract value does not exceed US$50,000. Since there are only few companies that speialize in the
surveys needed to identify the boundaries of coal mine fires, 'surveying services' will be procured under
Linited Interational Bidding. All other items would be procured under ICB, with the exception of local
support services as shown in Schedule B.
53.   Project cost. The preparation of the fire fighting program is estimated to require about 145 staff
months, that of the environmental management plan 115 staff months The work of both teams is esti-
mated take two years to complete. The terms of refererce of the consultants for both project components
would be reviewed by the Association; they would clearly spefy the need to involve and consult with
the local population, in particular tnbals, in the design of the recommendations whose Implementation
affects the people living there.
54.   The project cost for the Jharia Mine Fire Control component is esdmated at US$10.2 milion
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$5.2 million equivalent (51%). Estimated project cost
are expressed in mid-1992 prices. These estimates are based on similar work canied out in other countries.



-19-
Physical contingencies of 10% of base costs have been included. Local price contingencies have been
estimated at 8.5% in 1993,7.5% in 1994 and 6.5% in 1995. Foreign price contingencies have been esfimated
at 3.7% of the respective base costs plus physical contingencies for 1993,1994 and 1995. Taxes and customs
duties on imported goods and services have been estimated on the basis of average rates provided by
BCCL. Total project cost is estimated at US$143 million equivalent, w'ith a foreign exchange component of
US$82 million equivalent (57.3%) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$04 million equivalent. The
total financing required is US$143 million, of which IDA would finanoe SDR8.6 million (equivalent to
US$12 million) that is 84% of the total. The proposed project would be completed within two and one half
years. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedule C and D,
respectively.
55.   Disbursements. Disbursement of the proposed credit is based on the assumption that it will
become effective by the beginning of the third quarter of FY93. It is expected that the credit will be con-
pletely disbursed by June 30, 1995. To facilitate disbursements a Spedal Account would be established
with an authorized allocation of US$500,000, which is equivalent to about four months of average dis-
bursements. Disbursements for services and equipment valued at less than US$200,000 would be on the
basis of Statents of Expenditure (SOE). Documentation of SOE would be retained by BCCL and made
available for review by Bank supervision missions. All other disbursements would be made against full
documentation. The credit will be disbursed against the categories outlined in Schedule B.
56.   Auditg. Agreement has been reached with BCCL during negotiations to have its annual ac-
counts. including the special aOunt and the statement of expenditurs for the prject. if any. audited and
submit the audit repots to the Bank within nine months of the end of the fiscal year.
57.   Schedule E provides a summary of the key project activities.
