REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
OF THE BANK AND TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
CORPORATION ON A PROPOSED LOAN BY THE BANK TO
SOCIETE FINANCIERE SENEGALAISE
POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT INDUSTRIEL ET TOURISTIQUE
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE
REPUBLIC OF SENEGAL
AND AN INVESTMENT BY THE CORPORATION IN THIS
DEVELOPMENT FINANCE COMPANY
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Societe Financiere Senegalaise pour le Developpement Industriel et
Touristique (SOFISEDIT) with the guarantee of the Republic of Senegal for the
equivalent of US$3.0 million and an IFC investment of up to US$200,000 in the
share capital of this new company. Amortization of the proposed Bank loan
would conform substantially to the aggregate of the amortization schedules
applicable to the specific investment projects financed out of the proceeds
of the loan. Interest on the loan would be 7-1/4 percent per annum; a com-
mitment charge of three-quarters of one percent per annum on the amount of
each sub-loan outstanding would accrue as from the various dates of approval
of sub-loans by the Bank. SOFISEDIT would relend the proceeds of the loan
for up to 20 years for tourism projects and up to 15 years for other projects.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2..       A report entitled "The Economy of Senegal" (212-SE) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on September 10, 1973. Country data appear as
Annex I.
Economic Potential
3.        Endowed with few natural resources, Senegal has only limited possi-
bilities for economic development. Agricultural conditions are generally
poor, particularly in the groundnut basin where the bulk of the population
lives. The south and southeast offer better prospects for development of a
variety of agricultural products, but groundnuts still account for the cash
income of most of the rural population and for nearly half the country's
export earnings.
4.        Apart from agriculture, the main possibilities for economic develop-
ment are fisheries, tourism and manufacturing. Thanks to rich resources off
the coast, fish production has been growing rapidly. International tourism
to Senegal has started to develop only in recent years, but prospects for



further expansion of this sector are promising. Senegal developed its industry
earlier than other West African countries and its industrial labor force is
one of the best in Africa. However, although there are certain definite pos-
sibilities for development of new crops and new sectors, diversification will
take a long time. The economy will continue to be affected by the. vagaries
of the weather and by fluctuations in the world market price of groundnuts.
Past Development
5.        Although during most of the 1960's, Senegal's economy remained
stagnant, with minimal growth of GJ)P in real terms (1 percent a year), a
number of factors combined to bring about faster growth since 1968, par-
ticularly in the modern sector. This was mainly the result of a marked
increase in exports of manufactured products averaging 14 percent a year,
which reflected Senegal's improving competitive position. In addition,
the Government's agricultural diversification effort started to yield
benefits in rice, cotton, and vegetable production.
6.        Senegal's public finances deteriorated throughout most of the 1960's.
By 1968/69, public savings had declined slowly but continuously to virtually
zero. Thereafter, a recovery of public savings was made possible because of
better tax collection, increased tax rates, and substantial surpluses of the
groundnut stabilization fund following the rise in groundnut export prices.
In 1970/71, public savings represented 7 percent of current revenues. Yet
locally-financed public investment continuec to exceed savings by a wide
margin, as it had throughout the 1960's, and this resulted in a steady decline
in Treasury deposits.
7.        Senegal has benefited from a large inflow of foreign aid, mostly on
concessionary terms. Between 1966 and 1970, foreign aid financed about 65
percent of public investment and averaged US$30 million per year. This cor-
responds to US$8.8 per capita annually, mainly financed by the European Econo-
mic Community (40 percent) and France (30 percent). The World Bank Group and
Germany contributed, respectively, 13 and 10 percent of the total. Foreign
aid concentrated on infrastructure and on directly productive projects in the
rural sector. Also important was technical assistance, mainly in education,
which amounted to US$29 million annually, mostly financed by the French
Government. In 1972, the Bank Group held 17 percent of Senegal's outstand-
ing and disbursed foreign debt, accounting for 4 percent of foreign debt
service.
Recent Performance and Prospects
8.        A severe drought in 1972 seriously affected groundnut production
and decimated livestock herds. However GDP fell only slightly, as the modern
sector achieved a growth rate of six percent in that year. Nevertheless the
drought caused a sharp decline in the standard of living of much of Senegal's
rural population, necessitating a large-scale emergency food program and a
number of drought relief projects. Although rainfall was somewhat better in
1973, the effects of the drought persisted.



-3 -
9.        Ongoing efforts to diversify agriculture and to expand fisheries,
tourism and industrial exports should enable the economy to grow faster in
the coming years than in the previous decade. However the drought on the
one hand, and the accelerating world inflation on the other, have profoundly
affected Senegal's balance of payments and public finances. To some extent,
increases in the cost of petroleum and other imports will be compensated by
expected increases in the price of groundnuts, phosphates and other exports.
By 1980, however, the annual trade deficit will reach US$220 million (37
percent of exports), or about US$64 million more than was estimated in early
1973. This would lead to a current account deficit in the balance of pay-
ments of US$168 million (21 percent of exports of goods and non-factor
services) as compared to US$122 million estimated a year ago. Net factor
payments abroad will continue to increase with the growth of foreign invest-
ment and the increase in foreign capital requirements.
10.       The increased need for external resources is aggravated by a dif-
ficult public finance situation in the past decade. Current revenues kept
pace with the increase in GDP but current expenditures grew faster than
current revenues. This pattern worsened sharply in 1972-1973 as a result
of the drought, increases in civil service salaries, subsidization of food
imports and increased external borrowing. Even if strong measures are taken
to increase Government revenues, control expenditures and keep food subsidies
to a minimum, public finances will remain tight for the rest of the decade.
11.       Considering the need to diversify the economy, it appears essential
that public investment for the Fourth Plan (1973-77) be increased by at least
30 percent in real terms as compared to the Third Plan (1969-73). While such
a program is in line with the improved capacity to prepare and implement
projects, its financing raises difficult problems. To offset the shortfall
in local resources, and the sharply increased investment costs due to infla-
tion, a substantially higher level of foreign assistance will be required.
Foreign aid is expected to continue to expand rapidly, based on the programs
of the European Community, bilateral donors (France, USAID, Germany, Canada
and oil producing countries) and the World Bank Group.
12.       The terms of external aid to Senegal have been progressively harden-
ing over the years. The proportion of grant aid declined from 85 percent in
1964-66 to 55 percent in 1969-71. If Senegal is to finance the required pub-
lic investment program, a further hardening of the blend may be unavoidable.
From the balance of payments point of view, there is perhaps some scope for
increased borrowing on harder terms and even if Senegal's export earnings
are subject to serious fluctuations, some further hardening of the blend would
probably be manageable. The main constraint, however, on an increase in
borrowing on conventional terms is the public finance situation and more
particularly the difficulties which the Government will have in increasing
savings. Foreign lenders, therefore, should continue to provide a large
proportion of their financing on concessionary terms. Moreover, in order
to avoid delays in project implementation due to lack of local funds, it is
highly desirable that foreign lenders finance an average 85-90 percent of
total project cost, including a substantial portion of local currency
expenditures in the next few years.

PART II:  BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SENEGAL
13.       The Bank Group has had 18 operations in Senegal to date.    Total
lending <mounts to US$81 million (net of cancellations), including eleven IDA
credits, four Bank loans, one blend of Bank and IDA funds and two IFC opera-
tions. The Bank Group is now Senegal's third largest aid donor (after France
and the European Economic Community) providing about 13 percent of Senegal's
external capital assistance. IFC net commitments in Senegal total US$2.22
million in two projects. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1974 and notes on the execu-
tion of on-going projects.
14.       Bank Group operations in Senegal began in 1966 and for the first
five years were limited to the transport and groundnut sectors, with projects
for the railway (Credit 96-SE), the port (Loan 493-SE), highways (Credit
198-SE), an agricultural credit project for small holders in the groundnut
basin (Credit 140-SE) and an IFC loan and equity investment for the establish-
ment of a fertilizer plant near Dakar (114-SE). In the following three years,
Bank Group financing expanded and diversified. In addition to follow-up
operations for railways (Credit 314-SE and Loan 835-SE), highways (Credit
366-SE) and groundnuts (Credit 404-SE), there were several small holder pro-
jects aimed at developing new crops and opening up new agricultural regions
- Casamance Rice Project in the South (Credit 252-SE), Terres Neuves Project
in the East (Credit 254-SE) and the River Polders Project in the North (Credit
350-SE), as well as a promotional investment by IFC to develop near Dakar large
scale irrigated vegetable production for exports (210-SE and 265-SE) and a
project by IBRD to relieve the effects of the drought (Credit 446-SE). Other
Bank Group activities comprised an Airport Project (Loan 867-SE) to facilitate
tourism development, a Credit for technical and agricultural education (Credit
253-SE), a Telecommunications Project (Loan 866-SE), an engineering loan for
a ship repair project, and the Bank Group's first Site and Services Project
(Credit 336-SE).
15.       Execution of these projects, apart from the Railway Project and the
Site and Services Project, is moving forward without exceptional delays. The
Railway is in serious financial difficulties due to the failure of revenues
to increase as projected, low utilization of locomotives and rolling stock,
poor staff performance, and frequent changes at the post of General Manager.
These factors have in turn affected the implementation of the track renewal
program, which is now one year behind schedule. However the first shipment
of rails has been delivered and technical assistance financed under the Project
is helping the Railway's management to reverse the deteriorating trend. The
Site and Services Project is about one year behind schedule. The main causes
for the delay were the unexpected need to pass a law, rather than a decree, to
reorganize the executing agency (OHLM), the.delay in recruitment of technical
assistance and the difficulty experienced by OHLM in getting prompt cooperation
from other ministries and government agencies involved in project execution.
A recent request by the Government to modify the site plan for the project
may cause further delay. Tendering for the first tranche of 100 hectares



-5-
has now been completed and land occupation is scheduled to take plice by
mid-1975. Some of the agricultural projects, such as the Terres Ni!uves
Project and the Casamance Rice Project, were hampered by delays in receiving
the Government's counterpart contribution; however, owing to efforts of the
project authorities, physical implementation of these projects is proceeding
generally according to schedule.
16.       Future Bank lending is expected to take three main directions.    First,
we plan to continue lending for transport and education. A second education
project would aim at upgrading secondary education as well as assisting voca-
tional training for tourism, industry and fisheries. It will also include an
experimental program for informal rural training. Secondly, it is proposed
to follow up on a number of small-holder agriculture projects. One of these
(the Sine Saloum Project) will assist farmers in the southern groundnut basin.
Others such as the proposed second Casamance Rice Project and the proposed
second Terres Neuves Project will continue support for the experimental pro-
grams to open up new areas of the country with new crops, following the pro-
mising results of the initial projects. Finally, we are continuing to explore
other avenues for diversification such as the tourism and industry sectors.
In addition to the present SOFISEDIT project, lending may include assistance
to SONEPI for small scale industry, a tourism infrastructure project on the
Petite Cote and a ship repair project, based on the studies financed under
Loan S-3SE.
PART III: INDUSTRY, TOURISMI ANID BANKING IN SENEGAL
Industry
17.       Economic growth in Senegal has been largely attributable to the role
of the industrial sector, which had an annual rate of growth of 6-7 percent.
Although not outstanding by international standards, growth in the sector
represents an achievement for the Senegalese economy. In 1972, the sector
accounted for about 15 percent of GDP, as compared to 8 percent in 1960.
Industry employed about 20,000 persons, or 14 percent of the country's labor
force. Manufacturing accounts for about three quarters of value added by
the industrial sector, whiie public utilities and mining represent 16 and
7 percent of the total respectively. Growth in the manufacturing sector is
largely due to the textile/leather and mechanical/electrical subsectors.
Whereas industrial production was mainly oriented to import substitution in
the first part of the 1960's, growth of exports largely contributed to the
increase in industrial output in the latter part of the 1960's.     These new
markets were found for the most part within former French West Africa, al-
though some firms (textiles) have proved to be competitive in the markets
of developed countries. Gross investment in the manufacturing sector, ex-
cluding a large sugar complex, is estimated to have amounted to about CFAF 4
billion (US$16 million) per annum in 1969/71 against an average CFAF 2.5 bil-
lion (US$10 million) in 1964/66.



18.       Recent industrial growth is due to the combination of a number of
favorable factors: first, Senegal has a long tradition of industrial pro-
duction, and labor productivity is comparable to Europe in the case of
mechanized or repetitive industrial operations requiring relatively little
control; secondly, investments in manufacturing increased considerably in
the 1960s, reflecting the confidence of foreign entrepreneurs (mostly French)
who control 85-90 percent of the modern industrial sector; thirdly, the com-
petitive position of Senegal was helped by a rather slow increase in wages
of about 3 percent per annum; finally, the 1966 Agreement among the countries
of the West Africa Customs Union benefitted Senegal.
19.       Industrial production is expected to continue to grow on the basis
of a further increase in exports to developed countries and by greater local
consumption commensurate with an expanding economy. Despite the increase in
the cost of energy and the difficult transport conditions, the value added
in the industrial sector could continue to grow by more than 6 percent annually
between 1971 and 1980. To complement the foreign private investment that is
likely to continue to be attracted to Senegal's industrial sector, the Govern-
ment's Fourth Development Plan for 1973-77 projects investments in manufac-
turing totalling CFAF 17.6 billion (US$70.4 million), or CFAF 4.4 billion
(US$17.6 million) per year.
Tourism
20.       Senegal is well endowed for international tourism development.   Its
long sandy beaches, pleasant climate during European and American winters and
good accessibility through the international airport at Dakar offer much attrac-
tion for foreign tourists as well as for stop-over traffic destined for other
African or South American countries. After a long period of very slow growth,
tourism increased by about 10 percent a year between 1968-71, and has taken
even a more sharp upturn in 1972 and 1973. Nevertheless, total tourists are
relatively small in number. Senegal received 60,000 foreign visitors in 1972
compared to almost a million that were attracted to the Canary Islands.
21.       The growth in bednights by over 70 percent in 1972 and in the first
half of 1973, and the high occupancy ratio of hotels in Senegal (averaging
about 80 percent in the first half of 1973) indicate that the main bottleneck
for tourism expansion has been the insufficiency of hotel accomodation. As
tour operators begin to organize regular charter flights and package tours,
hotel capacity will continue to pose a problem. At the end of June 1973, the
total hotel capacity in Senegal suitable for international tourism was 1,771
rooms, over two-thirds of which were concentrated in Dakar. Of the 800 rooms
now under construction, about half are in the Dakar area. This disequili-
brium in tourist facilities between Dakar and the rest of the country hampers
the expansion of excursions into the country side. Nevertheless, consider-
able expansion potential exists in outlying regions, particularly the Petite
Cote, a long stretch of beaches 60 miles south of Dakar. The Government has
ordered a study of the physical planning of a project in this region and
lhas requested World Bank financing for infrastructure construction.



- 7 -
22.       Recent tourism demand studies undertaken for Senegal show that if
attractive, moderately priced accomodations were available, tourism bednights
could increase annually by over 30 percent over the next ten years. Senegal's
Fourth Development Plan (1973-77) forecasts the construction of 11,270 hotel
beds at a total investment cost of CFAF 27.2 billion (US$109 million). Al-
though this target appears unrealistic due to constraints in infrastructure
and trained personnel, plans based on advanced proposals indicate that at
least 4,000 hotel beds will be built in the next four years, resulting Sn
annual investments on the order of CFAF 2-3 billion (US$8-12 mill:'.on). In
addition, it has been ascertained that complementary investments i'or infrastruc-
ture, conservation of natural and historic resources, and promotion, should
further increase annual investments by about CFAF 650 million (US$2.6 million).
23.       Assuming that daily expenditures per tourist average about $25
until the early 1980's and rise to about $30 by 1990, by 1982 gross revenues
from tourism would increase to CFAF 16 billion per year (US$64 million) and
to CFAF 44 billion (US$176 million) by 1990. This would substantially in-
crease the importance of tourism vis-a-vis merchandise exports from under
four percent in 1972 to nearly 16 percent by 1982 and over 26 percent in
1990.
Banking
24.       Senegal is a member of the Western African Monetary Union established
in 1962 and composed of six countries with a common central bank, the Banque
Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) which has an agency in Dakar.
Other financial institutions in Senegal include four commercial banks and a
development bank. Established in 1964, Banque Nationale de Developpement
du Senegal (BNDS) has specialized since 1970 in short and medium-term loans
to the agriculture and agro-business sectors. The Union Senegalaise de
Banques (USB), a commercial bank, is now 51 percent owned and controlled by
the Government: it was recently granted loans from KfW and AfDB to provide
long-term finance to industry, and particularly Senegalese enterprises. How-
ever, the AfDB loan may be cancelled; the commitment of this loan was difficult
because of the rigorous documentation required by AfDB. The KfW loan is
expected to be fully committed by the end of 1974. The three other commer-
cial banks, which are foreign-controlled, are presently extending only medium-
term finance (up to seven years) to industry and tourism.
25.       BCEAO exercises a qualitative and quantitative control of credit
through a system of global and individual rediscount ceilings. The interest
rate structure is built around the rediscount rate of BCEAO which was raised
from 3.5 percent per annum to 5.5 percent per annum early in 1973. The in-
terest rates charged to industrial firms for medium-term loans are between 9
and 11 percent per annum.
26.       Except for USB recently, there has been no internal source of long-
term financing. Long-term credit to industry has been extended only by Caisse
Centrale (France), directly or through BNDS (until 1970) at low interest rates
(3-1/2 percent per annum to 6-1/2 percent per annum ); the outstanding amount
of long-term loans so channelled to Senegalese industry was CFAF 4.3 billion
by end-1973.



- 8 -
27.       To fill the gap for such long-term financing, the Government decided
to establish a new financial institution, SOFISEDIT. To preserve competition
in the commercial banking sector, the Government decided that SOFISEDIT should
be an independent entity, not aligned with one of the existing financial
institutions. In order to provide SOFISEDIT with an opportunity to establish
itself in Senegal's financial structure, it would have the first option on
applications for long-term financing for industry and tourism under the terms
of its convention, the signature of which would be a condition of effective-
ness of the loan (Section 8.01(b), draft Loan Agreement). SOFISEDIT will,
however, seek close cooperation with existing financial institutions in the
many cases where co-financing will be required. SOFISEDIT will also cooperate
closely with SONEPI, a Senegalese promotional institution which undertakes
feasibility studies of selected industrial proposals, seeks Senegalese in-
vestors to sponsor approved projects and assists such sponsors with project
development, organization and management. To encourage a continuous communica-
tion and a transfer of knowledge between these organizations, each will be
represented on the other's Board as an observer. In addition, the Government
has undertaken to guarantee a long-term loan by SOFISEDIT to SONEPI of about
CFAF 20 million (US$80,000) in order to reinforce ties with SONEPI and con-
tribute to the promotion of Senegalese enterprise (Section 3.04, draft
Guarantee Agreement). The loan to SONEPI would be viewed as a one-time
interim arrangement possibly to be complemented by future Bank Group assist-
ance directly to SONEPI.
28.       Senegal has endeavoured to promote investment by granting financial
incentives under an Investment Code. Applications for benefits under the
Code are reviewed by a Technical Commission, headed by the Ministry of Plan-
ning, on the basis of an appraisal prepared by SONEPI, and then submitted to
an inter-ministerial Committee which meets in principle once a month.
SOFISEDIT will be invited to attend all meetings of the Technical Commission,
so that it will receive the project studies submitted by SONEPI and have the
opportunity to discuss them at an early stage and to express an opinion on
the merits of projects.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
Background
29.       In 1970 a Bank mission visited Senegal at the request of the Govern-
ment to examine the feasibility of creating a new development bank to spe-
cialize in long-term financing for industrial projects. The mission concluded
that immediate investment prospects were insufficient at that time to warrant
the establishment of a new institution. By mid-1972, however, when the need
for fixed investment in industry and tourism had substantially increased, the
Government proposed the establishment of the Societe Financiere Senegalaise
nour le Developpement Industriel et Touristique (SOFISEDIT) and requested
Bank Group assistance to establish this new financial institution and to assist



-9-
in financing it. A Working Group, including representatives of SOFISEDIT's
prospective shareholders and of the Societe Nationale d'Etudes et de Promotion
Industrielle (SONEPI), was formed in June 1973 in order to prepare SOFISEDIT's
formation, operating policy, management and staffing requirements and appraisal
procedures. Working closely with the Working Group, a Bank and IFC mission
appraised the project in November 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington
on April 29, 1974, with H.E. Ousmane Seck, Minister of Planning, heading the
Senegalese delegation.   A report entitled "Appraisal of Societe Financiere
Senegalaise pour le Developpement Industriel et Touristique" dated May 9,
1974 is being circulated separately. A loan and project summary appears as
Annex III.
Capital Structure and Resources
30.       SOFISEDIT was incorporated in March 1974 as a societe anonyme under
the Senegal Commercial Code and as a financing institution subject to the
banking legislation of BCEAO. Its initial share capital totals CFAF 650
million (US$2.6 million), with the following participations:

31.       Based upon a forecast of the projected level of SOFISEDIT operations
from 1974/75 to 1979/80, SOFISEDIT resources through 1976 will need to be
sufficient to cover commitments of CFAF 1,981 million, equivalent to about
US$8.0 million, distributed as follows:



- 10 -
CFAF Million      Percent of Total
Long-Term Loans                         1,110              56.1
Medium-Term Loans                         760              38.4
Equity Investments                        111               5.6
Total                              1,981             100.0
IUhile medium-term loans will be rediscounted at the Central Bank and equity
investments will be financed by SOFISEDIT's own share capital, SOFISEDIT will
need to finance up to 90 percent of its long7term loans with foreign borrow-
ings. The Bank loan would meet about 70 percent of the foreign borrowing
needs, with the remainder to be provided by Caisse Centrale and KfW. SOFISEDIT
will submit projects to Caisse Centrale on a case-by-case basis, and will
request a loan from KfW to be made after KfWT's present line of credit to
USB is fully committed early in 1975.
Role and Objectives
32.       SOFISEDIT's objectives are principally to contribute to the economic
development of Senegal by promoting and financing the establishment, expansion
and modernization of enterprises in the industrial and tourism sectors. To
this end, SOFISEDIT will provide through loans and equity participations
heretofore scarce medium- and long-term funds, will discount medium-term loans
at the Central Bank, and will guarantee credit from other sources. As a
specialized long-term finance institution not aligned with one particular
bank, and as a national institution with reasonablv broad international con-
tacts, SOFISEDIT has the objective of becoming a key promotional channel by
which foreign investors may contribute to the development of Senegal's tourism
and industry.
33.       In an effort to aid the development of Senegal's small but growing
group of local entrepreneurs, SOFISEDIT will concentrate as large a portion
of its activities as sound financial policy will permit upon projects ad-
vanced by small, less experienced Senegalese investors. Almost half of
SOFISEDIT's initial list of prospective projects are expected to be sponsored
by Senegalese businessmen. While the capital cost of these projects amounts
to only about 5% of the capital cost of all projects in the list, it does re-
present a considerable first step towards focusing needed attention on Sene-
galese-owned enterprises. SOFISEDIT will collaborate closely with SONEPI,
which was established in 1969 for the purpose of developing small- to medium-
scale Senegalese-controlled industrial enterprises, in particular through its
participation and guarantee funds.
MTanagement and Organization
34.       SOFISEDIT's Board of Directors will be responsible for overall
policies, procedures and operations. It will have twelve members; six will
represent the Government and strictly Senegalese institutions while the other



- 11 -
six will represent the three foreign-owned commercial banks and other parti-
cipating foreign institutions. The President, a Senegalese, will cast the
deciding vote in the event of a tie. The Board has elected recently as Presi-
dent Mr. Ibrahima N'Diaye, who has been Director of the Senegalese Post,
Telegraph and Telephone Office and is well-known to a number of Bank staff.
Ile is an able administrator, and has good relations in both the private and
public sector. The Board will meet at least four times a year, and its members
will hold office for a term of six years. Board representatives, already
appointed by the Government and shareholders in the public sector, are persons
of independent judgement, of high caliber and stature, and with significant
experience in banking.
35.       SOFISEDIT's President will also serve as the company's chief execu-
tive officer. He will be assisted by an expatriate Deputy General Manager and
by an expatriate Director of Investments during SOFISEDIT's first two years of
operation. At the request of SOFISEDIT, the Bank Group has proposed candidates
for these positions, and is in the process of recruiting the candidates selected
by SOFISEDIT. Initially only a small Senegalese professional staff will be
required, including an accountant, an engineer, and three project financial
analysts/economists. Appointments to the most important of these positions
would be a condition of effectiveness (draft Loan Agreement, Section 8.01 (a)).
Operating Policies
36.       SOFISEDIT's operating policy conforms in most respects to the po-
licies adopted by other development finance companies. With regard to debt
financing, SOFISEDIT will normally extend not less than CFAF 2 million (US$
8,000) nor more than 20 percent of its equity (CFAF 130 million or US$520,000
initially) to any single enterprise. Its equity investment will normally
amount to less than 25 percent of an enterprise's share capital, and will not
exceed 15 percent of its own share capital and free reserves. In accordance
with Senegal's banking legislation, its total equity holdings will not be
greater than 75 percent of its own share capital and reserves. SOFISEDIT will
normally finance only up to 50 percent of the cost of a project, including
permanent working capital. SOFISEDIT is expected to charge an interest rate
on long-term loans of 9.5 percent per annum, earning an average spread of
2-3/4 percent.   The interest rate on medium-term loans will be 8 percent
per annum and SOFISEDIT will earn an average spread of 2.5 percent on such
loans.
Terms
37.       The proposed Bank loan would be made directly to SOFISEDIT on terms
similar to those for other development finance companies. In order to give
SOFISEDIT an opportunity to build up its portfolio without excessive financial
burden, it is proposed that the Bank's commitment charge accrue only from the
respective dates on which various sub-projects are authorized by the Bank
(Section 2.05, draft Loan Agreement). Prior Bank approval would be necessary
for each sub-project requiring Bank funds in excess of US$100,000 and the
aggregate free limit would be US$600,000 which would ensure that projects



- 12 -
involving about 80 percent of the amount of the loan would come to the Bank
for approval (Section 2.02 draft Loan Agreement). The proposed loan would finance
the estimated foreign exchange cost of good:; and services needed for invest-
ments supported by SOFISEDIT. Exchange risis will be borne by the sub-bor-
rowers, SOFISEDIT would lend the proceeds of the loan for terms of up to 20
years for tourism projects, and 15 years for other projects. Amortization
of the proposed Bank loan would conform substantially to the aggregate of
the amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment projects
financed out of the proceeds of the loan. Up to US$200,000 may be used to
finance the foreign costs of the Deputy General Manager and Investment
Director during SOFISEDIT's first two years of operation. The amount
utilized for this latter purpose will be repaid to the Bank in ten equal
semi-annual installments beginning October 1, 1990.
Financial Prospects
38.       It is estimated that in its first two years, SOFISEDIT will fi-
nance loans totalling about 6 percent of the combined industrial and tourism
investment in Senegal, increasing to 10 percent in its third year of opera-
tions and stabilizing at 11 percent after its fourth year. Commitments of
CFAF 416 million (US$1.7 million) in 1974/75 should approximately double in
1975/76 and triple by 1976/77, with long-term loans averaging 58 percent of
commitments, and medium-term loans and equity 36 percent and 6 percent res-
pectively. Assets would total CFAF 2 billion at the end of 1977, and debt/
equity ratio would be 1.8:1. SOFISEDIT would be able to make modest profits
during its first four years of operations; in its fifth year net profits
could reach CFAF 45 million (US$180,000) or about 7 percent of share capital.
Administrative expenses would decrease from 4.8 percent of average total assets
in 1974/75 to 2.5 percent after three years of operations and 1.5 percent in
1978/79. Dividends of 4% are expected to become payable starting in 1978/79.
PART V: THE IFC INVESIMENT
39.       It is proposed that IFC subscribe for cash 500 shares of SOFISEDIT
at par value of CFAF 100,000 each (about US$200,000), pursuant to a Subscrip-
tion Agreement to be entered into with SOFISEDIT. The Senegalese Government
and foreign investors attach considerable importance to IFC's proposed
investment. IFC will have a representative on SOFISEDIT's Board and will
thus contribute to SOFISEDIT's pursuing sound investment policies and help
assure a close relationship between SOFISEDIT and the Bank Group. I intend,
therefore, to nominate a suitable person to represent IFC on the Board of
SOFISEDIT. Considering its modest expected returns, the investment must be
seen more in terms of IFC's developmental role than financial attractiveness.
40.       The main conditions of IFC's subscription will be:
(i) that the Bank and SOFISEDIT have entered into a loan agreement
providing for US$3.0 million and that such loan agreement has
become fullv effective;



- 13 -
(ii) that investors established in Senegal have subscribed and
paid in CFAF 340 million of the CFAF 650 million contemplated
share capital of SOFISEDIT, and foreign investors have agreed
to subscribe and pay CFAF 260 million of SOFISEDIT's contemplated
share capital;
(iii) that an agreement among shareholders has been entered into
providing for the election of SOFISEDIT's Board of Directors.
PART VI: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
41.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and SOFISEDIT, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Senegal and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, the text of a Resolution approving the proposed
loan and the text of a resolution approving the proposed IFC investment,
are being distributed separately. The draft agreements conform generally to
the normal pattern for loans to development finance companies. Special
features of the proposed agreements are indicated in'paragraphs 27, 35 and
37 of this Report.
42.       In accordance with Section 3(ii) of Article III of the Articles
of Agreement of the Corporation, notice of the proposed investment has been
given to the Government of Senegal.
43.       Senegal has signed and ratified the ICSID Convention.    Provision
will be made whereby any disputes between the foreign investors and the
Government of Senegal will be submitted to ICSID for arbitration.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and that the proposed investment would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Corporation.
PART VII: RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that (a) the Executive Directors of the Bank approve
the proposed loan and that (b) the Board of Directors of the Corporation
approve the proposed investment by the Corporation.

Ln. No. 584    US$3.5 Million
Credit of February 10, 1969 and Loan of same date (cancelled);
Closing Date: March 31, 1974
The credit should be fully disbursed by June 30, 1974.
Cr. No. 198    First Highway Project; US$2.1 Million
Credit of June 19, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The first highway project provided for construction of feeder roads,
purchase of highway maintenance equipment, and a study of road.improvement.and
maintenance. Execution of the project has been satisfactory. ..Actual.costs
are within appraisal estimates and surplus funds available-are being used to
provide additional maintenance equipment.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weak-
nesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 252   Casamance Rice Project; US$3.7 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971, Closing Date:   June 30, 1977
The rice production program is progressing satisfactorily. The
number of supervised farmers, as well as the paddy production and yields,
are above appraisal estimates; however, participating farmers marketed
through the project authority only a negligible part of their production.
Problems of procurement have delayed the initiation of the feeder road con-
struction program. Present staff situation is adequate. The channelling of
funds to the project is improving. The preparation of the FY 1977 second
phase project is getting underway.
Cr. No. 253   Technical and Agricultural Education Project; US$2.0 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: October 1, 1976
Due to the unacceptability of the preliminary design for the tech-
nology institute and to delays in initiating the procurement procedures for
the furniture and equipment, the project implementation is about 9 months
behind schedule. No further delay is expected in selecting the fisheries
specialist related to Section 4.02 of the Credit Agreement. No extension at
the closing date of October 1, 1976, is expected.
Cr. No. 254   Terres Neuves Settlement Project;   US$1.35 Million
Credit of June 18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfactorily and
first year's results (1972) are in line with the appraisal report estimates.
Administrative difficulties in making STN (the State Corporation in charge of
the project) operational held up Government's contribution to project financ-
ing. STN is now operational and the procedural difficulties in providing
Government's contribution to project costs have been resolved and project
implementation should continue as scheduled.
Loan 835-SE/Credit 314-SE Second Railway Project; US$3.2 Million and
US$$6.4 Million Credit and Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date June 30, 1975
This project is part of the Regie's Third Four-Year Development
Plan. The major items are track renewal, workshop rehabilitation and equipment,
purchase of locomotives, and consultants' services and training. Of the total
project cost of US$13.3 million, the Bank/IDA is contributing US$9.6 million,
with the balance provided by FAC and from local funds. Initial planning of
details and procurement has been slow because of difficulties in getting bids
on a sufficiently wide international basis, and also because of time-consuming
procedures for evaluating and approving bids, and frequent changes of the
General Manager.



ANNEX II
Page 4
The contracts for purchase of rails and fittings have now been placed,
and delivery of rails began in January 1974. The track renewal program is
already one year behind schedule because of the lack of local funds, and has
moreover been cut back from 175 km to 150 km to allow financing of spare parts
required to repair track-laying equipment. Plans for the workshop rehabili-
tation nave been submitted for Bank approval, but implementation will be at
least two years behind the appraisal schedule.   Consultants are reviewing
traffic operations and mainternance of locomotives and rolling stock. The
contract for the transport coordination study was finalized in late January
1974.
The financial position of the railway has been deteriorating over
the last five years, primarily because of its inability to carry available
traffic as a result of: (a) poor managerial and supervisory performance; (b)
insufficient staff performance; (c) inadequate use of locomotives and rolling
stock; (d) continuing lack of spare parts for motive power and track renewal
equipment caused by the shortage of local funds; and (e) inadequate telecom-
munications system.   The Regie's recently appointed General Manager has
initiated action aimed at restoring managerial efficiency, but the operating
and financial targets provided for in the Plan of Action will probably not
be achieved.
Cr. No. 336    Site and Services Project;   US$8.0 Million
Credit of September 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The Site and Services Project is about one year behind schedule.
The main causes for delay were the unexpected need to pass a law, rather than
a decree, to reorganize the executing agency (OHLM), the delay in recruitment
of technical assistance and the difficulty experienced by OHLM in getting
prompt cooperation from other ministries and government agencies involved in
project execution. More recently a request by the Government to modify the
site plan for the project may cause further delay. Tendering for the first
tranche of 100 hectares has now been completed and land occupation is scheduled
to take place by mid-1975.
Ln. No. 866    Telecommunications Project;   US$6.25 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the 1973-1976 telecommunications rehabilita-
tion and development program of OPTS (Senegalese postal organization).    It
provides for the expansion and modernization of local and long distance facili-
ties, in particular the installation of a modern microwave link between Dakar
and the northern region of Senegal and a VHF/UHF link along the line of the
Senegal River from Richard Toll to Bakel.   Financial measures have been adopted,
and project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.

Ln. Ao. 867    Airport Project;   US$3.0 Million
Loan of December 19, 1972; Ctosing Date: June 30, 1975
This loan for the extension of Dakar airport runway was made effec-
tive on Hay 22, 1973. Bids were opened on January 8, 1974 for the civil works
for runway and apron improvements. Site work is expected to commence in May
1974 and to be completed by June 1975. In spite of uncertainties due to the
oil crisis, bids compared favorably with the appraisal estimate.
Cr. Io. 350    River Polders Project; US$4.5 Million
Credit of January 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The project became effective early in June 1973. Procurement is
now completed for the main components of the project and contracts have been
awarded. Construction of works has begun and Government funding of the project
account is expected in time.
Cr. No. 366    Second Highway Project;   US$8.0 Million
Credit of April 9, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is about six months behind schedule due to delays in
awarding contractors' and consultants' contracts. Contractors will be invited
shortly to submit bids for the road construction component of the project,
and work is expected to start in April 1974. Consultants Louis Berger have
been selected for implementation of the four-year maintenance program, and the
eeam is presently being mobilized. Consultants BCEOM have been awarded the
contract for preinvestment studies and feeder roads requirements, and work
ia about to start.
Cr. No. 404    Second ariculture Credit Project; US$8.2 Million
Credit of June 7, 1973;- Closing Date: June 30, 1977
Area planted to groundnuts in 1973/74 was about 7% below the previous
(drought) year but production was much higher because only small losses oc-
curred, Production of millet/sorghum was about average, but 50% above the
previous year. Demand for medium-term credit remains stronger than anticipated,
and available credit funds may not be sufficient to cover the 1975/76 cropping
year. The subsidy on fertilizer has not been reduced, as required, but the
aclhduled study under Credit 404-SE should provide a basis for policy review.
Technical agsistance is proceeding satisfactorily.
Loan No. S.3-SE      Ship re air engineering loan: US$0.6 million loan of
The project consists of carrying out of the studies essential to
determine the feaasibility of a dry-dock project, including:

A.        Technical studies including those of physical and geophysical
factors affecting site situation.
L.        Economic studies including a market survey, a revision of the dry-
dock project feasibility study and survey formulating a training program.
The loan became effective in February 1974 and the studies are
proceeding satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 446-SE Drought Relief Project; US$3.) Million Credit of December 7,
1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
The project is part of the Senegalese plan to help people in drought
affected areas to re-establish their self-sufficiency by assisting them to
redevelop and improve their farms and lands.
The credit became effective in February 1974. All sub-project plans
nave been approved by the Bank. Orders were placed late 1973 for all project
items, some equipment is already in place and the remainder will be in place
snortly. Thus, disbursements should start immediately.
D.   IFC Projects in Execution-/
Societe Industrielle d'Engrais au Senegal (SIES) - 114-SE
Fertilizer Plant
The plant is operating satisfactorily. Fertilizer sales to the
local market are expected to exceed 50,000 tons in 1974 compared with
35,000 tons last year and export sales are also continuing strong. The
company expect to declare a dividend in 1974 for the first time (IFC/R 74-17).
Bud Senegal S.A. -210-SE and 265-SE - Vegetable Export
Production and sales resumed at satisfactory levels after October/
November 1973 when supply of water for irrigation was interrupted due to
equipment breakdowns in the water distribution system. IFC will attend the
company's board meeting June to review the project (IFC/R 74-17).
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Board of Directors on the status
of the existing projects and to report upon problems, including those
relating to undisbursed investments, which are being encountered and of the
actions that are being taken to remedy such problems. These notes are not
comprehensive in terms of factual content nor are they intended to present
a balanced evaluation of each investment. Reference is made at each note
to the prior report upon each investment contained in the Monthly report
or in other submissions to the Board.
