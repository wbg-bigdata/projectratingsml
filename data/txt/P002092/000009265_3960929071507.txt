MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA FOR A
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PROIECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development credit to the
Federal Republic of Nigeria for SDR 58.5 million is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on a standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity. The credit is to strengthen the national
agricultural research system.
2.   lBawkgEoujm. Nigeria has the largest African agricultural research system with 17 research
institutes, competent professional staff and a history of good performance. However, due to erratic
funding of the system during the 80's1/, six major reorganizations since 1975, lack of effective
central leadership, ill defined priorities, and inadequate human resource development, the system in
recent years has not made significant contributions. Also, because the research institutes under the
Federal Ministry of Science and Technology (FMST), the extension activities of the Federal and State
MinisSties of Agriculture including the ADPs and the Universities under the Ministry of Education are
not effectively linked, efficient use has not been made of available human resources, research fidings
have not been transferred to the farming communities and feedback from them has not been received
for increasing the relevance of research. Even though in recent years, with the gradual introduction
of the Training and Visit extension system nationally, the research-extension-farmer linkages have
improved, a large proportion of available research information is for mono-cropping systems
requiring the use of purchased inputs for high productivity, thus making them unsuitable for the
dominant farmer practice involving low input mixed cropping agriculture. Some useful on-farm
adaptive research is being undertaken by the ADPs but revitalization of the national research system is
crucial, especially if farmers are to benefit from the current adjustment program which has
significandy improved farm incentives. In the long term, with increasing population and declining
per capita availability of cultivable land, a well managed research system is needed to generate the
environmentally sound technologies for sustainable agricultural growth.
3.    Rationale for IDA Involvemegt. The LTPS, MADIA study and sector report on agricultural
growth (Report No. 7988-UNI) have all emphasized the need for a strong agricultural research system
to ensure long-term agricultural growth, basic to food security, foreign exchange generation and to
provide gainful employment to rural population. Until now, Bank financed projects have included
small components of adaptive research to meet the specific needs of the projects, which in some cases
has undermined the national research institutes. There is now a conviction in the country that the
long-term success of agriculture requires a strong research system. The proposed project would
address the key constraints inhibiting research while incorporating the essential elements of the
strategy developed by the Region and addressing concerns highlighted by other studies. It would
increase research output and availability of usable technology needed to improve benefits from past
Bank investments in the sector and underpin efforts to improve linkages between ADPs (technology
1/    Research system expenditure declined from about N98m in 1980 to N65m in 1987.
Thereafter, in current Naira, the funding has been increasing, reaching Naira 127
million by 1989. However, the increases have not kept pace with the high inflation
rate. By 1989, in US dollar terms, the funding declined to less than a tenth of the
level In 1980.



adaptation and extension) and the research system. Based on its experience from elsewhere, and
given the serious lack of funding of agricultural research, the Bank can significantly help the
strengthening of the Nigerian research system.
4.    Prject Objective. Revitalization of the research system is a long term undertaking which
can only be accomplished in carefully planned stages. The proposed project represents the flst stage
of this process to develop the institutional framework and improve the research management systems
so that priorities accord with national development objectives and needs of farmers, research planned
and implemented efficiently and human resource developed and deployed effectively at all levels.
Other important project objectives would be to rehabilitate the institutes, focus Bank support on high
priority research to generate affordable and appropriate technology, and provide effective mechanisms
for linking the research system with universities and the extension system.
5.    Project Description. The project to be implemented over a 7-year period would have two
major components. The first component would focus on research system development. Ihis would
include: (a) operational support to the National Advisory Committee for Agricultural Research
(NACAR) and strenghening of the Agricultural Sciences Department (ASD) of FMST. NACAR
would function as an independent advisory body to the Minister of Science and Technology on
research priorities and funding and to improve inter-institutional relations, especially between FMST
and FMANR, through representation from policy makers of related ministries, emninent scientists and
customers of research. The strengthened ASD would provide secretariat to NACAR and upgrade
management systems for research priority determination, planning, programming, budgeting and
monitoring and evaluation; (b) development of a National Research Strategy Plan (NRSP);
(c) establishment of a Research Grant Scheme (RGS) to support timebound contract researc on
specific proposals not included in the core research but which emerge as later priorities; all qualified
public and private institutions, especially universities, would be eligible to apply for grants under this
scheme. Collaborative regional research initiatives and twinning arrangements with selected ceners
of excellence in other countries would also be eligible for financing under this scheme; and (d)
establishment of a systematic Human Resource Development Program, using expertise of national and
international institutions to train staff in essential skills in relation to changing needs of the system;
and (e) provide technical assistance to develop research management systems, upgrade financial
management, and to assist the development of the NRSP.. The second cumsponent of the project
would focus on strengthening of the research institutes including: (a) rehabilitation of infrastructure
and provision of funds for repair and/or purchase of equipment considered essential for implementing
agreed priority programs; (b) operational funding for priority research programs; (c) strengthening of
the research-extension linkage program. Funding for infrastructure rehabilitation and for priority
research programs would be agreed with IDA annually and, after the NRSP has been completed,
would accord with its recommendations. After the first three years, IDA contributions towards the
operational costs of the priority programs would be gradually decreased in proportion to increasing
Government contributions, which are expected to reach 100% of the costs by the end of the project
period.
6.    The total cost of the project is estimated at US$104.1 million equivalent with a foreign
exchange component of US$62.9 million (60% of total cost). A breakdown of costs and financing are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Two maps of Nigeria
are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8646-UNI, dated May 15, 1991 is being
distributed separately.



7.    AgretdActigons. During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following: (i) PGN
would: a) provide its incremental contributions in line with the financing plan agreed with IDA; b)
maintain the 1990 value in real terms of its existing annual agricultural research budget; and c) adopt
each fiscal year a research program and budget taking into consideration the views expressed by IDA
and accounted for in FMST annual budget; (ii) research institutes would be subjected to extemal
reviews by a panel of Nigerian atnd international experts at regular intervals at terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA; (iii) as an early action of the project, a National Research Strategy Plan (NRSP)
and a Human Resource Development Plan (HRDP) would be prepared and by Marcn 31, 1993, these
plans would be jointly reviewed by the NACAR, FMST and IDA to agree implementation of their
recommendations; (iv) a Research Grant Scheme would be established and managed according to the
criteria and procedures agreed with IDA and changes recommended by the mid-term review; (v) the
training program would be agreed annually with IDA by March 31 and accord with the
recommendations of the HRDP when available; (vi) a mid-term review of both scientific and physical
progress of the project would be undertaken no later than December 31, 1994 by a joint team from
the Government, NACAR and IDA to monitor progress and provide mid-term corrections. A
condition of effectiveness would be that FMST has opened a project account and FGN has credied 50
percent of its first years contribution as an initial deposit.
8.    EMic Benefits. The project would help establish a well managed research system able to
generate relevant research results and adapt technology for the immediate needs of smallholders under
diverse agro-ecological conditions, leading to increases in agricultural productivity. Strong linkages
to be established with other Bank assisted agricultural activities and the International Agricultural
Research Centers (1ARCs) would ensure rapid exploitation of research findings. Development of
appropriate systems for the management of natural resources would help safeguard the environment
and ensure sustainable agricultural growth.
9.    Rigia. The main risk facing the project is the inherent unpredictability of sciendfic research
where success cannot be guaranteed. Other risks relate to: (a) the responsiveness of the Nigerian
research system and its administration to undertake institutional reforms as needed; and (b) adequate
and predictable funding of research. To safeguard against these risks, key organizational changes
have been implemented and the progress of the project would be reviewed annually with the
Govermnent. The agreed changes in the institutional arrangements would strengthen client influence
on research policy and programming. Implementation of changes in research management and
*             improvement in quality of research would be reinforced by provision of expertise to the Government
in critical areas, establishment of close links with the International Agricultural Research Centers
under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, and early emphasis on training
*             of senior managers in the research management procedures. Research would also be re-aligned to
address the priority needs of farmers as identified through the extension service, thereby increasing its
relevance. To minmize the risk of under-funding of research, the Government's commitment to
provide adequate funds in a timely manner was obtained at negotiations.
10.             a . I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
