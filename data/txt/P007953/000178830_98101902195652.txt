REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
BANCO DE FOMENTO AGROPECUARIO DEL PERU
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PERU
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banco de Fomento Agropecuario del Peru (BFA) with the guarantee
of the Republic of Peru for the equivalent of $25 million to help finance
a three-year agricultural credit program. The loan would have a term of
18 years, including 5 years of grace, with interest at 7-1/h percent per
annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Peru" (No. 136-PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 25,
1973. Annex I summrarizes the main economic and social indicators.
3.       The rich and varied mineral resources have been since colonial
days one of the major sources of Peruts wealth, and in later years a limited
but quite profitable export agriculture and a large-scale fishmeal industry
have been developed. While exports are based almost exclusively on the
country's own primary production, they are nevertheless diversified, and
with major new mineral developments under way the medium-term'outlook for
exports and - given a continuing good economic management - growth seems
quite favorable.
4.       The main challenge that has faced Peru for some time can be sum-
marized as the need to break the historical pattern of development without
impairing growth.  In the past Peru has achieved a respectable overall
growth accompanied, however, by wide disparities in productivity, employment
opportunities and income levels, as well as other welfare indicators, between
the modern and the traditional sectors, the coast and the rest of the country,
the urban and the rural population. There are many facets to this challenge:
the need effectively to integrate into the social and economic fabric large
groups of Indian descent who until now have hardly been touched by modern
development, the need to combat the high levels of un- and underemployment,
the need to raise the very low productivity and income of the labor force
outside the modern sectors, and the need to reduce the excessive dominance
of the Lima-Callao area in virtually all aspects of development. This
challenge is made all the more formidable by the country's extreme topog-
raphy and climate which make transport and communications very difficult
and costly and set narrow limits to its agricultural land use.
5.       The military Government that took over after an economic and
political crisis in 1967-68 has been able to restore stability and growth



- 2-
in the economy. It has also taken vigorous steps to effect structural re-
forms which it sees as necessary preconditions for a more equitable social
and economic development pattern.  "Basic legislation" has been issued,
establishing ground rules in the various sectors, including agriculture,
fishing, mining and industry. In agriculture a new law in 1269 made the
previously existing agrarian reform legislation more comprehensive and its
implementation more effective.  Special emphasis was given to the promotion
of cooperatives and other forms of collective management, which are tra-
ditional among the Indian population. In mining the new legislation pro-
v.ded for the reversion to the State of private concessions not being ex-
ploited and for which no agreed program for exploitation could be established
within a short period, and also for a gradual State monopoly of mineral
exports.  Six "basic" industries were reserved for the public sector - iron
and steel, refining of non-ferrous metals, cement, petrochemicals, fertil-
izers, and paper - while legislation on labor commnunities was introduced in
industry, mining and fishing to bring about workerst participation in profits
and ownership.  In parallel, comprehensive reforms of the public administra-
tion were launched and a number of State enterprises set up to implement the
new policies.
6.        As could be expected, the break with past policies has caused con-
troversy and has deterred to some extent private new investment, particularly
in industry and agricrllture. The Government is aware, however, that even if
the Dublic sector is to play a much more important role than in the past in
the economy and the managc.nent of the economy is to be in Peruvian hands,
with broad popular participation, a dynamic development in Peru requires
active participation of the private sector and foreign capital and know-how
are indispensable in some sectors. The Goverrnmentts approach has thus been
pragmatic. It hao agreed to the developmert of the largest new copper mine
(Cuajone) by a foreign company (Southern Peru Copper Company), made arrange-
ments for foreign participation in the recent oil exploration in the Amazon
basin, and is actively trying to attract foreign participation in joint
ventures for important industrial projects. A regime of 50 percent tax
exemption applies to reinvestment of profits in the industrial sector, and
even higher incentives are given to investment outside the Lima-Callao area.
Further, agrarian reform bonds may be usedi as payment of up to half the
amount their shareholders are williLng to invest in industries and, to
overcome the uncertainty felt by individual farmers, a new effort has
been launched to provide documents exempting from expropriation the owners
whose fanrs are in compliance with the size provisions of the law, and who
in addition are complying with relevant labor and other social legislation.
Recently the Governrment has expropriated some 90 private enterprises in the
fishmeal and fishoil industry, with 10 percent of the compensation for the
expropriated assets to be paid in cash and the rest in 6 percent tax-free
bonds, denomLnated in soles and redeemable in ten yearly equal installments.
As in the case of the agrarian reform bonds, these bonds can be used for
financing -up to half of investmerts in certain priority industries. This
latest seizu-re is renewaing open discussion of the Government policies toward
the private sector.
7.        After the initial stabilization of the economy in 1969, the Govern-
ment has also ;7een careful to follow a policy of moderate fiscal and monetary
expansion, and, while there are now some signs of increasing pressures on
prices, the resumed growth has on the whole been managed without creating
serious disequilibria. Current budget expenditures, including'defense



outlays, have been kept under control, and have actually decreased
as a share of national product. The need to finance a growing public invest-
ment - directly  and indirectly through transfers to State enterprises - has,
however, led to a growing fiscal deficit, and at the end of 1972 the
Goverrnent took action to substantially raise tax revenues. This includes
the substitution of a sales tax at producers' and wholesalers' level for a
large number of stamp taxqs, and modifications to the income tax system.
These measures are estimated to represent an additional tax yield of at
least S/. 3.5 billion per year on average during the 1973-74 budget period,
equivalent to 9 percent of the 1972 tax revenues. The Government expects
to raise some further S/. 3 billion in 1974 by additional measures to be
taken this year. This is largely in lne with the increased fiscal revenues
estimated to be required in the 1972 Bank economic report.
8.        In the pursuit of its development goals the Government is in-
oreasingly stressing the role of planning. Its first medium-term develop-
ment plan - covering 1971-75 - puts the achievement of the structural reforms
and a substantial reduction of un- and underemployment as the highest prior-
ity objectives. More employment is to be created in agriculture by better
land utilization in the reformed areas and in industry by a vigorous indus-
trialization drive including a strong expansion of State enterprises and
joint ventures with foreign firms. In addition, mining investment plays an
important role, as it is recognized that most of the needed foreign exchange
will continue to originate from the mining sector. The plan also provides
for substantial investment in a number of major irrigation projects designed
to increase the available agricultural land, since even with all farms
brought in compliance with the size provisions of the reform law there will
not be enough land to provide a sufficient income base for the present rural
population.
9.        Clearly the 1971-75 plan projected too large investment levels,
and this was due to the fact that these levels were primarily set to provide
challenges for the executing agencies rather than realistic sectoral targets.
In terms of accomplishments, the experience of the first year of the plan
period, 1971, was rather disappointing. Many agencies were new, or newly
reorganized, the lead time required before project execution could actually
start had been underestimated, and there was a general lack of experience
with how to actually turn the public sector into a dynamic leader of growth.
As a result, project implementation fell far short of what had been hoped
for, with agriculture being the sector with the worst shortfall.
10.        The record for 1972 indicatep, however, a better performance,
with overall public investment increasinig about 20 percent, twice as much
as the year before.  For the future) it is important to note that Mineroperu,
the State min`nghenterprise, has Signed contrc6ts during 1972 with a UK
syndicate of banks, the Canadian ExTcort Development Corporation and
Japanese suppliers for financing of the large Cerro Verde copper mining
project and a copper refinery, and further mining expansion projects are
under active consideration. Furthermore, the promising indications of
petroleum deposits in the Peruvian part of the Amazon basin have added a
new _acet to the investment program. Petroperu, the State Petroleum
ezterprise, has signed contracts with seventeen foreign companies or
grDup.s of companies for exploration investment, and has embarked on a
Sizeable program of its own. As development of Peru's mineral resources



- 4 -
remains the key element for the balance of payments prospects of the country
and its creditworthiness, the recent progress arid new possibilities in this
sector are very promising. We intend to follow closely further progress in
this field, in the context of our continuing analysis of the countryts credit-
worthiness.
11.       There was at the time of the 1967-68 crisis serious concern about
the external debt situation of Peru.   External indebtedness had risen very
rapidly and the debt service situation for the f'ollowing years was going to
be difficult.  Discussions had to be taken up with major creditors and some
relief was obtairned in two rounds of debt renegotiations. However, debt
service requirements have continued at high level (they accounted for 18
percent of export earnings in 1972) and, in order to achieve the needed net
capital inflow, the Government during 1972 successfully negotiated a number
of medium-term bank loans for some $90 million for refinancing purposes,
in addition to a growing volume of direct development loans. Meanwhile, a
successful repatriation of capital held abroad and favorable price develop-
ments for the export products during 1970 enabled Peru to build up a comfort-
able level of foreign reserves, close to $400 million. It is clear, however,
that debt service, even if manageable, remains a heavy burden for the country
and that more than medium-term bank loans for refinancing is required to
fundamentally alter the situation, especially in view of the present uncertainty
concerning the future of fishmeal exports due to the virtual disappearance of
the anchovy since mid-1972. The Government is aware of this and is seeking
to obtain long-term project loans in support of its investment program.
12.       External capital requirements for the 1973-76 period will be sub-
stantial. In addition to the current account de1'icit foreseen - some $1,150
million over the period, based on an average rate of growth of exports of about
9 percent and of imports of about 12 percent per annum - amortization of the
external debt will require $855 million. The gross capital requirements will
thus amount to about $2,000 million fcr the period, rising from $450 million
in 1973 to $550 million in 1976. On the basis of a plausible financing
pattern of capital inflow, draw down of reserves, and disbursements and
commitments of new loans, annual requirements for new project loan commit-
ments would increase from $295 million in 1973 to $470 million by 1976.
Expressed in terms of export earnings, the debt service would remain at about
19 percent over the period.  Looking beyond 1976, this situation will ease
significantly die to the increased export earnings from the new copper mining
developments.
13.       In view of the need to mobilize development capital abroad, the
Consultative Group for Peru, which had been dormant since 1966, was recon-
vened in February 1972, at the initiative of the Government, to discuss Peru's
public investment program and external capital requirements. The members of
the Group recognized the serious development eff'ort of the Government and
agreed that external financing commitments at a level of about $260 million
per year would be required ov-er the period 1972-74. The response in 1972 of



the multilateral and bilateral lending agencies has been mixed. Overall,
Peru has been able to obtain a record $U44 million in overall commitments
of external loans during 1972, but only a minor part of it has come from
official sources, at long-term (for details, see page 3 of Annex I). The
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) granted one loan of $12 million,
while the US Agency for International Development (AID) made available
$27.6 million for disaster relief in areas affected by the earthquake or
floods. It should be noted that agreement in principle has been reached
with the Federal Republic of Germany and France for substantial amounts of
concessional financing, (i.e., loans exceeding 15 years at interest rates
lower than 5 percent), although in these two cases the projects to be
financed have not yet been fully prepared. As a result of the better
terms now offered, Peru has also begun a process of replacing some earlier
loans with new ones which have better conditions. During the first half
of 1973, Peru contracted $200 million, mostly for non-project purposes,
including debt refinancing, and obtained recently from IDB a $6 million
loan for a mining credit project. On June 19-20, 1973, another meeting of
the Consultative Group was held. The Group commended Peru's achievements,
in particular the Government's efforts to combine economic growth with
social justice and its policy of stimulating exports through mining and
petroleum expansion. The Group urged the Government to create and maintain
a climate of confidence necessary to encourage private investment, and a
reassuring statement on the subject was made by the Minister of Economy and
Finance, head of the Peruvian delegation. Several participants indicated
that they would consider extending part of their assistance on concessionary
terms.
14.       As documented in the economic report, the Peruvian Government is
showing great pragmatism in its economic management and has shown genuine
concern for a more equitable distribution of the fruits of development.
The project preparation and execution capacity of the various public sector
agencies is improving and, while debt service is going to be a burden for
the country for several years to come, Peru is clearly creditworthy for
substantial amounts of additional borrowing. There is, however, a case for
substantial grace and repayment periods, so as not to increase the debt
service probles of the next few years, before additional export earnings
from the new mining projects begin to accrue. There is also need for some
local currency financing, as the resource transfer required to support the
development program is not likely to be fully achieved if all lending is
restricted to the foreign exchange component of projects suitable for
external financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PERU
15.       Since 1952, the Bank has made 24 loans to Peru for a total net of
cancellation of about $243 million. Of this amount, about 48 percent has
been for transportation (eleven loans, mainly for highways and ports), 27
percent for electric power, 24 percent for agriculture and the remainder for
industry. IFC commitments to date have been about $9 million - all in



industry - of which $0.4 million is held by the Corporation. A statement
on Bank loans and IFC investments as at May 31, 1973,and notes on ongoing
projects are attached as Annex II. Bank loans to Peru constitute about
11 percent of total outstanding debt, including undisbursed, and absorb
about 7 percent of the country's debt service obligations.
16.       As indicated to you in August 1970, when a loan was approved to
assist Peru in the aftermath of the earthquake, the Bank became concerned
in 1967 about the rapidly deteriorating fiscal situation and a balance of
payments crisis that ultimately led to the devaluation of the sol in September
1967. Also, after the new Government came into power in 1968, it took over
the International Petroleum Co. (IPC) properties in Peru, in connection with
a dispute that had existed for rany years, and agreement on compensation
was not reached. In 1969, we informed the Government of Peru of our concern
for the fiscal position, the resulting lack of local currency resources for
ongoing Bank projects in Peru, and possible adverse consequences on Peru's
balance of payments and capacity to service external debt of the disputes
with the US Government regarding compensation claims. I therefore made
clear in 1970 that the road reconstruction loan was proposed without prejudice
to the question of when and how the Bank might resume normal lending to Peru.
Since then, however, the general economic management has improved considerably,
the budgetary and balance of payments outlook has also improved, and the
international financial community, both governmental and private, is showing
increasing interest in Peru, as evidenced by the recent external borrowing
record and the arrangements made with private investors for mining and petro-
leum expansion. Settlements with foreign investors have been reached in the
cases of Banco Continental, formerly 60 percent owned by Chase Manhattan
Bank of New York, and of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation.
Other investment disputes continue to shroud the horizon, but recent develop-
ments have given some grounds for hope that these problems will also find a
solution.
17.       Taking all things into account, I have reached the conclusion that
the Bank might Droperly respond to the present situation by resuming lending
to Peru on a moderate scale. Besides the proposed agricultural credit project,
the Bank has under consideration loans for three other projects, in secondary
and vocational education, roads and power. Presentation of these projects
to the Board will, however, await a further review of the status of outstand-
ing investment disputes.
PART III - AGRICULTURE IN PERU
18.       The importance of agriculture in Peru is greater than indicated by
the 1 percent it contributes to the gross domestic product. It provides
the livelihood for about half of the total population, and is also important
for the balance of payments; in value,exports of agricultural products are
currently higher than imports, but insufficient production growth in the
face of rapidly rising demand could easily increase the import bill to un-
comfortable levels. The growth rate of agricultural production during the
last two decades appears to have been under the population growth rate (which
was of the order of 3 percent per year) and well under the rate of growth



of incomes. The supply-demand balance at the present imnort level is very
precarious and a bad agricultural year such as 1972 immediately causes
serious shortages. Aware of the situation, the Government is trying to
improve the internal distribution system so as to avoid regional supply im-
balances, has introduced rationing of beef, and is promoting the consumption
of fish.
19.       The agricultural sector is characterized by widespread underemploy-
ment, low average productivity outside export agriculture, and therefore low
inzome levels for most of the rural population.  Since neither industry nor
other urban activities can possibly provide adequate employment for all the
surplus rural population, except possibly in the very long run, it is clear
that Peru, despite the fact that it does not have abundant agricultural
resources, must make a strong effort to improve both labor productirity and
labor absorption in agriculture.
20.       The Government is attacking the problems of agriculture in several
ways. In 1969 it issued a new agrarian reform law, which considerably ex-
panded the scope of the l9L64 law and also sought to speed up its implementa-
tion process. Unlike the old law, the new one covers also efficiently
managed units such as the sugar estates on the coast and large livestock
ranches in the Sierra, most of which have already been expropriated and
organized in the form of production cooperatives. The agrarian reform aims
also at putting into production idle and abandoned lands, land under -public
oawnership and areas reclaimed or improved for agricultural production under
State financed irrigation and drainage schemes. Finally, the aim is also to
consolidate excessively small holdings into cooperatives and thus to estab-
lish more viable units.
21.       The Government is giving very high priority to the implementation
of the agrarian reform. Between 1964 and 1972 some 4.8 million hectares of
land had been expropriated, including 3.3 million since the new law was
passed. This compares with an estimated total of some 12.7 million hectares
of "expropriable" land under the two laws.   Revised plans now envisage that
about 10 million hectares will be covered by 1975 and that all redistribution
of land now in large farms will have been completed by then. It should be
pointed out that, despite the rather rapid rate of expropriations, the reform
has had no detrimental effects on production, as has been the case with other
agrarian reform schemes.
22.       Meanwhile, the inevitably drawn-out reform process and the multi-
plicity of grounds which the law gives as possible causes for expropriation
havecreated considerable uncertainty among farm owners, even if they know
that they are in basic compliance with the size provisions of the law, and
hm-z negatively influenced their willingness to make new investrnents.  In
order to overcome this problem, the Government has undertaken a review of
all agricultural land in the richest valleys in the country, to determine
their priority for land reform purposes and identify those where the reform
could be considered completed. The Government has also issued documents
which exempt a number of farm   from expropriation.  These documents are being
issued taking into account the size of the farms, their productivity, the
ov.-nerls compliance with social regulations, and other factors.



- 8 -
23.       The second way in which the Goverrment is trying to solve the
problems of the agricultural sector is by inoreasing the availability of land
through investment in irrigation (mainly on the coast) or large-scale land
clearing (mainly on the eastern slopes of the Andes). Thus several extensive
irrigation projects have been started and the Government is trying to find
external financial assistance for further projects; several new colonization
projects are also being prepared, some of which are based on studies under
the IDB/FAO cooperative program and are designed as integrated ru.ral
development programs.  While the objectives of these programs are praiseworthy,
they are very costly and their rates of return may be meager. There is also
a definite risk that the Government may overextend itself in pursuing too
many of these projects with long gestation periods at the same time, to
the detriment of less glamorous but in the short run more productive invest-
ments in small irrigation rehabilitation and drainage projects, better
water management facilities and practices, and, generally, aid to small
farmers to increase productivity on land already under cultivation. The
Bank has discussed these issues with the Government, and plans to continue
impressing upon it the need for well-defined and effective policies in this
field.
24.       In addition to the irnpovement of the landholding system and the
provision of new and improved lands, the C-overnment is paying attention to
other important factors affecting production and income in agriculture.
Extension services are thus being strengthened and the 1973-74 budget pro-
vides for a substantial increase in the number of technicians who work in
or close to the field. Foreign financial and technical assistance to agri-
culture is being sought: the currently proposed loan, in conjunction with a
loan made in 1972 by IDB, is designed to increase the funds available for
medium and long-term agricuLtural credit, which have been in very short
supply over the past severaL years.
25.       In the -past, several BanK maissions iLndicated the need fir the
Govern'ment to develop a comprehensive policy of production promotion to
complement the agrarian reform. In particular, they recommended action irn
the field of prices so as to give greater production incentives to farmers
for certain products, especially beef and milk, for which prices were low
related to costs and the imports of which had been increasing. The actual
price for beef to domestic producers has increased because in practice most
domestically produced beef is now graded as "extra quality", for which the
normal ceiling price does not apply, and toward the end of 1972 the price
of pasteurized fresh milk -- i.e. of most of the domestically produced
milk - was set free.   These producer prices are now at levels that enable
the average farmer -to achieve reasonable rates of return with available
technology.  However, there is some uncertainty as to the future.   The
Government currently seems to be moving towards a greater emphasis general-
ly on price regulation and direct market interventions - a general price
control law was passed early in 1973 outlawing all price increases not
explicitly authorized.   In the past, the Government has tended to adopt
an ad hoc approach towards agricultural price problems rather than evolving
a comprehensive price strategy.  The Government is now considering adopt-
ing such a strategy, which would involve a balancing of competing objectives,



- 9 -
such as, the desire to stimulate production of certain products, to raise
incomes of the rural population, to keep urban cost of living from rising
too rapidly, and to contain the budgetary burden of keeping consumer prices
down in the face of rising import prices and domestic production costs.
The Bank intends to continue closely to follow the question of agricultural
policy in Peru and to review with the Government the need to give high
priority to production objectives whenever these objectives are not ac-
corded adequate weight. In this connection, the Bank agreed with the Govern-
ment to undertake a detailed sector survey later this year.
26.       In summary, the Government is pursuing a number of important
policies designed to improve the performance of the agricultural sector.
The comprehensiveness of the agrarian reform legislation and the Govern-
ment's dedication to its implementation hold out the promise of a substan-
tially improved ownership and increase production in a few years' time. At
the same time the reform process has introduced a great uncertainty among
the - so far - unaffected individual farmers, and the Government would do
well in continuing the type of action it has tentatively begun to allay the
existing fears by clearly indicating farms that definitely will not be
touched. There is no doubt, however, that the Government is genuinely
dedicated to the alleviation of the lot of the rural population while
recognizing the need to promote increased agricultural output and that
financial assistance by external lending agencies to assist in these
endeavors is warranted.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The proposed project is the eighth Bank operation for agriculture
in Peru and would be the fifth agricultural credit to be provided through
Banco de Fomento Agropecuario del Peru (BFA), practically the only source of
medium and long-term financing for agriculture in Peru. A Bank mission ap-
praised in June 1967 an earlier proposal by BFA, but the general situation
in Peru hindered further processing of this loan (see paragraph 16 above).
Subsequently, in May 1971 and March 1972, two Bank missions renewed prepara-
tion work on the project. The Government submitted the final proposal to
the Bank in August 1972, and the Bank appraised the project in September/
October 1972. Negotiations were held in Washington the week of May 21, 1973;
the Borrower's delegation was headed by its Financial lManager, Mr. A. Mastrokalo,
and the Guarantor was represented by the Director of Public Credit, Mr. F. Reus.
28.       An Appraisal Report on the project (No.55-PE) is being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. A summary statement on the proposal
is given in Annex III. The loan is designed to provide support for a three-
year lending program of 5-15 years loans to help finance investment programs
of small and medium size individual farmers and cooperatives. It would
finance the development of livestock farming, annual crop production,
perennial crops and agro-industrial investments. The total project cost,
excluding interest during execution, is estimated at $41.7 million, of which
$19.0 million is in foreign exchange. Financing would be provided by the
proposed Bank loan (60 percent), EFA through increased capital contributions



- 10-
of the Government (20 percernt) and the project beneficiaries (20 percent).
The beneficiaries' contribution of 20 percent, which would include family
labor, is in line with what can be expected from their financing capabilities.
The proposed loan would therefore cover the foreign component of the project,
as well as $6 million of local costs, an amount justified by Peru's overall
resource transfer requirements (see para. 14). The Government's contribution
would be made in three approximately equal part,s, with payments to be made
respectively prior to the e'fectiveness of the loan, by mid-1973 and mid-1974.
The Government would cover the foreign exchange risk on the proposed Bank loan.
The proposed loan would complement the 1972 IDB loan to BFA, which is to
be on-lent to 70 newly formed cooperatives, and a proposed loan for an
animal health program currently being considered by IDB.    In order to
maximize the coverage of the combined IDB and B3ank credit projects, on-
lending under the proposed Bank project will not be made to cooperatives
which are beneficiaries under the IDB loan. The overall demand for agri-
cultural credit by cooperatives is expected to leave ample room for the
combined programs of IDB and the Bank.
29.       The proposed loan has a threefold objective.   First, it aims at
8 supporting the agrarian refcrm program by financing the long-term investment
requirements of cooperatives, for which 50 percent of the loan is earmarked,
and by providing firnancing, with the other 50 percent of the loan, for the
investments of small and medium size farmers, who have so far refrained
from investing because of the uncertainties and shortage of funds referred
to above.  The resulting increase of production would help to improve Peru's
balance of payments position, mainly by substituting imports of meat, milk
products and grain: annual foreign exchange savings, net of increased
import of inputs, are expected to reach about $11 aillion a year at the
projectls full development. To ensure a good supply of funds to coopceratives,
sub-loans under the project will be limited to those cooperatives which shall
not have a substantial surplus available nor good prospects of securing capital
from other sources to finance their proposed investments. On the whole, the
economic rate o0' return of the project is estimated at 26 percent, wnile the
financial ra-tes of return accruing to the farmers and cooperatives would
range between 19 and 39 percent.
'S0.      A second objective of t.he loan is to reinforce the improvement of
I agricultural credit policies that has recently taken place in Peru. In the
past, many agricultural and livestock activities have been isolated from
market forces through various f'orms of price control programs and subsidized
credit.  With the recent IDB loan, BFA's effective interest rate to coopera-
tives has increased from 7 percent to about 9 percent, with terms tailored
to the cash flow requirements of beneficiaries.   Since the proposed Bank-
financed project would yield relatively high financial returns to individual
farmers and cooperatives, it is proposed that the sub-loan commitments to
cooperatives be made at 9 percent per annum for the first 15 months and at
10 percent (or other interest rate to be agreed between BFA and Bank) there-
after, and at 13 percent to individual farmers, with the maturity of the
loans tailored to the cash flow requirements of the individual investments.
A certain period has been allowed before increasing the interest on sub-loan
c:lr'mu.mC11ts to the co-operatives, because such interest was recently increased,
''a; i  soinfe discontent among the farmers.  The average interest rate of



- 11 -
sub-loans made during the first 15 months woul1d therefore be 11 percent
per annum, resulting in an average real interest rate, at the current
level of inflation, of around 3-4 percent. At the present rate of
inflation, these interest rate levels would allow BFA to carry out the
project on a financially sound basis and would be in line with what we
consider appropriate levels to secure adequate factor pricing. The
lower interest rates for cooperatives, besides supporting the Government's
agrarian reform effort, would reflect the lower unit cost of handling
loans to cooperatives. In order to create a floor for real interest rates
on sub-loans, should inflation in any fiscal year surpass 9 percent, the
Government, the Borrower and the Bank would review the interest rate level
at which project funds would be on-lent.
31.       Finally, this loan would support institutional changes in EFA that
are needed because of its expanding operations.   BFA provides 80 percent of
institutional credit to the agricultural sector, exercises the State market-
ing monopoly in natural rubber and jute, and acts as trustee for the agrarian
reform bonds and as fiscal agent for special purpose Government funds. Under
previous Bank loans, BFA underwent a partial reorganization with the assist-
ance of consultants, who strengthened the accounting procedures and separated
the banking activities from its other ventures. Due, however, to rising staff
costs and the need to ration scarce medium and long-term funds, BFA reduced
the authority of its branches to approve loans and gradually increased central-
ization of decision making in the Lima head office.   Under the proposed loan
BTA undertakes to make a review of means of improving its operational and
administrative costs by mid-1974, discuss the findings with the Bank, and put
them into effect thereafter in order to improve cost efficiency. BFA also
undertakes to review by end 1974 its overdue portfolio, which accounts for
30 percent of the total portfolio of BFA, exchange views with the Bank on the
result of such review, and take the necessary actions thereafter. In addition,
BFA is to decentralize the decision making authority in the granting of loans
by giving branches authority to approve medium and long-term loans up to
S/.1.2 million. With this new procedure, the flow of information, supervision
and coordination between head office and branches will need strengthening.
For this purpose, BFA is to appoint, in consultation with the Bank, an advisor,
prior to the effectiveness of the loan. It is expected that with these
commitments, BFA's operations will be expanded and made more dynamic.
32.       Under the proposed project, procurement through international
competitive bidding would be inappropriate because of the diversity of items
and small size of individual purchases. Accordingly, local commercial channels
will be used. Peru has a good network of dealers in agricultural inputs with
a wide representation of makes. Competition among suppliers is keen, which
should ensure fair pricing of equipment and supplies, and facilities for
maintenance and servicing of machinery are adequate. The Bank would reimburse
to BFA 75 percent of the loans made by it to the farmers.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
33.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and BFA, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the Bank, the Report
of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement and the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
34.       The draft agreements contain provisions to reflect the various
arrangements described in Part IV above, including the usual covenants for
agricultural credit projects.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

being overcome. eroject management has recently been strengthened and the
last part of the project related to the drainage scheme is now in process of
imolementation.  While studies necessary for that scheme were underway, dis-
bursements were slow. With their completion and tho start of work on the
drainage scheme disbursements have picked up.   Undisbursed funds amount to
U$$1.1 of which US$0.5 have been conmitted for the procurement of equipment
for the drainage scheme and the balance of US$0.6 is expected to be used by
cl.osing date for the replacement of hydraulic equipment.
Loan No. 425-PE - La Oroya-Aguatia Hi4iway Project: US$33 million Loan
of September 17, 1965; Closing Date: December 31, 1973
The extraordinary difficult geological, climatic, and soil conditions
of the region were underestimated in the design and cost estimates on which
the project appraisal was based, as well as in the bid prices of the contrac-
tors. This together with heavy inflation during 1966-68 and the Government's
d&?lay in paying contractors for extended periods led to large time and cost
olverrur.:. In November 1969, the scope of the project was reduced by deferring
to a second phase paving and a major portion of the necessary drainage and
prctective works of the ro^,d (sce Memorandum to the Fxecutive Directors "Peru -
Proposed Revision of the Cen;:ral Highway Project", November 14, 1969 (R69-219)).
The first phase works for the construction of the La Oroya-Aguaytia Road are
nearing completion. The second phase project has been recently appraised for
possible Bank financing.   Tne closing date of this loan, originally .June 30, 1971,
ans been twice postponed, first to December 31, 1972 and then to December 31, 1973
to permit completion of the project.
Loan No. 511-PE - Matucana Power Project; US$17.5 million Loan of September 11,
1967; Closing Date: November 1, 1973.
The project is practically completed.   The 120 MW plant, as major itern,
went into service in October 1971 for a cost of about US$34.8 million, or about
8 percent less than originally estimated (after adjustment for currency varia-
tions). The closing date was postponed one year to allow for changes in the
transmission and distribution portion of the loan due to revised Government
plans on the Lima airport and housing developments. Completion of the remainder
of the project is expected late in 1973 and within estimate as most contracts
have been awarded.
Loan 706-PE - Road Reconstruction Project; US$30 million
Loan of September 14, 1970; Closing Date:   September 30, 1975
The loan was signed only three and a half months after the earthauake
in the Callejon de Huaylas.  However, the identification, feasibility study
and designs of the roads to be imDroved, have taken a longer period than
expected at the time of appraisal, because of delays in contracting consultants
and in the execution of their studies.   Construction of a short section of road
is well advanced.  Bidding and award of constru.ction contracts for the remainder
of the project are erpected to be completed before the end of 1973.   Construc-
tion works are now projocted to bo finished by the end of 1976, about one year
after the original Closing Pate.

D. EXECUTED PROJECTS (OUTSTANDING ISSUES)
Loan No. 271-PE - Aguaytia-Pucallpa Highway Project; US$5.5 million Loan of
December 19, 1960; Closed on July 31, 1967
Due to cost increases, loan funds have been exhausted in 1967 before
the works were finished. Extensive failures have since occurred in completed
sections, due to insufficient allowance for the combination of poor local soils
for construction purposes, the instability of the region transversed, and
extreme heavy rainfall. Legal proceedings initiated by the Government are
taking place against the consultant and the contractor. The contractor in turn
has filed a claim for compensation.
