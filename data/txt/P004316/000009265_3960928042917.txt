MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO MALAYSIA
IOR A RUBBER INDUSTRY SMALLHOLDERS DEVELOPMENT
AUTHORITY (RISDA) PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Malaysia for US$71.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan would have a repayment period of 17 years, including a grace period of five
years, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would help finance a
rubber replanting project in peninsular Malaysia to be implemented by the Rubber
Industry Smallholders Development Authority (RISDA).
2.          Background.   Rubber smallholders constitute the biggest poverty
group in Malaysia, accounting for about one-third of the rural poor.  Since its
inception in 1972, RISDA has been responsible for raising their productivity and
incomes through assistance in replanting old, low-yielding rubber with high-
yielding varieties of rubber, oil palm or one of the 17 other eligible crops.
Smallholders receive grants of up to M$5,436 (US$2,013) per ha for rubber and
M$3,707 (US$1,373) per ha for other crops, the difference in amounts reflecting
the considerably longer immaturity period of rubber. For replanting, RISDA's
primary source of funds (602) is a cess levied on rubber exports (Q M$99/ton),
followed by direct Government budgetary allocations (402).   Roughly 60S of
replanting is currently with rubber, 301 with oil palm and 102 with diversified
crops. Four replanting systems are followed: individual replanting (accounting
for 75 to 80? of the yearly total), simultaneous replanting by scattered farmers
following the same replanting schedule (10 to 15?), group replanting by farmers
on contiguous land (5Z) and mini-estates (52). On mini-estates, RISDA assumes
full replanting and maintenance responsibility on behalf of smallholders.
Through 1988, a total of 980,000 ha of old rubber had been replanted; about
300,000 ha had never been replanted; and 179,000 ha were ready for second-round
replanting. The Government now envisages an acceleration of the replanting rate
to about 40,000 ha p.a. in the 1990s, compared to about 31,000 ha p.a. over 1981-
88, so that the backlog of smallholder rubber areas never replanted would be
cieared by the end of the 1990s.
3.          Institutional problems have constrained RISDA's effectiveness in
recent years.  These problems have resulted from RISDA's undertaking too wide
a range of activities (developmental, commercial and social) without appropriate
organizational changes and staff training. The Bank has supported smallholder
rubber replanting through relatively small RISDA components in four area
development projects, but these have not dealt directly with RISDA's role,
policies and overall performance. These issues would be addressed under the
proposed project, which would complement ongoing Government efforts to introduce
organizational, staffing and procedural changes at RISDA's head office and field
level and to rationalize its activities.
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Duringprojectpreparation, theBank
helped focus attention on the relevant institutional issues and clarify the
direction and substance of RISDA's reorganization and strengthening. Continued
Bank involvement during project implementation is expected to facilitate the
complex process of institutional change. The project would be consistent with



- 2 -
the Bank's agricultural sector lending strategy for Malaysia which emphasizes
reduction in rural poverty by raising smallholder productivity and incomes,
growth in export revenues, crop diversification and institutional improvement.
S.          Project Objectives.  Theprojectwouldhelpincreasetheproductivity
and incomes of rubber smallholders by supporting RISDA's reorganization and
institutional development efforts, and a three-year time slice (1990-92) of its
agricultural program, which centers on replanting of smallholder rubber.
6.          Project Description.  Agricultural support under the project would
includes   (i) replanting of 101,500 ha of old rubber; maintenance during
immaturity of this area and an additional 106,100 ha replanted prior to the
project; rehabilitation of 7,500 ha; agricultural Inputs, mainly for crop areas
already in production; and supplemental support for mini-estates; (ii)
construction and maintenance of about 300 km of agricultural access roads; and
(iii) extension and smallholder training. Institutional strengthening would be
achieved throught (i) provision of management facilities and vehicles, including
equipment to assist in computerizing RISDA's management information system; (ii)
staff training; and (iii) studies. The institutional component of the project
includes reorganization of RISDA's head office; field level reorganization and
decentralization; strengthening the role of the extension staff; rationalization
of activities to facilitate concentration on rubber replanting and extension;
and improvements in manpower planning, operating procedures and internal
controls, and monitoring of performance of RISDA and its subsidiaries.   In
addition, five project studies would facilitate further institutional actions
in the future.   The total project cost is estimated at US$206.7 million
equivalent, of which US$6.5 million of cocoa replanting and maintenance
expenditures would not be supported by the Bank. The foreign exchange component
is US$73.3 million or 35Z of total project costs. The proposed loan of US$71.0
million would cover a part of the gap in financing of RISDA's replanting program.
The loan would finance expenditures on crop replanting and maintenance through
maturity, rehabilitation of replantings, agricultural inputs, supplemental costs
of mini-estate development, infrastructure, extension and smallholder training,
vehicles and equipment, overseas training and consultancies. Since the proposed
loan would finance a time slice of RISDA's development expenditures beginming
January 1, 1990, retroactive financing not exceeding US$ 7.0 million for eligible
project expenditures after January 1, 1990 would be provided. A breakdown of
the project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group Onerations in Malaysia are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. IBRD Map 21617 is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8029-
MA, dated November 16, 1989, is being distributed separately.
7.          Agreed Actions.        In  fulfilment of the  condition  for Board
presentation, the Government furnished to the Bank RISDA's audited financial
statements through 1986. Receipt by the Bank of RISDA's 1987 audited accounts
would be a condition of loan effectiveness. During negotiations, agreement was



- 3 -
obtained from the Government and RISDA on the followings (a) crop choice would
continue to be the prerogative of the replanters, except in cases where such
choices are agroclimatically unsuitable, and RISDA would not intervene
administrativrely to enforce any specific crop ratio; (b) RISDA would upgrade
access road specifications to those for agricultural roads, create a new accounts
code for infrastructure maintenance, and earmark adequate funds for maintenance
from its development budget allocations for infrastructure; (c) RISDA would begin
to record the number of trainees by gender, endeavor to increase the number of
women trainees at RISDA Training Institutes and expand facilities for in situ
training of women in villages; (d) a computerized management information system
would be implemented at RISDA in accordance with an agreed schedule; (e) by
September 30 of each year, the Government would consult with the Bank on RISDA's
annual work program and its funding for each following year of the project; (f)
RISDA's head office reorganization would be completed by the end of 1990; its
field level reorganization and decentralization substantially completed by the
end of 1992; the role of its extension staff would be strengthened; RISDA's
marketing operations would be assumed by the National Rubber Smailholders
Cooperative (NARSCO) by the end of 1990; RISDA's cooperatives would become self-
financing beginning 1992; a decision on the future of Schemes 1956 and 1959,
which manage RISDA's nurseries and estates, would be taken by the end of 1990;
and RISDA's credit activities (except for the credit component of mini-estate
development costs) would be discontinued by the ead of 1990; (g) the Government
and RISDA would have studies relating to suitable organizational and management
models for mini-estates; the cooperative structure for the smallholders served
by RISDA, including restructuring and strengthening of NARSCO; the future
organizational options for Schemes 1956 and 1959; technical evaluation of the
Muar computerization project; and establishment of a monitoring and evaluation
system; completed by September 30, 1990 by independent consultants; (h) RISDA's
audited accounts through 1989 would be available to the Bank by the end of 1990;
and (i) the Write-Off Committee, established to reconcile RISDA's sundry
creditors and debtors accounts between the control accounts and the subsidiary
ledgers, would continue to exist during the project period to examine the
auditors' reports and recommend appropriate action to address outstanding issues.
8.          Benefits.  The  main  project  benefits  would  be:  (a)  improved
productivity and farm incomes for rubber smallholders, many of whom are at
present earning less than the estimated poverty income of M$ 380 (US$140) per
month per family of five; (b) increased export earnings from rubber and palm oil
and increased production of diversified crops; and (c) increased institutional
efficiency of RISDA in delivery of services to the rubber smallholder sector.
Some 104,000 rubber smallholders are expected to benefit from the project,
including new replanters and those who replanted prior to the project, but whose
farms would receive early maintenance support under the project.   At full
development around the year 2003, net foreign exchange earnings and savings from
project incremental production (using projected world market prices for the year
2000 in 1988 constant dollars) would be about US$ 230 million per year.  The
improvement in RISDA's effectiveness as an institution would also contribute to
the Government's poverty alleviation efforts. The project would directly benefit
about 18,000 women workers in rubber smallholdings through increased training
facilities. Moreover, recording of trainees by gender, which would be initiated
under the project, would provide valuable information for the planning of future



- 4 -
extension and training services for women in the rubber subsector. The economic
rate of return of the project is estimated at about 141 for new replanting
(rising to 25 if maintenance of prior replants is included).
9.          RLsks.  The main project risk relates to effective lmplementation
of RISDA's reorganization and institutional strengthening. Institutional reform
is a complex process, which could take place more slowly than currently planned.
To minimize this risk, efforts were made during project preparation, appraisal
and negotiations to achieve a firm consensus on basic principles. Already agreed
Institutional measures will be complemented by studies wvhch will lay the basis
for future actions. A step-by-step approach has been adopted, and sufficient
lead time has been allowed for each stage of institutional change. Significant
reforms have already been initiated by the Government, beginning with a chmage
in RISDA's top management in May 1989.  It is, therefore, expected that the
institutional component would be implemented as envisaged.
10.         Recommendatlon.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agresment of the Bank and recomuend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
