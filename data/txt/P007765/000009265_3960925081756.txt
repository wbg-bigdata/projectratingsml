PROJECT' COMPLETION REPORT
NICARAGUA
MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2086-NI)
Preface and SummaEy
1.       Encouraged by the early  success  of the Urban Reconstruction Pro-
ject (Credit 965-NI, approved in December 1979) and the National Decentral-
ization policy (which funneled new urban investment to the secondary cit-
ies), in July 1980 the Government of Nicaragua requested Bank assistance to
improve and expand its  municipal  development  program.   During the first
year of the reconstruction Credit (1980) most of the Government resources
were allocated to rebuilding the six provincial towns that were heavily
damaged in the civil war, while little or no improvement was made in the
low-income "barrios" of Managua and the smaller towns throughout the
country.
2.       Urban problems in Managua were significant.  After the war in July
1979, the population of Managua continued to grow at over 7% per year while
the secondary cities and provincial towns grew at less than 4%. By 1980,
Managua had expanded in all directions from the lakeshore, with over
650,000 inhabitants -- representing 50% of the national urban population.
It will remain in the foreseeable future the major center of population.
Immigration to Managua was estimated at 30,000 per year. At the western
edge of the city, a new settlement, Ciudad Sandino with over 50,000 popula-
tion, emerged in the end  of  1980.    These expansion areas, lacking basic
infrastructure, added to the existing low-income "barrios", presented enor-
mous problems for the  city.    Lacking  in  storm drainage, street paving,
w'l.kways and street lighting, it was virtually impossible to travel through
half of the city during a rainy storm.  Residents in these "barrios" had to
take off shoes before leaving their dwellings to walk long distances to the
paved road and bus service. During the dry season, the "barrios" were con-
verted to dust bowls. Both situations affected the health and welfare of
the workers and their  families.    The  sanitary  sewer networks, built in
1930, cover less than 40% of the built-up area; there are no sewage treat-
ment plants.  Tne sewer outfalls discharge raw sewage into Lake Managua and
industrial liquid wastes add chemical pollution.
3.       In the secondary cities  and  provincial  towns, the situation was
worse; they not only lacked basic infrastructure, but also basic community
facilities, e.g. markets, slaughter houses, bus stations and administrative
buildings. There was an urgent need for a program of municipal development
on a national level that would provide basic infrastructure and community
facilities as well as improved municipal management. Loan 2086-NI was to
be focussed on the upgrading of low-income "barrios", housing over one-
third of the population of Managua; in addition the government requested
financing for a smaller program of improvements to the municipal services
and facilities in a network of smaller towns throughout the country.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NICARAGUA
MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2086-NI)
Highlights
1.       In Part A of the project, 26 low-income "barrios" in Managua were
upgraded with improvements in grading, drainage, street paving and
walkways, street lighting and landscaping (para. 9). In acordance with the
appraisal, these improvements covered one-third of the city. With 44 km of
paving completed, including curbs and gutters, buses were able to enter the
"barrios" on paved streets for the first time. In addition, macro-drainage
improvements were completed on the six major storm drainage basins, as
planned during the appraisal. By September 1983, the periodic flooding of
the low-lying areas was eliminated (para. 9). In Part B, the Secretariat
of Municipal Affairs (SAMTJ), with technical support from the Ministry of
Housing & Human Resources (MINVAH), completed the appraisal development
program of 31 components consisting of municipal markets, slaughterhouses,
bus terminals, municipal offices, storm drains and paving in 15
municipalities (para. 10). Most of the municipalities are located on the
western or Pacific side of the country, with two on the eastern or
Caribbean side. This part was substantially completed in 3.0 years as
scheduled. In July 1982, a new component was added to this Part,
consisiting of repairs and reconstruction of 5 bridges damaged by the
floods. The works were completed in twelve months. Under Part C
(municipal management), technical assistance was provided in municipal
budgeting, financing, cost controls, as well as the introduction of
effective mechanisms to set and collect property taxes. Part of the
training was provided through formal courses for 900 municipal
administrators in the Government Training Center followed by on-the-job
training (para. 11). Through careful management and programming, the
annual training quotas were exceeded by 25 percent. Foreign experts made
valuable contributions in the course work (para. 18).
2.       The PCR is based on information in the President's Report and the
review of the Bank's files including project supervision reports.
Additional information was obtained by a supervision mission which visited
Nicaragua April 21-28, 1984. Since the two parts were implemented by
different government entities, a joint evaluation report of the project was
not prepared. However, JRM prepared the documentation for Part A Barrio
Upgrading and MINVAH for Part B Municipal Development. In preparing the
PCR, each entity assisted, to the extent possible, in the data collection
and discussion with the municipalities. This report represents a desk
review of available documents for the project completion as of April 19,
1987. As of this date, the project objectives were fully met.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NICARAGUA
MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 2086-NI)
I. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
1.1      Project Preparation
1.1.1    In July 1980, SAMU and JRM presented to a Bank supervision mission
of the Urban Reconstruction Project (Credit 965-NI) a proposal for
upgrading low-income "barrios" with community facilities and improved
municipal management. Managua, as well as a network of secondary and
provincial towns were to be the beneficiaries of the program'. The proposal
was organized into two lending operations. JRM proposed upgrading one-
third of the city, accompanied by macro-drainage components, as one
operation, while SAMU piLposad a municipal improvements program for the
network of secondary cities and towns.  In December 1980, a mission pre-
appraised the first operation with JRM. The Mayor and the JRM staff had
worked closely with the "barrio" leaders in evaluating the conditions of
over half of the city and selected 26 "barriosn. The site planning and
design proposals were of a high quality and had the full support of the
residents. The 15 priority municipalities, selected by SAMU, formed part
of the national regional development strategy. They also met the criteria
for growth potential and the need to efficiently serve existing industrial
activities. The municipal improvements proposed by SAMU were based on
proven prototype designs. The earlier conceptual development plans (Planes
Orientadores) prepared for the secondary cities during the initial
reconstruction phase were developed further into land use and
transportation plans. These provided the planning rationale for locating
the proposed community facilities.
1.2      Project Appraisal
1.2.1    In February 1981, the Bank sent the appraisal mission with the
primary objective of combining the two proposals into one lending
operation, focussing on the the Managua upgrading components, while
reducing the components of the improvements program for the 15 towns. By
May 1981, the project was defined to:
(a) provide basic infrastructure to 26 low-income "barrios" in
Managua, the lack of which had negatively affected production
and distribution of goods and services as well as the general
welfare of these "barrios";
(b) st-engthen the capability of the municipal institutions to
plan and execute urban public works.
During the post-appraisal mission of October 1981, with the worsening of
economic conditions, the Government issued Decree No. 814 which integrated
JRM's budget with the national budget. This decree appeared to
substantially curtail the financial autonomy of JRM, significantly
affecting the project. Assurances were given by the Government that JRM's
financial autonomy would be affected only in the sense that expenditures



for capital improvements and projections of future revenues would be
reviewed. This would allow the Ministry of Finance to monitor more closely
the municipal budget. Based on the above, the Board approved on January
12, 1982, a loan of US$16 million for the total project cost of US$22.8
million. During the year of preparation, JRM's staff demonstrated their
efficiency in preparing final designs, specifications, details, quantities
and cost estimates of the 26 'barrios', as well as the micro drainage
structures.
II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION, EFFECTIVENESS
2.1      Board Approval and Effectiveness
2.1.1    The loan was signed on February 5, '982 and became effective on
March 12 when all conditions including preparation of a revised land-use
and zoning plan, were fulfilled. MINVAH, charged with the preparation of
land-use planning satisfactorily completed the Plan Regulator (Land-Use
Plan) for Managua by March 1982.   A most important feature of the Plan was
the redensification study, which proposed a desirable population ceiling,
with residential neighborhoods of an optimal size for efficient use of
installed infrastructure and efficient linkages between housing and
employment. By July, progress was satisfactory for Part A Barrio
Upgrading, with completion scheduled for December 1983. However, in May,
serious floods damaged six bridges in the cities of Leon and Chinandega.
At the request of the Government, the Bank agreed to expand and transfer
US$4.0 million from the unallocated category to a Special Account
established solely to finance this new component. The July 1982
supervision mission reviewed the proposed repairs and reconstruction of
three bridges in Leon that serve one-third of the city and three bridges in
Chinandega where one-quarter of the population was cut-off from the center.
The estimated base cost was US$3.7 million with a construction schedule of
nine months. They were completed in twelve months with additional foreign
assistance, (Annex 2 Photograph 7).
2.2      Implementation
2.2.1    Even though the project suffered from shortages in equipment and
delays in the supply of paving blocks, all 26 "barrios' were virtually
completed on schedule by June 1984, including landscaping (Annex 1 Graph
1). The latter was undertaken through community participation in each of
the "barrios' with great enthusiasm. Small trees were given to each
"barrio" to be planted by community associations along all the streets and
walkways. Individual households added shrubs and ground cover in their
front yards, which helped transform the appearance of their 'barrios'.
Over 44 km of secondary streets were graded and paved including curbs and
gutters. Pre-cast "adoquin" blocks were laid by hand, using contract labor
based on competitive unit prices. (Annex 2 Photographs 1 & 2 and Annex 3
Map 1.) Walkways and street lighting provided efficient pedestrian
circulation throughout the 26 'barrios'. Over 250,000 persons, who before
the project lived on dusty lanes during the dry season or in ankle deep mud
during the rainy season, were directly benefitted. The macro-drainage,
completed in September 1983, has successfully eliminated the periodic
flooding of the major traffic arteries and adjacent residences along the
edge of the lake. (Annex 4 Photographs 3 & 4 and Annex 3 Map 1.)



- 3 -
2.2.2    In Part B, the technical. assistance from the MINVAH staff,
especially in the preparation of prototyr- and final designs as well as
supervision, evolved into an effective op,...ation. However, several
components were delayed for administrative reasons. In July 1983, SAMU was
placed under the Secretariat of General Coordination for Urban and
Political Development, rermioved from operations and development. It was
clear that the most appropriate way to complete this subproject was to
transfer the implementation responsibilities to a special unit in MINVAH.
This change was formalized soon thereafter. The lack of counterpart funds
for equipment and finishes for a few of the markets and slaughterhouses
delayed their inaugutrations. For the remaining markets and bus terminal,
pre-cast concrete structural columns and beams were used to speed up the
construction. By December 1984 all the components were complete and
operating (Annex 2 Photograph 6 and Annex 3 Map 2).
2.2.3    In Part C, the Government Central Training Facility was used to
train the MINVAH staff as well as the JRM units. The Nicaraguan Institute
for Public Administration (INAP) with assistance from the Brazilian
Institute of Municipal Administration (IBAM), trained 900 low-level
managers and skilled operators, as of December 1984. Thirty-one courses
were provided ranging from public health and hygiene, park
maintenance/gardening, automechanics maintenance, computer programming,
systems analysis, program evaluation and statistics. The recording and
audio visual equipment for the center was financed by the project. During
the completion of the project INAP prepared an evaluation report of the
current training program, to guide future staff training programs schedule
for 1985 and 1986.
2.3      Cost, Procurement and Disbursement
2.3.1    At the completion of the project in September 1984, the cost was
Cordobas C. 297.0 million. During the implementation period 1982-84, the
value of the Cordoba dropped from US$1:10 to 1:15.9, as a result the total
project cost was US$23.0, compared to the SAR estimate of US$22.8 (Annex 1
Table 1). While there was virtually no increase in the US dollar value,
the cost in Cordobas increased 30.3?, due to inflation. The price increase
occurred mainly in construction materials for Parts A and B. For Part A,
Barrio Upgrading, the final cost was US$17.5 million (Annex 1, Graph 1).
For Part B, MuniLipal Infrastructure Improvements, the final cost was
US$3.1 million and for Part C it was US$0.3 million.
2.3.2    Procurement was in accordance with the provisions of the Loan
Agreement and Bank guidelines. The purchase of cement and paving blocks
was made through local competitive bidding procedures and bid evaluations
were satisfactory. Over 30 suppliers and local contractors were used.
Documented force account expenditures were carefully prepared and post
audited by JRM's internal auditors.  In accordance with the loan agreement,
external auditors prepared acceptable annual audits for the three years of
implementation. The daily output of the force account teams were analyzed
for their efficiency using unit prices which were compared with the daily
market prices.

2.3.3    Disbursements were made against civil works as well as
construction materials and some training equipment. Through the use of the
special account and SOE's. JRM was reimbursed on a monthly basis. By the
end of 1984, the loan was disbursed except for a very small amount that was
finally cancelled in May, 1987.  This successful rate of implementation was
due mainly to the excellent organization of the JRM implementation unit
that was geared to carry out well-designed components with uniform design
and specification criteria. Furthermore, the construction components were
scaled to the implementation capability of each group or local
municipality.
2.4      Quality of the Work Completed
2.4.1    The quality of the completed civil works in Part A, Barrio
Upgrading, was outstanding due In part to the pride that each cadre of the
work force took in the details and finishes, but also to the active
participation of the direct beneficiaries in overseeing the opera'ion. The
macro drainage works were undertaken mainly by hand labor because all
available large drag lines and bulldozers were sent to the frontier to
construct roads. For Part B, even though the local supervision was
inadequ~.e, due to the shortage of staff, the quality of the market
building, community facilities, as well as drainage works, was
satisfactory.
2.5      Additional Benefits
2.5.1    In Part A, the paved and landscaped streets and walkways of the
"barrios" provided efficient access for solid waste collection as well as
public transportation mentioned above. With clean and well-maintained
streets, the house owners were motivated to improve and expand their
dwellings--vertically as well as horizontally. From available information
and visual inspection, it appears that for every C 1,000 spent on municipal
improvements, about C. 2,600 of private improvements in the housing stock
was generated during the project implementation.  Individual dwellings were
expanded horizontally and in some cases vertically to accommodate their
extended families or to rent. This has resulted in substantial
redensification by about 25Z. The civil works of Part A, representing 85%
of the total project costs, employed 2,650 workers during the peak period
through March 1983. By September, the number was reduced to 1,600; the
others were shifted over to other JRM projects or to municipal maintenance.
The urban planning of Managua including the redensification and
restructuring the city, to improve the internal efficiency, drew support
from the Governments of Cuba and the Netherlands, who sent planning teams
from the Cities of Havana and Amsterdam to assist in establishing the
methodological approaches and technique for evaluating alternatives. In
addition, the Technical University of Delft provided technical assistance
for improving other low-income "barrios" and help prepare a development
plan for the downtown area. JRM plans to upgrade 30 more "barrios" over
the medium term--through 1995; however, with the limited financial
resources, the local residents will have to make a substantial .ontribution
through sweat equity.



2.5.2    In Part B, with the construction of markets, slaughter houses,
office buildings and maintenance shops, the municipalities were required to
set up management and administrative units for financial controls and cost
recovery. These in turn evolved into the overall financial planning
offices of the smaller municipalities where they did not exist before the
project.
III. ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE
3.1      Institutional Development
3.1.1    A major objective of the project was to strengthen the
capabilities of the municipal institution to plan and execute public works.
In Part A, JRM (autonomous municipality governed by a five member board)
within one year, became a powerful and dynamic institution; more efficient
management and computerized cost controls were introduced during the second
year to make the project implementation more efficient. One of the first
training courses was set up for field level supervision staff--civil
engineers, bookkeepers, supply and stockroom clerks--before they went into
the field.  Refresher courses were given later.  With computers, the daily
output in terms of direct costs of labor and materials were continually
analyzed along with indirect costs. The Planning and Implementation
Division of the Municipal Operations Department of JRM carefully
distributed the daily workload to maintain a highly productive st.ff.
Starting with eight "barrios", more were added as the trained work force
and supervision became available. Marked improvement in the productivity
was noted by the Bank supervision missions as their managers became more
experienced.
3.1.2    In Part B, with the transfer to the Secretariat of General
Coordination for Urban and Political Development, SAMU focused on the
decentralization of the development programs in the geographic and
functional regions plus two territories on the Atlantic coast. MINVAH
aggresively responded to the responsibilities of implementing this sub-
project. Many of SAMU's field and operational staff transferred to the
MINVAH project implementation unit to continue their work. At the
conclusion of the project, this unit continues to provide technical
assistance in developing additional municipal improvements in the regions.
By the end of the project, most of the staff was regionalized leaving a
core group to coordinate and enhance the urban development policies.
3.2      Bank Group Performance
3.2.1    The Bank Group responded to the Government's request for
assistance in July 1980 and by December 1980 pre-appraised the JRM
operation. The appraisal mission of February 1981 consolidated the JRM and
SAMU projects into one operation. A post-appraisal mission in October 1981
resolved the issue of JRM's financial autonomy which was threatened by the
Government's decree to integrate JRM's budget with the National budget.
The Board approved the project on January 12, 1982 and the loan became
effective March 12, 1982. Two supervision missions were undertaken yearly
in 1982, 1983 and 1984.  For the first two missions 80Z of the effort was



- 6 -
concentrated on technical assistance during the final design stages mainly
with SAMU. The ir,tensive supervision during the first year helped the
early completion of the project. Considerable effort was made to improve
cost controls and monitoring of each component. Suggestions by the
missions were quickly adopted in the field within a fine spirit of
cooperation from the beneficiaries to the project managers.
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
4.1      Compliance with Covenants
4.1.1    During the appraisal an early agreement was reached with JRM on
the guidelines for financial reporting and controls including systems of
internal and external financial controls as well as systems of budgeting
and budgeting controls. With its newly acquired computer capability, JRM
had.these systems operating by the end of the first year. By December
1983, JRM presented its three-year Capital Investment Plan which was
updated annually in accordance with the Loan Covenants. The rates of
municipal taxes and fees were also reviewed annually to ensure adequate
revenues. By July 1984, JRM had completed a study on how the private
construction industry of Nicaragua could increase their participation in
municipal improvements programs. With this study, JRM and SAMU/MINVAF
complied with all the covenants.
4.1.2    In Part A, the JRM financial performance improved dramatically due
mainly to improved tax enforcement and increasingly effective cost control.
JRM ended CY83 with a significant surplus on their overall operation-
-exceeding the SAR projection by 24Z. The tax on the sale of goods and
services, regulated by a schedule (Plan de Arbitrios) was revised in 1980
and aggresively enforced. The collection system by the same token is
functioning satisfactorily. Current expenditures were equally
satisfactory--lower than the SAR estimate. With this performance, JRM had
no difficulty in providing counterpart funding and discharging its debt
repayment liabilities.
4.2      Cost Recovery
4.2.1    For Part A, the cost recovery was initiated in late 1983 in the
completed "barrios", through a 15? surcharge on the monthly electricity
bills. An additional surcharge was added to cover the cost of garbage
collection. JRM receives a single monthly payment from the electrical
corporation, eliminating problems of collection. The Instituto
NicaragUense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) in collaboration with the
Direcci6n de Estadisticas de Asentamientos Humanos studied methods of
front-foot assessment by pro-rating land values in relation to the distance
from paved streets. JRM is applying a graduated tax designed to recover
all their capital investments within ten years. These studies were
expanded beyond the project boundries to cover eventually the entire city
in the preparation of a new cadastral.



4.2.2    For Part B, the muni-ipalities are able to repay the SAMU loans
directly from the revenue earnings of the markets, slaughterhouses and bus
terminals. For the other infrastructure works, the costs will be recovered
through general municipal revenues. All repayments of the SAMU line of
credit are deposited into the Municipal Development Fund which is
administered by the National Development Bank (Banco Nacional de
Desarrollo). This fund continues to be used to finance new municipal
development projects.
4.3      Economic Rate of Return
4.3.1    In the SAR report, an economic rate of return of about 17Z was
calculated for Part A on the basis of the increase in thLe imputed rental
value of existing housing units that woula likely result from the proposed
investment. While the majority of the dwellings in these "barrios" were
owner-occupied and increased in value, there were a significant number of
dwellings for rent that benefitted from the project. The last supervision
mission, September 19, 1984, was unable to collect sufficient data;
however, taking into account the improvements to individual dwellings, the
ERR based on the increase in land values exceeds the appraisal estimate by
50J. This is comparable to the experience in other urban upgrading
projects. For Part B, the large number and variety of relatively small
components to be financed through the SAMU line of credit made calculations
for an o,rerall economic rate of return difficult. In both Parts A & B,
important benefits, such as in health, were not quantified.
V. T.ESSONS TO BE LEARNED
5.1      This project complemented the Emergency Plan Urban Reconstruction
project (Credit 965-NI) that preceded it. In particular, the paving of
roads allowed the buses procured under the first project to extend service
while reducing wear and tear on the units. The net effect was synergistic:
economic benefits accrued to both projects.
5.2      Lessons from this experience show that when urban upgrading
projects are well designed, with appropriate technology, in scale with
financial constraints, and implemented by a well organized and trained
project management team, the results are positive. If, in addition, the
project really addresses the felt needs of the people, and therefore
effective community participation can be organized, the benefits to the
poor are enhanced and the overall economic impact of the project is
greater. In Managua, the "barrios" had less than 9,500 population (1,750
dwellings) so that participation by the residents in the site planning,
including adjustments to their lot lines was easily achieved, thereby
eliminating delays over street closings, etc.. Their cooperation
facilitated the final clean up and landscaping. JRlI used the special
account of three-months expenditures as a revolving working fund. The
processing of reimbursement applications was reduced to ten working days;
as a result, there were no delays due to lack of counterpart funds.



- 8 -
5.3      In Part B, the municipal development program for 15 mu- 4p;1lities
was a success because the components were smal' and scaled to the
functional needs of the town. The larger the community facility the
greater are the problems which is a truism. The large market of Chinandega
in particular had problems starting with site selection which was
predicted. Nevertheless, future municipal development programs should
continue to finance such projects, but with the understanding that there
will be delays. The smaller components used prototype designs that were
easily implemented.

(WORKING TRANSLATION)
Managua, July 6, 1988
Mr. Alexander Nowicki
Chief, Policy-Based Lending
Energy, Industry and Public
Utilities Division
Operations Evaluation Department
Dear Sir:
We would like to thank you for your letter including the draft
(PCR) report on the Municipal Development Project (Loan No. 2086-NI) which
was made available to our institution in 1982.
We would like to express our thanks to your organization for
proffering the precious collaboration and the support which enabled us to
provide, through this loan, basic infrastructure to the lowest-income
neighborhoods thereby integrating them into the overall development of the
city. We fully agree on both the terms of the report and the data it
includes.
We hope for a possibility to participate in future Municipal
Development Projects, all the more so as our municipal development process
focuses on the participation of the local population as a key feature for
the implementation of works.
Fraternally,
Francisco Sanchez
Deputy Minister
Municipality of Managua
