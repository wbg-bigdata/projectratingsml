Credit and Project Summary
Borrower                          The Republic of Yemen
Implementing                      The Ministry of Planning and Development through a Steering
Agency                            Committee and its Project Management Unit
Beneficiaries              .      Potential unemployed and recipients of improved infrastructure
services
Amount                     :      SDR17 million
Terms                             Standard, with 40-year maturity and 10 years' grace
Commitment Charge                 Standard (a variable rate between 0 and 0.5 percent of the
undisbursed credit balance set annually by the Executive Directors
of IDA)
Project Objectives         :      The overall objective of the project is to mitigate potential adverse
effects of economic adjustment. Specific objective is to generate an
estimated 75,000-96,000 work-months of employment at a cost
range of US$260 to US$350 per work-month. It is also expected
that the project would help deliver much needed infrastructure
services, improve environmental and sanitary conditions and enhance
community participation in preparing and implementing sub-projects
for civil works. Achievement of the project's development objective
will be monitored through performance indicators and the findings
will be reflected in quarterly progress reports and in quarterly audits.
Project Description        :      The project has three components: (i) a multi-sectoral, labor-
intensive program of essential, small-scale public works aimed at
rehabilitating, extending or maintaining urban and rural infrastructure
such as: water supply, streets and roads, storm water drainage, flood
protection, irrigation, soil conservation, health and education
facilities. Under the project, an estimated 250-300 sub-projects
would be selected according to agreed criteria and implemented; (ii)
establishment of a Steering Committee and as its secretariat, a
Project Management Unit to manage project implementation; and (iii)
a technical assistance program to develop the capacity of the Project
Management Unit; to prepare and implement sub-projects; and to
provide training to local consulting and construction companies. The



- ii -
IDA funds would help finance: (i) the implementation of sub-
projects; (ii) the establishment and operation of the Project
Management Unit; and (iii) technical assistance.
Benefits                      :      The major project benefit refers to the number of jobs that are
expected to be created, which for the total project would correspond
to an estimated 75,000-96,000 work-months of direct employment.
In addition, it is assumed that jobs to be created indirectly, under
various activities serving the construction industry, would correspond
to about 40-50 percent of those to be created directly. Apart from
job creation, the sub-projects will provide additional benefits from
improved infrastructure services, protection of the environment and
better health and education facilities.
Risks                         :       The project has several risks referring to: (i) maintaining a high
labor content in the sub-projects; this risk would be mitigated by
selecting labor-intensive sub-projects; (ii) maintaining an acceptable
quality of works; this risk will be addressed by providing technical
assistance and training to local consultants and contractors as well as
NGOs; and (iii) ensuring sustainability of completed works; this risk
would be addressed in the selection of sub-projects and in the
development of NGOs' capabilities to assist communities in operation
and maintenance. To respond to all these risks, flexibility has been
built into the project to allow for adjustments, as necessary, in sub-
project selection and in implementation arrangements.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
1. INTRODUCTION
A. Country Background
1.1       The Republic of Yemen (ROY) was established in May 1990, when the Yemen Arab Republic
(YAR) in the north and the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) in the south were united. North
Yemen had been ruled under a traditional system of governance and virtually closed to the outside world until
1962, when an army coup overthrew the last Iman and declared the formation of the YAR. South Yemen
had been under British rule for a century and a half, with the port of Aden serving as an entrepot for British
trading interests, until nationalist forces took over in 1967. PDRY became an independent country in 1970.
1.2       The unified Government had designated 1990-92 as a transition period, during which it
concentrated on the difficult task of merging the two administrations and realigning the two economic
systems. The transition period culminated in nation-wide parliamentary elections in April 1993. However,
serioui difficulties arose leading to civil war from May to July 1994. Following the cessation of hostilities
a coalition government was formed that is supportive of the current reform program.
1.3       To achieve sustainable growth and alleviate poverty, the Government has iecognized that a new
development strategy is required. Given the inadequacies of the public sector and poor public finances, the
source of growth for the future would be the private sector. Accordingly, the strategy for the modernization
and development of the economy would be based upon a reduced role of the public sector, the development
of the private sector, and export diversification.
B. Economic Reform Program
1.4      In an effort to deal with the country's substantial econeonic problems, the Government is
implemen,ing a comprehensive program of economic stabilization and structural adjustment with support from
IDA and the IMF. In designing the economic reform program, the Government considered a number of
factors. Central among them are: managing the fiscal dinmensions and consequences of the reform measures,
stimulating a private sector supply response (that is, increased output and employment), and increasing
economic efficiency. Within this framework, the Government's program focuses on three main areas:
(a) stabilization to restore macroeconomic balance and reduce inflation; (b) structural reform and adjustment
to stiimiulate medium- and long-term economic growth; and (c) social protection measures to minimize the
negative impact on the vulnerable an(d the poor during adjustment. The imnplementation of the early phases
of structural reforms would be supported by the Economic Reform Credit (ERC) (Credit No. 2840-YEM,
approved on April 9, 1996). Mitigation of potential adverse effects of adjustment over the medium-term is
to be achieved through different initiatives, including the Public Works Project and a proposed Social Fund
Project. These initiatives would aim at social protection, delivery of social services to communities, and job
creation.

C. Rationale For IDA Involvement
1.5       The Project is fully consistent with the Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
Yemen, presented to the Board on February 20, 1996. Economic reforms and poverty alleviation are among
the key thrusts of the CAS. During its implementation, the Project would also, to the extent feasible,
integrate the findings and recommendations of the Poverty Assessment study that is being prepared by using
the data to be generated on the poverty profile, characteristics of the poor, and geographical distribution of
poverty. The Project also complements ongoing and proposed IDA projects by providing infrastructure
services and improving environmental and sanitary conditions. The Project, moreover, builds on the
Emergency Recovery Project (Credit No. 2840-YEM) in Yemen as well as the experience in social funds and
small public works programs in other countries. Further, the framework provided by the Project can play
a catalytic role in attracting donor financing.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.1        The overall objective of the project is to mitigate potential adverse effects of economic
adjustment. Specific objective is to generate an estimated 75,000-96,000 work-months of employment at a
cost range of US$260 to US$350 per work-month. It is also expected that the project would help deliver
much needed infrastructure services, improve environmental and sanitary conditions and enhance community
participation in preparing and implementing sub-projects for civil works. Achievement of the project's
development objective will be monitored through performance indicators and the findings will be reflected
in quarterly progress reports and in quarterly audits.
B. Project Description
2.2       The project would comprise:
(a)    small scale civil works in areas with above average unemployment rates for rehabilitation
and/or extension in the following sectors: (i) waste management: waste water collection
systems and storm water drains; cleaning of such systems; and solid waste collection and
sanitary landfills; (ii) urban development: water distribution systems; repairing and
paving (cobblestones) streets and footpaths; storm water drainage; flood protection; (iii)
rurai development: road repairs; water supply systems; cleaning and repairing of
irrigation canals; (iv) soil conservation: terracing and drainage works; small dams; and
(v) health and education: health centers and school buildings.
(b)    development of a project management capability comprising a Steering Committee (SC)
and a Project Management Unit (PMU) to be funded as the executive arm of the SC; and
(c)    provision of technical assistance services for: (i) the establishment of the PMU:
including preparation of organizational and staffing structures; framework agreements for
project management, personnel, administration, and operation; accounting and
management information systems; (ii) investment programming, monitoring and review;
(iii) sub-project preparation and implementation: including preparation of engineering
design and tender documents, and construction supervision; (iv) support to local
consulting and construction companies, including preparation for and organization of
workshops; and (v) auditing.



Public Works Project                                                                                   3
2.3        The sub-projects would be selected according to established criteria (para. 3.13) agreed with the
Government and would concentrate on urban/rural areas with above average unemployment rates. During
the initial stages of Project implementation, the sub-projects would be derived from unfunded public
investments while a portfolio of sub-projects with high levels of community participation and NGO
involvement are being identified.
C. Project Costs and Financing
2.4        The total Project cost is estimated at US$28 million equivalent, with a direct and indirect foreign
exchange component of about 20 percent. Since the volume of civil works sub-projects would be adjusted
according to available funds, price and physical contingencies have not been applied. The cost of material,
such as pipes for water supply, is not included in project costs as they already have or would be procured
under other arrangements. The first slice of the estimated investments have been identified at about US$5
million (Annex 1), which would be completed during the first 6-12 month period of the project.
2.5        The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2.1 below.

2.6        The estimate of the operational costs for the PMU  is based on:  (i) remuneration of staff
comparable to the private sector; and (ii) salary increases and other costs to be adjusted to the inflation. The
iocal and foreign inflation rates are shown in Table 2.2:

2.7      An IDA Credit would finance about 90 percent of total costs excluding duties and taxes. T!he
breakdowns are: (a) 100 percent of the costs for project management; (b) on an average, 90 percent of civil
works contracts for proposed sub-projects; (c) 100 percent of foreign  and local (ex-factory costs)
expenditures and for items to be procured locally 95 percent of expenditures (net of taxes) for goods and
equipment; and (d) 100 percent of services to be provided by individual consultants and consulting firms,
NGOs and auditing firms.
2.8      For sub-projects at an advanced stage of preparation, contracts are expected to be awarded with
expenditures to be incurred prior to Credit effectiveness, for which retroactive financing corresponding to
5 percent of the Credit amount, or US$1.25 million, is proposed. This would be in addition to an advance
under the Project Preparation Facility, up to an amount of US$1.5 million which has been approved to
cover expenditures, including civil works costs prior to Credit effectiveness. The breakdown of costs and
the financing plan are shown in Table 2.3. During negotiations, Government gave assurances that it would
finance the difference between the Project costs and the IDA Credit, estimated at US$3 million equivalent,
and that it would allocate the annual budget for the Project prior to February I each year for use by the
PMU as needed.

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Procurement
3.1      Procurement of goods and works would be in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits of January 1995 and revised January 1996. Procurement
of goods, which would be limited to vehicles and office equipment for the PMU and locally made school
furniture, could be procured according to national shopping for contract values of less than US$25,000 and
international shopping for contract values of less than US$50,000, with an aggregate amount of US$450,000
and US$250,000 respectively. National and international shopping should be based on at least three
quotations and, where relevant, from two countries.
3.2      The size of the civil works contracts would range from very small up to about US$250,000 to
be awarded according to national competitive bidding (NCB) following local procurement procedures. A
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was recently completed, and with amendments as shown
under the Project Implementation Summary in the Project File, the NCB procedures were found to be
satisfactory. Conclusions reached are summarized as follows:



Public Works Project                                                                         S
*   present system for classification of civil works contractors and restriction of bidding to
contractors in relevant categories of classification are acceptable to IDA;
*   contract amounts, where relevant, would be stated in US$ and, for payments to be made in
local currency, these would, for evaluation purposes, be converted at prevailing market rates
28 days prior to bid opening; and payments would be made according to the market rates;
and
*   standard bidding documents, issued in 1994 by the Ministry of Construction, Housing and
Urban Planning (MCHUP) would be applied as appropriate.
3.3      For sub-projects in rural and to a lesser extent in urban areas, which are feasible for
implementation by local communities or government agencies (e.g., municipalities), procedures under
community participation (para. 3.19) would be accepted. For contracts exceeding US$250,000, if any,
international competitive bidding (ICB) should take place. Following local advertisement the PMU would
prepare a roster of potential local contractors including reference material, specializations and performance
records, which should be maintained and updated as needed.
3.4      Consultant services would be used for: (i) specific short-term assignments for the establishment
of the PMU and for annual progress and performance reviews; this would include foreign and local
consultants; and (ii) the preparation of sub-project reports, engineering design and tender documents, and
construction supervision; this would be carried out by local consultants (possibly through joint ventures with
foreign consultants), and NGOs. The consultant contracts would be in the range of US$20,000 to
US$300,000. The procedures for the invitation of consultant proposals with preparation of contract
agreements should be according to Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as Executing Agency of August 1981. The PMU would prepare a roster of potential
consulting firms and NGOs, including reference material and information on specializations and performance
records, which should be maintained and updated as needed.
3.5      The PMU would be staffed by local recruitment. Staff selection would be done competitively.
The Project Director (PD) has already been appointed by the Steering Committee, on the basis of a short-list
of candidates. IDA was consulted on the appointment and gave its no objection. For other key PMU
positions, IDA has reviewed relevant job descriptions and qualification criteria, and interviewed suitable
candidates whose appointments will be subject to IDA approval. It would be acceptable for civil servants
to applv for the jobs, provided they leave their present employments to ensure their total integration in the
PMU management structure.
3.6      All consultant contracts and goods and works contracts, estimated to cost more than US$50,000,
as well as the first two contracts for goods and works regardless of value, would be subject to prior review
by IDA. This is expected to result in a prior review of about 70 percent of all IDA-financed contracts.
Given the preponderance of small contracts, this ratio is satisfactory. Of the remaining contracts, one in
four would be subject to random post review. To ensure proper application of the procurement procedures
under the Project, a procurement seminar was held in Sana'a in December 1995 and another one is scheduled
for late-1996.

3.9       The project would be implemented over a four-year period, with a completion target date of
June 30, 2000. The Credit closing date is scheduled for October 31, 2000, four months following the Project
completion date. Although there are disbursement profiles for Yemen, these are not directly applicable to
the project which is different from those executed by sector ministries. The disbursement schedule is shown
in Annex 2 and summarized in Table 3.3 below. This should, however, be considered as tentative, since
project execution will be subject to the capacity of the PMU to prepare and implement sub-projects.
Table 3.3: Estimated Disbursements

3.10     To tacilitate disbursements, the MPD would establish in the Central Bank a Special Account to
be operated by the SC/PMU under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. An initial deposit of US$1.0
million would be made to the Special Account and replenished, until US$2.0 million of disbursements have
been made, whereafter it would increase the deposit to US$2.0 million, corresponding to about 4 months'
expenditures. The PMU would submit replenishment applications for the Special Account on a monthly
basis, or when about half of the deposit has been utilized, whichever comes first. The minimum amount
for applications for direct payment and for special commitment would be 20 percent of the authorized
allocation to the Special Account. Disbursements would be made against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs)
for contracts for goods, works and services of less than US$50,000, for civil works under community
participation and for PMU operating costs.
C. Project Preparation and Implementation
3.11     Status of Proiect Preparation. The Council of Ministers has approved the project and issued a
decree for establishment of the Steering Committee and the PMU. In addition, the Government has formally
requested an advance of up to US$500,000 under the Project Preparation Facility to finance expenditures
for: (a) office facilities, equipment, vehicles and short-term consultant services for the establishment of the
PMU; (b) operating costs of the PMU; and (iii) consultant services to prepare sub-projects under the first
investment program and bring them to the stage of contracting. Subsequently, the Government made a
second request to increase the PPF advance by an additional US$1.0 million, which now aggregates to
US$1.5 million. This addition would cover the costs for initial civil works contracts.
3.12     The PMU is operational and its key staff have been appointed. An outline organizational and
staffing structure for the PMU is shown in Annex 3. The Staff Service Rules (SSR) have been prepared and
approved by the SC. The Manual of Procedures (MOP), which covers operational matter is currently being
finalized by a PMU consultant and will be submitted to the SC for approval. Outlines of table of contents
for the SSR and MOP are shown under the Project Implementation Summary in the Project File. Vehicles
and office equipment for the PMU are currently being procured. Sub-projects for the first investment
program have been identified and are being prepared by a PMU consultant in order for construction to start
no later than October, 1996. The first investment program is summarized in Annex 1.



8                                                                             Public Works Prooject
3.13     Investment programs, which will be prepared and approved on a quarterly basis, will include sub-
projects to be selected according to agreed criteria. These criteria, which are shown in Annex 4, take into
account:
*   the labor content (labor costs as a percentage of contract values); contracts to be financed
should be labor-intensive and comparatively small in size;
*   the impact on poverty alleviation regarding the extent to which sub-projects are located in
areas with above average poverty levels and/or unemployment rates;
*   the impact of improved infrastructure services;
n   the impact of improved environmental and sanitary conditions;
*   the degree of community involvement in the identification of sub-projects, and contributions
of the communities in cash or in labor; and
*   the ability of the beneficiaries to operate and maintain and to ensure sustainability of
completed works.
3.14     Project Management. Effective implementation of the project will require a project management
capacity, that will be able to serve a number of sectors and quickly respond to urgent requirements. This
would be achieved through the recently created SC and PMU, which would have: autonomous status; staff
appointed on contractual basis with remuneration comparable to the private sector; and their location in the
Ministry of Planning and Development (MPD) with the mandate to execute a multi-sectoral project. The
SC and the PMU will be regulated by the decree issued for their establishment, the Staff Service Rules and
the Manual of Procedures.
3.15     The Steering Committee2' is composed of six Government and three non-Government
representatives and chaired by the Minister of Planning and Development. The duties and functions of the
SC include: (a) approval of sub-project selection criteria, staff service rules and manual of procedures; (b)
sanction and termination of contracts for high level PMU staff, including the PD; (c) approval of annual
budgets for the operation of the PMU and investment programs; (d) review of quarterly and annual progress
reports and the performance of the PMU; (e) approval of contracts exceeding a value of US$200,000; and
(f) appointment of auditors and review of auditor's reports. During negotiations, assurances were given by
the Government that the membership of the Steering Committee and its terms of reference would be
satisfactory to IDA.
3.16     The PMU serves as the Secretariat to the SC. The PMU is headed by the Project Director, who
would be assisted by three managers -- one Financial and Administrative Manager, and two Area Managers,
responsible for the preparation and implementation of investment programs. The country has been divided
between two area managers for operational purposes. PMU staff would also include an investment planner,
a procurement specialist, a MIS specialist, an environmental specialist, and a part-time legal advisor.
Employment of the PMU staff would be governed by the SSR. which cover, inter alia, rules for
remuneration, conflict of interest, staff performance assessment and replacement of non-performing staff.
2/    The SC is composed of: Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for MPD; Minister for Local
Administration; Minister for MCHUP: Minister for Social and Local Affairs; Director for Prime
Minister's office: Deputy Minister t6r MPD; and three non-Government members. two cf whon
representing NGOs.

During negotiations, assurances were given by the Government that no replacement of the PD would take
place and no appointments or replacements of key PMU staff would be made without prior consultation with
IDA.
3.17     The duties and functions of the PMU include: (a) preparation of investment programs, including
sub-projects to be based on established selection criteria; (b) appointment of consultants/NGOs for specific
assignments, for engineering and construction supervision and for works to be required under community
participation; (c) entering into contracts for goods and civil works with approval to be given for those with
a value of less than US$200,000; (d) carrying out of annual reviews with adjustments to be made in work
approach and procedures on the basis of experience gained; (e) coordination with government and non-
government authorities and financing agencies; (f) preparation of Staff Service Rules, sub-project selection
criteria and manual of procedures; (g) entering into and termination of contracts for support staff; and (h)
capacity building for the strengthening of local consulting and construction firms and NGOs and for
enhancing community participation.
3. 18    Proiect Implementation. The implementation schedule for the project is provided in Annex 5.
Sub-project proposals would be identified at the community/municipal levels in cooperation with NGOs,
sector ministries, the Governors' office and the PMU. The PMU would evaluate such proposals as a
continuous exercise and group them into quarterly investment programs, which are estimated to range in cost
between US$1-3 million, and to be executed within a 6- to 12-month period. In formulating the investment
programs, lessons of experience derived from execution of earlier sub-projects and annual
progress/performance reviews shall be applied as appropriate. Investment programis will be subject to review
and approval by the SC and IDA. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that each
investment program. including an environmental assessment, will be submitted to IDA for approval. The
MOP will describe the preparation and implementation of sub-projects for which a summary is also
provided in the Work Program (dated March 19, 1996), presented in the Project File. The Work Program
was agreed with the Government during negotiations.
3. 19    For the involvement of communities in the execution, operation and maintenance of sub-projects,
the support of NGOs would be essential. Therefore, the PMU would prepare, and present to IDA for
review, a strategy for a greater role for NGOs and community groups, and implement the strategy, including
organizing workshops and training courses. The strategy would also include recommendations for community
participation in procurement. It is expected that, as the project progresses, the Government would be able
to mobilize donor assistance to increase the level and scope of technical assistance for conmmunity and NGO
involvement.
3.20     The capacity of local consulting firms remains uncertain and would only be ascertained during
the course of project implementation. Some training would be provided by the PMU, and consulting firms
would have the possibility to recruit non-Yemeni staff or associate with foreign firms, with the costs to be
covered under respective consultant agreements with the PMU. Workshops would also be organized by the
PNIU, in cooperation with the Contractors' Association, to help small contractors better understand contract
documents and quality requirements.



10                                                                         Public Works Project
D. Participatory Approach
3.21     The concept of the project emphasizes flexibility to ensure quick response; labor-intensive, small-
scale civil works that do not require long preparation and implementation periods; and participation of
communities and NGOs. The latter was influenced by the experience from other countries which indicates
that such goals could best be achieved through active community participation to be mobilized with the
support of NGOs. In Yemen, particularly in the rural areas. communities have traditionally participated in
civil works projects by contributing in cash or in kind. The Project builds on this tradition, but also includes
measures to involve support from a number of small NGOs, which have not to any larger degree, been
active in community-based civil works programs.
E. Project Monitoring
3.22     To ensure that the project meets its objectives, a set of performance indicators have been
developed (Annex 6). These indicators focus on the number of jobs created and relevant costs per work-
month. The PMU would establish a data base on unit costs for different works to be executed to enable a
comparison among sub-projects and a refinement of its cost estimates. The SC and IDA would monitor
project progress against these indicators on a quarterly basis, using the information obtained from the
quarterly reports to be prepared by the PMU.
3.23     The SC/PMU and IDA would appoint a consultant to carry out an annual performance review.
The findings and recommendations of the annual reviews would be discussed in workshops following the
review process, with the participation of the stakeholders. The annual reviews would focus on the scope
for improvements with specific proposals to be made regarding the functioning of the PMU and for the
preparation and implementation of investment programs. During negotiations, assurances were given by the
Government: (i) that quarterly progress reports including performance indicators would be submitted to IDA
for review within 30 days after the end of the reporting period; and (ii) that annual performance reviews
would take place each year during January with recommendations to be approved by the SC within one
month. The annual review for 1999 should also be considered as the mid-term review.
F. Project Supervision
3.24     Although the individual sub-projects are expected to be relatively simple, their country-wide
distribution and large numbers would make the overall implementation complex. Moreover, the preparation
of sub-projects with investment programs would be a continuous process during project implementation. This
would require intensive supervision, and consequently, IDA resources have been shifted from the normal
levels for preparation and appraisal towards implementation. The responsibility for project supervision
would be delegated to the Resident Mission (RM). Staff from headquarters would be involved particularly
in the annual reviews with an estimated annual input of about 10 staffweeks. The total input is estimated at
200 staffweeks.
G. Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting
3.25     The PMU, which is responsible for project budgeting and accounting, would keep separate
accounts for the operation of the PMU, for the use of consultant services, for civil works and other
contracts, and for the Special Account and Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The PMU would install
appropriate accounting/budgetary and management information systems, and  for each year of project
implementation, prepare a budget for its operational costs and investment program.



Public Works Project                                                                       11
3.26     The Borrower is not in compliance with IDA audit reporting covenants. This issue would be
discussed separately in the next Country Portfolio Performance Review with the Government. The PMU
would be subject to quarterly and annual audits by independent auditors in accordance with internationally
accepted standards. The audits would complement the annual performance review that would determine the
applicability of the procedures (as detailed in the MOP) and assess the overall performance of the PMU.
During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that auditors, acceptable to IDA, would be appointed
for a 4-year period; annual audit reports would be submitted within 6 months from the end of the reporting
period; quarterly interim audit reports would be submitted within 30 days following each quarter; and the
audit reports would include separate statements for the Special Account and SOEs.
H. Environmental Assessment
3.27     The proposed project has been classified as a category "B" project for the purpose of Operational
Directive 4.01. A review of the characteristics of potential sub-projects concludes that the overall
environmental impact would be positive. However, the environmental impact would vary among the sectors
and works to be executed. Special attention would be paid to sub-projects covering waste water, solid waste
disposal and storm water discharge.
3.28     Each sub-project report would assess the potential environmental impact of the works to be
undertaken and specify mitigative actions to be taken. During sub-project selection, any sub-project for
which the mitigative measures specified are not adequate to alleviate the adverse environmental impact would
be rejected. The PMU would prepare for each investment program a Summary Environmental Assessment
and include under its annual reviews relevant environmental aspects. The content of a Summary
Environmental Assessment is shown under the Project Implementation Summary in the Project File. To
ensure that environmental aspects of sub-projects are adequately addressed, the PMU would appoint an
environmental specialist to report directly to the PD.
I. Project Sustainability
3.29     Sub-projects, when completed, would be handed over to the sector ministries, NGOs and
communities for operation and maintenance. Long-term sustainability would thus be subject to the capacity
of these entities to maintain and operate the completed works. In the selection of sub-projects an assessment
would be made of expected future operational arrangements, and to what extent concurrent actions would
be taken on improvements in operational performance. Operational arrangements would also be reviewed
by IDA sector staff in the context of the development strategy being followed in the sector.
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
A.       Benefits
4.1      The major project benefit refers to the number of jobs that are expected to be created. An
analysis of typical sub-projects for the first investment program (Annex 7) shows that each US$1 million
investment would generate jobs in the range of 2900 to 3800 work-months, assuming a distribution of
investments in urban/rural areas in the ratio 70/30 and a labor content in the range of 30-40 percent of
contract values. For the total project, this would correspond to an estimated 75,000 to 96,000 work-months
of employment at a cost of US$335 to US$260 per work-month. In addition, it is assumed that jobs to be
created indirectly, under various activities serving the construction industry, would correspond to about 40-
50 percent of those to be created directly. A sensitivity analysis would show that a change in the distribution



12                                                                           Public Works Project
of investments in urban/rural areas from 70/30 to 50/50 would increase the number of work-months by about
10-15 percent.
4.2       Apart fromjob creation, sub-projects will provide additional benefits from improved infrastructure
services, protection of the environment and better health and education facilities. These benefits would be
significant, but it is not cost-effective to evaluate them for every sub-project. The project will include high
priority, low investment sub-projects for rehabilitation of physical assets to increase their value and return
to full utilization. Because of the small size and diverse location of sub- projects, it is not cost-effective to
carry out formal economic analysis to estimate internal rates of return.
B.       Risks
4.3       Potential risks and actions taken or to be taken for their mitigation are:
(a)     maintaining a high labor content in sub-projects to be selected:
*   selection criteria have been agreed to that labor-intensive sub-projects are chosen; the
number of jobs to be created will be monitored as a performance indicator; and IDA in its
approval of investment programs will pay particular attention to the labor content;
(b)      developing a project implementation capacity through the establishment and operation of the
SC and the PMU, which would be funded as the executive arm of the SC:
PMU staff will be appointed on contract basis at a salary level comparative to the private
sector; IDA will review and approve all appointments; and provisions will be made for
annual performance evaluations and for the replacement of non-performing staff;
(c)      avoiding selection and financing of low priority sub-projects, or sub-projects that have been
initiated under various arrangements but not completed:
*   PMU is designed to be autonomous and have high quality staff, with review of its activities
by the SC, auditors and IDA staff;
(d)      maintaining an acceptable quality of works taking into account present competence and
availability of local consulting firms, NGOs and small scale contractors:
*   local consulting firms and NGOs can use non-Yemeni staff financed under their contract
agreements with PMU as needed; workshops and training sessions will be organized; and
specifications and quality requirements will be standardized and closely supervised; and
(e)      assuring sustainability of completed works:
*   this is taken into account in the selection criteria; NGOs would be developed to assist
communities in operation and maintenance; and concurrent actions are taken in different
sectors on improvements in operational performance in the course of other donor and IDA
operations;



Public Works Project                                                                       13
In addition, implementation performance, project quality and sustainability will be assessed annually, and
adjustments will be made in sub-project selection and design on the basis of experience gained. Also, for
IDA to better assist in project implementation, the main responsibility for project supervision will be
delegated to the Resident Mission, which will enable a faster response to potential problems.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED
5.1      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) the Government of Yemen would finance the difference between project costs and the IDA
credit, estimated at US$3.0 million, and that the annual budgeted amount would be allocated
before February I for use by the PMU as needed (para. 2.8);
(b) the membership of the Steering Committee and its terms of reference would be satisfactory
to IDA (para. 3.15);
(c) the SC would not replace the Project Director or make any appointments or replacements
of key PMU staff without prior consultation with IDA (para. 3.16);
(d) the SC/PMU would submit each investment program including an environmental assessment
to IDA for approval (para. 3.18);
(e) the SC/PMU would submit to IDA for review, within 30 days after the end of the reporting
period, quarterly progress reports including performance indicators and would carry out
annual performance reviews each year during January with recommendations to be approved
by the SC within one month (para. 3.23); and
(f) the SC/PMU would appoint auditors acceptable to IDA for a 4-year period and submit
annual audit reports to IDA for review no later than 6 months after the end of the reporting
period, and quarterly interim audit reports within 30 days; the audit reports would include
separate statements for the Special Account and Statement of Expenditures (para. 3.26).
5.2      The proposed project provides a suitable basis for an IDA Credit of SDR17 million equivalent
to the Republic of Yemen at the IDA standard terms.

PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT
Sub-Project Selection Criteria
1.    The Public Works Project will cover a number of sub-projects in different sectors and dispersed
on a country-wide basis, which will be summarized under investment programs.  The investment
programs will be prepared taking into account: selection of sub-projects according to specific criteria;
the need for multi-sectoral coverage; and specific conditions for achieving a balanced geographical
distribution. These matters are addressed in the paragraphs below providing a further elaboration of the
overall project objectives, which are to:
-     create employment, particularly among the poverty groups;
-     deliver much needed infrastructure services;
-     improve environmental and sanitary conditions; and
-     promote community participation.
2.    The sub-project selection criteria address:
(a)   the labor content as a percentage of contract values, which should be in the range of 30-
40 percent and only less than 25 percent in exceptional cases. This implies:
-     the selection of works that, by nature, are labor intensive and contain a
low level of imported material; and
the preference of small contracts, where the use of special equipment is less
economical;
(b)   improvements in infrastructure services regarding:
number of beneficiaries and related investment costs per capita;
unit costs for different works to be executed with ceilings to be
established; and
assessment and comparison of benefits to be achieved;
(c)   improvements in environmental conditions regarding:
an assessment of the need for mitigative actions; and
rejection of sub-projects with an adverse environmental impact;



Annex 4
Page 2 of 2
(d)    degree of community (or stakeholder) involvement:
involvement in sub-project identification and preparation;
contribution (cash or labor) in works execution; and
responsibility for operation and maintenance;
(e)    poverty alleviation regarding:
extent to which sub-projects will be located in areas with above average poverty
levels and/or unemployment rates;
(f)    sustainability regarding:
-     extent to which proposed works form a part of a larger development program;
-     current and expected future arrangements for operation and maintenance; and
-     degree of cost recovery and need for recurrent budgetary allocations.
3.    For each sub-project a report, according to a standard format, will be prepared, which will
include an evaluation of the above criteria. These have also been summarized in a table format as shown
under Appendix 1. It is proposed that any sub-project with a rating of less than 50 (to be expressed as
a percentage of maximum score) should be excluded. The selection criteria will be reviewed annually,
taking into account the development and refinement of a data and information base, with adjustments to
be made as appropriate.
4.    In the composition of investment programs the Steering Committee should provide guidelines,
to be reviewed annually, on geographical distribution, coverage of different sectors, and balance between
urban and rural areas. In rural areas, community participation will be more predominant than in urban
areas, while in urban areas, because of higher population density, the investments per capita would be
less and a larger number of people can be reached. In some sectors, which would have a preference,
a larger labor input will be achieved because of the nature of works. The above considerations might
effect the sectoral and urban-versus-rural distribution of sub-projects, which will be reviewed for each
individual investment program.
5.    The thrust of the project should be job creation, with emphasis on unskilled workers, and thus
poverty alleviation, and therefore geographical areas with an above average poverty level and
unemployment rate should be targeted. On these matters information is rare, but some indications would
be provided through a poverty assessment, which is under preparation, and through needs assessments,
that will be prepared where justified. The information base will improve during the course of project
implementation, which will enable an increasing refinement in sub-project selection.

PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT
Reporting Systems and Perfornance Indicators
1.    Because of the large number of sub-projects dispersed throughout the country and to be implemented
during a short time-period, a well-developed project monitoring and reporting system will be critical to ensure
satisfactory project management. This should include:
(a)    project implementation schedules to cover one-year activities, to be updated quarterly, to
include:
-     preparation of sub-projects and investment programs;
-     processing and appointment of consultant/NGO services;
-     processing and implementation of goods and civil works contracts; and
-      any other events.
(b)    preparation of monthly progress reports for individual civil works contracts to be done by the
supervisory consultants. The reporting format, to cover information on physical works and
disbursements, should be finalized prior to the award of the first civil works contract.
(c)    performance indicators to be prepared for each investment program and to be consolidated
as an ongoing process for all investment programs.  The indicators should include
information on:
-     for individual contracts and for the investment program as a whole: the labor costs
as a percentage of contract costs; daily rates for skilled and unskilled workers; and
number of jobs created (in work-months) for skilled and unskilled workers;
-     unit costs for representative work components;
-      specific measurable benefits; and
-     disbursements.
For each investment program projections should be made regarding the above matters, which,
on a quarterly basis, should be compared with actual achievements.
(d)    preparation of quarterly and annual reports summarizing information under (a), (b) and (c).
These should be submitted to IDA for review within 30 days from the end of the reporting
period.
(e)    preparation of a roster for consulting firms, NGOs, and contractors with identification of
areas of competence. These should be updated as needed.



Annex 6
Page 2 of 2
2.    Annual performance reviews should take place each January/February (with the first one in 1997) to
cover:
(a)    overall functioning of the SC/PMU and performance and adequacy of the PMU staff;
(b)    adequacy and applicability of operational procedures;
(c)    overall performance in project implementation;
(d)    process of sub-project identification, including community and NGO participation, and
preparation of sub-project reports; and
(e)    performance of consultants, NGOs and contractors.
The annual review should focus on experience gained and conclude with the preparation of a proposal on
adjustments to be made. This should then be discussed in a workshop with the conclusions to be submitted,
within 2 weeks, to the SC for approval. In order to ensure independence, the annual review should be
prepared by an outside consultant, who should also be made responsible for organizing the workshop.
3.    In Appendix 1 projections have been made on a quarterly basis for 4 performance indicators - job
creation, cost per work-month, disbursements for civil works, and progress in project completion. These will
be included in the quarterly reporting system, reviewed and, if need be, updated annually.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT
Analysis of Labor Content under Typical Sub-Projects
1.    The primary objective under the project is to achieve under various sub-projects a high labor content
in order to optimize job creation. An analysis has been made for an investment package of US$1.0 million
as shown in Appendix 1. Assumptions made and conclusions reached are summarized as follows:
(a)    assumptions, based on local information, have been made regarding:
-      labor costs for unskilled/skilled/supervisory staff in urban and rural areas;
-     distribution of labor costs among relevant categories;
-      composition of the investment program in view of sectoral coverage and distribution
between urban/rural areas; and
-     direct and indirect labor content.
(b)    conclusions reached are:
-      the labor costs vary between different sectors and, in this case, average about 34%of
total civil works costs;
-     the number of work-days created is 70,900 which, at 22 working days per month,
corresponds to about 3,250 work-months;
-      indirect labor will increase the direct labor component with about 47 percent;
-     job creation through direct and indirect labor would then correspond to about 4,750
work-months; and
-     the costs for the creation of a work-month for direct and direct plus indirect labor
correspond to US$307 and US$210, respectively.
2.    An extrapolation of the above conclusions for the whole project could be summarized as follows:
(a)    because of expected variations in the composition of investment programs, the direct labor
content (labor costs as percentage of total costs) has been assumed to vary between 30 to 40
percent;
(b)    direct job creation in work-months (at projected investments of US$25.2 million in civil
works) would be in the range of 75,000 to 96,000; and for direct and indirect job creation
the number of work-months would be in the range of 106,000 to 141,000; and
(c)    for direct job creation the cost per work-month would be in the range of US$335 to US$260;
and for dirert and indirect job creation the cost per work-month would be in the range of
US$238 to US$179.
Job creation in work-months and relevant costs are included as monitoring indicators as shown under Annex
6.
