TANZANIA
MWANZA/SHINYANGA RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
I. BACKGROUND
The Rural Sector
1.01      About 14.5 million, over 90% of Tanzania's total population of
15.3 million, live in rural areas and the overwhelming majority are small-
holders. Agriculture is still the dominant sector of the economy, supply-
ing some 40% of the total GDP and contributing over 80% of exports, as well
as supporting most of the population. With the exception of sisal, both
export cash crops (cotton, coffee, cashew and tobacco) and food crops are
cultivated on smallholdings. It is estimated that roughly 60% of value added
in agriculture is still generated by subsistence production. At 17 persons
per km , overall population density is still extremely low, and rough grazing
or forested land still accounts for the vast bulk of the land area. However,
the better agricultural areas are already cultivated, and in much of the
country the infertile lateritic soils, coupled with low and erratic rainfall,
sharply limit the potential for intensive cultivation. Long-established
bush-fallow systems of cultivation for field crops continue to be widely
practised, in most cases based on the hand-held hoe. Such systems are cha-
racterized by low productivity of man and land.
1.02      Over the past ten years, performance of the agricultural sector has
been disappointing, largely due to the predominance of subsistence production
and the ineffectiveness of government technical support services. Both recent
and medium term experience indicate low growth overall, with sharp year-to-
year fluctuations associated with climatic conditions. Marketed production,
after a modest growth period in the 1960s (associated with certain cash crops
such as cotton, tea, tobacco and cashew), has been virtually stagnant since
the beginning of the 1970s; food crop production has barely kept pace with
population growth, and food imports rose to substantial levels in the drought
years of 1974 and 1975, in total amounting to some 750,000 tons of grain.
Poor agricultural performance has resulted in lower overall economic growth
and in loss of foreign exchange earnings.
1.03      Disappointing economic performance in the rural sector cannot,
however, be attributed to Government indifference to or neglect of agriculture
and rural development. On the contrary, the Government has initiated a wide
range of actions during the past decade aimed at improving the well being of
the rural poor. In its Arusha Declaration of 1967, it proclaimed rural
development as the centerpiece of its development strategy. Its first and
second Five-Year Development Plans both emphasized rural development as "the
key to the achievement of both the production targets in the Plans and the
social goal of spreading development to the mass of the people". 1/ Beginning
in 1970 and culminating in 1974, the Government launched a wide ranging pro-
gram to resettle the country's rural populations into villages. In 1972, it
decentralized government administration to 20 regions and 80 districts in
1/   Tanzania Second Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development
(1969-1974), Vol. I, p. 4.



-2-
order to tailor development programs more closely to the needs of the new
vil:Lages. In 1975, it instituted the Village and Ujamaa Villages Act, which
laid down the legislative base and procedures for the newly created villages.
With the establishment of new villages, the Government set ambitious targets
to provide essential social services. Under a Universal Primary Education
Program launched in 1974, all children of primary school age were to be
attending classes by 1977. A program of rural water supply was initiated
in 1972 to provide the entire rural population with an accessible supply
of potable water by 1991. An innovative program has also been launched to
provide all rural people with access to rudimentary health care.
1.04      The economic and social objectives of villagization were to pro-
vide basic servic:es more efficiently and completely and thereby increase
rurral productivity and welfare. The political objectives were to instill
in the rural populations the principles of self-reliance and a community
approach to development. The Arusha Declaration of 1967 and TANU Guidelines
of 1971 identified the ujamaa village 1/ as the means to achieve these
objectives. However, progress proved slow and by 1974 only 19% of the
ruraLl population resided in villages. Consequently, the Government decided
to move to the formation of planned villages as an intermediate step toward
full. ujamaa status. It shifted emphasis from collective cultivation to
"blcck farming" (in which each farmer would cultivate his own plot within
an overall block of land allocated to the village) or individual holdings
within a village framework. The pace of village formation accelerated dra-
matically during 1974, and by the year's end over 9 million, or some 65%,
of the rural population were settled in villages, with an average size of
250-300 families. The level of villagization has since remained relatively
constant, although relocation of many villages subsequently proved neces-
sary to correct for errors in siting or size of villages incurred during
the massive 1974 operation. There are presently about 7,700 registered
villages, allocated for administrative purposes into 1,828 rural wards.
1.05      The Government has thus made substantial headway during the past
decade in laying the foundation for a long-term program of rural development.
The underlying strategy and objectives have been clearly articulated. Most
of the institutional reforms have been introduced. Programs to meet the
socio-economic targets set for the rural populations have been launched.
However, for a combination of reasons the rural populations have yet to
experience fully the benefits of the Government's overall strategy. External
factors, such as the oil crisis of 1973 and severe drought of 1974/75, weighed
heavily on the Government's development efforts. Numerous internal problems
have contributed even more to the poor performance, including limited numbers
of qualified staff, rapid institutional change and ambitious targets well
beyond its limited capacity to achieve. Thus, real household incomes in rural
areas remained approximately constant from 1969-1975 and still represent only
about 40% of average urban incomes. The Government's social programs still
affect only a small proportion of the total rural population. Only 36% of
the rural population have water supply systems, 44% of eligible children
attend primary school, and health coverage remains insufficient in most
villages.
1/   "Ujamaa" is a Swahili word meaning familyhood, which conveys the idea
of living and working together on extended family principles.



-3-
Government Structure
1.06      Under the decentralized political structure, the regions are autho-
rized to plan and implement their own development programs, and are allowed
a high degree of autonomy in administration. Regional and district plans,
in principle, emanate from consultations at village level, and require the
approval of Regional and District Development Councils. The Regional Commis-
sioner is the political head of the region and holds the rank of cabinet
minister. He is a member of the National Assembly and of the National Execu-
tive Committee of the Party, Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM). His counterpart at
the district level is the Area Commissioner. All Commissioners are appointed
by the President. The regional and district civil services are headed respec-
tively by Regional and District Development Directors (RDDs and DDDs), whose
senior staff include a Planning and Manpower Management Officer. Both re-
gional and district administrations include functional managers responsible
for executing the development program in their respective sectors (cf Annex 2,
Chart C-1). Technical staff, through their functional managers, are respon-
sible to their DDDs and RDDs on all administrative matters and to their parent
ministers on all technical matters. Principal responsibility for field activ-
ity rests with the district administration, while the regional administration
provides general coordination, supervision and advice. All important deci-
sions are made by the Regional Development Committee and District Development
and Planning Committee, respectively chaired by the Regional Commissioner and
Area Commissioner.
1.07      The decentralization of government structures has served to improve
communications between the Government and the village, and between the Party
cadre and the civil service. Villages, in principle, have more opportunity
to participate in the planning and implementation of the development programs
which affect their lives. Moreover, the civil service operating at the dis-
trict and regional levels has a more integrated approach to rural development
than was possible through the central technical ministries.
Previous Bank Group Assistance
1.08      Previous Bank Group assistance to the agricultural sector in Tanzania
has included IDA credits totalling US$133.3 million and IBRD loans for US$37
million for thirteen agricultural and two rural development projects. Agri-
cultural projects comprise one for agricultural credit, three for livestock,
two for tobacco and one each for tea, sugar, cashew nuts, maize, fisheries,
forestry and cotton. The latter, which operates in Geita and Sengerema
districts of Mwanza region, became effective in 1974. The first rural
development project for the Kigoma region became effective in 1974, and a
second, for the Tabora region in November 1977.
1.09      The Kigoma Rural Development Project illustrates both the ambitious
objectives and multiple constraints facing the country's development efforts.
The project, amounting to US$13.3 million in total costs, set as its principal
objectives: (a) the doubling of the annual per capita incomes of about one-
half of the rural population of Kigoma region; and (b) the strengthening
of the Government's and parastatals' capacities to provide support services
to villages. While the project has experienced mixed progress in attaining



- 4 -
these objectives, it has provided numerous lessons for Government's rural
development program and for follow-up projects.  Physical progress is behind
appraisal estimates, as the project continues to experience delays caused by
Government's limited implementation capacity and shortages of critical sup-
plies and inputs.  The agronomic response to the fertilizer recommendations
propoDsed under the project remains uncertain for much of the project area and
verification trials to be introduced in villages and the Agricultural Trials
and Training Centier (ATTC) financed by the project have not yet established
satisfactory alternatives. The level of credit recovery for seasonal inputs
stands so far at only 35%. Progress has been disappointing on the minor
project componentis of feeder roads, fisheries, livestock and tsetse clearance.
On the other hand, substantial advances have been made on many other aspects
of the project. Some 57 villages (80% of appraisal estimates) have fulfilled
the eligibility criteria for project support, as the project has trained and
posted the necessary bookkeepers and extension workers and prepared the
required land-use planning maps and feasibility reports for each village.
The mobilization of village self-help for brick-making and labor supply has
been impressive. The system to service the village infrastructure program
has been developed and, despite continuing setbacks, has resulted in the
const:ruction of an average 5 structures in each of 45 participating villages.
The project has contributed significantly to the strengthening of implementing
institutions, particularly related to marketing, credit and input delivery,
land-use planning and bookkeeping.
1.10      Among the main lessons from the Kigoma project are the crucial need
for verification trials of technical packages at village level; for ongoing
trainLing; technicaLl assistance and institution building to strengthen limited
implementation capacity; fqr integration of project management into existing
regional institutions; for modest production targets; and for active village
participation and mobilization. The recently approved project in Tabora and
the proposed project in Mwanza and Shinyanga regions draw heavily on this
experience from the Kigoma project. While project implementation on the
Tabora project is on schedule, no substantial investments have yet been
made.

II. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Introduction
2.01      The proposed project encompasses two of the country's twenty adminis-
trative regions, Mwanza and Shinyanga, at the southern end gf Lake Victoria,
located in northwest Tanzania. The regions cover 70,500 km , or 7.9% of the
national territory. They have a population of 2.4 million, some 16% of the
national total, of which more than 95% is rural. The two regions contain the
following administrative units (Map No. IBRD 13156):
Districts       Wards       Villages
Mwanza                   6            143           642
Shinyanga                4            111          589
Table I (page 9) tabulates socio-economic indicators for each region, and
compares them with the equivalent national statistics.
B. Physical Environment
2.02      The regions' elevation varies from 1,000-1,200 meters.  The rainfall
distribution is bimodal with short rains from October to December followed by
a dry period in January to mid-February and long rains from February to May.
The rainfall is extremely erratic, however, and the rainfall pattern in any
given year is very unpredictable. Rainfall tends gradually to increase
across the two regions from less than 700 mm in the southeast, to over 1,300
mm annually in the northwest.
2.03      The topography is generally uniform with gentle undulations and
flat to depressed plains interspersed with isolated granitic outcrops. Low
vegetative growth covers much of the eastern half of the project area, while
woodlands, generally tsetse infested, characterize much of the western area.
The associations of soil to topography can be broadly classified in three
categories: (a) the range of black cotton soils, usually of impeded drainage
and, in many cases, seasonally waterlogged, associated with flat topography;
(b) the succession of soils, from the stony soils on the upper slopes through
the granitic hillsands to the less permeable sandy-clay loams on the lower
slopes, associated with ridged topography; and (c) the combination of loamy
sands to dark clay, usually of impeded drainage, associated with undulating
topography. Some 12 agro-economic Zones were identified during project
preparation on the basis of rainfall, population densities and soil topography
associations (see Annex 1, Tables 2 and 3 for further details and Map No. IBRD
13156 for location).



C. Population
2.04      Mwanza and Shinyanga regions constitute an area referred to as
Sukumaland, mainly inhabited by the Sukuma tribe. The Sukuma are the de-
scendants of Bantu migrants from Central Africa and of Hima pastoralists
from the area north of Lake Victoria.  After being orginally settled in con-
centrated villagtes, the Sukuma gradually shifted to a pattern of scattered
setitlements during the German colonial period, in response to a decrease in
the incidence of tribal warfare. The introduction of cotton as a cash crop
at the beginning of this century prompted an expansion of the cultivated and
settled areas. In the Period between the First and Second World Wars, the
British colonial government encouraged further expansion with major efforts
at land clearing to eliminate tsetse. These efflorts were subsequently
assisted by the Sukumaland Development Scheme, which led to large-scale
migrations into the western districts during the 1950s. These migrations
have continued inI recent years, although at a slower pace. While Sukuma
expansion was first associated with cotton cultivation, recent movement has
been motivated by the need for more land to cultivate food crops to meet the
subsistence needs of the rapidly expanding population. Small population
flows continue into the western districts, where soil resources, however,
cannot sustain laLrge numbers.
2.05      With an annual population growth rate from 1948-67 of 2.9%, much of
Sukumaland has now become one of the most densely populated areas in the country.
The population densities in Mwanza and Shinyanga reiions (the latter excluding
gazetted forest aLreas) are 68 and 35 persons per km respectively, compared
with a national average of 17. The resulting pressures on land are further
exacerbated by the large livestock herds - presently estimated at 2.3 million
units, or 22% of the national total - traditionally maintained by the Sukuma
for security and social reasons. Population pressures vary widely within
Sukumaland (see IBRD Map No. 13156), and important internal migrations during
the past 20 years have served to alleviate the most serious points of pres-
sure. In more recent years, migrations to neighboring regions, including West
Lake, Kigoma and Ruvuma, have also increased considerably. Nevertheless,
pressures continue to mount in the densely populated Sukuma heartland, and the
quality and quantity of cultivable land continues to deteriorate. The concen-
tration of the area's population into villages during 1974/75 has also aggra-
vated land pressures. As a result, an estimated 35% of the project area's
divisions have insufficient land to meet the minimum income, grazing and
fallow requirements of their populations (Annex 1, Table 4). Annex 1, Table 5
indicates the estimated food balance calculated in calorie supply and demand
by agro-economic Zone.
D. Economy
2.06      Approximately 4.6 million ha in the project area are available
for iFarming and grazing, of which an estimated 1.1 million ha are presently
cultivated and the balance is used for livestock grazing and fallow. The



average size of farm holding throughout the two regions is 6 ha, of which 3.2
ha are cultivated. Considerable variation in the size of average farm hold-
ings exists within the project area, ranging from 14 ha in agro-economic
Zone X to 2.2 ha in Zone III. Annex 1, Table 1, based on adjusted findings
of a survey of farm holdings during the 1975/76 season, indicates average
cropping patterns, cropped areas and baseline crop yields by agro-economic
zones. Considerable variation in cropping patterns is evident within the
project area. Approximately half of the population in the project area own
cattle, although the proportion of cattle-owning families varies from a high
of 64% in Zones V and VIII to a low of 17% in Zone III. The average herd size
numbers 20 head, ranging from 11 in Zone V to 28 in Zone X. The average
number of smallstock owned per family is approximately 5, ranging from 1 in
Zone VI to 9 in Zone X.
2.07      The rate of economic development of Mwanza and Shinyanga regions
from 1966-74 was below the national average. Depending almost exclusively
on agriculture or related activities, the annual GDP growth rate at constant
prices was 1.5% for Mwanza and 1.1% for Shinyanga, as compared to 2.7% for
Tanzania as a whole. The contribution to Gross Domestic Product decreased
over the period from 7.7% to 6.2% for Mwanza and 8.9 to 7.0% for Shinyanga.
The combined GDP of the two regions was TSh 1,831 million in 1974. The pro-
ductive sectors of agriculture, livestock and forestry all face important
constraints, brought on by a deteriorating resource base and exacerbated by
ineffective government technical services, which have, in turn, contributed
to the low levels of economic growth. Detailed technical background, coef-
ficients and specifications for each sector are presented in Annex 1.
2.08      The average family size in the two regions is 6.7 persons.  Average
per capita farm income for the two regions is estimated at US$67 (cf Table 2
Page 10), with crop and livestock production accounting on average for 66% and
34% of the total respectively. Small amounts of non-farm income are also
earned, particularly by the smallest farmers who hire out as seasonal laborers
to the surrounding large farms. Average annual per capita farm incomes vary
from an estimated high in Zone X of US$109 to a low in Zone VI of US$46. It
is estimated that about 60% of the rural population of the two regions have per
capita farm incomes below the absolute poverty level (estimated at US$73 for
rural Tanzania). The proportion of the population in this category varies by
agro-economic zone, from a high estimated at close to 100% in Zone VI (the
offshore islands), to a low in Zones V and VIII of 28%. The per capita farm
income and cultivated area of the average cattle owner in the two regions are
US$120 and 6.6 ha respectively. Only 20% of the cattle-owning population have
incomes below the national poverty level.
2.09      As in any rural economy, individual farm incomes directly relate to
land use. In Tanzania, all land is publicly held, but usufruct rights are
vested in the family unit. Since 1975, the Village Councils are empowered to
allocate all land within the village boundary. It was expected that, with the
establishment of new villages, land would be reallocated more equitably to re-
duce the income disparities cited above.  However, except whaere village siting
has caused displacement requiring compensation, no major land reallocation has

occurred within the two regions, except in Geita district.  Local policy
allows individual families to use the lands they have traditionally held for
farmaing and graziing as long as they continue to use them productively and
do not infringe on others' rights. Significant income disparities exist
within each agro--economic zone as a result of variation in farm size and
livestock ownership.  Annex 2,  Table T-1, indicates per capita farm income
by agro-economic zone and farm size. For the project area as a whole, average
per capita farm iincome varies from US$22 for farms of 0-1 ha to US$250 for
farms above 20 ha. It is estimated that roughly 8% and 2% of all farms fall
within these respective categories. Income disparities are most pronounced
in Zone X, where the top quarter earns 3 times that of the bottom quarter,
and least pronounced in Zones IV and XI, where the top quarter earns only 30%
more than the bottom quarter. Income disparities, such as present in Zone X,
correlate closely with disparities in livestock ownership. Moreover, larger
famiLlies tend to cultivate larger holdings and own more cattle. Thus, the
one--third of fami lies (representing 45% of the regions' population) with 4 ha
or more of cultivated land average 9.5 family members, own 72% of all cattle
and 65% of all li vestock, and farm 69% of all land cultivated.

III. EXECUTING AGENCIES
A. Regional and District Administration
3.01      Government structures have been decentralized to the regional and
district levels since 1972 (cf paras 1.06-1.07). The regional and district
administrations of Mwanza and Shinyanga observe the patterns and procedures
instituted nationwide. They play a major role in the planning and execution
of Government's development program in their respective jurisdictions. They
have, however, encountered considerable problems in implementing the devel-
opment programs. Annex 1 contains analyses by sector of the development
programs and administrative constraints of the government departments. Table
3 (page 13) lists, for each region, the number of staff and vehicles operat-
ing under the regional and district administration in the respective sectors.
Many staff are inadequately trained and supervised, and most vehicles are old
and of limited use. This has resulted in limited implementation capacity at
all levels.
3.02      Approximately 10% of the recurrent budgets and 30% of the develop-
ment budgets of the two regions are directed specifically toward productive
activities (cf Annex 2, Table T-2). Although four times the size of the
development budget, the recurrent budget remains insufficient to operate and
maintain existing plant and equipment, as a result of Government fiscal
constraints. Valuable assets go under-utilized and implementation of the
Government's development programming suffers accordingly. About 85% of the
recurrent budget is allocated to salaries of staff, who generally lack suffi-
cient training, transport, program and supervision to perform effectively.
The provision of the training, vehicles and programming necessary to transform
existing personnel into effective agents of development is therefore a high
priority.
B. Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB)
3.03      TRDB was established in 1971 as the successor to the National De-
velopment Credit Agency (NDCA). TRDB is a government-owned institution
with an authorized capital of TSh 300 million and paid-in capital of TSh 150
million (June 1975). Total net income for the period was TSh 11 million.
Roughly 50% of TRDB's medium- and long-term liabilities were IDA loans.
TRDB's lending operations include credit for seasonal agricultural inputs,
agricultural equipment, rural transport, storage facilities, fisheries and
livestock development and small-scale industries. Most lending has been for
seasonal inputs (about 70%) to support coffee, tea, cotton and tobacco
development. Cooperative societies and unions represented TRDB's most
important borrowers until 1974, when villages and companies (mostly District
Development Corporations) assumed ever-increasing importance. Lending to
cooperatives terminated in 1975 with proclamation of the Village Act which
disbanded cooperative societies and unions. TRDB's lending terms include



- 12 -
interest rates of 8.5% for short- and medium-term loans generally, and 7.5% -
8.5% for long-term loans with 25% downpayment for term credit.
3.04      TRDB maintains small regional offices in both Mwanza and Shinyanga
to appraise loan applications, supervise activities financed and collect
paymenLs due for the two entire regions. Together, the two have eight profes-
sional staff and two four-wheel drive vehicles. Regional Loan Committees are
empowered to sanction uncollateralized loans up to TSh 50,000 and collateralized
loans up to TSh 200,000, above which the central office must issue its approval.
Total loans disbursed by June 1977 were TSh 26.5 million in Mwanza and TSh
15.5 million in Shinyanga region. TRDB has limited staff and transport for
adequate supervision and credit collection.
C. Tanzania Cotton Authority (TCA)
3.05      The Tanzania Cotton Authority (TCA), established in 1973, is the
parastatal organization responsible for the purchasing, processing and market-
ing of all cottoni in Tanzania.  In addition, it supports extension personnel,
provides seasonal inputs on credit and undertakes crop promotion programs to
increase cotton production. Cotton production in Mwanza and Shinyanga regions
represents 86% of the national total.  TCA has two regional offices to support
this production. It administers 17 seed cotton ginneries, 13 oil mills, 14
four-wheel drive vehicles and 148 lorries in the two regions, 486 buying
post:s and has adequate storage capacity. TCA employs about 1,500 personnel in
the two regions, including approximately 160 cotton extension staff and 516
staff to operate the ginneries and mills. Following the dissolution of
the cooperative societies and unions provided for in the 1975 Village Act,
TCA has served as the primary marketing parastatal in the two regions.
D. Tanzania Livestock Marketing Company (TLMC)
3.06      The Tanzania Livestock Marketing Company (TLMC) was established in
1974 under the Bank-financed Second Livestock Development Project as a subsi-
diary of the parastatal organization, the Tanzania Livestock Development
Authority. TLMC's purposes are to: (a) organize, develop, maintain and manage
livestock markets, holding grounds and stock routes; and (b) provide for and
facilitate the movement of livestock from areas of surplus production to the
consumer markets. Mwanza and Shinyanga regions accounted for 45% of TLMC's
livestock purchases in 1975. TLMC presently operates five markets in Mwanza
and 19 markets in Shinyanga region. Average through-put per day of operation
is 60 head. It also maintains four holding grounds in Shinyanga region.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Background
4.01       Tanzania has designated rural development as the centerpiece of its
overall developm,ent strategy. It aims jointly at increasing small farmer
agricultural production and at improving basic social services, such as water
supply, education and health. To address these objectives, it has decentral-
ized government administration to the level of 20 regions and has also moved
the entire rural population into villages (paras 1.03-1.05). The Government
has turned to the Bank and other donors for support of its ambitious and
innovative rural development program. Bank Group assistance for regional
pro jects began wiith the Kigoma Rural Development Project in 1974 (para 1.09),
foll]owed with the Tabora Rural Development Project in 1977, and is now pro-
posed for the two regions of Mwanza and Shinyanga under the present project.
The two regions were selected for priority treatment by the Government because
of their relative size (jointly 8% of the nation's area and 16% of the popula-
tion) and economic importance(jointly accounting for 86% of the nation's
cott;on production and approximately one-quarter of the national cattle herd).
The proposed project was prepared from December 1975 to March 1977 by a
Preparation Team located in Mwanza town and financed under the Kigoma Rural
Development Projetct. The work of the Preparation Team benefitted from the
Regional Integrated Development Plans (RIDEPs) prepared under bilateral
assistance from the Dutch in Shinyanga (completed in 1975) and the Swedish
in Mwanza (completed in 1976).
B. Brief Description
4.02       The project as proposed for joint IDA/IFAD financing would consti-
tute the first five-year phase of a long-term development program designed to
improve the social and economic well-being of the rural population of Mwanza
and Shinyanga regions. The program would augment rural incomes by increasing
productivity in agriculture, forestry, livestock and small-scale industries;
would contribute to social welfare by improving health, education and water
supply services; and would strengthen the necessary supporting infrastructure
and technical services. Moreover, it would focus on arresting the deteriora-
tion of the regions' natural resource base, including soils, forests, vegeta-
tive cover and waiter. The program would use the recently constituted villages
as the principal vehicle for development. It would mobilize villagers to
part:icipate fully in the planning and implementation of the infrastructure and
services to be established under the program, thereby transforming the villages
into viable socio--economic units. It would concentrate on building up the gov-
ernment institutions responsible to implement the development program, thereby
helpiing to ensure effective implementation of this project and enhancing their
capacity to undertake subsequent phases of the development program.



- 15 -
4.03      The project would implement during an initial five-year period the
most immediate actions of the longer-term program and develop the institutions
and infrastructure necessary for subsequent development. It would include a
number of specific measures to strengthen implementation capacity of regional
institutions, and the research capacity of national institutions (para 4.04).
It would place emphasis on increased productivity where technical improvements
are proven and feasible in agriculture, livestock, forestry and small-scale
industries. It would simultaneously initiate steps to safeguard existing
resources from further loss of productivity and to lay the foundation for
long-term development. Because knowledge of technical improvements appro-
priate to the project area is still limited, the project would support meas-
ures - including trials, mapping, research, experimentation and pilot activ-
ities - designed to establish a broader base for accelerated productivity
and sustained development in later years. The project would also accelerate
development of the basic infrastructure - including feeder roads, water supply
systems, health and educational facilities, transport and processing equipment
- needed for the regions' villages.
4.04      The project would finance activities in the following sectors (the
proportion of total baseline costs is indicated in parentheses):
(a) Agricultural Investments (38%): Agriculture (16%), including
the production and distribution of improved planting material,
a village verification trials program, crop research, and exten-
sion service reorganization; Livestock (9%), including extension
service reorganization, range improvement research, and disease
control monitoring and research; Forestry (9%), including devel-
opment of regional, school, and village plantations, forest
assessment and management, and forest research; and Land-use
planning (4%), including the mapping and planning of existing
and new village settlements;
(b) Village Self-Help Program (VSHP) (20%): including the provision
of credit for village production projects (about one-third of
costs) and of matching grants for a variety of other village
projects (two-thirds of costs);
(c) Rural Infrastructure (30%): Road improvement (20%), including
rehabilitation of regional roads and village access roads; and
Water supply (10%), including the construction of shallow wells
and improvement of operation and maintenance capabilities; and
(d) Project Coordination and Evaluation (12%), including the estab-
lishment of regional monitoring and evaluation units; a central
evaluation unit for all Bank Group rural development projects
in Tanzania; and a Project Special Fund in each region for
technical assistance, training and technical innovations.
As will be discussed in Section C below, village-level investments in infra-
structure and tree plantations would be channeled through the VSHP. This
method of financing has been selected to ensure that investments are tailored
to the specific needs of individual villages, as well as to encourage maximum
mobilization of village resources.



- 16 -
4.05      The regional administrations would be responsible for implementing
the project in their respective jurisdictions. The project would encompass
all districts in t'he two regions, except for the agriculture and roads com-
ponents, which would not extend to Geita and Sengerema districts of Mwanza
region, where the IDA-financed Geita Cotton Project adequately covers the
requirements of these sectors. The Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB)
would serve as the channel for credit under the project. To strengthen the
Government's abililty to service villages' development requirements, the
project would improve the implementation capacity of participating government
services at regional and district levels. The project would focus on train-
ing and institution building.  Technical staff would be reinforced, upgraded
and provided with the necessary transport, equipment, programming and super-
visioII to perform their tasks effectively.
C. Detailed Features
Agricultural Development
4.06      Technical Packages (US$1.0 million).  The project would support the
widespread dissemination of the few proven technical packages available at
preserLt to improve the existing low crop yields in the two regions through:
(i) production and distribution of improved seed for maize and sorghum; (ii)
the dressing of maize and sorghum seed; and (iii) multiplication of improved
cassava varieties. First, the project would provide for maize and sorghum
seed from national farms to be multiplied by regional seed farms and local
contract growers under close in-field supervision. It would finance vehicles,
godowns, seed dressing equipment, two incremental senior Tanzanian staff, an
internationally recruited technical specialist, support staff and operating
costs. The project would provide the facilities and support the arrangements
for seed certification and subsequent transport, cleaning, dressing, storage
and redistribution for sale of the seed. At full development, it is esti-
mated that approximately one-third of the area presently under pure maize
and sorghum production would be planted to improved varieties. Second, the
project would support the incremental costs of purchase, distribution and sale
of chemical seed dressing for farmers to treat their homegrown seed retained
from the previous year's harvest. By year 7, it is expected that 40% of the
present total cropped area of maize and sorghum would be sown with dressed
seed. Third, the project would promote the widespread distribution of cut-
tings of improved cassava varieties by the agricultural extension service
which would be strengthened under the project. Five cultivars of cassava
would be multiplied at Ukiriguru Research Station and distributed by the
agricultural extension services to the cassava growing areas. It is estimated
that approximately one-quarter of the area presently planted to cassava would
be under improved varieties by year 8.
4.07      Trials (US$0.8 million).  To develop a technical base for longer-term
development and to remedy the increasing constraints on agricultural production,
the project would support an extensive program of village verification trials.



-17 -
The project would finance vehicles, equipment, two incremental senior
Tanzanian staff, an internationally recruited technical specialist, support
staff and operating costs. The village trials program would provide the
research institutions with a means to test their findings under actual farming
conditions, which differ markedly from the controlled conditions maintained at
research stations, and over a much wider area. A program of trials would be
drawn up each year jointly by national research and regional agricultural
staff. A maximum of six different trials per year would be designed for each
agro-economic zone. The trials would be carried out on farmers' fields
supervised by field staff of the agricultural extension service and analyzed
by national research staff. Presently under-utilized because of the lack of
proven innovations, the regional extension staff would provide a pool of
trained manpower well suited to implement such a program. The statistical
validity of the trials would be assured through the large number of sites
rather than multiple replicates on any one site. By Project Year 4, it is
expected that 390 field staff in the two regions would each be overseeing 10
trials of 0.1 hectare each.
4.08      Research (US$0.6 million).  The project would complement the program
of village verification trials with support for selected research activities
through: (i) research on root crops, sorghum and millet; (ii) establishment
of a research substation, (iii) prefeasibility study on the agricultural
development of southeast Shinyanga; and (iv) testing of oxen equipment. First,
the project would finance two senior, internationally recruited research
officers for root crops and sorghum/millet respectively to work for three
years within the national research system. It would also provide for the
necessary transport and, in the case of cassava, a multiplication unit. Sec-
ond, the project would support the establishment and operation of one substa-
tion to the Ukiriguru Agricultural Research Institute in the populated hill-
sand zones through the financing of vehicles, land development, buildings,
support staff and operating costs. The substation would be located on approx-
imately 2 ha of land that has been subject to continuous cultivation for many
years. A condition of disbursement against expenditures for civil works and
materials for the crop research subcomponent would be the acquisition of a
site satisfactory to the Association. The substation would undertake controlled
experimental work related to use of fertilizers and new cotton varieties on
the depleted hill-sand soils. Third, the project would finance a prefeasibility
study of actions needed to counter the serious erosion affecting approximately
200,000 ha of relatively fertile soil in southeast Shinyanga. Because this
could not be costed in detail, it would be financed through a Project Special
Fund to be set up for use at the discretion of the respective RDDs (cf para
4.18). Fourth, the project would support testing of oxen equipment for
seeding and inter-row weeding in those areas where available labor represents
the principal constraint to increased productivity. It would finance the
costs of an agricultural field assistant and one vehicle. The purchase of
equipment to be tested, as yet unspecified, would be financed through the
Project Special Fund (para 4.18).
4.09      Extension (US$1.2 million).  Central to the project's agricultural
component would be the reorganization and revitalization of the regions'
agricultural extension service, along the lines of a suitably modified "train-
ing and visits" strategy. The project would finance vehicles, equipment,
teaching materials, overseas training and travel, two incremental senior
Tanzanian staff, two technical specialists, support staff and operating



- 18 -
costs. Under the project, the extension staff would be responsible for
undertaking the program of village verification trials and for disseminating
recommended improved technical packages. These recommendations have been or
will be identified by the research program. To enable the extension staff to
undertake these important functions, the project would support the following
measures: (i) extension staff in the two regions would for the first time
take on a meaningful function by disseminating only proven technical packages
appropriate to individual agro-economic zones and by supervising verification
trials on farmers' plots to obtain information for future appropriate recom-
mendations; (ii) the extension staff would be provided a structured work
program that laid down the daily responsibilities of each agent over the
month and furnished criteria by which his performance could be objectively
evaluated; (iii) the extension staff would be subject to intensive supervi-
sionl from the ward, district and regional levels; and (iv) the extension
staff at all levels would be provided regular in-service training and the
necessary transport in order to take on effectively its new functions. The
workc program of each field extension staff would be organized to give atten-
tioII to the needs of fifteen groups of ten farmers with contiguous plots.
A special extens-ion program would be launched on fifteen offshore islands,
where rainfall and population densities are the highest and income levels
the lowest in the project area. The project would support on the islands
the extension of minor improvements for pineapples, citrus fruits and arabica
coff'ee through financing the purchase of small amounts of fertilizers and
pesticides, development of nurseries, importation of planting materials,
provision of technical assistance and initiation of trials.
Livestock Development (US$2.0 million)
4.1C      The project would aim to improve livestock productivity by strength-
ening the extension services of the two regions. It would upgrade, on a pilot
basis, 21 of the regions' 60 Livestock Development Centers (LCs) in order to
provide improved veterinary services and animal husbandry advice to nearby
livestock owners. The project would rehabilitate the physical facilities,
furnish necessary equipment, guarantee a regular delivery of veterinary sup-
plies and drugs, and train and mobilize attending field staff. The Centers
would focus on improving production of village scavenger poultry as well as
sheep, goats and cattle. The Centers would attempt to give priority to giv-
ing animal husbandry and marketing advice in their outreach work, and to dev-
eloping programs for smallstock and poultry. The project would complement
upgrading of the LCs with support to supervisory staff at district and re-
gional levels through provision of vehicles and consultant advice on program-
ming and in-service training. The selected Centers would be located near
marketing outlets to help ensure that the anticipated improved productivity
would lead to increased offtake of the livestock herd. Each Center's impact
on t'he surrounding herd and grazing resources would be closely monitored by
the livestock extension staff in coordination with the Project Evaluation
Officer in each region. An initial census would be followed by regular
monitoring of data on herd composition, seasonality of calving, calving and
weaning percentages and mortality and offtake rates. Target coverage for each
LC under the pilot program would be 40% of the cattle and 80% of the poultry
population by Year 5. This would represent 6% of the total cattle and 11% of



- 19 -
the total poultry population of the two regions. If the monitoring system
demonstrates attendant improvements in commercial offtake without further
deterioration of grazing resources, the pilot program could be greatly ex-
panded under a subsequent project.
4.11      The project would establish a range and pasture improvement program
in the project area to test new species and their low-cost establishment,
to multiply the seed of promising species and to conduct pilot programs on
village ranches and communal grazing areas. The project would finance an
internationally recruited range improvement specialist, local support staff
facilities, equipment and operating costs. The project would also strengthen
the staff and facilities of the Veterinary Investigation Center in Mwanza in
order to train dip attendants and supervisors, to design and operate a monitor-
ing system to evaluate the impact of disease control programs and to study
disease control techniques. The project would finance an additional research
officer, together with support staff, a vehicle, dormitory renovation, mate-
rials and laboratory equipment.
Forestry Development (US$2.0 million)
4.12      The project would support ongoing programs for development of
approximately 5,400 ha of fuelwood and pole plantations, including: (i)
regional plantations; (ii) school tree blocks; and (iii) village tree blocks.
The project would finance incremental field staff and vehicles, housing mate-
rials, labor, equipment and operating costs. One or two regional plantations,
averaging 300 ha in size and located where possible in forest reserves, would
be supported in each district to provide a basis for developing plantation
capacity, demonstration areas, future seed supply sources and commercial pole/
fuelwood production. School tree blocks of some 2 ha each would be estab-
lished to provide participating schools with poles for future building con-
struction and fuelwood to cook school meals. Village tree blocks of 2 ha (or
multiples of 2 ha) would be identified and financed through the Village Self-
Help Program (VSHP) upon village requests and with the village undertaking to
maintain and protect the tree crops. The project would support the upgrading
of one nursery in each district to provide the seedlings for the plantations'
program and for sale to farmers for their private planting. The project
would provide for assessment of approximately 700,000 ha of forest reserves
and public land forests through simple categorizing and mapping to enable
more rational long-term exploitation and management. The assessment would
involve reconnaissance survey, photo interpretation and forest-type mapping
and follow-up work by a team composed of one forest surveyor, one cartograp-
her, one photogrammetrist and one inventory forester. The project would also
strengthen the management of forest reserves by providing field accommodation,
transport and operating costs, in order to reduce the indiscriminate destruc-
tion of the reserves and increase their productivity and revenue-generating
potential. The project would establish a small research station under the
auspices of the Ministry of Natural Resources Development to establish suit-
able species and develop plantation and nursery methods appropriate to the
drier eastern areas of the two regions. It would financ^ incremental staff
transport, housing, equipment, land development and operating costs. Sup-
porting services to implement the forestry program would include in-service
training and a publicity campaign.

Land-Use Planning (US$0.8 million)
4.13      The project would support establishment of a land-use planning unit
in each region consisting of three field teams serviced by a central planning
and drafting unit. The project would finance training, vehicles, equipment
and operating costs associated-with the two units. Each unit would produce
village inventory maps (scale of 1:1000) with simple soil classification and
land-use overlay for village planning and management. Such maps could assist
a more rational distribution of the village's population, through establishment
of satellite settlements, and more efficient exploitation of the village's
natural resources. They would precede and support measures to align roads,
conserve soils, establish irrigation schemes or install water supply systems.
Each unit would subsequently work with interested villagers in the planning
and lay-out of any satellite settlements. It would also assist the appropriate
technical services in the location and lay-out of any village infrastructure
financed under the VSHP. Drawing upon aerial photography, each team would map
about 30 villages per year, thus covering approximately one-fourth of the
villages in the two regions over the project period.
Village Self-Help Program (VSHP) (US$4.4 million)
4.14      The project would provide for establishment of a Village Self-Help
Program (VSHP) which would encourage village self-reliance and participatory
development by supporting priority development projects of villages in both
regions. It would constitute a pilot program in Mwanza and Shinyanga regions,
new to Tanzania and of potential significance to other parts of the country.
The VSHP would have four primary objectives:
(a)  to create a mechanism for substantial village participa-
tion in the determination of needs and priorities, in
project identification, formulation and execution;
(b) to establish a means to encourage community action and
village resource mobilization by requiring a village
contribution (labor, materials and/or cash) as a condi-
tion for technical and financial assistance;
(c)  to provide a meaningful structure for the regional and
district: administrations to supply technical and finan-
cial assistance as support and incentive to village
self-reLiance;
(d) to furnish the Government with practical experience in
stimulating self-reliance and participatory development
which could be applied to other parts of the country.
4.15      The VSHIP would include procedures to permit villages to identify
their priority investments and to participate in preparation of the appropri-
ate feasibility studies (cf para 5.11). It would require villages to
undertake a contractual commitment to provide self-help resources to comple-
ment the financial and technical assistance provided under the VSHP. It would



- 21 -
support a wide range of projects initiated by villages. Self-financing
projects, defined as those which fall within the portfolio of the Tanzania
Rural Development Bank (TRDB) would be eligible for term credit from TRDB on
its prevailing terms and conditions of lending. These would include projects
such as storage and transport facilities, processing equipment and irrigation
schemes. Village projects that were not self-financing, such as feeder roads,
water supply systems, tree blocks, health dispensaries or classrooms, would
be eligible for financing on a matching grant basis from a special regional
VSHP subvote. This subvote would finance that part of the project's initial
direct costs, including materials, equipment and skilled labor, beyond the
means of participating villages to supply. The VSHP would serve to finance
village projects supplementary to existing government programs. Villages
uninterested in assuming the self-help commitment required by the VSHP could
always choose to wait for the regular government program to reach them with
its own terms and procedures. It is expected that by the end of the project
period over half the villages in the two regions would have been given the
opportunity to participate in the VSHP, which would have supported some 600
projects of all types. The project would finance: (i) four economists, three
vehicles, offices and equipment for a VSHP Unit in each region (US$0.5 mil-
lion); (ii) one additional project officer, three additional credit super-
visors, vehicles and motorcycles for each TRDB regional office (US$0.3 mil-
lion); (iii) the two regional VSHP subvotes (US$2.7 million); and (iv) a TRDB
line of credit (US$0.9 million).
Road Improvement (US$4.4 million)
4.16      The project would establish in each region a Village Access Road
unit and a Regional Roads Unit. The units would operate in all districts
except Geita and Sengerema districts of Mwanza region (para 4.05). The
Village Access Roads Units would comprise light equipment to upgrade selected
bad stretches of village access roads identified and requested by villages
under the VSHP. It would gravel and construct culverts for such stretches
in collaboration with village labor provided under the VSHP. Each Village
Access Roads Unit would service about 80 villages over a five-year period.
Each Regional Roads Unit would improve approximately 10 segments of regional
roads identified by regional authorities as most critical to the local eco-
nomy (shown on Map IBRD 13157). Each unit would have an estimated capacity
for improvement of 80 km per year and would reshape the road base, gravel
and install culverts and bridges as required, operating independently of the
VSHP. The project would finance the costs of staff, equipment, operation
and maintenance of the four units. Staff would include one internationally
recruited volunteer and three senior Tanzanians for each Regional Roads Unit
and one senior Tanzanian technician for each Village Access Roads Unit.
Water Supply (US$2.1 million)
4.17      The project would establish in the Mwanza regional water department
three shallow well construction units, drawing upon pipe-well and ring-well
construction technologies developed under the Shinyanga Shallow Wells Project
assisted by the Dutch Government (Annex 1, para 22). The units would implement



22 -
village projects, the requests for which would be formulated under and
financed by the VSHP. The combined units would develop an eventual capacity
of 200 wells, capable of providing improved water supplies to approximately
30 villages, each year. Shallow wells offer the least cost solution to water
supply wherever technically feasible and could serve the needs of roughly 50%
of the rural population. The project would finance the vehicles, equipment,
staEfing, operation and maintenance of the three units. Senior staff would
include three internationally recruited specialists. The project would also
provide for the rehabilitation of existing water supply schemes where required
and requested by villages in both regions. It would finance the acquisition
and installation of equipment and materials needed for each system. It is
estimated that about 540 shallow wells would be constructed in Mwanza region,
and 36 existing water supply systems rehabilitated in the two regions during
the project period. The project would finance vehicle, equipment and operat-
ing costs to support the operation and maintenance of shallow wells in Mwanza
reg:ion and to bo:Lster the overall operation and maintenance capability in
Shinyanga region.
Project Coordination and Evaluation
4.18      Project: Coordination (US$2.3 million).  The project would establish
within the Regional Planning Office of each region a Project Coordinating
Section (PCS). Each section would include a Project Coordinator, an interna-
tionally recruited Financial Controller, a Monitoring and Evaluation Unit (cf
para. 4.19) and support staff. The Project Coordinator would coordinate and
monitor the activities of functional managers involved in the project.
The Financial Controller would be responsible for project procurement and
would manage and control project funds. The project would finance staffing,
offices and transport for the two PCSs, storage facilities administered by
the PCSs and 24 senior staff houses. A Project Special Fund (US$0.18 million)
would be established in each region to be administered directly by the res-
pective RDD, to finance the many unforeseen needs that may arise during
implementation relating to technical assistance, training and technical
innovations. Assurances have been obtained that expenditures from the Project
Special Fund in excess of US$10,000 would be made only after consultation with
the Association.
4.19      Evaluation (US$0.4 million).  The project would establish a Monitor-
ing and Evaluation Unit within the Project Coordination Section of each region.
Each Unit would consist of a Regional Evaluation Officer (REO), statistical
assistant and support staff. The REO would report to the Regional Planning
Officer through the Project Coordinator and would be responsible for: (i)
coll(ecting, coordinating and analyzing data for monitoring project progress
to facilitate management decisions; and (ii) evaluating project impact. The
unit would give special attention to monitoring the operation of the VSHP
(para 4.14). The project would finance staffing, equipment, operating costs,
training and loca:L consultant services for each unit.
4.20      The project would also support establishment of a Central Evaluation
Unit, responsible to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), to coordinate and
assist the evaluation activities in all regions for which IDA is financing or
is expected to finance rural development projects. The unit would provide the
evaluation and monitoring work of each region with methodological support,
quality control, aLnalytical assistance and in-service training. The unit



- 23 -
would include an agricultural economist, a sociologist/economist, a statis-
tician and supporting staff. The project would finance most of the unit's
staffing, transport office and consulting costs, the balance to be paid by
the Tabora Rural Development Project (Cr. 2043-TA).
D. Cost Estimates
4.21      Total project cost, over the five-year implementation period, is
estimated at US$30.5 million, of which US$15.4 million (50%) is the estimated
foreign exchange component. Total project cost excluding taxes and duties
is estimated at US$29.5 million. Baseline costs have been estimated as of
November 1977. Project costs are summarized below:

- 24 -
4.22      Physical contingencies of 10% have been included on civil works,
vehicles and equipment; 15% on materials and vehicle operation and maintenance;
and 5% on expatriate staff costs. Price contingencies have been calculated at
the following annual rates: (a) equipment and foreign salaries at 7.5% for
1978-79 and at 7% for 1980 on; and (b) civil works at 12% in 1978, 11% in
1979, 10% in 1980, 9% in 1981, and 8% for 1982 on. Local staff costs have
been inflated at 5% a year throughout, a level in keeping with Government's
policy of wage and salary restraint. Total price contingencies represent 30%
of baseline costs. Table 4 (page 27) indicates annual project costs by year
and by subcomponent.
E. Financing
4.23      The financing of the project costs would be shared in the following
amounts and proportions:
US$ (millions)    %
IDA                                      12.0         39
International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD)                       12.0        39
Tanzania Government                        4.8        16
Villagers                                  1.7         6
30.5       100
The proposed IDA credit of US$ 12.0 million would be on standard terms to the
Government of Tanzania. The proposed IFAD loan of US$12.0 million would be
administered by IDA acting as Cooperating Institution under the terms of an
agreement between IFAD and IDA which was approved by the IDA Board of Governors
on March 31, 1978 (IDA Board of Governors Resolution No. 106), and pursuant to
a Loan Agreement between the United Republic of Tanzania and IFAD. The Road
Improvement and Waiter Supply components would be financed entirely from the
IDA credit, which would cover 100% of the foreign exchange costs (US$5.0
million) and 50% oiE the local currency expenditures (US$2.0 million). The
balance of the IDA credit and the IFAD loan would be applied in a 30:70
proportion to all remaining components and would cover 100% of the foreign
exchange costs (US$10.4 million) and 59% of the local currency expenditures
(US$6.6 million). Overall, 79% of total project costs, excluding taxes and
duties, would be externally financed which represents 81% of project costs net
of taxes and duties.
4.24      Villagers' cash contributions for village investments made within
the context of the VSHP are estimated at US$1.7 million. In addition, vil-
lagers would contribute some 280,000 mandays of unskilled labor, valued at
approximately US$0.17 million. Assurances have been obtained that villagers
would contribute a minimum of 25% of the initial direct costs. Further,
assurances have been obtained that villages would be required to contribute
towardLs the ongoing operational maintenance costs of each project, as deter-
mined for each type of project by the VSHP Board of each region. The VSHP
Boards would be authorized to fix the village contribution above these levels



- 25 -
depending on the type of project and resources of the individual village.
Funds for village credit under the VSHP would be made available by Government
to TRDB at 4% annually for 25 years, including 5 years' grace. This arrange-
ment would be subject to a subsidiary loan agreement: a condition of dis-
bursement against any TRDB sub-loans would be that this agreement shall be in
effect. Villages would pay an interest rate of 8.5% for medium and long-term
loans, the interest rate prevailing under recent IDA-financed projects. The
Government would also ensure through its regular budget that the project-
financed roads units were operated and maintained to realize their full
economic life.  To ensure sufficient project liquidity, it is essential that
Government make adequate and timely provision of funds to the project.  This
would be done on the basis of annual budgets prepared by the Project Coordi-
nating Sections in coordination with the Regional Planning Officers, and
approved by the Regional Development Committees (RDCs).
F. Procurement
4.25      Contracts of US$100,000 or more for purchase of vehicles and equip-
ment (US$3.0 million) would be awarded on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding (ICB), in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Domestic manufacturers
would be granted a preferential margin in bid evaluation equal to the prevail-
ing tariff, or 15% of the cif cost of imports, whichever is the lower. Civil
works contracts totalling US$100,000 or more (US$1.2 million) would be subject
to ICB; in evaluating bids, domestic contractors would be allowed a 7.5%
preference. Contracts for the purchase of vehicles, equipment and materials,
and the construction of civil works which cannot be bulked in packages of
US$100,000 or more would be handled in accordance with existing government
procedures which are satisfactory. The aggregate value of such contracts for
the purchase of vehicles and equipment would not exceed US$1 million equiva-
lent. Most contracts for building construction (US$5.7 million), which would
generally be small, of varied design and geographically scattered, would be
constructed by a combination of local competitive bidding, force account and
self-help. Because of the long delays in procurement of vehicles and equip-
ment, steps have already been initiated for procurement of items required
during the first year to ensure delivery shortly after the start of project
implementation. Each Project Coordinating Section would be responsible for
coordinating procurement of items financed under the project. Appropriate
staffing and storage facilities would be provided for this purpose. Orders
of the two regions would be bulked where practicable. The procurement officer
located in Dar-es-Salaam and financed under the Kigoma Rural Development
Project (Cr. 508-TA) would be used to expedite purchase and delivery of equip-
ment and material required by this project. Assurances have been obtained
that the procurement procedures outlined above would be followed.
G. Disbursements
4.26      IDA funds and IFAD funds with respect to its components would be
disbursed according to the following percentages and amounts:



- 26 -
(a) 100% of foreign expenditure and 85% of local expenditures for
vehicles and equipment (US$3.0 million);
(b) 75% of total expenditure for operation and maintenance of
vehicles and equipment (US$4.1 million);
(c) 100% of foreign expenditures and 75% of local expenditures
for technical assistance, staffing and training (US$5.7
million);
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures and 75% of local expenditures
for civil works and materials (US$5.7 million); and
(e) 100% of amount disbursed for TRDB sub-loans under VSHP
(US$0.7 million).
An amount of US$4.8 million would be unallocated. Disbursement against
category (a) and foreign expenditures under categories (c) and (d) would be
fully documented. Disbursements for expenditures under categories (b) and
(e), and for local expenditures under categories (c) and (d) would be made
against a certificate of expenditure, the documentation of which would not be
submitted for review but would be retained by the PCS and made available for
inspection by IDA during project supervision missions. Table 5 (page 28)
ind:Lcates estimated disbursements by fiscal year.
H. Accounts and Audits
4.27      All project funds except for term credit would be channelled from
the Ministry of Finance and Planning to the Regional Development Budget in
each region, where they would be administered for the Regional Planning Office
by each Project Coordinating Section. Each Project Financial Controller would
maintain separate accounts of project funds allocated to his region and would
make annual alloc:ations as necessary to the regional functional managers and
District Development Directors (DDDs). Because the vehicle capital and recur-
rent costs represent such an important part of total project costs (20%),
special accounting would be instituted to ensure the proper operation and
maintenance of all project vehicles. Assurances to this effect have been
obtained. Funds to support project activities administered by the central
ministries or parastatal organizations would be channelled through the appro-
priate Regional Development Budget and handled in separate agency accounts.
Project funds designated for term credit would be directly allocated to and
administered by TRDB, which would maintain separate accounts for sub-loans
under the project.
4.28      Accounts of project funds would be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to IDA, and the accounts and auditors' reports would be submitted
to IDA within six months of the close of each financial year. Accounts
of funds allocated to villages under the project would be maintained by
officers of the appropriate cooperative and audited by Ujamaa and Coopera-
tive Development staff.

V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Introduction
5.01      The project would observe existing organizational structures to
the fullest extent possible. It would support the institutional arrangements
introduced during Government decentralization in 1972 by building up the re-
gional and district administrations in Mwanza and Shinyanga, which now have
responsibility in the project area to implement the Government's development
program (cf para 1.06). Where possible, the project would utilize existing
staff and endow them with active and meaningful roles and sufficient resources
and support. About 80% of the manpower requirements of the project would
consist of existing cadres. The project would thus render productive an
important but under-utilized resource. Where not possible to use existing
staff or organizations, the project would support special arrangements to
assist efficient implementation. The project would thus include the appoint-
ment of eight internationally recruited staff in the two regions (five in
Mwanza region and three in Shinyanga region) and three internationally re-
cruited volunteers (two in Mwanza region and one in Shinyanga region).
Sixteen additional senior Tanzanian personnel would be appointed to the
regional staff (eight in each region). It would also establish new divisions
within the relevant technical departments in each region to implement the
roads and shallow wells components. By focussing on the institutional limita-
tions and opportunities of the regional and district administrations, the
project would help to improve the Government's capacity to implement develop-
ment programs both present and future in the two regions. Table 6 (page 36)
summarizes the incremental requirements of staff and vehicles.
5.02      The project would both strengthen and supplement the Government's
ongoing development program in the two regions. The project's agriculture,
forestry and land-use planning components would subsume all of the regions'
projected capital investment programs in these sectors, and would finance the
required incremental salaries and operating expenses.  The livestock component
would, as a pilot effort, reinforce only parts of Government's projected
program. The remaining components would be fully additional to the regions'
present development efforts. The project would thus represent mainly supple-
mental funding to the currently projected budgets of the two regions.
5.03      The project would also support a limited number of activities
falling under the administrative responsibility of the central ministries,
including the appointment of three internationally recruited specialists and
six senior Tanzanian staff. This support would be directed principally
towards agricultural, livestock and forestry research which, although located
in the two regions and important to the regions' development, fall under
national jurisdiction.

B. Project Coordination, Monitoring and Evaluation
5.04      The regional administration of each region would have overall
responsibility for the project. Policy matters would be decided by the
Regional Development Committee chaired by the Regional Development Director
(RDD). The project would be coordinated, guided and monitored by a Project
Coordinating Section in each region, under the respective Regional Planning
Officer (RPLO), who is a member of the Regional Development Committee. The
RPLO would be assisted by a Project Coordinator, who would be responsible
for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the project and coordinating the
activities of the various functional departments concerned. The Project
CDordinators would each be supported by an internationally recruited Financial
CDntroller and a Regional Evaluation Officer, each with appropriate support
staff. The Regional Monitoring and Evaluation Units will receive methodo-
logical assistance and guidance from the Central Evaluation Unit, to be set
u]? in the PMO under the project (para 4.20). The Regional Evaluation Officer
would institute and coordinate an internal reporting system on progress by
project component, initiate special ad hoc surveys as required to serve the
iniformation needs of project management and collate the mid-term data needed
to undertake project evaluation. A baseline survey in each region was con-
ducted in 1976 under the aegis of the Project Preparation Team. One of the
two Financial Controllers would be responsible for coordinating procurement
activities of the two regions where appropriate and for coordination of reim-
bursement claims before submission to the Ministry of Finance and Planning
(Treasury). All items in the statements of expenditure attached to reimburse-
ment claims would be categorized to the extent possible by part of the project.
The appointment of qualified individuals, satisfactory to IDA, to the posts
of Project Coordinator and Financial Controller would be a condition of
effectiveness. The Project Coordinating Section of each region would maintain
close relations with the office of the Planning Commissioner of the PMO, to
which it would submit written progress reports each quarter. TRDB would also
submit quarterly reports to PMO on the status of their portfolio under the
VSHP. The PMIO would have responsibility for final compilation of the quarterly
project reports for submission to IDA. Assurances have been obtained that
Government would submit a report to the Association within six months of
completion of disbursements analyzing the implementation and impact of the
project against the targets and objectives set.
C. Project Implementation
5.05      The project would generally be implemented through existing
regional and district organizations, which would be strengthened with
additional resources and funding as required. Chart C-1 in Annex 2 shows
the integration of the project into the existing organizational structures.
Chart C-2 in Annex 2 indicates the estimated schedule of project implementa-
timn. Organizational arrangements to implement each component would be as
follows:
5.36      Agriculture.  Implementation of the agricultural component would be
under the overall responsibility of the respective Regional Agricultural Dev-
elopment Officer (RADO).  A Regional Seeds Officer would be appointed in each



- 31 -
region to work under the RADO and with the District Agricultural Develop-
ment Officers (DADOs) in implementing the seed multiplication subcomponent.
Direct responsibility for the extension and trials subcomponents would lie
with the Regional Extension and Training and Regional Trials Officers respec-
tively, who would be appointed to work within the RADO's office but would
rely heavily upon the Regional Planning Officer to provide the administrative
authority over district agricultural staff necessary to carry out effectively
their programs. Two specialists would be internationally recruited to advise
the Regional Extension and Training Officers for three years in each region.
Two internationally recruited technical specialists (one for seeds and one for
trials) would be appointed. Their time would be shared by the two regions to
advise the Regional Seeds Officers and Regional Trials Officers respectively.
Short-term consulting services financed from the Project Special Fund would
be provided for the prefeasibility study on the agricultural development of
southeast Shinyanga and the testing of ox-drawn equipment. The regional
offices of the Tanzania Cotton Authority (TCA), or other relevant agencies,
would be responsible for transporting to villages improved seed and dressing
provided under the project, which would be sold through village cooperative
stores under the joint responsibility of village storekeeper and bookkeeper.
Assurances have been obtained that certified seed produced under the project
would be sold to farmers; each Regional Seeds Officer would maintain records
and accounts to monitor the costs of seed multiplication. The Crop Develop-
ment Division of the Ministry of Agriculture (Kilimo) in Dar-es-Salaam would
have administrative and technical responsibility for the research subcompo-
nents but would consult regularly with the RADOs on program policy and design.
Two specialists would be internationally recruited to implement the root crop
and sorghum/millet research subcomponents, assisted by local staff.
5.07      Extension staff within the wards would be responsible in both
technical and administrative matters to the relevant DADO, through area
supervisors to be assigned under the project in an approximate ratio of one
area supervisor to eight wards (see Annex 1, para 8). Approximately 390 field
extension staff in the two regions would be required to implement the project
effectively; this number was in place at the time of appraisal. In view of
the recent assignment of Village Managers, and the consequent loss of approxi-
mately 30% of the extension staff in the two regions (see Annex 1, para 4),
assurances have been obtained that the required number of extension staff
would be employed for the project; that if specific senior staff important for
the project had been assigned as Village Managers, suitable replacements would
be obtained; and that any further recruitment of Village Managers would take
place through public recruitment. Further, the Government has confirmed that
no change in the chain of command in the extension system had taken place as
a result of the appointment of Village Managers.
5.08      Livestock.  The livestock component would fall under the general
responsibility of the respective Regional Livestock Development Officer
and would be implemented by district livestock staff. The subcomponents to
strengthen the Veterinary Investigation Center and to support range improve-
ment research would be administered by the Livestock Development Division of



- 32 -
Kilimo in close consultation with the regional authorities. A Livestock
Research Officer would be appointed to the Veterinary Investigation Center
to strengthen its staff and an internationally recruited specialist, assisted
by local staff, would be responsible for the research program on pasture
improvement.
5.09      Forestry.  The forestry component would be administered in each
region by the Regional Natural Resources Officer. He would be assisted in
this task by a Regional Forest Officer to be appointed to each region. The
forest research subcomponent would be implemented by a Forest Research Officer,
who would report directly to the Forestry Division of the Ministry of Natural
Resources and Tourism in Dar-es-Salaam.
5.10      Land-Use Planning.  The land-use planning component would be
implemented in each region by a Regional Planning and Drafting Unit, each
headed by a Regional Land-Use Officer to be appointed under the project and
to be responsible to the Regional Land Development Officer. Each unit would
consist of three field teams, each headed by a team leader of assistant
Field officer level.
5.11      Village Self-Help Program (VSHP).  The VSHP would be administered
by a special unit to be established in the Regional Planning Office of each
-egion.  The unit would be staffed  by a Senior Economist (VSHP), three
junior economists and supporting personnel; it would draw upon technical
staff resources of other agencies as needed. A regional VSHP Board, consist-
ing of appropriate Party and administrative officials of the region, would
be constituted to formulate policy and provide overall guidance for the VSHP.
Assurances have been obtained that the VSHP Board would be established in each
region by December 31, 1978, and that these Boards would operate according to
policies and procedures satisfactory to the Association. As the size of the
program increases in each region, an Executive Committee of each VSHP Board,
miade up of relevant regional and district administrative staff, could be
established tc oversee ongoing operations and approve most projects. The VSHP
regional unit would be assisted at ward level by Ward Ujamaa and Cooperative
Development Officers (WUCDOs), who would be trained initially by the IDA-
financed Village Management Technician Training Program and subsequently by
special courses organized under the project. Village investments would be
supported by either the VSHP subvote, administered by the VSHP regional unit,
or the TRDB line of credit, administered by the TRDB regional office. Both
TRDB regional offices would be provided additional staff to undertake their
administrative, appraisal and supervisory responsibilities.
5.12      Village projects under the VSHP would be processed in the following
manner. Wards selected for inclusion under the VSHP would each be assigned
a WUCDO who, assisted by an initial socio-economic survey, would work with
village leadership including the Village Manager, where present, to formulate
individual needs and development priorities. Project requests, representing a
consensus of tlne Village Assembly, would normally be submitted to the VSHP
regional unit and the TRDB regional office for appraisal and approval. A
feasibility team would then be constituted. This would be headed by an
economist of the VSHP regional unit or TRDB project officer, as appropriate,



- 33 -
and would include the relevant DUCDO and district functional managers. The
team would prepare a feasibility study which would include: (i) a technical
and/or financial assessment; (ii) a review of the organizational and management
arrangements; (iii) an assessment of the required materials, equipment, labor,
transport and technical and supervisory services; and (iv) an agreement on the
size, nature and schedule of the village contribution to both initial and
ongoing costs of the project. The feasibility study would be presented to the
Village Assembly for its review. Evidence of the Village Assembly's approval,
together with evidence showing that the specified village cash contribution
had been deposited in a village bank account, would be required before submis-
sion of the project for approval to the VSHP Regional Board of the TRDB
Regional Loan Committee, as appropriate. Village projects once approved would
be implemented jointly by the village and appropriate district technical
department.
5.13      Roads.  The roads component would be implemented in each region by a
Regional Roads Unit and a Village Access Roads Unit, both under the administra-
tive responsibility of the Regional Engineer. The Regional Roads Unit would
be administered by a Plant Superintendent, recruited as an international
volunteer and assisted by a senior roads technician and two senior mechanics.
The Village Access Roads Unit would be administered by a senior road technician
with the assistance of a foreman. The equipment, accounts and work program of
the project-financed units would be separately maintained. The Village Access
Road Units would operate on village projects which had been formulated and
approved under the VSHP.
5.14      Water Supply.  The water supply component would fall under the
overall responsibility of the Regional Water Engineer of each region. The
Shallow Well Construction Program in Mwanza region would be administered
by a separate division to be created within the Regional Water Department.
The division would be headed by an internationally recruited Program Manager
and would include two ring well units and one pipe well unit, operating in the
field, and a central compound of office and workshop facilities. The division
would be assisted by an internationally recruited geologist and an interna-
tionally recruited volunteer workshop master. The Shallow Well Construction
Program would respond to village requests forwarded under the VSHP. The
rehabilitation programs and support services financed by the project would
be administered by each Regional Water Engineer. Accounts, vehicles,
equipment and work programs would be maintained separately for the Shallow
Well Construction Program.
5.15      Staffing.  In addition to the 6 senior staff for project coordina-
tion (para 5.04), 30 senior staff would be appointed elsewhere under the
project. This number of senior staff, to be recruited over a two-year
period, would represent an increment of approximately 10% over the number of
existing senior staff in the two regions. Table 7 (page 37) summarizes the
incremental senior staff to be financed by the project. The timely recruit-
ment and posting of all senior staff would be critical to effective project
implementation. All recruitment of senior staff would be conducted on the
basis of detailed job descriptions, which are incorporated in the relevant



- 34 -
working papers for implementation (see Annex 3). This recruitment has already
been initiated. Assurances have been obtained that qualified and experienced
individuals would be appointed to all senior staff posts listed in Table 7
(page 37). Moreover, it was agreed that internationally recruited staff
provided under the project would be employed on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Association, and assurances were obtained that:
(a) the following key positions be filled not later than December 31,
1978: the Trials, Extension and Training, and Seeds Officers in
each region and their internationally recruited advisors; the
EvaluatiLon Officer, Senior Economist (VSHP) and Forest Officer
in each region; and the Program Manager for the Shallow Well
Construction Program in Mwanza Region; and
(b)  the following positions be filled not later than July 31, 1979:
the Plant Superintendent for the Regional Roads Unit and the
roads technician for the Village Access Roads Unit; the Regional
Land-Use Officer; the geologist and workshop master for the Mwanza
Shallow Well Construction Program; and the specialists on root
crops, sorghum/millet and range improvement research.
5.16      Training.  The project would include the following specific training
measures for each component, which would be provided by existing institutions
or project-financed incremental staff, as appropriate:
(a) Agricul:ure: (i) provision for five man-years of technical
advice on extension and training; (ii) appointment of an

VI. PRODUCTION, CONSUMPTION AND MARKETING
A. Production
6.01      The main crops for development under the project are maize, sorghum
and cassava. Maize and sorghum production would be increased through the
introduction of improved seed and seed dressing:  cassava production, through
the introduction of improved planting materials. These three simple but
important technical improvements would be widely disseminated throughout the
project area. The resulting cropped area and incremental production in the
fifth project year (PY5) and at full development are estimated as follows (see
Arnex 2, Table T-3):
Crops/           Project Cropped Area    Incremental Project Production

Seed dressing           57          120           1.7                  3.6

It: is estimated by full project development that improved seed would apply
to 33% and seed dressing to 40% of the maize and sorghum cropped area, and
that improved planting materials would cover 25% of the cassava cropped
area. The few agricultural improvements are thus modestly assumed to gain
only partial coverage. Also, these coverage estimates apply only to areas
presently cultivated, rather than to any new areas. The proposed inputs
have not previously been taken up despite their attractive returns because
of the unavailability of required inputs at village level and the lack of an
alppropriate extension program. Farmers are expected to react favorably
because of the small amounts of additional cash and labor they are required
to contribute for the relatively high returns.  These are summarized as
follows:

6.02      Horticultural development on the offshore islands would provide
200,000 pineapple plants (of the Smooth Cayenne variety) and 95,000
citrus trees for distribution over five years, and would increase nursery
production of Arabica coffee by 20,000 plants per year.
6.03      The project would increase livestock production by reducing the
mortalities of the cattle and poultry populations serviced by 21 selected
Livestock Development Centers (LCs). It is estimated that by PY 10 some
14,300 additional cattle would be culled or sold, equivalent to 1,440 tons
of beef per year. Vaccination of village poultry against Newcastle Disease
would result in annual incremental production of about 600,000 eggs at full
project development. The improved management of forest reserves and existing
regional plantations, the establishment of new regional village and school
plantations and the upgrading of nurseries under the project would lead to
important increases in the regions' production of poles and fuelwood. The
following summarizes the areas affected and the projected incremental produc-
tion in the project years indicated:

6.04      Projections based on Tables 6 of Annex 1 and T-3 of Annex 2, of
the value of irncremental production at current market prices indicate the
fcllowing in the fifth and tenth years after project initiation:

B.  Consumption
6.D5      Most of the incremental production generated under the project
would be used within Mwanza and Shinyanga regions to meet basic food require-
ments. At present population growth rates, the regional populations will
have increased :38% by PY 10 and will require incremental food production
equivalent to roughly 822 million K Cals.  Present food production in the
two regions is estimated to generate a surplus of only 317 million K Cals
(see Annex 1, Table 5). With unchanged cropping patterns and without the
project, the caLorie deficit would therefore amount to 505 million K Cals.
Project incremenital production would result in the increase of only 200
million K Cals of food crops by PY 10. Minimum calorie requirements of the
project area would thus absorb any additional production of food crops under
the project. The transfer of food crops from surplus to deficit agro-economic
zones, both within and adjacent to the project area, would continue, but the
project would result in no significant export to other parts of the country
or abroad.
6.06      The multiplication and distribution of improved cassava varieties
would potentially generate an incremental 90,000 tons of dry cassava chips by
PY 11 on about two-thirds of the area presently planted to cassava. However,
a maximum incremental production of only 30,000 tons has been assumed, as
demand may taper off when about one-quarter of the area presently under
cassava cultivation takes up the improved varieties. It is expected that
the increased cassava yields would lead to some transfer of land to cotton or
fallow, both of which would produce benefits that have not been quantified
here.
6.07      It is expected that the increase in commercial offtake associated
with each Livestock Development Center (LC) under the project would be easily
absorbed by the expanding domestic beef market. Increased cattle production



- 41 -
from each LC catchment area is estimated to lead to the following annual con-
sumption levels at full development: (i) about 200 cows/heifers (more than
36 months) consumed at village level and (ii) 1,150 bulls/steers and 500
cows/heifers (more than 36 months) sold for slaughter within the project
area or for export from the area. The local demand for fuelvood and poles
would exceed the relatively small incremental production of forest products
under the project (cf Annex 1, para 14).
C. Marketable Surplus
6.08      The bulk of food crops produced under the project is expected
to be retained by participating farmers for home consumption. However, a
portion of the cassava, sorghum and maize harvest would be marketed where
farmers experienced surplus production or immediately required cash.
Marketable surplus would be sold mostly through unofficial channels, where
buying prices tend to be higher (cf Annex 1, Table 6). Increased cattle
production under the project would be marketed principally through local
traders buying at village level. Traders would, in turn, sell the cattle
either through the markets administered by the Tanzania Livestock Marketing
Corporation (TLMC) and located adjacent to selected LCs, or through unofficial
marketing channels.
6.09      Fuelwood, poles and charcoal produced under the project would be
subject to a variety of marketing arrangements. Poles from village and
school tree blocks and fuelwood from village tree blocks would be sold
within the village at prevailing market prices. Fuelwood from school tree
blocks would be used to cook the pupils' hot meals. Fuelwood, charcoal and
poles from the regional plantations and forest reserves would be sold by the
Regional Department of Natural Resources Development at fixed stumpage
rates, to be revised under the project to reflect more fully their real
economic value. It is expected that most fuelwood would be purchased by
villagers and most charcoal by urban dwellers.

VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Financial Analysis
Financial Return to Participating Farmers
7.01      The project would support a limited number of available and proven
technical packages for crop development for widespread adoption irrespective
oi farm size or income.  The financial benefits of the individual technical
improvements are indicated in Table 7 of Annex 1.  The relatively detailed
farm budget data available indicate a broad similarity of cropping patterns
among different: farm sizes so that the rate of uptake by farm size category
is difficult to predict. Any estimate of number of project beneficiaries
would therefore be subject to a wide margin of error. The project would,
however, provide for special efforts to encourage adoption among targetted
lc,w-income farmers.
7.02      Selected farm models for families cultivating less than 3 ha of
land have been prepared as indicated in Table T-4 of Annex 2. These models
assume that the full technical packages available under the project would be
applied to all relevant crops for the selected farm sizes and agro-economic
zones. Incremental per capita annual crop incomes thus generated average
US$5 and vary from US$1 to US$11. During the year of adoption, percentage
increase in per capita crop incomes resulting from the project varies from 9
to 32%, and averages approximately one-quarter. The financial returns on
the proposed inputs to individual beneficiaries as indicated in para 6.01
are very high.
7.03      Financial models have been prepared for two types of cattle-owning
hou-seholds to take up the livestock investments: (i) the average cattle-
owning household possessing 20 head of cattle and cultivating 6.6 ha; and
(ii) the smallholder cattle-owning household owning 13 head of cattle and
cu:Ltivating less than 3 ha. Table T-5 of Annex 2 summarizes the two finan-
cial models. At full development, the average household shows a project-
induced incremental per capita annual livestock income of US$6, or 10%; the
smallholder household of US$5, also 10%. The financial rates of return are
35%2 and 36% respectively.
B. Targetted Benefits and Beneficiaries
7.04      The project is designed to fit closely the Government's rural
development straLtegy. It aims to strengthen the Government's regional and
district administrative structures following decentralization in order to
provide effective services to the rural populations of the project area. It
sets out to build up the recently formed villages as the principal vehicles
for socio-economic development. It intends to augment the incomes of the two



- 43 -
regions' populations by supporting whatever productive improvements are avail-
able for prompt dissemination and by fostering research and testing of new
technical packages as a basis for future development. It would improve the
nutritional standards of the growing rural poor by intensifying productivity
of the regions' basic food crops without further deteriorating the regions'
soil resources. It aims to assist the Government's social programs by sup-
porting health, education and water projects when requested and supported
by interested villages.
7.05      Production benefits under the project would be distributed 75% from
the agricultural component, 15% from the livestock component and 10% from the
forestry component. Although it is impossible to predict the number and type
of farmers who would benefit from the project with any precision (cf para
7.01), the project does aim to benefit the poorest section of the population.
The principal means available to channel project benefits would be an effec-
tive extension service through the strategy of programming extension visits
to selected groups of ten farmers with contiguous plots (cf Annex 1, para 8).
The targetted beneficiaries for the agricultural component would be farm
families earning per capita incomes of TSh 300 (about US$35) or less, which
is approximately half of the national poverty level and the project area's
average per capita income. This group numbers approximately 540,000, or about
one-quarter of the present population. Agro-economic Zones designated for
concentration would be Zones II, III, VI, IX, and XII, each containing 20-80%
of the targetted population. Table 8 (page 49) indicates the distribution of
the targetted beneficiaries by agro-economic zone and farm size. The culti-
vated farm area of the targetted population are generally less than 2 ha and
family size averages 5.4. The project would aim to increase per capita crop
income of the targetted beneficiaries by an average of approximately one-
quarter.
7.06      The livestock component would upgrade the veterinary and animal
husbandry services of 21 Livestock Development Centers (LCs), whose area of
coverage encompasses about 276,000 people (12% of the population), 315,000
cattle (14% of the cattle population) and approximately 315,000 poultry. The
project would aim to affect 40% of the cattle and 80% of the poultry covered
by the upgraded LCs. This would benefit approximately 50,000 people for the
cattle and 220,000 people for the poultry activities. The project would place
special emphasis on improved poultry productivity, whose benefits would be
shared by small and large farmers alike. However, the bulk of the benefits of
the livestock component would not benefit small farmers, who generally do not
own cattle (cf para 2.08). The livestock component is included more to serve
the country's production objectives than equity objectives. Possessing some
25% of the country's cattle population, the two regions control a valuable
national asset whose productivity deserves whatever support the project can
provide.  However, because the increased offtake of cattle is not assured, the
livestock component is proposed on a pilot basis only.
7.07      If the targets summarized above were achieved, the estimated number
of direct project beneficiaries would be approximately 700,000 persons, over
90% of whom would have incomes below the estimated national poverty income
level (US$73).

7.08     3At full development, the forestry component is estimated to generate
140,000 m of fuelwood and poles. Although a small amount of production
would be owned, imanaged and used by villages, most would be managed by the
regional forestry departments and sold to private traders or users.
7.09      The project, through the Village Self-Help Program, would support
the development of socio-economic infrastructure and services at village
level (cf para 4.14). The number and type of projects would depend entirely
on the needs expressed and resources committed by individual villages.
Possibilities include, inter alia, upgrading village access roads and health
dispensaries; constructing classrooms, water supply systems, irrigation
systems, village godowns and shops; and purchasing maize mills and lorries.
C. Economic Analysis
Economic Rate of Return
7.11)     The economic analysis of the project included the following project
components: agr:iculture, livestock, forestry, roads, land-use planning and
project monitoring and coordination.  Although not immediately productive, the
research and trials elements of the agriculture, livestock and forestry com-
ponents were included in the rate of return analysis as an integral part of
the project's productive objectives. The analysis excludes social service
costs and benefits - mainly the health, education and water supply investments
projected for the water supply and Village Self-Help Program (VSHP) compo-
nent:s - for which adequate indicators of project benefits were not available.
These components would not contribute directly to the productive objectives of
the project, but their inclusion is consistent with the Government's general
development strategy and would contribute significantly to the viability of
the newly established villages on which the productive components depend.
7.11]     The anallysis estimates the incremental benefits which would arise
fromi the project activities, on the assumption that, without the project,
prodiuction levels in each sector would remain constant; in fact, the level
of production in the absence of the project would more probably decline as
a result of progressive deterioration of the basic land resources through
overgrazing, soil erosion and diminishing soil fertility.
7.12      The relevant components have been analyzed separately over a 25-
year period, generating the following rates of return:
(a)  Agriculture              51%
(b)  Livestock                12%
(c)  Forestry                 18%
(d)  Regional Roads           15%



- 45 -
The overall rate of return for the project is 21%. The relatively high
overall rate of return is due to the predominance of the agricultural com-
ponent is the analysis. The project's agricultural activities result in
substantial net benefits because: (i' they aim to rely heavily on existing
resources (i.e., agricultural field sW72ff) at small incremental cost; and
(ii) ti y lead to important increases in production with only marginal
increases in on-farm costs (cf para 6.01).
7.13      The local cost element has been transformed into border prices by
the Standard Conversion Factor (SCF) for Tanzania of 0.70. This is the equiva-
lent to applying the shadow exchange rate for Tanzania of TSh 12.00 = US$1.00,
instead of the official rate of TSh 8.30 = US$1.00. Project costs have been
assumed to continue after the fifth project year (PY5) on the following basis:
recurrent costs would continue at the level of PY5 for the appropriate period,
20% of vehicles would be replaced annually after PY5, all trials and research
would terminate by the tenth year after project initiation, and evaluation
would continue through year six. Unskilled labor, including incremental farm
labor, has been shadowpriced at TSh 5.00 per man-day, or 30% of the present
official rate. On the basis of prevailing market rates, the same wage rate
has been calculated for both the labor surplus and labor deficit zones of the
project area. The incremental labor demand generated by the project is con-
sidered to be relatively small and spread throughout the agricultural season
and therefore would not lead to labor shortages or increased wage rates.
7.14      Local market prices, adjusted for transport costs as appropriate,
have been used in the economic analysis for most commodities produced under
the project and for which no international markets exist. The sorghum and
maize produced under the project, although internationally traded commodities,
have been valued at local prices for the following reasons. It is expected
that incremental production resulting from the project would be fully ab-
sorbed in local markets, given the small existing surplus of food crops in
the project area and the heavy incremental demand anticipated from continuing
population growth and increased demand. In the absence of the project, such
incremental production would most probably be supplied through projection
surpluses generated elsewhere in Tanzania. Given the country's recent per-
formance in and future prospects for the agricultural sector, it appears most
realistic to value incremental output generated by the proposed project on the
assumption that Tanzania will re-attain self-sufficiency in foodgrains in the
medium term. Maize and sorghum have thus been valued at prevailing local
prices plus a mark-up to reflect transport and handling costs incurred in
supplying the needed foodgrains from more distant production in the absence
of the project. All economic prices are indicated in Annex 1, Table 6.
Sensitivity Analysis and Project Risk
7.15      The sensitivity of the project's rates of return (in %) would be
as follows:



- 46 -
Costs              Benefits          Base Estimate

Agriculture        51        41    29       64    84    38    17         59
Livestock          12         3   -20       19    28      1   -20        25
Forestry           18        14    11       21    26    14      7        12
Regional Roads    15          9     2       21    30      8   -15        27
Overall            21        16     9       27    35    14      0        26
The greatest risk confronting the project is the possible inability of the
government administrations to implement the proposed program in a timely and
effective manner. The current problems of morale, discipline, training,
supervision programming and mobility of government personnel could, unless
remedied by the proposed project, stymie the proposed development efforts.
The continuing rotation of personnel and modification of institutions by
Government are other potentially destabilizing factors. However, despite
the risks of limited implementation capacity frequently experienced in
Tanzania, the proposed project fully deserves support. The project sets
out to achieve modest targets as part of a long-term development program.
A limited number of agricultural improvements would be supported, each with
high profitability for participating farmers, and with widespread applicability.
A number of specific measures have been proposed to boost the implementation
capacity of government institutions. Furthermore, the project is designed
to absorb the risks of poor implementation capacity if needed. For example,
if the number of extension staff continued at the level immediately following
the recruitment of Village Managers in early 1978 (cf para 5.07), instead of
returning to the level at the time of appraisal, it is estimated that the
rate of return for the agricultural component would fall to 41% and, for the
project as a whole, to 18% as a result of reduced uptake of the technical
packages. With one- and two-year lags in project implementation, the overall
rate of return would still be 16% and 14% respectively. With a 50% decrease
in the crop benefits, resulting from poor farmer uptake due to a continuing
poor input supply or inadequate extension program, the overall rate of return
would still be 10%.
D. Cost Recovery and Fiscal Impact
7.16      The project aims to support development of basic economic and social
services in the two regions while minimizing the Government's fiscal burden
for such services. This would be brought about, inter alia, by requiring
beneficiaries, where possible, to make a substantial contribution to project



- 47 -
investments (cf para 4.23). The proposed VSHP would support establishment of
village infrastructure on the basis of least cost and substantial beneficiary
contribution. Self-financing village investments would be funded by TRDB,
and through the terms of the subloan (cf para 4.24), the full costs would be
recovered. All productive inputs financed under the project - improved seeds
and seed dressing for agriculture, drugs and supplies for livestock and
seedlings for forestry - would be sold on a cash basis. Sales prices would be
set to recover a majority of the real economic value of each item, and cash
receipts would revert to individual revolving funds to finance future years'
production.
7.17      The project would, during its five-year life, represent only a
modest additional fiscal burden to the Government. The average annual proj-
ect cost (including contingencies) would be 23% of the total 1978/79 budgets
of Mwanza and Shinyanga regions. Since only 25% of this incremental cost
would be financed by the Government, the average annual incremental fiscal
burden to Government would be only 6% of the total 1978/79 budget for the
two regions. While the present recurrent budget for the two regions would
most likely remain unaffected by the project, parts of the development budget
are expected to be replaced by proposed project activities. For example, the
agriculture, forestry and land-use planning sectors would have no development
budget additional to the funds allocated under the proposed project. The
Government's annual fiscal obligation in such sectors arising from the project
would represent only about half of the allocated development budget for the
same sectors. The Government's fiscal burden would also be reduced when many
project costs are recovered directly from beneficiaries as outlined in para
7.16.
7.18      The incremental fiscal burden after completion of the project would
be approximately TSh 30 million, or US$3.6 million per annum. This represents
approximately 13% of the total 1978/79 budgets for the two regions, and
approximately TSh 13 (US$1.5) per beneficiary of the long-term development
program, of which the first five years would be financed under the project.
E. Environmental Impact
7.19      The proposed project would have a positive impact on the natural
environment of the two regions. The agricultural component would promote
technical improvements which, unlike artificial fertilizers or pesticides,
induce no adverse ecological effects. The research on range improvement to
be supported under the livestock component would hopefully lead to improved
grazing resources which would, in turn, relieve pressure on the overgrazed
natural vegetative cover. Without such improvements in the grazing resource
and increases in offtake rates, the increases in livestock productivity
supported by the project would lead to further deterioration of the natural
resource base. The forestry component would have a positive effect on the
ecology of the project area by arresting the destruction of forest reserves



- 48 -
in the western areas and re-establishing forest plantations in the remaining
areas. Such measures would contribute to general ecological stability, pro-
tect valuable watersheds and impede accelerating soil erosion. The land-use
planning component would, through its aerial photographic interpretation and
village mapping, provide for more rational land-use planning and management,
which could help tco safeguard the regions' soil, water and forestry resources.
The water supply component would improve not only the accessibility but also
the quality of domestic water for participating villages. The monitoring and
evaluation component would assess on a continuing basis the project's environ-
mental impact and signal any adjustments required.

distribution. It is assumed that over half of Zone VI's population
would be included as targetted beneficiaries: i.e., at least 15,000
holdings and 66,000 persons. Inclusion of these estimates would bring
the overall percentages of holdings and population in the targetted group
to 32% and 24% respectively.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained on the following
principal points:
(a) individual expenditures from the Project Special Fund in each
region in excess of US$10,000 would be made only after con-
sultation with IDA (para 4.18);
(b) villages participating under the VSHP would be required to
contribute both to the initial costs and to the operation
and maintenance costs of VSHP projects (para 4.24). Further,
the VSHP Boards would be established by December 31, 1978
and operate under policies and procedures satisfactory to
IDA (para 5.11);
(c) an adequate system would be instituted to record the operation
and maintenance of all vehicles financed under the project
(para 4.27);
(d)  the number of extension workers would be maintained at the
level required for the project (para 5.07); and
(e) certified seed produced under the project would be sold to
farmers (para 5.06).
8.02      Assurances were also obtained during negotiations that qualified
and experienced :Lndividuals would be appointed to:
(a) key poSitions listed in para 5.15(a) not later than
December 31, 1978; and
(b) the positions listed in para 5.15(b) not later than
July 31, 1979.
8.03      A condiLtion of effectiveness of the proposed credit would be the
appointment of qualified and experienced individuals to the posts of Project
Coordinator and F7inancial Controller in each region, satisfactory to IDA
(para 5.04).
8.04      Conditions of disbursement would be:
(a) for expenditures on civil works and materials for the crop
research subcomponent, the acquisition of a site satisfactory
to IDA, for the Mwanza substation to the Ukiriguru Agricultural
Research Institute (para 4.08); and
(b) for the TRDB credit subcomponent of the VSHP, the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement between the Borrower and TRDB shall be in force
and effect (para 4.24).



- 51 -
8.05       With the above assurances and conditions, the proposed project would
constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$12.0 million on standard
terms to the Government of Tanzania.

TANZANIA
MWANZA/SHINYANGA RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Technical Background, Coefficients and Specifications
A. Agriculture
Background
1.        The agricultural sector is seriously constrained by both physical
and demographic factors. Agricultural production in the project area is
affected by erratic rainfall, which forces farmers to observe staggered
planting dates. Moreover, in areas where available land is the principal
constraint, agricultural production has generally suffered from declining
soil fertility, as population pressures no longer allow for sufficient
fallow, and inappropriate fertilizers are applied. In areas where available
labor represents the major constraint, production suffers from excessive
weed growth. The principal crops cultivated in the project area, many of
which are intercropped, are cotton (320,000 ha), maize (330,000 ha), cassava
(220,000 ha), sorghum/millet (340,000 ha), legumes (210,000 ha), sweet
potatoes (50,000 ha) and rice (15,000 ha). Table 1 summarizes the estimated
baseline yields and cropping patterns for each agro-economic zone, the prin-
cipal features of which are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. A land balance
analysis for each zone and the two regions as a whole (Table 4) indicates that
35% of the project area's divisions have insufficient land to meet the minimum
income, grazing and fallow requirements of their populations.
2.        Cotton represents the major cash crop, with annual  lint produc-
tion of 26,300 tons in 1975/76, but production has fallen from peak levels
of 73,000 tons in 1966/67 due to decreasing yields and cultivated area. The
IDA-financed Geita Cotton Project was instituted in Geita and Sengerema dis-
tricts in 1972 to improve cotton production but has thus far been able to
register only marginal impact. Soil fertility has decreased and input costs
have increased in recent years such that no financially viable improved
technical packages exist for cotton in most of Sukumaland. Cassava production
in much of the region, on the other hand, has increased considerably due to
the mounting calorie requirements of the regions' growing populations. Only
35% of the 12 agro-economic zones register significant surplus food production,
while 25% experience calorie deficits (cf Table 5). Minimal use is made of
maize seasonal inputs for agriculture, and yields remain low for all crops.
3.        The Government's technical services in the productive sectors
involve significant numbers of staff but are generally ineffective. In agri-
culture, the project area is served by the national Agricultural Research
Institute at Ukiriguru which is responsible for the medium altitude areas



ANNEX 1
Page 2
of Tanzania. Its research program broadly covers cotton, food crops and soil
fertility. Its most important contribution has been the provision of cotton
varieties well adapted to most of Sukumaland. It has also undertaken a valu-
able series of long-term experiments on soil fertility, but has contributed
little to the development of food crops apart from breeding of composite
maize varieties suited to the wetter western areas of the two regions.
4.        The agricultural extension service in the two regions comprises
staff of both the Ministry of Agriculture (Kilimo) and the Tanzania Cotton
Authority (TCA), administered by the District Agricultural Development Officers
(DADOs) at district level. Extension staff in the project area at the time of
appraisal totalled 427, including 246 in the Mwanza project area, and 181 in
Shinyanga region (cf Tables 6 and 7): however, since appraisal, a national
call-up of 4,000 Village Managers has been effected (in January and February
1978). Recruitment took place from almost all ministries and parastatals,
including the Ministry of Agriculture. It is estimated that the effect of the
Village Manager call-up on the strength of the extension service in the two
regions, was a temporary 30% reduction in the numbers of extension staff. No
change in the structure or chain of command in the extension service has been
made since appraisal. The ratio of extension staff to farm families under the
project would be that at the time of appraisal, i.e. I to 500 in Mwanza and 1
to 1,000 in Shinyanga. Virtually all agricultural staff (230 in the Mwanza
project area and 156 in Shinyanga region) are posted at village level follow-
ing the relocation of regional and district staff in 1977. However, the
extension service continues to be largely ineffective and sorely needs to be
restructured and rejuvenated. Field staff presently lack adequate mobility,
supervision, training, programming and technical packages and consequently are
of little service to the farmer.
5.        Cotton seed, collected and stored at the ginnery and later distri-
buted by TCA, is lprovided free to the farmer. Maize and sorghum seed, on the
other hand, are either homegrown, purchased and redistributed by agricultural
officers, or produced on regional seed farms or the national seed farm at
Ilonga. The overwhelming majority of seed used in the regions is unselected,
untreated and of mixed genetic origin and could readily be improved.  The
farming population use unimproved cultivars for cassava cultivation, which
could also be upgraded by introducing improved varieties.
6.        Surplus agricultural production is marketed through parastatal mar-
keting organizations. The National Milling Corporation (NMC) is the official
marketing channel in the two regions for maize, sorghum, millet, legumes, rice
and cassava. However, a substantial but undetermined percentage of food crops
is marketed through unofficial channels at higher prices (cf. Table 6). The
Tanzania Cotton Authority (TCA) is responsible for marketing of all cotton
production (cf para 3.06). Agricultural credit is the responsibility of the
Tanzania Rural Development Bank (TRDB) (cf para 3.03).

are indicated in Table 7. Crops in the project area for which proven



ANNEX 1
Page 3
technical packages exist are maize, sorghum, cassava and - to a limited
extent - horticulture. All remaining crops, including cotton have no
technical packages with satisfactory financial return to the participat-
ing farmer. Yield information on the tree crops of the offshore islands
is unavailable and would be the subject of immediate study under the
project. The following technical packages would be extended under the
project:
(a) Based on 5-8 years of regional trials, the use of
improved certified seed for maize and sorghum is
estimated to lead to an average 30% yield
increase in the project area. The increment
for maize would be 150 kg/ha of shelled grain
and for sorghum 130 kg/ha. The full costs of
production, storage and distribution of the im-
proved seed are estimated to be roughly TSh 2.35
per kg at full project development, some portion
of which would be charged to the farmer at time
of sale.
(b) The project would provide seed dressing to pro-
tect against smut in sorghum and maize. Seed
dressing would be applied to all improved maize
and sorghum seed when stored and would be avail-
able to farmers to dress their homegrown stocks.
It is assumed that, because of widespread smut
infestation, dressing would improve crop yields
20% at least one year in three for an estimated
average annual increase of about 30 kg/ha. The
cost of dressing would be about TSh 1.0/ha for
both maize and sorghum.
(c) Research at Ukiriguru Research Institute has
identified five cultivars of cassava in a collec-
tion of Tanzanian varieties that are moderately
resistant to virus mosaic and cassava mite and
also high yielding. Ukiriguru would establish
20 ha of the five improved varieties for propa-
gation under the program of village verification
trials. It is assumed that after two years of
cultivation each plant would produce only five
cuttings for further propagation as farmers select
from the five cultivars those most palatable and
productive. Yields are assumed to increase by
740 kg/ha, or 27% of the incremental yield
obtained for the five cultivars under research
conditions. The farmer would have no incremental
out-of-pocket costs in taking up the improved
planting material, although incremental harvest-
ing labor requirements would be about 34 man-days.



ANNEX I
Page 4
(d) Horticultural development for extension on the off-
shore islands would introduce the pineapple variety,
Smooth Cayenne, and would support minor irrigation
investments to increase nursery production of citrus
trees and Arabica coffee plants.
8.        The work program of the agricultural field staff would be care-
fully structured. All field extension staff would be responsible to the
relevant DADO in both technical and administrative matters, through the
supervisory staff. The senior extension worker of each ward would super-
vise other field staff operating in the ward. An area supervisor would
be assigned responsibility for supervising the extension staff of about 8
wards as well as undertaking his own more limited extension activities.
Each extension worker would select, under the guidance of his supervisor and
in consultation, with the Village Government (and the Village Manager where
present), fifteen groups of ten farmers within his area of responsibility
which he would visit for a full day at least once a month. The worker would
spend the remainder of the working month in training sessions and Party/Govern-
ment meetings. In visiting farmer groups, the worker would advise on any
improved agricultural practices relevant to the crop, agro-economic zone and
time of season. He would select one farmer of each group to undertake a
verification trial appropriate to the agro-economic zone. The extension
worker would lay out the trial plot, furnish the needed seasonal inputs and
technical advice, oversee the trials' implementation and record all activities
every three weeks on field data cards. Trials would simply test results with
and without the proposed practice on plots of 0.1 ha each. Participating
farmers would be remunerated in kind in case of crop failure.
9.        The agricultural research supported under the project would address
the following: (i) cassava research would identify high-yielding clones
resistent to virus mosaic and mite; (ii) sorghum/millet research would test
coLlections submitted from the National Crop Research Coordinating Committee
adapated to local conditions; and (iii) the new Ukiriguru substation would
test on about 2 ha of continuously cultivated land the problems of farming on
acid sandy soils,.
B. Livestock
Background
10.       The livestock population of the project area presently numbers about
2.2 million cattle, 870,000 sheep, 680,000 goats and 2 million poultry. There
is no evidence of a long-term positive trend in livestock numbers over the
last two decades, but nonetheless, there has been a trend to increased overgraz-
ing as population pressures have reduced the available grazing land. This, in
turn, has resulted in low average liveweights (about 250 kg for adult cattle).
Commercial cattle offtake is low (approximately 6%) as the Sukuma use livestock
as a hedge against crop failure and as a currency for social transactions.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
Most livestock marketing takes place at the farmgate, where owners consider
the conveniences of sale to outweigh the higher prices offered at primary and
secondary markets. In addition to commercial sales, however, dead carcasses,
hides and milk contribute significantly to the wellbeing of livestock-owning
families. Low offtake has led to retention of unproductive animals and high
average ages at slaughter (about 6 years for steers). A drought or disease
outbreak can result in a significant reduction of the regional herd. Any
major advances in livestock management can take place only if the uncertain
environment which induces farmers to acquire more cattle is stabilized through
such risk reduction measures as development of drought tolerant food crops or
improvement of domestic storage.
11.       The cattle of both regions are predominantly of the Tanzania Short-
horn Zebu breed, whose genetic potential has not yet been fully exploited
and which would respond well to improved management. The principal livestock
diseases found in the two regions are East Coast Fever (ECF), Fasciolasis,
Foot and Mouth Disease and Trypanosomiasis, with Nairobi Sheep Disease in
smallstock. ECF is the most important and is responsible directly or in-
directly for an estimated 90% of calf mortalities.
12.       The livestock development services of Government provide mainly
veterinary rather than animal husbandry assistance to livestock owners.
Principal emphasis is given to cattle, with only passing attention to small-
stock. The Government's staff of about 500 operates 60 Livestock Development
Centers (LCs) and 241 dips in the two regions. However, effective veterinary
services are limited, as supplies and drugs are generally unavailable. In
addition, the majority of dips are unoperational, inadequate transport
limits supervision and recurrent financing is short of requirements. The
Ministry of Agriculture (Kilimo) also operates a number of livestock insti-
tutions in the two regions, including the Veterinary Investigation Center,
the Malya Research Station and the Mabuki Livestock Multiplication Station.
13.       National investments in the livestock sector in the two regions
have been primarily directed at improving the marketing, processing and
"organized" production sectors of the beef industry, largely through the
Bank-financed Second Livestock Development Project. More recent efforts to
establish village-based beef and dairy enterprises, and thereby to begin to
"commercialize" the traditional sector, have so far met with only limited
success. Experience with the seven village ranches financed by the Second
Livestock Development Project in Shinyanga region has raised doubts about
the validity of the concept of extensive village ranching in areas of moderate
to high population density. It has also shown the need for strong support
from the regional livestock services if village-based livestock enterprises
are to be viable. While there still exists considerable potential for de-
velopment of various forms of village-based livestock enterprises, more effort
needs to be directed towards identifying appropriate management and production
systems, and strengthening the disease control and management support services
supplied by regional and district livestock staff.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
Technical Coefficients and Specifications
14.       Under t:he project, twenty-one existing Livestock Development
Centers (LCs) would be upgraded, where livestock extension services would be
sigrLificantly strengthened. Animal health coverage for the 15,000 cattle
serviced by each LC would reach 40% for Blanthrax vaccinations and dipping
COVe,rage, 30% for drenching against intestinal worms, 20% for curative
trealtments, and 7% for Foot and Mouth Disease vaccinations. On the basis of
experience elsewhere in East Africa, the impact of the improved veterinary
coverage and animal husbandry advice would be to reduce calf mortalities
from 33% to 20% aLnd adult mortalities from 5% to 4% and to allow commercial
offtake for slaughter to rise from 6.4% to 11.0%. Vaccination programs
against Newcastle Disease in village poultry would reach 80% of all poultry
in the vicinity of each Livestock Development Center, or 12% of all poultry
in the two regions. The range improvement program would test low-cost
estaLblishment methods for the following species inter alia over a four-year
period: buffel grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana),
SiraLtro (Macroptilium atropurpureum) and Perennial Stylo (Stylosanthes
guyaLnensis). Project support for the Veterinary Investigation Center (VIC)
in 11wanza would include livestock disease control monitoring and a study of
alternative techniques to vaccinate poultry against Newcastle Disease.
C. Forestry
Background
15.       Both regions contain extensive areas of natural woodlands in the
western districts, a large proportion of which are forest reserves, and
are virtually treeless in their eastern districts. In the central districts,
remnant woodlands remain in scattered areas, but are being rapidly used up
by local populations to meet house construction and fuelwood needs. In
addition, a number of islands in Mwanza region contain forests which are
also under pressure to meet demands for cultivation of food and forest pro-
duce. Depletion of the forest resources has been proceeding rapidly over
the past 20 years and is likely to continue at an expanding rate. Some
40,000 ha of reserved forests in Mwanza region have been lost since 1957; a
similar magnitude is estimated for Shinyanga. In addition, encroachment of
the forest reserves is continuing both with respect to unauthorized clear-
ing for cultivation and illicit removals of forest produce. The remaining
woodlands in public lands outside forest reserves are rapidly being con-
sumed and are expected to be fully exhausted in Mwanza region within the
next 5 to 10 years and in Shinyanga within 20 years unless corrective measures
are taken.  Pr5sent demand for poles, fuelwood and ch Ircoal is estimated to
average 0.86 m per capita annually Mwanza and 0.67 m in Shinyanga. At
such conslmption levels, total demand for forest produce would reach 2.7
million m of solid wood by 1990, while the indigenous forests could produce



ANNEX 1
Page 7
1.0 million m3 on a sustained yield basis. The increasing scarcity is re-
flected in the present high prices of forestry products. The absence of
timber, poles and firewood in the eastern areas is constraining development
and adversely affecting the lifestyle of the local inhabitants.
16.       Government forestry programs include the control of exploitation
in existing forest reserves; (see IBRD Map 13157) collection of revenues for
forest products harvested for resale from public lands; operation of district
tree nurseries for small planting programs and supplying seedings to the
public; establishing regional plantations by direct labor employment; and
developing school and village tree blocks on a self-help basis. Approxi-
mately 360 forestry staff operating at the district and local levels are
responsible for implementing the forestry program. However, management of
the approximately 880,000 ha of forest reserves has been only partly effec-
tive because of lack of transport for forestry staff, a high incidence of
illegal exploitation and encroachment for agricultural development. A
sporadic program for establishing regional plantations (approximately 780
ha) has been operated in the two regions since about 1972 with mixed results,
due partly to lack of a sound technical base and partly to lack of funds for
maintaining the areas planted. The response by villagers to establishing
self-help village tree blocks has been slow. Some 1.2 million seedings were
supplied in 1976/77, equivalent to 600 ha. The plantations' programs are
supported by a network of about 25 nurseries.
Technical Coefficients and Specifications
17.       The main species to be introduced for forest plantations under the
project would be Eucalyptus terticornis, E. citriodora and E. camaldu ensis,
with certified seed being provided by the Silviculturist, Lushoto. Some
slower growing species which are easier to establish (e.g., Cassia siamea,
Acacia arabica, Albizia lebbek) may be substituted in the more difficult
growing areas pending firm recommendations from the research subcomponent.
Planting espacement would be 2.4m x 2.4m (1,700 seedlings/ha); plantations
would be grown on a clear-fell coppice rotation of 8 years with no3inter-
mediate fellings.  The average growth rate is expected to be 12.5m /ha/year
in regional plantations and lOm /ha/year in the school and village tree
blocks. Reinforcing the management of the existing forest reserves is
exgected to result i4 a 15% increase in forest production (from about
lm /ha/year to 1.15m /ha/year) over some 190,000 ha and in the retention of
the productive benefits of some 20,000 ha of these forests which would
otherwise be lost. The research program would include intensive trials in
nursery and plantation methods, species, provenances within species and
yield trials for introduced and indigenous species. The assessment of
forest reserves and public land forests would, using forest-type maps of a
scale 1:50,000, delineate according to the following functional categories:
water-logged areas; rock areas and steep slopes for protection; grasslands
and open savanna for grazing; open woodlands with low tree stocking for
possible agricultural extension; and closer canopy woodlands with a pre-
dominance of trees in vegetation-type and fully stocked woodlands for timber
production management.

D. Industry
18.       Mwanza and Shinyanga regions have fewer than 200 industries with
assets above US$10,000, 50% of which are in Mwanza and Shinyanga towns and
25% in district headquarters or market towns. Mwanza town has evolved into
the major industrial center in western Tanzania, due to its location at the
railhead on the shores of Lake Victoria and to the development of cotton
production, while Shinyanga has remained at a relatively low level of indus-
trial development. Mwanza town had, in 1975, 154 industrial enterprises,
of which 64 had 10 or more employees. Most industrial activity relates to
the processing and marketing of cotton and cotton products. The largest
single undertaking is the Bank-financed textile mill of Mwanza Textiles
Limited (MWATEX). Shinyanga's major enterprises are a rice mill owned by the
]National Milling Corporation (NMC) and an abattoir being constructed by
Tanganyika Packers Limited and financed by the Bank under the Second Livestock
Development Project. Other industrial activities include vegetable oils and
fats production, soap making, sawmilling, vehicle and motor repair and manu-
f,acturing of furniture, fishnets and clothing. Development of small-scale
industries in the rural area of the two regions has proceeded slowly. The
rural areas, which contain almost 95% of the two regions' population, have
fewer than 252 of their small industries and services. These mostly produce
carpentry goods, blacksmith products, clothing and footwear. Some 70 small
industry cooperative groups have been established in villages and towns in
recent years under the technical guidance of the Small Industry Development
Organization (SIDO).
E. Roads
Background
19.       The two regions are served by a network of trunk, local main,
regional and village access roads as follows:
------------------------- Classification -----------------------
Region         Trunk     Local Main       Regional    Village Access    Total
(km)
Mwanza          385           406          1,056            2,647         4,494
Shinyanga       292           293            776            1,830         3,191
Although the extent of the road network is adequate to meet the regions'
transport needs, its quality is poor. Only 59 km of trunk roads are paved,
and the surface of gravelled sections has virtually disappeared through lack
of maintenance. Local main and regional roads are generally poor, varying



ANNEX 1
Page 9
from stretches with the subsurface exposed to sections impassable during
the rains. Access roads, originally designed to move the cotton crop from
village stores to the ginneries, are mostly earth tracks barely maintained
and frequently impassable when wet. Road conditions in the two regions make
road transport costly and unreliable.
20.       The government program of upgrading and maintaining the regions'
road network is limited. The regional Department of Works is responsible for
maintenance of all but village access roads, which are a village responsibility.
Separate funding for trunk road maintenance is provided by the central Ministry
of Works (MOW). During 1976, 668 km of trunk roads and 594 km of local main roads
were maintained in the two regions. No regional and access roads were main-
tained during the year. The program of road maintenance suffers from lack of
qualified personnel, adequate equipment and vehicles and recurrent funds. The
Government's programs of road rehabilitation in the two regions include:
(a) the Geita/Sengerema Road Betterment Unit, which is part
of the Third IDA Highways Project and which is expected to
complete the improvement of 303 km of Trunk and Local Main
Roads in Geita and Sengerema districts by mid-1980; and
(b) the Geita Cotton Project Road Improvement Scheme, which is
an integral part of the Geita Cotton Project and is designed
to improve accessibility to selected villages under the project.
The Fifth IDA Road Project, to be appraised in 1978, would be specifically
designed to strengthen MOW'S road maintenance capability and to improve its
technical and managerial capability. The upgrading of MOW's facilities in
Mwanza and/or Shinyanga regions under the Fifth IDA Road Project is not yet
certain.
Technical Coefficients and Specifications
21.       Regional and village access roads would be upgraded under the
project to the following standards:
Gravel Width                 Gravel Depth
Cacriageway      Shoulders
Regional Roads            4.0 m                                   0.15 m
Access Roads              3.0 m                                   0.15 m
The regional roads unit would include one bulldozer, ona mo>orgrader, one
loader, one steamroller, six tippers, one mobile tanker, cne lorry, two
pickups, two water trailers, three tractors and lubrication and repair equip-
ment. The village access roads unit would include three tractors with diverse
equipment, one tipper, one four-wheel drive vehicle, one lorry and hand tools.
Average costs are estimated at TSh 19,000 (US$2,400) per km for village access
roads and TSh 37,350 (US$4,500) per km for regional roads.



ANNEX 1

F. Water Supply
Background
22.       Over 80% of the rural populations of Mwanza and Shinyanga regions
still rely on unprotected and unreliable sources of drinking water. In addi-
tion to the health hazards of bacteriologically unsafe water sources, consi-
derable time is spent in drawing and carrying domestic water. In the dry
season, each family spends on average more than four hours per day fetching
water. In Mwanza region, a recent survey found that a third of the villages
had no source of water within their territory, and relied upon the water
supply of a neighboring village, lying at an average distance of 6 km. The
Government initiated in 1972 an ambitious national program of water develop-
ment to address the problems of inadequate water supply. It included the
construction of pumped systems in both Mwanza and Shinyanga regions. In
addition, it has sponsored from 1974 the construction of 500 shallow wells in
Shinyanga under the aegis of the Dutch-financed Shallow Wells Project. It has
supported preparation of Water Master Plans for boch Mwanza and Shinyanga
regions, under Swedish and Dutch technical assistance respectively. Despite
such initiatives, however, the Government's target to assure a supply of
potable and accessible water to the entire rural population by 1991 will
certainly not be met. Fiscal constraints have forced reductions in development
expenditures for rural water supply and restricted funds available for proper
operation and maintenance of existing systems. In Mwanza region, for example,
only 8 new systems are under construction in 1977; and, because the lack of
adequaate maintenance and spare parts, water delivered by existing systems
meets only 40% of design capacity.
Technical Coefficients and Specifications
23.       The project would establish one ring-well unit and two pipe-well
units in Mwanza region. The first would construct wells to an average depth
of 4m and the second to an average depth of 8m. Either type of well would
serve an estimated 300 people respectively. Their reliability in an average
dry season is estimated at better than 80%. Both types would be encased in
sand and capped with a concrete cover to protect water quality and would be
equipped with a hand pump. The ring-well unit would be supplied with two
pickups, four 7-ton lorries, mobile ring production and well-sinking equip-
ment. The pipe-well units would be supplied with two 7-ton lorries with
cranes, one pickup and simple drilling equipment. The shallow-well con-
struc:tion units would be serviced by a central compound, including two pick-
ups and workshop equipment, and temporary compounds located at district
headquarters. It is estimated that the ring-well unit could produce one
well per month and the pipe-well unit three wells per month. Direct average
unit costs to construct the former would be TSh 20,700 (US$2,494) and the
latter TSh 9,200 (US$1,108). This compares with TSh 144,400 (US$17,400) and
TSh 32,300 (US$3,900) to rehabilitate a village water supply system in
Mwanza and Shinyarnga regions respectively. Estimated average per capita



ANNEX 1
Page 11
capital costs would be TSh 30 for pipe wells, TSh 70 for ring wells and TSh
20 for rehabilitated systems. Estimated average operation and maintenance
costs per capita would be TSh 5 per year for shallow-wells and TSh 15 per
year for rehabilitated systems.
G. Health and Education
Background
24.       Parasitic and infectious diseases pose the most serious health prob-
lems in Mwanza and Shinyanga regions. Both vesical and intestinal schisto-
somiasis are widespread; recent surveys demonstrated the incidence of the
former to be more than 60% in sample areas and of the latter to be 35-40% of
the population in Mwanza lakeshore areas. Malaria is another major disease,
with malaria parasites found in more than 60% of hospital admissions. Malaria
and measles exact a heavy toll among the 1-5 year age group. The incidence of
tuberculosis and of gastro-intestinal infections is also serious. Protein
energy malnutrition (PEM) is a widespread phenomenon of fairly uniform inten-
sity affecting approximately 30% of children under 5 years of age.
25.       Both regions have made considerable efforts in recent years to ex-
tend health services to the majority of the rural population through de-
veloping a network of rural health centers (RHCs) and dispensaries. National
targets specify one hospital per district, one RRC per 50,000 people and one
dispensary per 10,000 people. These compare with the following health facili-
ties in the two regions in 1975:
Rural Popu-   Hospitals         RHCs             Dispensaries
lation (million)   No.         No.    Coverage   No.       Coverage
Mwanza           1.23          6          16        76,000   119       10,200
Shinyanga        1.09         5            9       121,000   115        9,500
Although dispensary coverage meets national targets, the distribution of dis-
pensaries is uneven and many isolated villages remain without services.
Mwanza also houses the modern 550-bed Bugando hospital, which is one of four
national referral centers and employs 42 physicians (of which 30 are expatriate).
However, the hospital has few outreach activities to service the needs of the
regions' rural populations. The system of rural health services faces important
staffing and financing constraints which lead to problems of neglected supervi-
sion, insufficient supplies, low staff morale, poor efficiency and quality
of care.
26.       Adult literacy remains low in both regions, although the Govern-
ment has initiated an adult literacy program that now includes roughly
800,000 registered participants. The Government has also placed heavy em-
phasis on primary education in recent years. Its latest initiative to



ANNEX 1
Page 12
accelerate primary education is the program of Universal Primary Education
(UE'E), proclaimed in 1974 (cf para 1.05). Under UPE, classes are taught
by the older students (Form IV) and villages provide, on a self-help basis,
the labor and materials needed for classrooms and equipment.  Students in
schools established before the UPE program are generally taught by teachers of
hig,her level in classrooms of better standard. Primary school attendance
among children of 9-14 age is estimated at 46% and 33% for Mwanza and Shinyanga
regions respectively. Villages in the two regions register 1370 schools,
3,480 classrooms, 318,000 students and 5,000 teachers at the primary level.
Approximately two-thirds of teachers have inadequate housing.
Technical Coefficients and Specifications
27.       Social infrastructure to be supported under the Village Self-Help
Program includes classrooms, and health dispensaries, constructed3or upgraded
through village self-help. Classrooms are assumed to average 65m with a
capacity of 45 pupils and to cost roughly TSh 15,500 (US$1,900); the
upgrading of health dispensaries, including provision of standard equipment
and supplies and construction of the dispenser's house are estimated to cost
about TSh 20,700 (US$2,500) on average.

1/ Yields shown for existing practices for maize and sorghum refer to total cropped area, including mixed stands. However,
yields for improved seed and seed dressing for maize and sorghum apply to pure stands only. Cassava yields
refer to annualized yields of dry cassava chips or flour.
2/ Calculated at official farmgate prices.
3/ Includes cost of seed and seed dressing. Planting material for cassava assumed to have zero cash cost.
4/ Represents 30% increase on yields of total cropped area. However, project benefits calculated on
basis of baseline yields of reduced area (excluding maize/sorghum and maize/cotton mixes).
5/  The costs per ha of tractor and oxen tilling would be TSh 245  and TSh 165 respectively (based on local private hire charges),    >
and are included in the calculation of return to labor for those technologies.

1/ Derived from 1976 Village Sample Survey data: crop income obtained by using data on average yields, cropping patterns (by farm size) and official
prices. Livestock income derived from data on cattle and smallatock numbers (by farm size), and applying derived annual vialts of production per head of
TSh 190 and T5h 20 for cattle and livestock respectively.
2/ Quotati ons of average crop incomes per capita in the text are derived from TableT 1, which is based on adjusted sorvey data, as described in NWP C-3.
livestock incomes are quoted as averages for all households (including non-cattle owners) and are derived from census data on livestock and
household numbers per zone, as shown in Working Paper C-4, Table 3.
3/1 zone vit. UkereWe and UJkara islands, has not been included because of lack of data on income distribution by farm size.
