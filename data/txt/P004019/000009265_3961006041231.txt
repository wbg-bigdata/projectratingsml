TO INONESIA
FOR TlE SBCOND ACCOUNTANCY DEVELOPNT PROJECT
1.         I submit for yo  approv  the foflowing m ndum and              on a proposed
to the Republic of ndonia for the eq aent of US$25.0 mMiion   help finnce the Second
Accounncy Developmen projec Mbm loan would be at the Banks standad variabl Interest   , wt
a maturity of 20 yea, cudig fivey    of gae
2.         c9malm=  B g           .  As Idones s economy continues to grow, and makets
contne to expand domescay and    natioly, the need for coarable and reliable financial
Informato has become apparent to te Govemet The use of basic financil        of e
In particular, is taking on increased sgnificac. lhese staemen arem and wi contiue t be & prim
sorc of infioration for bans etnding redt for shor- and Ion-tm  cai  needs; for supplier
exteg trade credit; for domec and intnatonal investors; nd for goverm   agencies responsible
for the financial spevision of banks, capit marts, and sownd eteprises.
3.         The Government of Indonesia has recognized dhe Imortae of setting ad eorcing
standrds, and of genly ehag  the quity and reuti  of the acunting proession; however,
its efbrts to date apa t have had ihmitd impact Enterprise financi a   are not yet prepared
consiteny accorg to a genealy accepted set of accounting standards; and eva if audited by loca
accounti  fim, such financial   e    oftenr given, limited credibty by hies, ldendrs and
concernd governme  agencies. Although the Inonsian Accutan Instiu        has been acdve over
the past seven year in daftg accounting nd audig standards, and in tryig t strengthen the
accounting profsion, its ouput and ffectvene  has been limited. Hence, the Govenmuen has been
rewsming its aproah to the set8t  and enforcn of ths standards, and has developed a program for
improving and bette managing these important actes, as part of an overllw    deudvopment
strategy. In s strategy, the Gov.ame  has al  rognzed the bIporanc of developing a reiable
govemen acoting system, wich woud snd improve the accounting system used by
agen   in .pordng govenm     finances and at, and which would enable the
Govermen to btter mon    and s    _aguard the Governme's ast.
4.         The costs of delaying or neglecting  ee matters are appare  to the Government, albeit
difficult O quanfy. For example, by not having comparabe ad reliable enterpise financia 
bans can be  cted t ovedy rely on coaterail secui ad psoa  guarant   n making loans.
Iest raes may be ind, and loan matries reduced to oMpna  for higher  ranty and
ris  Trade credit and other sourc  of workig capital may be reaivly more difficult o obta,
epecy for smaller and newly emerging nterprs. Rlk-avea  investors, both domestic ad foeign,
may avoid or bid low fr enterise shre offeings or jointventure opportunities. Addtonlly, with
omparabl ad reliable financa    mt, the opaton of pvement ageces concoed with the
spervision of banks   d other  s    ,  cvptalmnkds, ad imm t  ahbt                 wM be
rendered less effictlve. In short, whe ompetive mats may indeed contue to imon, they would
do so in a relvely inefficient and inefete manner.

5.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. Ihe primary objectives of the First
Accountancy Developmet Poject (Loan 2940-IND) were to fnane  the desip and linpi     of
an improved goverent accounting systeM, to pmride hnilal spport to the development of the
accounting profession and capital mwkets regulations, and tO finae  the enment of instuctor skills,
leaning materis and equipmet for all levels of accouatg education The project is meeting most of
its objectives. The following lessons have emerged from the expeiac wi this project:
(a) Ihe isblladton of the goveme  acounting systm is tech ly comple  it rqr
very tight projet contol to avoid schede slippage, cost ove   and an over-dependency
on foreign c Sultan  for activides more appropriately caried out by govenme st4
such as project management and supervision. Also, for th governm  accunting system
to operae most effecvely, it must be compatible with other finan    informaton system
in the Ministry of Finance. To achieve this, it is important for the Ministry of Finance to
develop a plan and standards for the management of the govermn  accounting system.
(b)  It is important to emphize project imple  an management upfront, through the
introduction of computerized project plan   and detailed acvty scheduling, idendfication
of key milestone events, and recognition of responsibility and accoutabiliy for meeting
project objecves by semor agency officials.
(c)  While improvemes in goveret accounti  certainly Contribute to more effective and
ansparent dministion, a larger impact on development wil have to come f*om
impovinlg the usebness and credibility of financia information for entepi   in the
private and public sectors. The creation of an eff ctive envionment to enable this to
happen will depend on govenment sategies and commiment
6.         These lesson  have been taken IOD account in deinng the Second A ccun y
Developmen Project and in preparing for its upeiso   Specficly, to addrs point (c) above, the
Govenment has developed a strategy document for accountancy development, and has reviewed   with
the Bak. In addition, to address points (a) and (b), comptaizd project management teias have
been adopted by governmt unit responsible for project implem   and wi  be used for project
planning, monitoring and control; and infmti technology management will be speificay addressed
as part of the enhancement of the government accounting system.
7.                         I. Te Government of Indonesia reogniz  the importance of reliable
financial information to the operation of both the public and priVate sectors. It also recopizes the
impornc of developing a strong and credible national acounting profesin  Te Gov ernes
accountancy development strategy emphasi  the followig for the medium term from 1994 to 2000:
(a)  uswg codified Inttona   atig and audiing st        as the primary rehren  in
drafting or revising national standards for Indonesi
()   establising more effcve prou   and coopution betwe  the Goverment and the
accounting profession (as rerented by the AI) in the draftn  and Isig of new
accounting and audng stdards; and developing requrements and a program of
contining professional eduation for II members;
(c)  enhancing the qualifing criteria and exaMInati  procus toward licng public
acountan;



-3 -
(d)  fostering Goverment capabilities to beter plan for and manage the use of infornatio
tecology in the Government's efforts to modrnize its accountg and fiaciSl
information systems;
(e)  strengthen   the management and staff skls of Govemment audit activities to meet
increasing demands in areas such as operational auditing an  auditng in a higbly
compuerized acaung e onment; and
(f)  imwroving the quality of accounting education through better coordinatd iprovement in
curriculum and teaching methods at all levels, from accounting technician through universiy
post-graduate.
8.         Hence, the Governmen's strategy not only recognizes the need to enhance its own
accounting and auditing capabfliies, but also that the Government is faced wit a growing need to ensure
that financal accounting, reporing and auditng in private and public sector enterises meets consistently
high internional standards. At this stage of the county's development, its accountng profession is sdll
. It is important for the Government to provide guidance and suppo . -;) the process of drafting
and issuing acng  and auditing stadards. Also, it is important for we Govement to ensure
adherence to these standards. The Government intends to achieve tbis primarily through coorn
efforts in capital markets reguations, company and commercial law development, testng and licensing
of public accountants and the strengthening of the Indonesian Accountants Inste M.
9.         Ihe preceding aspects of accountancy development tend to be inter-related and in many
instances wil require higly specialzed technical assistance. While this technical assistance is important
to the developmental effort, the Governmen recognizes that it is equally important to build strong interal
capabilities rough a 'rogram of well-focused overse higher education for a limited number of selected
staff. Such staff could then become supervisors and trainers in twhse agencies dealing with the
adminitrati  of the government accounting system and capial markets regulation.
10.        Ratione fr Bank           . Iprovemet in public sector perfonmance and promotn
of pnvate sector development are among the key objectves of the Country Assistance Stategy for
Idonesia presented to the Executive Directors on April 12, 1994. With its emphasis on modanizing
government accounig inormation systems and enhacing the credibility and usefulness of fnancial
normation for both public and private sector enterprises, the proposed project would effectively support
the thrust of the Country Assistance Strategy.
11.        Probjecye. Ihe objectives of this project are to support the Govenment's strategy
to modernize government accoing infoation systems; and to enhamce the credibility and usefWuess
of fiancia information in private and public sector enteprises, through the implemion of rigorous
qualifying examintons for public accountants, a comprebensive set of accounting and auding standards
and the enforcement of these standrds through capial market regulatory activiies.
12.        Emie       io. The project comprises two major components: (a) the moderizaton
of governmet acountig; and (b) prive and public sector enterprise accounting and auditing standard-
setftng and enforcement Primary activities in the fist component would include the emaotnd
contned impl      ton of the govenment accoung system, which was originally designed under the
fist Accunancy Development Project (Loan 2940-IND). Ths activity would also adres the Ministry
of Finance's need to better plan and manage its data omications capabites.



-4-
13.        The second mor cowmponent address the Governmens need to  su  that Intonally
accepted accountig and auditng standards are Issued and enforced for privat ad public sco
onteeprises. This component would further develop the quality and credibilWt of Indonesia's professional
accountants through more rigorous testng, licensing and continuig professional 8tucation progms.
14.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance technical assistance, equipment and
specialized overseas degree programs.
1S.                           . The Min ImpIm e$Iatinistry of Finae would have overall responsibility for
Implementation of the proposed proect. The project would be implemented over a period of five and
one-half years, with an expected compledon date of January 31, 2000 and a closing date of Juy 31, 2000.
Ihe project cost is estimaed at US$33.9 million equivalent, with a foreign excne componnt of
US$21.4 million equivalent (63%). A breakdown of costs and the fiag plan are shown In Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbs , and the disbunement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the stats of Bank Group
qperations in the Republic of Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Ihe Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 12883-IND dated July 29, 1994 is being dinributed separately.
16.            Pect Sinahil. The promulgation and enforcement of accunting and auditing
stndards, the strthening of the acunting profession and the IAI, the development of capital market
rules and regulations, and the implementtio of govment accunting normation systems, will all
have a long-term impact on private and public sector development, particlarly on the sustainabilit and
viy   of Indonesia's financial system. However, sustnability wil also depend on the Government's
effectiveness in maintaining, monitoring and enforcing the systems, institutions and reguations developed
and supported by the project. A key to such susinabiity will be the traning provided under the project,
comprsing overseas training in hily specialized are  and in-country training.
17.        Am=  Reache. During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the folowing
actions being taken, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank and under a schedule agreed with the BRL
(a)   Preparation and approval . work plans for professional accountta examinations;
(b)  Adoption of a minimum number of accounting and auditing standards;
(c)  Preparation and approva of disclosure guidelies for the regulation of capital makets;
(d)  Enrollment of participants in overseas degree programs;
(e)  Instalation of pilot systems for data communications; and
(f   implemntton of an improved governmen accountg system.
18.       In addition, assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations that:
(a)  by November 30, 1997, a mid-term review of the project would be caried out to assess the
achievement and sustainability of the objectives of the Project and to tak any correctve
measures, as needed;



(b) the Project Support Services Unit (PSSU) woudk monitor all avpects of project
implementtion throughout the project and would frnsh prompty to the Bank semi-nnul
progres reports thereon; and
(c)   amuawoprogm  amdbudgets wouldbervie ad withthe Bank, and the project would
be carried out in accordance with such work programs and budgets.
19.        Evr. The evronmnt category Is C, as the project would not have any
environmental impact. 
20.         d     iec   andRs;. It is expected that a comprehensive set of national accounig
and auditing standards consist wh accepted Ieational stds wil have been issued and enfrced
by the end of the project Implementation period. This would prwvide a fowudon for more useful and
creible financial reportiog and disclosure for eberises in both the private and public sectors. Ihe
accountancy profession will be significanty enhanced dhrough more rigorous aminatons for the
licesing of public accountants, ad tirough a program of required continng profession  educadon for
such accountants. Standard-set  and capital market rue-mking will be more effectively coordinated
with the broader commercial law reform effort. An improved computrized govwernnt acunting
system wM have become operational, providg the Governmeat with the means to more efficiendy plan,
monitor and control budgetary expenditures. As such, the project will have a broad Impact on Improving
economic efficiency, in both the financa and real sectors.
21.        While the GoveMment is committed to improved enterprse reporting and disclosure?
resitan  to the cages which are to be introduced could come from some stakeholders. This could
limit or delay the extent to wbich needed actions or decisions may be taken Also, the tecbhical
complexity of the acounting information sstems work produce Implem tion risks. The proje t
planning au control techniques that will be used for the project would limit hese risks; and the project
has been stuctured in a way that corrective actions may be taken durig annuat work program and budget
reviews as well as through a mid-term review exercise.
22.        Rewmmendaion. I am sadsfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Ardcles of
Agreement of Bank and recommend that the Executive Directs approve the proposed loaL
