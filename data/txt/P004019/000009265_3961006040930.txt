LOANANDPROJECTSUMMARY
Borrower:             Republic of Indonesia
Amount:               US$25.0 million equivalent
Terms:                20 years, including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate.
Project Objectives:   The project will provide further support for the implementation of the
Government's strategy to modernize the Government Accounting System. It
also will support enhancing the credibility and usefulness of financial
information in the private and public sectors, through the implementation of
rigorous qualifying examinations for public accountants, a comprehensive set
of accounting standards and the enforcement of these standards through capital
market regulatory activities. The project comprises two major components:
(a) the modernization of governmental accounting; and (b) private and public
sector enterprise accounting and auditing standard-setting and enforcement.
Primary activities in the first component would include the enhancement and
continued implementation of a new government accounting system, which was
originally designed under the first Accountancy Development Project (Loan
2940-IND). This activity would also address the Ministry of Finance's need
to better plan and manage its data communications capabilities. The second
major component addresses the Government's need to ensure that
internationally accepted accounting and auditing standards are issued and
enforced for private and public sector enterprises. This component also would
further develop the quality and credibility of Indonesia's professional
accountants through more rigorous testing, licensing and continuing
professional education programs.
Project Benefits
and Risks:            It is expected that a comprehensive set of national accounting and auditing
standards consistent with accepted international standards will have been
issued and enforced by the end of the project implementation period. This
would provide a foundation for more useful and credible financial reporting
and disclosure for enterprises in both the private and public sectors. The
accountancy profession will be significantly enhanced through more rigorous
examinations for the licensing of public accountants, and through a program
of required continuing professional education for such accountants. Standard-
i



setting and capital market rule-making will be more effectively coordinated
with the broader commercial law reform effort. An improved computerized
government accounting system will have become operational, providing the
Government with the means to more efficiently plan, monitor and control
budgetary expenditures. As such, the project will have a broad impact on
improving economic efficiency, in both the financial and real sectors.
While the Government is committed to improved enterprise reporting and
disclosure, resistance to the changes which are to be introduced could come
from some stakeholders. This could limit or delay the extent to which needed
actions or decisions may be taken. Also, the technical complexity of the
accounting and information systems work produces implementation risks. The
project planning and control techniques that will be used for the project would
limit these risks; and the project has been structured in a way that corrective
actions may be taken during annual work program and budget reviews as well
as through a mid-term review exercise.

SECOND ACCOUNTANCY DEVELOPMENT PROlC
I. THE DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT
A.         Introduction
1.1        In Indonesia, as in other competitive markets, economic decisions often are based on the
information contained in the general purpose financial statements prepared by various commercial,
industrial and other business reporting enterprises. The users of these financial statements include present
and potential investors, employees, lenders, suppliers and other trade creditors, customers and
govermnent agencies. Some of these users may require, and indeed have the power to obtain,
information in addition to that contained in financial statements. Many users in competitive markets,
however, have to rely on such financial statements as their major source of financial information.
Therefore, for markets to function efficiently, it is important that the information contained in enterprise
financial statements be relevant to decision-making needs of users, and that such statements be comparable
and reliable. These objectives are achieved fundamentally through the setting and enforcing of generally
accepted accounting and auditing standards.
1.2        Accounting Standards. A wide variety of accounting methods can be used in determining
how and when financial transactions are recognized, calculated, classified, posted, summarized and
ultimately reported. In effect, accounting standards are formal guidelines that specify how certain types
of transactions or events are to be recorded and disclosed in financial statements. The need for specific
standards, and the process of setting them, has evolved in various countries over a period of decades.
They have varied among countries, reflecting different national economic, social and political
backgrounds.
1.3        Accounting standard-setting has evolved to where specific standards are generally accepted
in each of the relatively developed countries, reflecting the recognized needs and circumstances of those
countries. While there are many similarities in accounting practices among various countries, there are
some areas of significant differences. For example, differences exist in the areas of: goodwill and other
intangible assets resulting from business combinations; accounting for equity in consolidated financial
statements; foreign currency transactions; lease accounting; pension liabilities; and income tax accounting.
These areas of difference have become more critical as the world's securities markets have become more
global, as business operations have become more multinational; and as bank and trade credit have become
more international. In effect, differences in accounting methods that may be used by enterprises in
different countries may hamper comparative analyses of their financial statements. Ihese differences also
create concern about the absence of a 'level playing field," in that they may have significant impacts on
reported earnings of enterprises.
1.4        The basic need for comparability in financial reporting, and the increasing concern for a
level playing field internationally, has underscored efforts toward achieving more uniformity among
national accounting standards. In Europe, such efforts have been reflected in recent European Union
(EU) Directives. Also, since 1977, the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and a related
International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), have been working toward developing and
enhancing a coordinated worldwide accountancy profession with harmonized standards. The IFAC is an
1



international organization whose membership comprises the recognized professional accounting bodies
of some 75 countries (including Indonesia). The IFAC and IASC have issued a number of accounting
standards, and auditing guidelines and statements. They are referred to as the International Accounting
and Auditing Standards. Although countries are not obliged to follow these pronouncements, they are
likely to become the most commonly used accounting and auditing standards in the world.
1.5        Auditing Sandards. While accounting standards serve to achieve comparability in financial
reporting, auditing standards serve to achieve reliability. The adherence to generally accepted auditing
standards by auditors provides credibility to the opinions they render on the presentation of financial
statements. This allows users of financial information to be confident that the statements indeed were
prepared according to generally acceptable accounting standards; that they are free of any material
misstatement; and that important relevant information has been fully disclosed.
1.6        Auditing standards typically address the qualifications of public accountants who may report
on financial statements; the conduct and supervision of audit field work; and specific audit procedures
which must be completed for certain engagements, most commonly for financial statement audits. In
individual countries, these standards are governed, in varying degrees, by local regulations. Such
regulations may be either of a statutory nature, or in the form of statements issued by regulatory or
professional accounting bodies. As with accounting standards, auditing standards among countries differ
in form and content. In practice, while the more developed countries have noticeably high standards of
qualification for public accountants and for the supervision of field work, less developed countries often
tend to accept lower standards. Certainly, users of financial information can be expected to attach less
reliability to reports prepared by auditors practicing in countries viewed as having the lower standards.
1.7        Implications for Indonesia. As Indonesia's economy continues to grow, and its markets
continue to expand domestically and internationally, the need for comparable and reliable financial
information has become apparent to the Government. The use of basic financial statements of enterprises,
in particular, is taking on increased significance. These statements are, and will continue to be a primary
source of information for banks extending credit for short- and long-term capital needs; for suppliers
extending trade credit; for domestic and international investors; and for government agencies responsible
for the financial supervision of banks, capital markets, and state-owned enterprises.
1.8        The Government of Indonesia has recognized the importance of setting and enforcing
standards, and of generally enhancing the quality and reputation of the accounting profession; however,
its efforts to date appear to have had limited impact. Enterprise financial statements are not yet prepared
consistently according to a generally accepted set of accounting standards; and even if audited by local
accounting firms, such financial statements often are given limited credibility by investors, lenders and
concerned government agencies. To some extent, this can be attributed to a general absence in
Indonesian law of regulations which would require and enforce basic standards of accounting, auditing
and reporting, other than for certain financial institutions and listed companies. Indonesia also does not
as yet have a strong professional accountants association. Although the Indonesian Accountants Institute
(IAI) has been active over the past seven years in drafting accounting and auditing standards, and in
trying to strengthen the accounting profession, its output and effectiveness has been limited. The
underlying reasons for this are complex and include such factors as a lack of strength in its professional
membership and a lack of well-established processes for drafting, reviewing and coming to agreement
on standards to be issued. As a consequence, over the past two to three years, key regulatory agencies
such as the Central Bank (Bank Indonesia) and the Capital Markets Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM),
have been pro-active in working with the LAI in drafting and issuing some initial standards. Hence, the
2



Government has been reassessing its approach to the setting and enforcing of these standards, and has
developed a program for improving and better managing these important activities, as part of an overall
accountancy development strategy, which has been submitted to the Bank to be used as the framework
for the proposed project. Further, this strategy recognizes the need to enhance the quality of accounting
education as part of strengthening the profession, building upon its achievements thus far in enhancing
accounting faculties and increasing the numbers of trained accountants and accounting technicians.
1.9        The costs of delaying or neglecting these matters are apparent to the Clbvernment, albeit
difficult to quantify. For example, by not having comparable and reliable enterprise financial statements,
banks can be expected to overly rely on collateral security and personal guarantees in making loans.
Interest rates may be increased, and loan maturities reduced to compensate for higher uncertainty and
risk. Trade credit and other sources of working capital may be relatively more difficult to obtain,
especially for smaller and newly emerging enterprises. Risk-averse investors, both domestic and foreign,
may avoid or bid low for enterprise share offerings or joint-venture opportunities. Additionally, without
comparable and reliable financial statements, the operations of government agencies concerned with the
supervision of banks and other enterprises, capital markets, and income tax administration will be
rendered less effective. In short, while competitive markets may indeed continue to function, they would
do so in a relatively inefficient and ineffective manner.
B.         The Govermment's Strategy
1.10       The Government of Indonesia recognizes the importance of reliable financial information
to the operation of both the public and private sectors. It also recognizes the importance of developing
a strong and credible national accounting profession. With Bank support under the first Accountancy
Development Project (Loan 2940-IND), the Government has completed pilot work on a new government
accounting system, and has significantly enhanced the education of accounting faculty in the country.
As a continuation of this work, the Government's accountancy development strategy emphasizes the
following for the medium term from 1994 to 2000:
(a)  using codified international accounting and auditing standards as the primary reference in
drafting or revising national standards for Indonesia;
(b)  establishing more effective procedures and cooperation between the Government and the
accounting profession (as represented by the IAI) in the drafting and issuing of new
accounting and auditing standards; and developing requirements and a program of
continuing professional education for IAI members;
(c)  enhancing the qualifying criteria and examination procedures toward licensing public
accountants;
(d)  fostering Government capabilities to better plan for and manage the use of information
technology in the Government's efforts to modernize its accounting and financial
information systems;
(e)  strengthening the management and staff skills of Government audit activities to meet
increasing demands in areas such as operational auditing and auditing in a highly
computerized accounting environment; and
3



(f)  improving the quality of accounting education through better coordinated improvements in
curriculum and teaching methods at all levels, from accounting technician through university
post-graduate.
C.   The Bank's Strategy
1.11       Improvement in public sector performance and promotion of private sector development are
among the key objectives of the Country Assistance Strategy for Indonesia presented to the Executive
Directors on April 12, 1994. With its emphasis on modernizing government accounting information
systems, and enhancing the credibility and usefulness of financial information for both public and private
sector enterprises, the proposed project would effectively support the thrust of the Country Assistance
Strategy.
1.12       The Bank's strategy recognizes that sustained development of efficient private enterprises
requires measures that strengthen the institutional underpinnings of efficient markets. This involves the
creation of an atmosphere conducive to wider participation, easier entry and greater competition, where
the focus of government will shift further from providing goods and services to helping markets work
better. In addition to progress in the deregulation of the financial and real sectors, this includes: (i)
building a modem legal framework (improvements in commercial, credit and contract laws and
adjudication) that would provide business with a stable, predictable environment that raises confidence
and reduces costs; and (ii) development of adequate accounting and auditing standards and disclosure
requirements. Further, the Bank's strategy recognizes that an effective and transparent administrative
system will be needed, allowing the private sector to focus on increasing output and productivity. Hence
as part of its assistance strategy, the Bank has supported the Government's efforts to develop and
implement a program for national accountancy development.
D.         The First Accountancy Development Project
1.11       The primary objectives of the First Accountancy Development Project (Loan 2940-IND)
were to finance the design and implementation of an improved government accounting system, to provide
initial support to the development of the accounting profession and capital markets regulations, and to
finance the enhancement of instructor skills, learning materials and equipment for all levels of accounting
education. The project is meeting most of its objectives and its closing date has been extended to June
30, 1995. The following lessons have emerged from our experience with this project:
(a)   The installation of the government accounting system is technically complex. It requires
very tight project control to avoid schedule slippage, cost overruns and an over-dependency
on foreign consultants for activities more appropriately carried out by government staff,
such as project management and supervision. Also, for the government accounting system
to operate most effectively, it must be compatible with other financial information systems
in the Ministry of Finance. To achieve this, it is important for the Ministry of Finance to
develop a plan and standards for the management of the government accounting system.
(b)  It is important to emphasize project implementation management upfront, through the
introduction of computerized project planning and detailed activity scheduling, identification
4



of key milestone events, and recognition of responsibility and accountability for meeting
project objectives by senior agency officials.
(c)   While improvements in government accounting certainly contribute to more effective and
transparent administration, a larger impact on development will have to come from
improving the usefulness and credibility of financial information for enterprises in the
private and public sectors. The creation of an effective environment to enable this to
happen will primarily depend on government strategies and commitment.
1.13            These lessons have been taken into account in designing the Second Accountancy
Development Project and in preparing for its supervision. Specifically, to address point (c) above, the
Government has developed a strategy document for accountancy development in Indonesia for the medium
term (1994-2000), and has reviewed it with the Bank (paragraphs 1.8 and 1.10). In addition, to address
points (a) and (b), computerized project management techniques have been adopted by government units
responsible for project implementation, and will be used for project planning, monitoring and control;
and information technology management will be specifically addressed as part of the enhancement of the
government accounting system.

II. THE PROJECT
A.         Project Background and Concept
2.1        The First Accountancy Development Project (Loan 2940-IND) was designed as a first phase
of the Government's plan for (a) modernizing the Government's accounting system; (b) improving
accounting education and training; and (c) initiating actions for meeting the financial information
requirements of the capital markets. Given its cost and technical complexity, the Bank and the
Government recognize the need for continuing Bank support of the installation of the improved
Government Accounting System (GAS).  Meeting this need also will enable the Bank to help the
Government to implement its broader accountancy development strategy, with its important impact on
private sector development.
2.2        The computerized GAS developed under the first project employed software technology
which was suitable at the time, even though it would limit the Government's flexibility in the selection
of computer hardware. Since the system is approaching its full implementation phase, it is appropriate
now to enhance the system to enable it to take advantage of new technology that currently is available.
This will allow the system to ultimately operate more effectively with a variety of computer hardware
systems available world-wide. This kind of enhancement is now viewed as an important step in the
normal evolution of computer software to mature systems.
2.3        The computerized GAS as well as other government information management systems will
require appropriate information technology standards to be established (for example, for open operating
systems and application portability). Also, these systems will ultimately require data communications
capabilities to transfer information from remote offices to a central computer site.
2.4        The Government is faced with a growing need to ensure that financial accounting, reporting
and auditing in private and sector enterprises meets consistently high international standards. At this
stage of the country's development, its accounting profession is still maturing. Hence, it is important for
the Government to provide guidance and support to the process of drafting and issuing accounting and
auditing standards. Also, it is important for the Government to ensure adherence to these standards.
This will be done primarily through coordinated efforts in capital markets regulations, company and
commercial law development, testing and licensing of public accountants and the strengthening of the
Indonesian Accountants Institute.
2.5        The preceding aspects of accountancy development tend to be inter-related and in many
instances will require highly specialized technical assistance. While this technical assistance is important
to the developmental effort, it is equally important that the Government build strong internal capabilities
through a program of well-focused overseas higher education for a limited number of selected staff. Such
staff could then become supervisors and trainers in those agencies dealing with the administration of the
GAS and capital markets regulation.
6



B.         Project Objectives and Scope
2.6        The objectives of this project are to support the Government's strategy to modernize
government accounting information systems; and to enhance the credibility and usefulness of financial
information for private and public sector enterprises through the implementation of rigorous qualifying
examinations for public accountants, a comprehensive set of accounting and auditing standards and the
enforcement of these standards. The installation of the Government Accounting System comprises major
levels of effort directed at information systems development and management. These efforts will include
specialized consultancy support in various aspects of accounting systems design, implementation,
management and training. The project also includes specialized consultancy support and training in
information system technology, as well as in the formulation of accounting standards, and of financial
reporting and other regulations for capital market operations.
C.         Project Description
2.7        The project comprises two major components: (a) the modernization of governmental
accounting; and (b) private and public sector enterprise accounting and auditing standard-setting and
enforcement. Primary activities in the first component would include the enhancement and continued
implementation of the government accounting system, which was originally designed under the First
Accountancy Development Project (Loan 2940-IND). This activity would also address the Ministry of
Finance's need to better plan and manage its data communications capabilities.
2.8        The second major component addresses the Government's need to ensure that internationally
accepted accounting and auditing standards are issued and enforced for private and public sector
enterprises. This component would also further develop the quality and credibility of Indonesia's
professional accountants through more rigorous testing, licensing and continuing professional education
programs.
Modernization of Government Accounting System
2.9        The project would support the purchase of computer hardware and software and the
enhancement of the current GAS (GAS R.1.0), to a second version (GAS R.2.0) and the nationwide
installation of the enhanced GAS. Overseas training for selected technical staff also will be supported.
The project would support technical assistance to MOF in identifying and adopting appropriate
information technology standards to coordinate and guide the future computerization efforts of the GAS.
Major activities of this work would include:
(a)   Requirements Definition and Design. A detailed analysis of the requirements for GAS
R.2.0 will be undertaken. It will include a study of GAS R. 1.0 to determine the features
that can remain in use and those that must be enhanced. Also, any potential deficiencies
in GAS R. 1.0 would be eliminated, particularly in regard to controls and audit trails.
Requirements for new features to support various reporting requirements for liabilities, fixed
assets, investments and requirements for interfaces with other MOF agencies also will be
determined. The major deliverable product of this task will be a final version of a
Requirements Document for GAS R.2.0.
7



(b)   Software Development.  Systems software for GAS R.2.0 will be developed and
documented. Also, quality assurance tests will be developed, and at least one pilot site will
be used to do initial acceptance testing of the software.
(c)  Implementation. Nationwide implementation of GAS R.2.0 will include activities related
to systems installation, user training, software maintenance and specialized training for
MOF technical staff.
2.10       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that the requirements
documents for GAS R.2.0 will be implemented by July 31, 1996 and that acceptance tests of GAS R.2.0
will be completed by November 30, 1997 (paragraph 4.16).
2.11       Government Information Systems Management. The project would support a feasibility
study, network design and pilot implementation of a data communications system, to facilitate the timely
and accurate collection and consolidation of government accounting information. This system would be
implemented in two or more pilot sites that would be using the GAS R.2.0. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government that the pilot data communications system will be
implemented by November 30, 1997 (paragraph 4.16).
Public and Private Sector Enterprise Standard-Setting and Enforcement
2.12       Standard-setting and Accounting Profession Development. The project would support
technical assistance to MOF to formulate some 40 accounting and 16 auditing standards, to process them
through draft exposure, public hearing, adoption by the IAI's professional committees and final
production. These standards will reflect internationally accepted practices. MOF has taken the lead in
standard-setting since the IAI is still at a formative stage. At the same time, the project will support the
Ministry's efforts to train key personnel to eventually lead the IAI, and to develop and begin executing
a continuing professional education program for the members of the IAI.
2.13       The project would also support the Ministry of Finance in a program to develop new
professional examinations and licensing procedures for public accountants. In developing this program,
special attention will be paid to the content and level of difficulty of the examination, the process of
formulating examination questions and problems, and the administration and grading of examinations.
2.14       During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that a detailed approach
and workplan for the professional accountant qualifying examinations will be adopted by June 30, 1996
and that 15 accounting and 15 auditing standards will be officially adopted by March 31, 1997 and that
40 accounting and 16 auditing standards will be adopted by July 31, 1999 (paragraph 4.16).
2.15       Enforcement of Standards. The major mechanism for enforcing accounting and auditing
standards in Indonesia is MOF's capital market regulatory activities. Financial disclosure by Indonesian
public companies must follow MOF rules. MOF also regulates record-keeping and financial reporting
by securities companies, exchanges, custodians, accountants, legal consultants, investment advisors,
securities administration agencies, clearing, settlement, and depository institutions, and investment funds.
Rule-making is central to the capital markets regulatory role. An average of 30 rules and related forms
have been issued per year, since 1991. The need for an additional 200 rules and forms has been
determined, of which about 50% are directly related to accounting, auditing, record-keeping, inspections,
8



reporting and disclosure. The project would support the technical assistance needed in the formulation
of these new rules. This assistance will be highly specialized covering such areas as securities industry
and capital markets regulation, surveillance and inspection. To develop important Ministry of Finance
capabilities in these areas, the project would also support overseas advanced degree programs and
specialized overseas short-term training for key regulatory staff. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Government that 30 capital market rules and 10 disclosure guidelines will be adopted
by October 31, 1997 (paragraph 4.16).
2.16       Enforcement of accounting and auditing standards also is achieved through provisions in
company and commercial law and associated ministerial decrees. Hence the project would support limited
but important technical assistance to ensure effective coordination among the law and decree-making,
standard-setting, capital market rule-making and professional accountants licensing and supervision
activities.
D.         Project Costs and Financing Plan
2.17       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$33.9 million equivalent, with a foreign-
exchange requirement of US$21.4 million or 63% of total costs. The estimated cost by project
component is summarized in Table 2.1 and by category of expenditure in Table 2.2. More detailed costs
by component and category are given in Annex 1.
2.18       Base costs are expressed at February 1994 prices. Technical assistance costs are based on
current actual unit costs for work that would be a continuation from the first project, estimates from
consultant contracts for work not currently financed by the Bank, for example, in capital market
regulations and consideration of relevant comparators. Overseas degree programs are estimated at
US$50,000 per year per program. Short-term overseas training of 3 to 6 months duration is estimated
at US$15,000 per person. Estimates of equipment costs are based on equipment lists under each project
activity as estimated by the Government and reviewed by the Bank, and primarily include computer
workstations. Incremental operating costs (i.e. honoraria and allowances, materials, administrative travel,
facility rental) directly attributable to project activities are included in the project and amount to about
10% of project base costs. Taxes are estimated at US$1.2 million.

IV. PROJECT LEMEIAON PLAN
A.         Status of Project Preparation
4.1        The proposed project is ready for immediate implementation, having been prepared with
technical assistance under the ongoing First Accountancy Development Project (Loan 2940-IND). Also,
many of the principal activities under this project, including all the computerized systems work and much
of the work relating to the setting and enforcement of standards, was begun under the first project.
Terms of reference for the major technical assistance contracts have been prepared and reviewed by the
Bank. In addition, the various mechanisms and procedures for selecting, testing and placing students in
the overseas training programs have already been established under the first project. Hence, all of the
proposed project activities can be expected to commence without undue delay.
B.         Project Monitoring and Evaluation
4.2        The project would be implemented over a period of five and one-half years, with an
expected completion date of January 31, 2000 and a closing date of July 31, 2000. The significant
milestone events identified in Table 4.1 will be used as a basis for monitoring and evaluating the
implementation of the project. A major mid-term review of the project is planned for November 1997.
This review would comprise a thorough assessment of project activities with respect to achievement and
sustainability of project objectives. At this time, revised action plans or project restructuring, as
appropriate, would be considered to ensure overall project success.
C.         Project Accounting. Reporting and Auditing
4.3        The Project Support Services Unit (PSSU) will have overall responsibility for monitoring
project costs, adherence to schedules and quality of work performed. It will receive monthly reports
from heads of the Government units managing the principal project activities, from which it will prepare
overall project summary progress reports. These summary progress reports will be provided to the Bank
on a semi-annual basis. These reports will summarize project expenditures by major project activity and
category of expenditure. They also will report work progress relative to the major project milestone
events, and will highlight any issues pertaining to work quality. To enable the PSSU to monitor project
finances, assurances were obtained during negotiations that systems and procedures for project accounting
satisfactory to the Bank will be established and documented. On an annual basis, a report summarizing
project expenditures for the year and cumulative to date will be audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and submitted to the Bank, no later than 180 days after the close of the reporting
period. Audited statements of Special Account activity, and an auditors report on Statements of
Expenditure used with loan withdrawal applications also will be submitted to the Bank, no later than 180
days after the close of the reporting period (paragraph 4.17).

4.4          Project Elements. Estimated Costs and Methods of Procurement. Table 4.2 summarizes the
project elements and their estimated costs and proposed methods of procurement. As part of project
preparation, equipment lists and arrangements for consultant services and training programs have been
developed and found acceptable to the Bank. International competitive bidding will be employed for data
processing equipment and software. The Bank's Guidelines for Use of Consultants will be used for the
services of foreign and local specialists that will be provided by consulting firms as a team, as well as
for individual foreign consultants.

/b   Services should be procured in accordance with World Bank Guideline: Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and
by the World Bank as Executing Agency (Washington D.C., August 1981).
4.5          Contracts for consulting  services would  cover: (a) government accounting  system
modernization; (b) technical assistance related to the development of accounting and auditing standards
and accounting profession development; and (c) technical assistance related to the enforcement of
17



standards through the capital markets regulatory process. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will
be used for equipment procurement under ICB and the Bank's standard contract form would be used for
all large technical assistance contracts. The threshold for the Bank's prior review for consultancies,
including management services for overseas training programs, will be US$100,000 for firms and
US$50,000 for individual contracts. Hiring of some local individual consultants, in-country training and
other miscellaneous expenditures, paid out of the Borrower's own resources, will be procured using
government administrative procedures found acceptable to the Bank.
4.6        Eguipme . All of the procurement in this category comprises computers, computer
workstations and associated data processing items. A summary of these items related to each government
unit is given in Table 4.3. Tenders for this type of equipment would be packaged so as to facilitate bulk
procurement through ICB, phased over the project implementation period, with about 52% occurring in
1995. In comparison of bids for equipment under ICB procedures, local manufacturers would be given
a margin of preference of 15% of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or the actual customs duty,
whichever is lower. Prior Bank review of bidding documents and proposed contract awards would be
required for all contracts for equipment.

4.7        Technical Assistance. Technical assistance under the project amounts to US$17.3 million
dollars or 51% of total project cost. This technical assistance represents 499 staffmonths of foreign
specialists and 1467 staffmonths of local specialists. It is anticipated that there will be 4 to 7 contracts
for consultancy services, ranging in value from about US$0.4 million to about US$6 million. Table 4.4
summarizes the technical assistance procurement by each government unit in the project and Table 4.5
summarizes the major technical assistance contracts. The contracts relating to capital markets regulations
18



and support for overseas training programs represent an expansion of technical assistance efforts
underway in MOF. The Government has prepared detailed terms of reference for assistance related to
the Government accounting system work and standard setting and capital markets rule making. The Bank
reviewed these at negotiations and has found them to be acceptable. This will enable the project to have
most consultants mobilized by no later than June 30, 1995 (see Table 4.1). Terms of reference for
accounting profession development will be prepared after a determination of the appropriate approach to
be used in Indonesia has been made. Annex 3 outlines the terms of reference for the major contracts,
reflecting the agreed scope and substance of the technical assistance. The detailed terms of reference are
available in the project files.

4.8           Overseas Training. The Ministry of Finance has contracted with fellowship management
agencies for assistance in participant selection, program recommendation and placement, predeparture
language and other skills training and academic monitoring and reporting, for both overseas degree
programs and specialized short-term programs. This arrangement has been effective and has been serving
the overseas training needs for various projects, both within the MOF as well as some other government
agencies. This project will use such MOF-contracted services to assist with specialized Masters degree
20



programs for approximately 29 students and specialized short-term (3-6 months) training programs for
approximately 110 students. The amounts- estimated for these overseas programs in Table 4.4 include
a provision for the cost of the related management agency services. Table 4.6 identifies the number of
students, by MOF agency, who will be taking specific degree programs. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from the Government that at least 18 candidates for overseas degree programs will be
enrolled by September 30, 1997 (paragraph 4.16).

thoroughly familiar with the Bank's procurement guidelines, having performed this function in the first
project. Contracts will be subject to the Ministry of Finance's normal approval mechanisms; after they
have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and reviewed by the Bank, all contracts will be signed
by the head of the PSSU.
4.10       Inlementation Schedule. The implementation schedule is shown in Table 4.7, from which
the estimated disbursement schedule (Table 4.8) has been derived. To encourage prompt action on the
part of the Borrower, milestones for the mobilization of consultants have been agreed and will be
monitored during project supervision (Table 4.1). Procurement information will include: (a) prompt
reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b) comprehensive six-monthly reports to the
Bank by the PSSU indicating revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project; and (c)
an implementation completion report by the Borrower within six months of the loan's closing date.

4.11        Disbursements. The proposed loan of US$25.0 million would be disbursed over a period
of five and one-half years. Disbursements would be made against the following categories of
expenditures: (a) for equipment, 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory)
for locally manufactured goods and 65% of expenditures for other locally procured items; (b) for
technical assistance, 100% of all expenditures; and (c) 100% of overseas training.
4.12        The estimated schedule of loan disbursements based on the project implementation schedule
is shown in Table 4.8.

4.13        Withdrawal applications would be fully documented for all expenditures against which loan
disbursements would be made. The use of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) would be required for
individual consultant contracts valued at less than US$50,000 and consulting firm contracts valued at less
than US$100,000. In order to avoid the necessity of prefinancing expenditures which are reimbursable
by the Bank and to simplify and expedite disbursement administration, the Government would establish
a Special Account in Bank Indonesia to be maintained by the Directorate General of Budget, MOF. The
22



Special Account would be used for all eligible expenditures made against all disbursement categories.
The Bank would make an initial deposit of US$1 million for eligible expenditures to the Special Account
upon loan effectiveness and upon confirmation of the establishment of the Special Account.
Replenishment to the Special Account will be made on a monthly basis or when 20% of the initial deposit
has been used on the basis of replenishment requests with supporting documents satisfactory to the Bank.
A quarterly statement on the Special Account would be submitted to the Bank by the Directorate General
of Budget, MOF.
E.         Project Benefits and Risks
4.14       It is expected that a comprehensive set of national accounting and auditing standards
consistent with accepted international standards will be issued and enforced by the end of the project
implementation period. This would provide a foundation for more useful and credible financial reporting
and disclosure for enterprises in both the private and public sectors. The accountancy profession will be
significantly enhanced through more rigorous examinations for the licensing of public accountants, and
through a program of required continuing professional education for such accountants. Standard-setting
and capital market rule-making will be more effectively coordinated with the broader commercial law
reform effort. An improved computerized government accounting system will have become operational,
providing the Government with the means to more efficiently plan, monitor and control budgetary
expenditures. As such, the project will have a broad impact on improving economic efficiency, in both
the financial and real sectors.
4.15       While the Government is committed to improved enterprise reporting and disclosure,
resistance to the changes which are to be introduced could come from some stakeholders. This could
limit or delay the extent to which needed actions or decisions may be taken. Also, the technical
complexity of the accounting information systems work produces implementation risks. The project
planning and control techniques that will be used for the project would limit these risks; and the project
has been structured in a way that corrective actions may be taken during annual work program and budget
reviews as well as through a mid-term review exercise.
F.              Agreements Reached and Recommendation
4.16       During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the timely achievement, and in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank, of the following planned events which are critical to meeting project objectives:
(a)   Detailed approach and workplan for professional accountant
qualifying examinations adopted (paragraph 2.14).           June 30, 1996
(b)   Government Accounting System Second Release (GAS R.2.0)
requirements documents completed (paragraph 2.10).          July 31, 1996
(c)   At least 15 accounting and 15 auditing standards officially adopted    May 31, 1997
(paragraph 2.14).
(d)   At least 18 overseas degree program candidates enrolled (paragraph   September 30, 1997
4.8).
23



(e)   At least 30 new rules and 10 disclosure guidelines for the regulation
of capital markets adopted (paragraph 2.15).                October 31, 1997
(f)   Pilot data communications system implemented (paragraph 2.11).  November 30, 1997
(g)   Acceptance tests of GAS R.2.0 successfully completed (paragraph    November 30, 1997
2.10).
(h)   40 accounting and 16 auditing standards officially adopted  July 31, 1999
(paragraph 2.14).
4.17       In addition, assurances were obtained from the Government during negotiations that:
(a)  by November 30, 1997, a mid-term review of the project would be carried out to assess the
achievement and sustainability of the objectives of the Project and to take any corrective
measures, as needed (paragraph 4.2).
(b)  the PSSU would monitor all aspects of project implementation throughout the project and
would furnish promptly to the Bank semi-annual progress reports. For this purpose, the
PSSU will adopt and maintain systems and procedures for monitoring the project,
satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 4.3).
(c)  annual work programs and budgets would be reviewed with the Bank, and the project would
be carried out in accordance with such work programs and budgets (paragraph 4.3).
(d)  project accounts would be kept in accordance with sound accounting practice. All accounts
and statements of expenditures for each fiscal year, including the Special Account, would
be prepared and audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and would be
furnished to the Bank, together with the auditor's report as soon as possible but not later
than six months after the end of each Government fiscal year. Six months after the closing
date, the Government would submit to the Bank an implementation completion report
covering all project components (paragraph 4.3).
4.18       Subject to the above agreements and conditions, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$25.0 million to the Republic of Indonesia, repayable in 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
