PHILIPPINES
SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
i.        The Government of the Philippines (GOP) has requested a Bank
loan of $12.0 million to finance the continuation of the ongoing Bank-
financed (first) Fisheries Credit Project (Loan 891-PH, $11.6 million,
1973). The objective would be to assist the Philippine Government in
its effort to increase fish production for domestic consumption and to
build up an institutional base for financing investments in marine and
inland fisheries. GOP would onlend the proceeds of the loan to the
Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to support a three year lending
program for fisheries facilities to be owned and operated by private
entrepreneurs in the Philippines.
ii.       The first Fisheries Credit Project is progressing satisfactori-
ly, and, as of April 30, 1976, Bank disbursement was $3.5 million, and
DBP is expected fully to commit the remaining funds by December 1976.
iii.      The first project consisted of three major components; (i) fi-
nancing of viable marine fisheries sub-projects, (ii) financing of inland
fishpond development and rehabilitation, mainly for milkfish farming,
and (iii) technical assistance required to support lending operations and
to build up DBP's technical capability for providing medium and long-term
fisheries development financing.
iv.       The proposed project would be the fifteenth Bank/IDA project for
agricultural development in the Philippines, and the tenth Bank project
involving on-lending through DBP.
v.        DBP, a wholly Government-owned development bank, is the single
largest source of long-term funds in the Philippines. Since its inception,
it has approved financial assistance totalling nearly $3 billion. About 25%
of its long-term loan portfolio is in agriculture. In FY75, DBP's total
lending reached $320 million, of which 23% was to agriculture. The volume
and diversity of DBP's operations give it a prominent and unique role as
the Government arm for financing economic development.
vi.       The project would provide credit to the private sector for the
construction of about 380 new and rehabilitated milkfish ponds, construc-
tion of 17 fishing boats in the 45 and 90 gross ton classes, refitting of 4
second-hand fishing vessels into fish carrier boats, construction of 3 ice
plants with cold storage, and a marine slipway.
vii.      Although fisheries contribute only 4% of GNP, it is an important
economic activity in the Philippines. The archipelago with over 7,000
islands provides excellent access to productive marine fisheries, and the
coastline with its many estuarine areas is ideal for brackish water fish



- ii -
farming. Fisheries employ directly about 700,000 persons (about 5% of
total employment) mainly in the traditional sector. Fish is a staple in
the Filipino diet and provides over one-third of animal protein. Fish im-
ports for human consumption, mainly canned mackerel and sardines, stood in
1974 at about $32 million per annum, equivalent to about 120,000 tons of
fresh fish, and the demand for marine products is growing rapidly. The
Government aims at self-sufficiency in fish production, and the proposed
project would help meet that objective.
viii.     The estimated total project cost is $23.5 million.  The Bank
would finance $12.0 million, representing 50% of the inland sector project
cost, and the foreign exchange component of the marine sector. The Bank
loan would be for 18 years including a five-year grace period.
ix.       Sub-loans would be for a maximum of 14 years including a three-year
maximum grace period, at interest rates of 12% per annum for loans secured
by land and 14% for others. Subloans in excess of $600,000 would be subject
to prior Bank approval.
x.        Contracts for construction of ice plants or the slipway with an
estimated cost of $200,000 or more would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank guidelines, and those
of $100,000 or more but less than $200,000 would be let through local com-
petitive bidding in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Contracts for ice plants or the slipway costing less than $100,000 would be
let through ordinary commercial channels. Equipment for vessels, such as
engines, winches, fishing gear and electronic instrument would be procured on
the basis of quotations received from firms prequalified through international
advertisement. Bulking of contracts would not be feasible because of the
geographic and temporal spread of the sub-projects, and the need to take
sub-borrowers' preferences into account, including compatibility with existing
equipment.
xi.       The estimated financial rates of return range from 17% to 39%,
with a weighted average of 27%. The estimated overall economic rate of
return is 30%. The benefits consist primarily in increasing fish production
and in strengthening DBP's capabilities for fisheries development financing.
The project annual production would be about 26,000 tons of fish, with an
estimated value of about $10.8 million.
xii.      The project would create about 1,000 new jobs directly required
for the sub-projects. Virtually all of these would be filled by those in
the rural poverty target group. In addition, the marketing of the project
production of some 26,000 tons of fish per annum is expected to generate
about 150,000 man-days of employment per year.
xiii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of $12.0 million repayable
over 18 years including a five-year grace period.

SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Philippines (GOP) has requested a Bank loan
of $12.0 million to finance continuation of the ongoing Bank-financed Fish-
eries Credit Project (Loan 891-PH), which loan is expected to be fully com-
mitted by December 1976.
1.02      As under the first project, the loan would be made to GOP which
would on-lend the proceeds to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
under a subsidiary loan agreement, and DBP would, out of the loan proceeds
and its counterpart funds, provide medium and long-term loans to private fish-
eries operators for financing fisheries and related facilities. The loan
would be the Bank's sixteenth project for the Philippine agricultural sec-
tor, 1/ and it would finance about 17 fishing vessels, four fish carrier
vessels, three ice plants, one slipway, and 380 fishpond sub-projects. The
fishing vessels would be of the 45 to 90 gross ton classes, and the fishponds
are expected to have an average size of 24 hectares. All of these elements
are expected to make contributions to the modernization of marine fisheries
and the expansion and rehabilitation of inland fisheries.
1.03      In April 1975, DBP sent the Bank a project proposal for the Second
Fisheries Project. In August/September 1975, an appraisal mission composed
of Messrs. D. Lee, S. Ettinger and L. Sprague (Bank) visited the Philippines.
The report is based on the findings of the mission.

II. THE FISHERIES SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
2.01      As in all other countries in the region, fisheries play a very
important role in the national food economy of the Philippines. During the
past decade, fish production in the Philippines more than doubled, from
550,000 tons in 1963 to 1,200,000 tons in 1973, and per capita consumption
increased by 50%, from 20 kg to 30 kg.
2.02      Fish and other marine products are a staple in the Filipino diet.
The estimated total fisheries production of 1.3 million tons for 1974 con-
sisted of 684,000 tons (53%) from the municipal fisheries, 471,000 tons (38%)
from the commercial, and 113,000 tons (9%) from the inland fisheries. The
Government estimates that fisheries accounted for about 4% of gross national
product in recent years and about 11% of the agricultural sector. Fisheries
employment has been estimated to be about 700,000 (about 5% of total employ-
ment), most of whom are subsistence fishermen.
2.03      The Philippines has been a net importer of fish and fish products
but is expected to become a substantial net exporter during the coming decade.
The estimated 1974 fish import of $32 million consisted of 42,000 tons of
canned mackerel ($26 million), 3,500 tons of canned sardine ($2.5 million)
and 10,500 tons of other processed fish products ($3.5 million), including
9,300 tons of fishmeal. The $18 million exports for the same year consisted
of 1,700 tons of frozen shrimp (estimated $5 million) and 11,400 tons of
frozen tuna ($7.0 million). These two export items appear to have potentials
for substantial expansion.
2.04      With the estimated 1973 consumption of 1.2 million tons as the
base, the demand for fish is estimated to increase by at least 6% per year,
which is about the rate at which the marine fisheries production reportedly
expanded during the 1968-73 period. Since the sustainable yields from the
Philippine waters are estimated to be at least about 1.7 million tons, con-
sisting of 0.7 million for the municipal (subsistence) and 1.0 million tons
for the commercial fisheries, the resource base would not be a constraint for
the industry in meeting the production requirement. Because the scope for
further expansion of the municipal fisheries catch is now rather limited,
however, much of the additional production would have to come from the commer-
cial fisheries. Since the present scale of investment in the commercial
fisheries appears to be grossly inadequate to meet the projected production
requirement, however, an increasing fish deficit is anticipated for the coming
years.
Fishing Industry
2.05      The fishing industry of the Philippines is classified into two
major categories, the marine and the inland fisheries. The marine fisheries
are further sub-divided into the municipal and the commercial fisheries
(Annex 1 discusses the marine fisheries and Annex 2 the inland).



-3-
Municipal Fisheries
2.06      Although the municipal fisheries account for about 53% of the total
fisheries production, not much is known about this subsector. It is made up
largely of subsistence, artisanal, and part-time fishermen-farmers, timber
workers, etc. It involves, by and large, unmotorized small boats (bancas)
of not more than 3 gross tons. In 1974, these fisheries, engaging approxi-
mately 500,000 subsistence fishermen, operated about 27,000 fishing boats
and produced some 684,000 metric tons, 61% of the total marine fisheries
production.
2.07      Despite the lack of reliable statistical information, it is clear
that, in the more densely populated areas, the limits of fisheries resources
available to municipal fishermen have been reached, and any significant in-
crease in fishing effort in these areas would only serve to lessen the pro-
ductivity per fisherman which is on the average thought to be already as
low as one or two tons per year. In the less populated areas, on the other
hand, there appears to be considerable scope for increasing the catch, but
the lack of suitable transportation and marketing facilities tends to make
it unprofitable to catch more than the isolated markets can absorb without
depressing the prices unduly.
Commercial Fisheries
2.08      The commercial fisheries fleet comprises an estimated 2,500 ves-
sels with tonnage capacities ranging from 3 gross tons to over 100 (see
Annex 1, Table 2). The fleet is operated by some 1,500 fishing operators,
based mostly in Manila and around the Visayan Sea. In the last ten years,
there has been a gradual reduction in the number of small vessels (less than
10 tons) and a substantial increase in the number of larger vessels (50
tons or more). Most fish are caught by trawl, purse seine, and bagnet.
The reported 1974 catch of 471,000 tons by the commercial fisheries consisted
of 65 major species, but five dominant species accounted for 60% of the total
(round scad 35%, slipmouth 9%, sardines 3%, chub mackerel 7% and breams 6%).
2.09      The nature of the chief problem for the fishing industry has
changed categorically during the past several years. Before the oil crisis
of 1973, the most serious problem was over-fishing on the traditional fish-
ing grounds, and the appropriate response to this was to build boats capable
of reaching more distant grounds and equip them with more powerful engines
and larger trawl fishing gear. The fishermen adopting this approach found
it quite profitable. The situation changed fundamentally, however, because
of the sharply increased oil prices. The larger trawls and more powerful
engines proved to be a highly oil-intensive method of catching, and the
tripling and quadrupling of the pump price of fuel oil made the more power-
ful trawlers much less financially viable. The industry now has to adapt
itself to fishing methods that are less oil-intensive, and many operators
are in fact showing a tendency to prefer (i) smaller vessels, (ii) less oil-
intensive methods of catching such as purse seining, and (iii) vessels which
have more flexible capabilities (for example, trawling as well as purse
seining).



-4-
Inland Fisheries
2.10      The Philippines is among the leading countries in the region in
developing brackish water culture, milkfish culture in particular. The
milkfish, Chanos chanos, locally called "Bangus" is the main species culti-
vated. The milkfish is found in the warm waters of the Indian and Pacific
Ocean. Fully grown they may weigh up to 30 kg, but the commercially culti-
vated milkfish are marketed at about 250-1,200 grams.
2.11      The estimated 1974 production of milkfish was 110,000 tons and ac-
counted for more than 97% of the entire inland fisheries production, which
includes some tilapia, mullet, shrimp and crab (these minor species are culti-
vated as incidental products as they enter the ponds with the inflow of water).
Although the average milkfish yield of 600 kg/ha/yr in the Philippines is
considerably higher than the 300 kg/ha/yr average for Indonesia, it is far
below the 1,700-2,000 kg/ha/yr average obtained in Taiwan. There are large
production potentials to be achieved by enhancing the average yield.
2.12      In 1974, there were 176,000 ha of fishponds, including 6,000 ha of
freshwater ponds. About half of the total fishpond areas is leased from the
Government under long-term arrangements (up to 25 years, renewable for another
25 years) and the remainder is privately owned. Potentially the fishpond
areas could be expanded about threefold, judging from the swampland classi-
fied as suitable for fishpond development. However, lack of infrastructure
(roads and distribution facilities), distance from major markets, and the
marginal quality of much of the remaining swampland reduce the scope for
immediate realization of this potential.
Shore Facilities
2.13      Despite the importance of fisheries, there has been a surprising lack
of specialized fishing port facilities. Even at Navotas at Manila, which
handles the bulk of all Philippine landings, fish are brought in by amphibious
trucks from vessels anchored over a mile offshore. Partly financed with a
$5.7 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a project is under-
way to develop Navotas as a well equipped fishing port, involving dredging
an approach channel, anchorage reclamation of the foreshore area, and construc-
tion of breakwaters, piers, wharves, quay walls and a fish marketing building.
The facility is expected to be operational in 1976. Existing ice-making fa-
cilities, transport equipment, cold storage facilities, auction halls and the
like, are inadequate and any large-scale increase in fish production would
require expansion and provision of new facilities.
Boat Building
2.14      The construction of fishing boats in the Philippines is carried
out at shipyards near Navotas, and in many small private shipyards in the
Visayas. In the Visayas, a considerable number of independent contractors
capable of building wooden vessels have successfully developed methods of
construction which require low fixed capital overhead in the form of ship-
ways and conventional shipyard infrastructure. The quality of the vessels
is satisfactory, boat building is usually well supervised by the owner, and



-5-
the costs of the vessels are quite competitive with those of the comparable
ones in other countries in the region.
Marketing
2.15      Most of the fish is sold fresh, because of strong consumer prefer-
ence. Where fish is iced for transport, the ice is usually removed before
sale in order to give it a fresh appearance. Because of the limited storage
and distribution capacity and the consumer resistance to chilled or iced
fish, rural fresh fish markets are easily saturated, even where there is
unsatisfied demand in the vicinity. The excess fish is sold for process-
ing (drying and smoking), at greatly reduced prices.
2.16      Fish wholesale markets in the Manila area are located at Navotas,
Malabon and Divisoria. Most fishing vessels discharge fish at Navotas. Sort-
ing takes place on board and sales are by tubs. Auctioning takes place at all
three markets by a method of secret oral bidding, the buyers whispering their
bids to the broker who, on the basis of the prices offered and his assessment
of the collectability, decides which bidder should be the buyer. This system
of "whisper bid" appears to be functioning well in the Philippine context
where the collectability is perhaps a more important factor than the bid
price. A small number of brokers, probably 6 to 8, control the marketing at
Navotas. The brokers charge a 3 to 6% commission depending on the services
performed such as loading and unloading, provision of containers, supply of
ice (especially for milkfish), and advances for working capital. The Malabon
market handles most of the milkfish and milkfish fry arriving in Manila, but
the Navotas market is rapidly increasing its milkfish trade. There are some
minor wholesale markets in the larger cities in the provinces with access to
the sea, but these are very small. Retailing in the Manila area takes place
through some 100 central markets with special fish sections. In addition,
there are a large number of door-to-door vendors. Retail of processed fish
takes place in the grocery sections. There is a substantial demand for
processed fish in the inland areas, and it is estimated that at least about
25% of the total catch is diverted to salting, drying, smoking and making of
fish paste and fish sauce. Low value fish like anchovies, slipmouth and round
scad are the usual raw materials for this processing. Freezing of tuna and
shrimp for exports is increasing, and a few small fish canning plants are
being established.
Extension, Education and Research
2.17      Inland fisheries research and extension services are provided pri-
marily by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR). The College
of Fisheries, University of the Philippines (UP), also conducts research.
BFAR has a large staff and its facilities are reasonably well developed,
and the quality and effectiveness of its service appear to be improving.
The establishment of a marine Fisheries Training Center with UNDP assist-
ance is presently under discussion. This center would provide on-the-job
training for captains and fishermen in modern equipment and fishing gear.
Further training is being provided by UP and numerous fisheries schools.
BFAR operates four training vessels which are used to demonstrate improved



-6-
fishing techniques, and to undertake experimental fishing surveys and ex-
plorations. The recent addition of two more research vessels has provided
the means to conduct test fishing programs to determine the marine resource
base more accurately.
Fisheries Credit
2.18      The most important institutional sources for medium and long-term
credit for the fisheries sector are, in order of importance, DBP, commercial
banks, rural banks, savings and loan associations and private development
banks. DBP has been by far the most important source and is expected to
play the leading role in financing the bulk of fisheries investments in the
coming decade.
Fisheries Administration
2.19      In November 1972, the Government issued a Presidential Decree No. 43
to provide policy guidance and to coordinate and delineate the various activi-
ties of the participating agencies of the fishing industry. This was followed
by another Presidential Decree (No. 704) in 1975 which further clarified
fisheries administration and the laws regulating the fishing industry. The
overall responsibility for policy coordination is vested in BFAR as a Direc-
torate under the Department of Natural Resources. As a result, BFAR functions
include coordination of training, research and extension as well as administra-
tion and regulation. The only major function outside BFAR relates to extension
of credit, although the decree envisages the establishment of a development
fund to provide finance for special programs, which are yet to be defined in
detail. In 1973, BFAR's staff totalled over 1,600. Of these, about 25% were
employed on inland fisheries extension and 20% on the improvement of the
marine fisheries sector.
Development Policies
2.20      The Government attaches a high priority to increasing fish produc-
tion. The program envisaged for the sector calls for (i) better knowledge
of the resource base, (ii) improved extension and training services, (iii)
provision of better infrastructure (ice plants and other shore facilities),
and (iv) strengthening of financial institutions and credit resources. In
addition, the Government seeks to reduce the fish deficit as rapidly as
possible (para 6.01), and to promote the effects of income redistribution
the commercial fisheries sub-projects facilitate in favor of the Visayan and
other southern provinces.
III. THE FIRST FISHERIES PROJECT
3.01      The Loan Agreement for the ongoing first Fisheries Credit Project
(891-PH) was signed on May 21, 1973, and became effective September 25,
1973 (inland sector) and December 5, 1973 (marine sector).  It provided for



-7-
an $11.6 million loan to the Government of the Philippines to be on-lent to
the Development Bank of the Philippines to carry out a program for development
of marine and inland fisheries.
3.02      The project consisted of three major components; (i) financing of
viable marine fisheries sub-projects, (ii) financing of inland fishpond
development and rehabilitation mainly for milkfish-farming, and (iii) tech-
nical assistance required to support the lending operation and to build up
the technical capability of DBP for long-term fisheries development work.
3.03      The marine fisheries component envisaged financing of (a) construc-
tion of 60 fully equipped fishing vessels of the 70 to 130 ton class, (b)
importation of 10 second-hand fish carrier boats, (c) construction of 3 ice
plants, and (d) 2 slipways.
3.04      The inland fisheries component was to provide credit to indi-
viduals for rehabilitation of 4,500 ha of flood-damaged fishponds to restore
full production and for improvement of existing ponds and construction of
new ones with an aggregate area of 7,500 hectares.
3.05      The technical assistant component included provision for (a) a
marine specialist and a naval architect to assist the Assistant Manager
(Project Administrator), (b) a study of fish marketing and distribution
to be carried out by consultants to aid future fisheries investment plans,
(c) a feasibility study for a smallholder (milkfish) fishpond estate scheme,
(d) an aquaculture extension specialist to assist the Government to orga-
nize and execute an inland fisheries technical training program, and (e)
a test fishing program to obtain marine fisheries resource data.
Project Implementation
3.06      Marine Fisheries.  There was a considerable delay in implementing
this component. It took longer than expected to staff the Fisheries Group
(FG) of DBP and prepare it to implement the rather complex project activities,
such as selecting consultants for the two studies, evolving working procedures
with the Bureau of Fisheries and with consultants, and developing suitable
fishing vessel designs. As FG prepared itself for project implementation,
the oil crisis came and seriously impaired the business outlook for marine
fisheries. There was a sharp increase in the cost of vessels (from the
appraisal estimate of about $60,000 for 70 gross ton vessel to an actual cost
of about $200,000), and also in the operating cost for the oil intensive
trawler operations. The designs of the fishing vessels had to be modified
to reflect higher oil prices, so that the vessels had to have more flexible
capabilities and be less dependent on oil-intensive techniques. Steel
vessels became so costly that they were no longer financially and econo-
mically viable (cost of steel vessels rose considerably more than these
for comparable wooden vessels). Moreover, the sharply increased fuel cost
associated with steel vessels, which are more fuel-intensive than wooden
vessels, are expected to have operating costs greater than the net sales.
As of February 1976, 19 wooden vessels had been approved, and the project
is expected to finance about 25 wooden vessels, compared with the original
target of 60 vessels (15 steel vessels and 45 wooden vessels). As of



-8-
February 1976, all of the three ice plants originally projected had been
approved. Because of the greatly increased investment cost, however, the
rate of commitment has been higher than the number of sub-projects might
suggest. As of February 1976, $2.9 million out of $5.9 million of the Bank
loan allocated for the marine sector was committed. As most of the sub-
projects are still in the gestation stage, it is still premature to deter-
mine their productivity and financial and economic rates of return. It
appears, however, that most of the sub-projects would be financially and
economically viable.
3.07      Inland Fisheries.  From the outset, the lending for the inland sec-
tor maintained a fairly rapid pace. As of February 1976, 383 sub-projects
covering a total of about 9,300 ha for total subloans of about P 46.5 million
($6.2 million) had been approved.  The average fishpond financed was about
24 ha at an average cost of about P 5,000/ha.  About 37% of the loans were in
Luzon, 42% in the Visayas, 14% in Mindanao and 7% in other provinces.  DBP
experience shows that good fishpond management coupled with appropriate inputs
can raise milkfish production to the levels of 2,500 kg/ha/yr achieved by
successful commercial fish farmers in Taiwan.  Milkfish production of well
managed DBP fish-farms appears to be between about 1,600 kg and 2,100 kg/ha/yr,
depending on the location of the ponds, the type of management system prac-
ticed and the inputs used. FG has done well in organizing itself in the
inland sector and has developed a capable technical and financial staff who
have been active in investment colunciling, in loan preparation, and appraisal.
There appears to be, however, a need to strengthen the loan supervision staff
in order to derive better measures of the impact of the lending program on
overall production and better measures of productivity.
3.08      Feasibility Studies.  Consultants were retained by the Bureau of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) to carry out two studies, (i) Small-
holder Fishpond Project Study, and (ii) Fish Marketing and Distribution
Study. The Smallholder Fishpond Project Study was conducted jointly by Sino-
tech Engineering Consultants, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan, and International Engi-
neering Co. Inc., San Francisco, California, USA. The study was technically
well done, but failed to demonstrate that the smallholder fishpond estate 1/
concept was technically, financially or economically sound. The Fish Mar-
keting and Distribution Study was carried out by Norconsult, A.S., Norway.
The study presents a large body of useful fisheries data and analyses.
3.09      Other Related Activities.  The first project included components
for (i) a test fishing program, and (ii) an inland fisheries training pro-
gram to be carried out by the Bureau of Fisheries. For the test fishing
1/  The "estate concept" here is for a scheme contemplated by the Philippine
government for development of large tracts of mangrove swampland, 1,500
to 3,000 ha, into fishpond estates to be sub-divided into hundreds of 3
to 5 ha plots to be farmed by local residents, mostly without previous
fish farming experience.



program, three fishing vessels of BFAR have conducted purse seining, trawl-
ing and longline cruises, primarily in trial fishing in the southern part
of the Philippines. These activities have made a significant contribution
towards a broader investigation of fisheries resources in the area. For
the inland fisheries training program, the Pond Fishery Extension and Train-
ing Group, under the BFAR direction, conducted training courses and field
extension service demonstrations in five principal field extension units.
This program, with courses in three subject areas, (i) general, (ii) exten-
sion teaching methods, and (iii) technical, has developed into one of the
best training programs of the kind in the region and has produced a number
of highly qualified extension personnel and teaching aides.
3.10      Sub-loan disbursement.  The rate of sub-loan processing in both the
inland and marine sub-sectors was increasing rapidly at the time of the last
supervision (February 1976). As of April 30, 1976, $3.5 million, out of a
commitment of $6.4 million of the Bank loan had been disbursed, and it is
expected that the Bank loan of $11.6 million would be fully committed by
December 1976 (full commitment might take place by as early as October 1976).
3.11      DBP Fisheries Group.  Although increased supervision staff is
needed for proper monitoring and supervision of the rapidly expanding inland
fisheries portfolio, and the technical staff in the marine sector needs to be
strenghtened, the performance of FG has been good. While DBP lending in
fisheries has not been a large part of the total lending activity in the
fisheries sector in the Philippines in the past, the changes in the structure
of the fishing industry which began about 1970, requiring a rapid expansion of
the catches of commercial fleet, would call for DBP to play a far more import-
ant role in financing fisheries investments. DBP is in a unique position to
develop its institutional and technical capabilities to a greater degree by
building on the experience gained in executing the first Fisheries Credit
Project.
IV. THE PROJECT
General Description
4.01      The project would be a continuation of the first Fisheries Credit
Project. The objective would be to assist the Philippine Government in its
effort to (i) increase fish production for domestic consumption, and (ii)
build up an institutional base for financing investments in marine and inland
fisheries. The project would continue financing viable medium-sized com-
mercial marine fisheries operations and the construction of new inland fish-
ponds as well as improvements of existing ones. A greater emphasis would
now be placed on upgrading of DBP's performance and standards for fisheries
investment promotion, project appraisal and supervision. In the course
of the project implementation, the Fisheries Group (FG) of DBP would be
further strengthened and would prepare itself to play an important role in
facilitating the greatly increased fisheries investments anticipated for the
coming decade. At full development, the fishponds financed under the project
would produce some 15,000 tons of additional milkfish per year and the 17
project fishing vessels would contribute an additional annual catch of about
10,000 tons.



- 10 -
4.02      Specifically, over a three-year investment period, the project
would provide credit to individuals and private companies for the following:
Inland Sector
(i) Construction of 114 new fishponds for milkfish farming,
(ii) Expansion and rehabilitation of 266 existing milkfish ponds,
Marine Sector
(iii) Construction of 14 90-gross ton fishing vessels,
(iv)  Construction of 3 45-gross ton fish vessels,
(v)  Conversion of 4 second-hand vessels into fish carrier
boats,
(vi)  Construction of 3 ice plants with cold storage, and
(vii) Construction of 1 slipway for repair of fishing vessels.
Detailed Features
4.03      Construction of New Fishponds.  The project would continue to fi-
nance, among others, the construction of new fishponds for milkfish farming.
Under the project, 114 new fishponds with a total of 2,700 hectares would
be financed. The size of the fishpond would vary greatly, depending upon the
nature of the land available and the operator's capacity for efficient manage-
ment. There are considerable economies of scale in investment costs for
fishponds up to about 30 hectares, and the standard commercial model adopted
by DBP, on the basis of the typical size of the fishpond sub-loans processed
(para 3.07 and Annex 4, para 8), involves a 24-hectare fishpond, with an
average investment cost of about P 11,000 ($1,470) per hectare. Annex 2,
paragraph 3 describes the essentials of fishpond construction.
4.04      Expansion and Rehabilitation of Existing Fishponds.  The project
would continue to finance expansion and rehabilitation of existing fishponds.
There are generally two types of investment under this category; (i) re-
habilitation of fishponds damaged by typhoons and flood and (ii) straight
expansion of existing fishponds. The project would finance expansion and
rehabilitation of 266 existing fishponds and facilitate full production from
about 6,400 hectares. These investments usually have greater financial and
economic viabilities than those for new fishponds. Unlike those for new
fishponds, the operators of existing ponds usually have demonstrated pond
management experience and skill. The investnient. cost per hectare is only
about P 6,500 ($860), much lower than that for new fishponds ($1,470). More
importantly, existing fishponds by and large have better natural conditions,
i.e., soil, water quality, proximity to markets, accessibility, etc.



- 11 -
4.05      Fishing Vessels.  The project would finance 17 fishing vessels, of
which 14 would be of the 90-gross ton class and 3 would be of the 45-gross
ton class. All of these vessels would have wooden hulls of a relatively
simple design (See schematic drawings with outline specifications), be powered
by diesel engines, equipped with trawl, and purse seine fishing gear, short-
wave radios, fish finders, and mechanical net hauling gear. The larger ves-
sel would have a crew of 25, and the smaller ones a crew of 17. DBP's naval
architect would evaluate the final design and specifications in consultation
with sub-borrowers. Because of the generally depressed state of the fishing
industry, the number of vessels projected for financing under the project
is only 17, very small relative to the existing fleet of about 1,000 vessels
of comparable tonnages. The most important consideration has been to maintain
continuity of DBP's lending operation in the marine sector, especially in
view of the eventuality that recovery from the present economic recession
would call for greatly expanded investments in the sector.
4.06      Conversion of Second-hand Vessels into Fish Carrier Boats.  The
project would finance acquisition of four second-hand vessels for conver-
sion and refitting into fish carrier boats. These boats would deliver ice,
fuel and other supplies to the vessels fishing on distant grounds and trans-
port fish from there to the markets. As a result of the sharply increased
oil prices, these specialized services have become one of the most effective
means of reducing the cost of fish landed by commercial fishing vessels.
There are dozens of second-hand vessel hulls on the market that are suitable
for conversion into fish carrier boats, and the carrier boats refitted out
of these inexpensive hulls appear to be at present the only way to provide
the specialized fish carrier services on a financially viable basis.
4.07      Ice Plants.  The project would finance three ice plants, each with
a capacity to produce 20 tons of ice and to hold 40 tons of fish in cold
storage. The plants would be located around the Visayan Sea, which would
serve as an advance base for the vessels fishing primarily for the Manila
market. Ice usage for marine fisheries has been rapidly increasing, and
the supply seems to be already very short. These plants would provide
the ice required for the vessels operating on the distant grounds and pro-
vide cold storage facilities for fish being held for better prices or those
to be collected by carrier boats for delivery to distant markets. Local
consultants engaged by the sub-borrowers would prepare the detailed design,
layout and engineering, if the estimated cost is $100,000 or more.
4.08      Slipway.  The project would finance a slipway at a suitable location
around the Visayan Sea to be used for repair and maintenance of fishing and
carrier vessels. At present, there is no suitable slipway and vessels in
need of repair are beached at high tide and repaired at low tide. The slipway
would be capable of servicing practically all categories of fishing vessels.
In the Philippines, there are a number of qualified consulting engineers
available to prepare design and provide engineering services for the purpose.
The sub-borrower would be required to hire such consultants for the prepara-
tion and execution of the sub-project, if the estimated cost is $100,000 or
more.

Project Cost
4.09      Total project cost is estimated at $23.5 million (P 176.0 million),
of which foreign exchange costs would be $6.3 million, or 27% of the total
(Annex 5 gives detailed project cost estimates). The estimated costs for
the different sub-project components are given in Annex 6 and summarized

Project Financing
4.11      The Bank would finance $12.0 million, representing, as under the
first project, 50% of the total cost of the inland sector (87% of which con-
sists of local cost) and the foreign exchange cost of the marine sector. The
beneficiaries of the inland sector would contribute 10% of the cost of invest-
ment project, and those of the marine sector would contribute a minimum of
20% of the cost of investment project, defined to exclude the cost of land 1/
and working capital.2/ DBP would make sub-loans in an amount not exceeding
90% of the cost of investment project under the inland sector and 80% of the
same under the marine sector. The Bank would reimburse DBP 61% of its sub-loans
for the cost of investment project (excluding working capital loan) for inland
sector (which would involve substantial local cost financing) and 71% of the
1/   The land required would be provided by the beneficiary.
2/   The working capital required would be provided by DBP out of its own
resources.



- 14 -
same for the marine sector. In the inland sector, most of the Bank funds
would be used to finance local costs. In view of the fact that the develop-
ment of this sub-sector is of a high priority, and that the requisite medium
and long term credit resources are not available from other sources, the
use of Bank funds for local cost financing appears justified, as fishpond
construction requires no foreign exchange components other than the watergate
systems of limited costs. The shares of Bank reimbursement are determined
on the basis of the formula that has been effective for the first Fisheries
Credit Project, i.e., in financing 50% of the total sub-project cost (includ-
ing the estimated incremental working capital) for the inland sector and
financing the estimated average foreign exchange cost of sub-project for the
marine sector. The corresponding shares of Bank reimbursement under the
first project have been 56% and 100% respectively. The differences in the
shares of Bank reimbursement between the first and the proposed project are
due to the fact that the present 56% under the first project was derived
from the assumption that there would be no incremental working capital for
the inland sector and that the marine sector's foreign exchange component
would be 100% of the DBP expenditure. It has been found that some provision
of incremental working capital would be essential for both the inland and
the marine sector and that it would be difficult for the sub-borrowers to
raise such funds from other sources. The working capital required for the
fishpond sub-projects would be mainly for the stock of fry, fish feed and
fertilizers for growing micro-organisms in the pond for fish feed - analogous
to the initial stock, feed concentrates and pasture development in animal
husbandry. In the marine sector, it would be mainly for start-up expenses.

Terms and Conditions of the Bank Loan
4.12      The Bank loan would be made to GOP for 18 years, including five
years' grace, at standard Bank lending rate of interest. A grace period of
five years would be a minimum consistent with a four-year disbursement period
and possible slippage in project implementation. It is not expected that
there would be any significant roll-ever. GOP would bear the foreign exchange
risk and would onlend the proceeds to DBP on the same terms under a subsidiary
loan agreement. This agreement would specify the main operating procedures to
be followed under the project, including the establishment of a separate
project account in which all receipts and payments for or in connection with
project implementation would be recorded. Execution of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and DBP, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a
condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan.
Terms and Conditions of Sub-loans
4.13      Sub-loans would be for qualified private individuals and companies.
Each sub-loan application would be filed either with the nearest DBP branch
or the head office. The application would give details of the applicant's
past experience, the purpose of the loan and the collateral offered. The



- 16 -
information would be sent to the Fisheries Group (FG) of DBP for further in-
vestigation. The sub-loans would be approved by DBP's Board of Governors,
on the basis of the findings of FG regarding such factors as applicant's
managerial and technical competence, and fisheries experience.
4.14      The first project provides for varying repayment terms for dif-
ferent items being financed, ranging from 4 to 12 years, in addition to vary-
ing grace periods, ranging from 1 to 4 years. These specific stipulations
have been found to be of little practical significance. The project would
introduce simplified sub-loan repayment terms of a maximum of 14 years in-
cluding a grace period not exceeding 3 years.
4.15      Based upon the interest schedule agreed at the negotiations for
the Second Industrial Investment Project, DBP would charge 12.0% per annum
for the loans secured by land and 14.0% for loans otherwise secured. Any
future change in the rates DBP charges on its loans in general would be
made applicable to commitment of sub-loans under the project. Since the
cost of the money to DBP would be about 8.6%, 1/ the margin would be a
minimum of 3.4% and there would be an additional 2.0% to cover the risks
on loans not secured by land, these rates should be adequate and, at the
same time, provide, in view of the Philippines' projected long-term in-
flation rate of 7.5%, an acceptable real rate of interest of 4.5 to 6.5%.
The borrowers would be required to pay other additional charges, such as
(i) a one-time application fee of P 60 to P 500 depending on the amount
of sub-loan, (ii) penalty interest charges of 2.0% per month on arrears
of 90 days or more (this 2.0% is scheduled to be raised to 3.0% effective
June 30, 1977), and (iii) DBP's appraisal and supervision costs for sub-
loans exceeding P 3.0 million, not to exceed 2.0% per annum on the loan
outstanding, etc. DBP normally finances up to 85% of the appraised value
of the collateral offered.
Free Limit
4.16      Any sub-loan which, together with any other sub-loan or working
capital loans to the same sub-borrowers under the first and second Bank-
financed fisheries projects, exceeded $600,000 would be subject to the Bank's
prior approval. Such sub-loans would be submitted to the Bank together with
DBP's project feasibility study demonstrating the technical, managerial,
financial and economic viability of the sub-project.
Procurement
4.17      The procurement procedures would be similar to those effective
under the first project.
1/   56% of DBP sub-loans would be reimbursed by the Bank at 8.5% annual
interest; the remainder would be covered by DBP's local funds with
marginal annual interest cost of 8.75%. The local funds come largely
from the public sector in the form of deposits, debentures and bonds.



- 17 -
4.18      Formal competitive bidding procedures would not be appropriate for
fishpond construction, rehabilitation, and improvements. The nature of work
to be done would vary widely from one sub-project to another, and the amount
involved would be normally small, ranging from about $7,000 to $70,000 per
sub-project, averaging about $25,000, scattered widely across the country.
Construction techniques are simple and the work would be done by manual labor,
which, in most cases, would be in part provided by the sub-borrowers themselves.
Sub-borrowers would be required to make appropriate arrangements, subject to
prior DBP approval, with local workers or contractors in their respective
area. DBP would maintain an up-to-date schedule, showing the cost of new
construction, rehabilitation, and expansion per unit of fishpond, for use in
determining the acceptability of the estimated project costs for inland
fisheries sub-projects.
4.19      Wooden hulls of the type required for relatively small vessels
proposed for financing under the project are constructed normally on a custom
basis on make-shift backyard sites in the Philippines, and are not suitable
for competitive bidding. The quality of the hulls produced is good and the
cost reasonable. The second-hand fishing vessels to be converted to fish
carriers would also be unsuitable for competitive bidding. These would,
therefore, be procured through ordinary commercial channels under the super-
vision of DBP, which would ensure that the cost is reasonable and that the
hulls procured conform to the standardized design criteria for the two cate-
gories of project vessels established by the DBP naval architect.
4.20      Contracts for ice plant or slipway estimated to cost $200,000 or
more would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines and those estimated to cost $100,000 or more
but less than $200,000 would be placed following local competitive bidding in
accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for ice plants
or slipway estimated to cost less than $100,000 would be let through ordinary
commercial channels, but with due regard for economy and efficiency.
4.21      Equipment for the vessels, such as main engines, winches, fishing
gear and electronic equipment is not usually manufactured in the Philippines,
but suppliers from several countries, mainly USA, Japan, Germany, UK and
Norway are already established there. Through international advertisement,
other suppliers would be encouraged to establish themselves and provide
adequate service facilities and spare parts inventories, and the market would
be open to suppliers meeting project standards and specifications. The
advertisement would indicate the approximate type of equipment and total
quantity required and potential suppliers would quote prices on various
quantities of each type of equipment. DBP would then assist the sub-borrower
in obtaining the make of equipment and quantity needed on the basis of these
quotations.
Disbursement
4.22      The Bank would reimburse 61% of DBP's disbursement for sub-loans
for investment projects (excluding land and working capital) for the inland



- 18 -
sector, representing 50% of total sub-project costs, and 71% likewise for the
marine sector, representing 100% of foreign exchange cost, upon submission of
documentation by DBP supported by statement of expenditure. Supporting docu-
mentation would be retained by DBP for review during the course of project
supervision.  An estimated quarterly schedule of disbursements appears in
Annex 8.
Audit and Accounts
4.23      Under the Second Industrial Investment Project through DBP (Loan
1190-PH), a series of measures were agreed to by DBP and the Commission on
Audit (COA) which are expected to result in substantial improvements in the
quality and coverage of the audit. In particular, COA will now undertake
a thorough review of DBP's portfolio with a view to determining its quality
and recommending appropriate corrective actions. Satisfactory progress is
being made in this direction and COA has already submitted an audit report
for FY75 in the form required by the Bank. The report is under review.
Furthermore, records and accounts pertaining to all Bank-financed agricul-
tural projects would be kept and audited separately; the depth and coverage
of this audit would be satisfactory. A copy of the audited report would
be sent to the Bank within three months of the close of the fiscal year
until full disbursement of the loan.
Reporting Requirements
4.24      Sub-borrowers Reports.  On the basis of a form agreed upon at
negotiations, sub-borrowers would report to DBP on their operations to enable
it to assess the impact of the sub-projects on an annual basis. The data
would include quantities and values of production, itemized production costs,
and indices of productivity to enable DBP to prepare and update financial and
economic analysis of sub-projects along the lines presented in the Cash Flow
Projections (Annex 11, Tables 1 - 7) and the Economic Analysis (Annex 12,
Tables 1 - 2).
4.25      DBP Reports.  DBP would be required to submit, in addition to the
summary report it submits to the Bank under the first Fisheries Credit Proj-
ect (891-PH), two sets of reports; (i) an annual summary report on the project
impact compiled on the basis of the form outlined in para. 4.24, and (ii) a
quarterly summary report on the state of its portfolio showing, among others,
the arrears position and the repayment collection on the fisheries loans, and
the ages of overdues, accounting for the Bank-financed sub-loans separately.
Assurances have been obtained at negotiations that DBP would furnish the Bank
these reports, at intervals not exceeding 12 months.
New Features of the Project
4.26      Fishing Vessel Design.  Experiences under the first project have
shown that rigid design specifications can be self-defeating in marine fish-
eries financing. The first project was designed for very different basic
financial parameters providing only for steel and wooden vessels of relatively



- 19 -
large tonnage classes (15 steel vessels of 130 gross ton class and 45 wooden
vessels of 70 gross ton class). Especially since the oil crisis, many fish-
ing operators found it more profitable to use smaller purse seine vessels.
The project, therefore, would be made more flexible in respect to the eligi-
bility of the tonnage classes of the vessels, and make all wooden vessels of
45 gross tons or more eligible.
4.27      Institution Building.  A major objective of the project would be
institution building. As part of the program to achieve this objective, DBP
would be required to monitor more closely the sub-project impact and institute
a systematic procedure for maintaining a running record of its arrears posi-
tion and repayment collection performance (5.07). These monitoring activities
are expected to enhance the appraisal and supervision standards of FG and
contribute significantly to strengthening DBP as the leading fisheries
development finance institution.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
DBP
5.01      DBP was established in 1958 (Republic Act No. 85) as an autonomous
government-owned development bank for supplying credit to industry and agri-
culture. 1/ It is the single largest institutional source of long-term funds
in the Philippines. Since its inception, it has approved financial assistance
totalling nearly $3 billion.  The volume and diversity o£-its operations give
it a prominent and unique role as the Government's arm for financing .4onomic
development. The bulk of its activities has been in loans and guarantees for
industry and agriculture.
5.02      Overall management of DBP is entrusted to a nine-man Board of
Governors consisting of the Chairman (who is chief executive officer), four
full-time Supervising Governors (one position is now vacant) with responsi-
bility for different departments of DBP, and four part-time Governors (pre-
sently the former Executive Secretary to the President, the Secretary of
Industry, a private lawyer, and one vacancy). One of the Supervising Gover-
nors is Vice-Chairman of the Board. The present Chairman, Leonides S. Virata,
was appointed in February 1970.
5.03      DBP's operating core consists of three broad departmental groupings
(Industry, Agriculture and Community-Development) each under the direction
of a Supervising Governor. In the past two years, DBP has concentrated its
efforts on consolidation. As a result, noticeable improvements in the
functioning of individual departments and in inter-departmental coordination
have taken place. DBP has a total staff of about 3,000, 55% of whom are
1/   For more comprehensive description of DBP, see Appraisal of a Second
Loan to the Republic of the Philippines for Industry Financing Through
the Development Bank of the Philippines, Report No. 872a-PH, 1975.



- 20 -
located in the 35 branches and 24 agencies. The staff is of generally
good calibre. Salaries are competitive with other Government financial
institutions, and above those of the general civil service.
5.04      The Bank has so far approved eight loans totalling $213.4 million,
all since 1971, for on-lending through DBP. 1/ In addition, the Second
Grain Processing Project for $11.0 million has been appraised recently, and
the Second Shipping Project will be appraised soon.
5.05      Through FY74, the large majority of DBP's financial assistance
consisted of the guaranteeing of foreign loans - in FY74, this was 88% of
all operations (by amount). In FY75, however, there was a dramatic change
as DBP's loan approvals rose from P 0.3 billion in FY74 to P 2.4 billion,
while its guarantees fell from P 2.8 billion to P 0.8 billion. As of June
1975, DBP's total assets stood at P 7.84 billion, an increase of 48% from
P 5.28 billion a year earlier. DBP's liquidity position is reasonably sound
(current ratio of 2.1) as is its present long-term capital structure (total
debt/equity ratio of 4.5:1).
5.06      DBP's net income for FY75 was P 71.4 million, 21% below its FY74
net income. This decline is in sharp contrast to the rising performance
trend of FY73 and FY74. Since DBP's financial statements are prepared on
an adjusted cash rather than on an accrual basis, the decline in income
reflected mainly a decline in collections as a result of adverse economic
conditions which affected many of DBP's clients, and rapidly rising
expenses. In judging its financial performance, it is essential to recog-
nize that DBP is a government-owned development-oriented insti'ution and
that its earnings performance is not strictly comparable to that of private
profit-oriented institutions. Nevertheless, the continuation of the present
income trend on its loan portfolio can only increase DBP's reliance on con-
tinual government assistance. A low level of collections and the magnitude
of its arrears continue to pose the main financial problems for DBP. At
negotiations for the Second Industrial Investment Project, DBP agreed to a
number of measures to improve its income, including higher interest rates
and better loan-collection efforts (Annex 10, paras 15-16).
5.07      DBP has only recently become a major source of credit for the fish-
ing industry. Its volume and amount of lending in the fisheries sector has
increased substantially since 1972. Excluding the sub-loans under the Bank
financed first Fisheries Credit Project (Loan 891-PH), DBP had approved as
of June 30, 1975, about P 225 million for fisheries purposes, of which about
P 120 million was for a very large number (over 20,000) of small loans in the
1/   Rice Processing and Storage Project, 720-PH, $14.3 million, Fisheries
Credit Project, 891-PH, $11.6 million, (First) Livestock Develoment
Project, 823-PH, $7.5 million, Second Livestock Development Project,
1070-PH, $20.0 million, (First) industrial Investment and Smallholder
Tree-Farmers Project, 990-PH, $50.0 million, Second Industrial Investment
Project, 1190-PH, $75.0 million, Shipping Project, 1048-PH, $20.0
million, and Small and Medium Industries Development Project, 1120-PH,
$15.0 million (out of a country-wide $30.0 million).

"foreshore" fisheries sub-sector. Of the P 225 million approved, about P 188
million in principal is outstanding. DBP reports that a total of P 25 million
of the outstanding amount is overdue. In addition, as of July 31, 1975, DBP
has committed P 35.5 million in the inland sector, and P 9.8 million in the
marine sector, under the Bank-financed first Fisheries Credit Project.
Fisheries Group
5.08      FG of DBP would be responsible for the processing of sub-loans
financed under the project. It has at present 25 staff including fisheries
experts, marine engineers, and financial and economic analysts. Since the
latest reorganization in April 1976, it has two divisions, an Inland Fisheries
and a Marine Fisheries Division, each consisting of an appraisal and a super-
vision section. Under the first project, FG has developed considerable ex-
pertise in fisheries lending and evolved satisfactory working relationship
with BFAR. It does, however, need to increase its technical capacity by
recruiting additional marine engineers to support the deepsea lending opera-
tion and additional staff to supervise its growing inland fisheries portfolio.
Assurances have been obtained at negotiations that DBP would adequately
strengthen the technical staff by the addition of at least five new recruits
for inland fisheries portfolio supervision and two for marine fisheries
project appraisal.
VI. MARKETS AND PRICES
Demand Projections
6.01      The major determinants of the demand for fish in the Philippines
appear to be (i) the rate of population growth, (ii) the rate at which the
road network is extended to areas hitherto inaccessible to motor vehicles,
and (iii) the level of per capita income, especially in the rural sector.
All of these indicate a high long-term growth rate of the demand for fish.
The population is increasing by about 3% per year. Feeder roads are being
extended at a greatly accelerated rate with the aid of the Bank, Asian De-
velopment Bank (ADB), and the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID). And, the per capita real income, especially of the farmers
whose terms of trade have greatly improved along with the sharp increases
in grain prices since 1973, is expected to increase at about 2-3%. On the
basis of these, it is estimated that the demand for fish would increase
by at least 6% per year, which is about the same as the rate at which the
marine fisheries production has been actually expanding during the 1968-1973
period. The requirement for domestic fish production would increase somewhat
faster than 6% per year, if the Government proceeds with its program to
substitute domestic fish for the significant quantities of canned and other
processed fish imports (equivalent to about 10% of domestic production in net
weight terms).



- 22 -
Production Possibilities
6.02      Since the sustainable yields from the Philippine waters are esti-
mated to be at least about 1.7 million tons for the marine fisheries (0.7
million tons for the municipal and 1.0 million tons for the commercial fish-
eries), it should be possible for the industry to meet the production require-
ment for the coming decade. In view of the fact that the scope for further
expansion of the municipal fisheries catch is now rather limited, however,
much of the additional production would have to come from the commercial fish-
eries. Since the present scale of investment in the commercial fisheries
appears to be grossly inadequate to meet the projected production require-
ment, an increasing fresh fish deficit is anticipated for the coming years.
Project Production
6.03      At full development, the project facilities would produce about
26,000 tons of fish per year (15,000 tons of inland milkfish and 11,000 tons
of marine fish), representing about 2.0% of the estimated total fish produc-
tion of 1.3 million tons for 1974. The quantity of incremental production
from the project facilities would be so small that it would not pose any
serious marketing problem.
Imports and Exports
6.04      Imports.  The Philippines has been importing substantial quanti-
ties of canned fish, mainly canned mackerel and sardine. The estimated 1974
fish import of $32 million consisted of 42,000 tons of canned mackerel ($26
million), 3,500 tons of canned sardines ($2.5 million) and 10,500 tons of
other processed fish products ($3.5 million), including about 9,300 tons of
fishmeal. As a result of the recently adopted government policy, canned fish
imports are likely to diminish in the next several years, but the extent of
the import restrictions is not yet clear.
6.05      Exports.  Philippine exports of fisheries products have been increas-
ing rapidly in recent years. The estimated 1974 fish export of $18 million
consisted of 1,700 tons of frozen shrimp (estimated $5 million), 11,400 tons
of frozen tuna ($7 million) and a variety of other items including frozen
milkfish, scallop, etc. The tuna was exported mainly to the United States,
but Japan took a small share, and the shrimp export was almost entirely to
Japan. These two export items appear to have potentials for substantial ex-
pansion.
Fish Prices
6.06      During the five year period from 1968 to 1973, the wholesale marine
fish price kept pace with the general wholesale price (the index for the fish
being 200 and for general price 199 with the 1968 prices as the base). Since
1973, however, the oil crisis has had far reaching effects on the determinants
of fish prices. First, it caused a sharp increase in operating cost for fish-
ing boats. Second, by causing a business recession at home and abroad, it



- 23 -
greatly weakened the demand for fish. These two factors together forced many
of the relatively inefficient boat operators to suspend their operation, and,
as a result, there appears to have been a substantial decrease in the commer-
cial fisheries catch, hence a reduced supply of fish from the marine sector.
Average wholesale prices of fish in the meantime appear to have risen some-
what faster than the general wholesale prices because of the greatly reduced
supply, despite the weakened demand. Compared with the rates at which the
wholesale fish prices have increased, ex-vessel fish prices appear to have
increased very little. Surveys made in 1972 (November), 1973 (November)
and 1975 (September) show that the estimated average price received by boat
operators for comparable fish delivered to Navotas (Manila) was P 1.4/kg in
1972, P 1.6/kg in 1973, and P 1.8/kg in 1975. These indicate that, during
the three year period, the boat operators' average receipt per kg of fish
landed in Manila increased only about 29% (13% for the last two years), while
the operating and investment costs have nearly doubled. It is anticipated,
however, that the ex-vessel fish prices would recover along with general eco-
nomic activities. The ex-vessel prices assumed for the project financial
analyses are P 1.8/kg for the trawler and purse-seiner-caught fish and P 2.5/
kg for tuna and high quality mackerels (estimated ex-vessel prices in September
1975).
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      Incremental Fish Production.  When the fishponds under the projects,
with an aggregate area of 9,120 ha, reach full development, they are expected
to add 15,000 tons of milkfish per annum to the present annual milkfish pro-
duction of about 110,000 tons. The 17 fishing vessels would annually harvest
an additional 11,000 tons of marine fish. The total incremental fish
production facilitated by the project would thus be about 26,000 tons per
year, with an estimated value of about $10.8 million.
7.02      Fisheries Supporting Services.  In addition the project fish car-
riers and ice plants would lend important support to efficient utiliza-
tion of fishing vessels and improved fish marketing. As a result of the
increased oil prices, the need for fish carriers is much greater than at
the appraisal of the first project. The fish carriers would permit fishing
vessels to operate on more distant grounds without having to make frequent
trips to the market. These trips consume much oil and reduce the time the
vessels can put to actual fishing. With proper coordination between fishing
vessels and carriers, the productivity can be greatly increased, and the
cost of fish landed considerably reduced. As the near-shore grounds near
major markets are almost fully exploited, so that much of the incremental
production from commercial fisheries would have to come from more distant
grounds, the requirement for carrier vessels would greatly increase in the
future.
7.03      Institution Building Effect.  One of the most important benefits
of the project would be its contribution to the strengthening of DBP's capa-
bilities for fisheries development financing. DBP is the only financial



- 24 -
institution in the Philippines providing medium and long-term credit in any
significant scale for fisheries development. In the course of implementing
the first project, DBP has considerably strengthened its technical capabili-
ties for fisheries development, but it is still in need of further strengthen-
ing, especially in the technical staff for marine fisheries and supervision
standards for inland fisheries. In the coming years, the requirement for
medium and long-term credit for marine fisheries is expected to expand rapidly,
because much of the additional fish production required to keep the per
capita fish consumption from falling would have to come from the commercial
fisheries, which cannot be expected to maintain the required level of in-
vestment without medium and long-term credit. The project would make a
significant contribution in helping DBP to evolve into an institution com-
petent in meeting this important development requirement.
7.04      Financial and Economic Viability.  All of the seven sub-project
models have acceptable financial rates of return, ranging from 17% to 39%,
with a weighted average rate of return of 27% (see Annex 11 for detailed
financial analyses). Since the financial costs and benefits of the project
are assumed to approximate the corresponding economic costs and benefits,
no adjustments have been made except the deduction of duties and taxes on
-imported investment goods required for the marine sector. The respective
economic rates of return, therefore, are equal to or higher than the corres-
ponding financial rates of return, ranging from 21% to 43%, with a weighted
average of 30%.  The estimated economic rates of return are relatively
insensitive to investment cost overruns and operating cost increases. They
are quite sensitive to decreases in the prices of the fish, but the chances
of fish prices decreasing are extremely remote. Detailed economic rates of
return sensitivity analyses appear in Annex 12, Table 3. Annex 12, Tables 1
and 2 present the details of economic rate of return calculations, which
are summarized below:

- 25 -
7.05      Employment Effect.  The project would create about 1,000 new jobs
directly required for the sub-projects (Annex 12, Table 4). As it is expected
that the present widespread unemployment of marine fisheries work force would
persist for the coming decade, and the newly fitted fishing vessels are manned
largely by currently unemployed fishermen, virtually all of these would be
filled by those in the rural poverty target group. In addition, the marketing
of the project production of some 15,000 tons of fish per annum is expected to
generate about 150,000 man-days of employment per year and the construction of
the project facilities would require about 4 million man-days of labor.
7.06      Distribution of Benefits.  Although the direct beneficiaries would
be some 400 rural entrepreneurs who would borrow funds under the project,
about 1,000 from the poverty target group would derive major benefits from
the permanent employment and an additional 750 from fish marketing job
opportunities created by the project. Finally, there would be benefits
of a general nature that the project would help limit the widening deficit
of fish, which is a staple in the Filipino diet.
Effects on the Environment
7.07      On the whole, the project is expected to have a positive environ-
mental effect. The only possible pollution causing elements of the project
would be the 17 fishing vessels and the 4 fish carriers projected for financing,
which would constitute less than 1.0% of the commercial fishing fleet of the
country. On the inland sector, however, the environmental effect would be a
positive one. The fish-farmers generally have much to lose by pollution of
the environment, and they already constitute an important pressure group
against pollution.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of $12.0 million

SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
Marine Fisheries
1.        The fishing industry of the Philippines is classified into two
major categories, the marine and the inland fisheries. The marine fisheries
are subdivided further into two sub-categories, the commercial and the muni-
cipal fisheries. The total fisheries production of 1.3 million tons for 1974
consisted of 684,000 tons (53%) from the municipal fisheries, 471,000 tons
(38%) from the commercial and 113,000 tons (9%) from the inland fisheries.
This Annex discusses the marine fisheries, and Annex 2 deals with the inland
fisheries. The waters adjacent to the Philippines and principal fishing
grounds are shown in Map (IBRD 11915).
Marine Fisheries Resources
2.        South China Sea Region.  The South China Sea includes some of the
widest expanses of shallow shelf in the world. Of the total sea around in-
volved (nearly five million km2), 20% is less than 50 m deep and 30% is be-
tween 50 m and 500 m deep. Including the nearby East China Sea, the waters
of Southeast Asia make up about 20% of the total shallow water areas of
the entire world. Because shelf areas tend to have higher natural fish
production, and more of this production becomes harvestable, the region
offers the possibility of very substantial sustainable fish catches. The
following table reflects the state of fishing industries in the region.

Philippines Fisheries Territorial Base
3.        The territorial sea of the Philippines, based on the so-called
"'archipelago principle", encompasses approximately 1.6 million km2 within an
area about 540 nautical miles wide (1180E to 1270E) and 1,640 nautical miles
long 21025'N to 4045'N). Only a few Philippine commercial fishing vessels
operate outside these limits--mainly in the South China Sea--and their catch
makes only a small contribution to the total catch. The Philippine Islands
are marked by an extremely rarrow continental shelf and a precipitous con-
tinental shelf, so that most of the fishing area is over waters deeper than
200 m. The shelf areas suitable for trawling are not extensive and covers
only a small area of about 185,000 km2 made up largely of the Sulu Sea (127,000
km2) and the Visayan Sea (15,000 km2).



ANNEX 1

Major Species
4.        The stocks of the Philippine waters may best be classified into four
groups (i) pelagic fish, (ii) demersal fish, (iii) tuna, and (iv) crustaceans
and molluscs.
5.        Pelagic Fish.  As shown in the following table, Pelagic (i.e. not
bottom associated) fish make up the largest group of fish caught at present as
well as the largest and most valuable potential for future development. FAO
reports have estimated that annual potential yields from pelagic fishery
resources in the South China Sea waters are in the order of 4.2 million tons.
The 1971 landings in the region totalled about 2 million tons. The main
groups of species concerned, excluding the tuna which are covered separately
in para 7 are the scads (Decapterus spp.), sardinellas, anchovioes (Stolephorus
spp.) and Indian mackerels (Rastrelliger spp.).  All these fish form near
surface schools (often quite large) at least at some time of the day or night,
when they can be caught in quantity by purse seines or other types of sur-
rounding nets. The larger species are also caught in gillnets. The quick
escape reaction of some species often causes large differences in catch by a
large or efficiently handled net as compared with a slightly smaller or poorly
set net. The Philippines catch of these species is approximately 550,000 tons
including the municipal fisheries catch, and there appears to be an excellent
opportunity to increase catches from the pelagic species group, particularly
in the grounds farther offshore.

Because of the increase in fuel oil prices and the increasingly heavy fishing
on grounds near the major landing ports, the relative effort expended on
pelagic species is expected to increase and bottom trawling is expected to
decline. While the data on catch per effort are not enough to determine whe-
ther, even for the near shore grounds, there has been undue fishing upon the
bottom associated stocks, most authorities agree that a cautious approach
to the expansion of this particular part of the Philippine fishing industry
is called for. Except for the fishing grounds around Palawan, the Samar Sea
and Mindanao, the size frequency distribution of fish appears to be declin-
ing and fishermen report more effort required to obtain profitable catches
than in previous years.
6.        Demersal Fish.  This group of fish includes the very wide variety
of species that live near or just off the bottom. These range from large,
often long-lived species of high market value such as croaker and snappers,



ANNEX 1
Page 5
to small fish which are used mainly as dried fish for human consumption and
for animal feed (fishmeal). Shrimp and other crustaceans are often sig-
nificant and valuable elements of the bottom species community, but they are
discussed separately in para 8. Almost all demersal fish are caught by
trawling, hook and line and beach seines. Commercial trawlers caught about
158,000 tons of demersal fish in 1974, an increase of about 39% from the
114,000 tons caught in 1968.
7.        Tuna.  Oceanic fisheries for tuna occur near the Philippines using
longline gear set by vessels from Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, but, the large
tuna caught by this method are believed to be fully exploited or over-
exploited and no increase in catch is thought to be commercially feasible.
The rapidly expanding tuna catch by the municipal fisheries shows that sub-
stantial stocks of skipjack and yellowfin tuna occur throughout the waters
near the Philippines. It is reported that about 12,000 tons of tuna were
caught in the 1974 season by hand lines set from small motorized canoes and
sold to freezer vessels for export to Japan. In addition, small purse seine
vessels fishing near anchored rafts have developed good catches of skipjack
tuna (about 5,000 tons in 1974), which have been landed in Davao for freezing
and export. With increasing effort being given to solving the technical
problems of catching skipjack (which appear to have highly erratic behavior
patterns and are difficult to catch), the catch of this species is expected to
increase greatly. Some estimates place the potential catch available to
vessels from the Philippines between 10,000 and 30,000 tons per year. In
1939, four small vessels owned by a Japanese company using live bait pole-and-
line methods caught 1,256 tons of skipjack and 265 tons of yellowfin tuna
from Zamboanga, Mindanao. It is expected that this method of fishing for
which adequate supplies of bait fish are availble will grow in importance, if
the difficulties of communication and transportation in the southern part of
the country were overcome, and the fishing grounds to the east toward the
Caroline Islands were explored by larger vessels with better capabilities to
cope with the sometimes violent weather conditions.
8.        Crustaceans and Molluscs.  The most important are shrimp, which
can be divided into two main groups according to size. The larger shrimps,
mainly species of the genera Penaeus and Metapenaeus, are principally caught
offshore, although several species spend the early months of their life in-
shore in lagoons or estuaries. Fishing for them is mainly by trawl, either
as part of the general demersal fishery or by specialized shrimp trawlers.
Shrimp fisheries are well developed in the southern part of the country.
Total catches are of the order of 10,000 tons, and it is likely that the
stocks of panaeid shrimp are fully exploited, with no sigificant opportunities
for expanding catches. By contrast, the small shrimps (Parapeneopsis spp.,
Acetes spp., etc.) mainly occur in inshore or estuarine areas. They are used
mostly as shrimp paste for local consumption. Employing a variety of gear,
shrimping is somewhat localized, depending to a considerable extent on the
local demand. Since the fishermen involved are mainly artisanal, the catch
data are poor, and no reliable calculation of the status of the stocks has



ANNEX 1
Page 6
been made.  Other crustaceans found in the area include the large freshwater
or brackish water prawn (Macrobrachium spp.) of which the natural stocks are
probably fully exploited, and a variety of crabs.  It is believed that catches
of the latter could be increased, but they would not make a major contribution
to the fisheries economy. Cephaalopods (squid, octopus and cuttlefish) are
caught mainly by trawls and other demersal gear. The present knowledge of the
status of stocks is poor.
Municipal Fisheries
9.        Although the municipal fisheries account for a great majority of
the Philippine fishermen and for about 53% of the total fisheries production,
not much is known about the composition of the catch (species, value, loca-
tion, time of catch, gear used, etc.), the cost of operation, and the specific
problems encountered.
10.       The sub-sector has been characterized as being made up largely of
subsistence, artisanal, and part-time fishermen-farmers, timber workers and
others. The municipal fisheries by and large involve the use of unmotorized
small boats (bancas) of not more than 3 gross tons. In 1974, these fisher-
ies, engaging approximately 500,000 subsistence and part-time fishermen from
6,000 fishing villages (barrios), operated about 27,000 fishing boats (bancas)
and produced some 684,000 metric tons, 61% of the total marine fisheries
production.
11.       The municipal councils regulate the fishing within their juris-
diction and a wide range of fishing methods and gear are employed, ranging
from simple snares, spears, small traps to very complicated and large stake
and hanging net traps. Vessels of tonnages under three tons are licensed
for the municipal waters, which include marine waters up to three miles from
the coastline, as well as inland waters within the jurisdiction of municipal
councils.
12.       Despite the lack of reliable statistical information, it is clear
that, in the more densely populated areas, the limits of fisheries resources
available to municipal fishermen have been reached, and any significant in-
crease in fishing effort in these areas would only serve to lessen the index
of productivity per fisherman which is on the average thought to be already
a very low one ranging between one and two tons per fisherman per year. In
the less populated areas, on the other hand, there appears to be considerable
scope for increasing the catch, but the lack of suitable transportation and
marketing facilities tends to make it unprofitable to catch more than the
isolated markets can absorb without depressing the prices unduly.
13.       In order to overcome the limitations imposed by finite resources,
geographically limited fishing areas, and the lack of supply and landing
places, many fishermen have sought to exploit more distant fishing grounds
from bases where marketing facilities exist such as Manila and Iloilo, em-
ploying larger and more powerful fishing vessels, and more sophisticated
fishing gear, so that some of them have thus entered the commercial fisheries.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
Commercial Fisheries
14.       The commercial fisheries of the Philippines are licensed and regu-
lated by BFAR, which, jointly with the Philippine Coast Guard, licenses ves-
sels larger than three gross tons.
15.       Fishing Methods, Fish Types, Catch and Grounds.  In the last 10
years, there has been a gradual reduction in the number of small vessels
(less than 10 tons) and a substantial increase in the number of vessels 50
tons or more (Table 1). Most fish are caught by trawl, bagnet and purse
seine, methods common to all sizes of vessels. Fishing by gillnet and round
haul nets and by hook and line is largely restricted to the smaller vessels.
BFAR publishes production data for some 65 types of fish, but five species
accounted for about 60% of the total catch of about 471,000 tons by commercial
vessels in 1974 (round scad 35.6%, slipmouth 9.5% and sardines 3.1%, chub
mackerel and breams about 6.0% each).
16.       The reported 1973 commercial fisheries catch for the most import-
ant fishing grounds is given below:

Marketing and Prices
17.       Marketing.  Marketing is carried out by the private sector (Annex
3 deals with prices and marketing in greater detail). Fish are sold by whis-
per auction and traded through a network of private dealers, wholesalers and
small independent retail outlets. The retail sale of fish takes place in



ANNEX 1
Page 8
the public central markets scattered throughout the main population centers
and the suburbs of larger towns where the local food markets have specialized
sections for selling fresh fish. The bulk of the fish is marketed in the
fresh condition. Frozen fish is practically unknown in local markets and
there is marked consumer prejudice against the use of ice. One of the main
problems in fish marketing is the physical inaccessibility of the isolated
rural markets because of the absence of even jeepable feeder roads.
18.       Prices.  Since 1973, the oil crisis has had far reaching effects
on the determinants of fish prices. First, it caused a sharp increase in
operating cost for fishing boats. Second, by causing a business recession
at home and abroad, it greatly weakened the demand for fish. These two
factors together forced many of the relative inefficient boat operators to
suspend their operation, and, as a result, there appears to have been a
substantial decrease in the commercial fisheries catch, hence a reduced sup-
ply of fish from the marine sector. Average wholesale prices of fish in the
meantime appear to have risen somewhat faster than the general wholesale
prices because of the greatly reduced supply, despite the weakened demand.
Compared with the rates at which the wholesale fish prices have increased,
the ex-vessel fish prices appear to have increased very little. Surveys
made in 1972 (November), 1973 (November) and 1975 (September) show that the
estimated average prices received by boat operators for comparable fish de-
livered to Navotas (Manila) was P 1.4/kg in 1972, P 1.6/kg in 1973, and
P 1.8/kg in 1975. These indicate-that, during the three year period, the
boat operators' average receipt per kg of fish landed in Manila increased
only about 29% (13% for the last two years), while the operating and in-
vestment costs have nearly doubled. It is anticipated, however, that the
ex-vessel fish prices would recover along with general economic activities.
The ex-vessel prices assumed for the project financial analyses are p 1.8/kg
for the trawler and purse seiner-caught fish and P 2.5/kg for tuna and high
quality mackerels (estimated ex-vessel prices in September 1975).
19.       Industry Trends.  The nature of the chief problem for the fishing
industry changed categorically during the past several years. Before the oil
crisis, the overriding problem was over-fishing on the traditional fishing
ground, and the appropriate response to this was to build boats capable of
reaching more distant grounds, and equipping them with more powerful engines
and larger trawl fishing gear. This was the correct response and the fish-
ermen adopting this approach found it quite profitable. The situation changed
categorically, however, because of the oil price increase. The larger hea-
vier trawls and more powerful engines proved to be a highly oil-intensive
method of catching, and the tripling and quadrupling of the pump price of
fuel oil made the larger more powerful trawlers much less financially at-
tractive. Now the industry has to adapt itself to fishing methods that are
less oil-intensive. In fact, the industry shows an apparent tendency to
prefer (i) smaller vessels, (ii) less fuel-intensive methods of catching



ANNEX 1
Page 9
such as purse seining, and (iii) vessels which have more flexible capabili-
ties (for example, trawling as well as purse seining) to respond to changes
in operating costs, as well as to exploit different fish species in order
to take advantage of price fluctuations.
20.       These changes in the strategy of the industry make it imperative
that more specialized fishing bases become available. Such bases with ade-
quate capabilities to reprovision, fuel and handle catch could prove decisive
in the development of the fishing industry in the coming years. In addition,
there is a general shortage of freezing facilities in the country. The
small existing facilities are producing frozen fish mainly for export (mainly
shrimp, tuna and milkfish). The Government attaches a very high priority to
developing a program for harbor development, cold chains and marketing systems.
21.       Fish Landing Facilities.  Most of the commercial catch is landed in
the Manila area. Navotas, the country's largest fishing port located in the
Metropolitan Manila alone received 61% of the total commercial catch, and if
the landings in adjacent Magallanes, North Harbor (Manila) and Malabon were
added, the Manila area then accounts for about 67% of the total commercial
catch. Navotas is the receiving point for almost 90% of the catch from the
Palawan waters, almost 85% of the Manila Bay catch, and about 45% of the
Visayan Sea. The remainder of the Visayan catch was landed in Iloilo City
(Panay Island) and Cadiz City (Negros Occidental).
22.       There are some 100 other minor landing sites usually without wharf
or other landing facilities, which handle small quantities for local consump-
tion. Despite the importance of fisheries, there has been a surprising lack
of specialized fishing port facilities. Even at Navotas, which handles the
bulk of all Philippine landings, fish are brought in by amphibious trucks
from vessels anchored over a mile offshore. Partly financed with a $5.7
million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a project is underway
to develop Navotas as a well equipped fishing port, involving dredging an
approach channel, anchorage reclamation of the foreshore area, and construc-
tion of breakwaters, piers, wharves, quay walls and a fish marketing building.
The facility is expected to be operational in 1976. Existing ice-making fa-
cilities, transport equipment, cold storage facilities, auction halls and the
like, are inadequate and any large-scale increase in fish production would
require expansion and provision of new facilities.
Boat Building
23.       The construction of fishing boats in the Philippines is carried
out at shipyards near Navotas, and in many small private shipyards in the
Visayas. In the Visayas a considerable number of independent contractors
capable of building wooden vessels have successfully developed methods of
construction which require low fixed capital overhead in the form of ship-
ways and conventional shipyard infrastructure. The quality of the vessels



ANNEX I
Page 10
is satisfactory, boat-building is usually well supervised by the owner,
and the costs of the vessels are quite competitive with those of the vessels
of comparable size in other countries in the region.

SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
Inland Fisheries
1.        The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in Asia
more than 2 million hectares are under cultivation for aquatic food produc-
tion and that about 2 million tons of food or aquatic products are produced.
Many organisms are farmed and they include seaweeds, shellfish, crustaceans,
and a number of fish species. The Philippines is among the leading countries
in the region in developing brackish water culture, milkfish culture in
particular. The main species cultivated is the milkfish (Bangus), or Chanos
chanos, which is found in the warm coastal waters of the Indian and Pacific
Ocean. Fully grown they may weigh up to 30 kg, but commercially cultivated
milkfish are marketed at about 250-1,200 grams. Some tilapia, mullet, shrimp
and crab also enter the ponds with the inflow of water, and may be cultivated
as incidental products.
Milkfish Culture
2.        The Fry.  The basic condition necessary for commercial milkfish
culture is the availability of the fry at reasonable prices. Milkfish spawn
in the near shore areas, often near the mouths of creeks and rivers. The
hatched fry drift with the current in the shallow coastal areas. They are
caught in many of the coastal localities by professional collectors with
special hand operated nets during certain season. Most of the collected fry
are shipped and sold to the fry dealers in Malabon (near Manila), who sell
them to pond operators or place them in their own nurseries for subsequent
resale as fingerling of about 5-6 cm. As the pond and pen hectarage has ex-
panded rapidly, there has developed an active fry trade across the country.
There has been occasional demand for fry from Taiwan and Indonesia, but the
Government prohibits export of the fry. The trade appears to be under an
oligopolitic control of a few dominant dealers based in Malabon. In 1974-75,
it is now stabilizing at about P 0.70 per-1,000. The concensus among the
knowledgeable fishpond operators is that fry resources available in the
coastal waters of the Philippines would be adequate to support any foreseeable
expansion of milkfish culture.
3.        Fishpond Construction and Layout.  Generally, brackish water ponds
are constructed in the tidal zone of an estuarine mangrove swamp by bunding
a perimeter, removing trees and stumps, levelling the bottom, and construct-
ing water supply and drainage canals equipped with gates for water control.
The maximum range of tidal fluctuations in the Philippines is 2 to 3 meters



ANNEX 2
Page 2
with a normal daily range of 1.5 m. This is ideal for management of brackish
water ponds. The construction work involves mainly manual labor, often hired
by the pond owner. The ponds are filled with water during high tide, and
water can be retained or drained by manipulating the water gates. During
the typhoon season, ponds, especially in Central Luzon, are subject to strong
wave action and flooding which causes damage to the perimeter dike, allowing
the fish to escape. To prevent the fish from escaping, the perimeter dikes
should have height of about 1.0 to 1.5 m above the highest tidal levels and
be strong enough to resist wave action. The work for removing the tree
stumps and levelling the bottom is laborious and is usually completed over
a number of years. Frequently, a large area, say, between 25 to 50 ha, is
enclosed. In most cases, the operating pond units are divided by secondary
dikes into one or two nursery ponds, a transition pond and two or three
rearing ponds. A 24 hectare pond is often used as a model for analytic
purposes. In this model the dike occupies about 10% of the area. The grow-
ing area comprises a nursery pond, covering about 5% of the total pond area,
a transition pond with 10% of total pond area, and the remainder would be
used for the main rearing ponds.
4.        Fishpond Management.  Milkfish feed on bottom algae (mostly green
and blue green), tiny crustaceans and, to a lesser extents, planktons. The
principal food, bottom algae and plankton community, is called lab-lab. Pro-
moting and maintaining the growth of lab-lab is the most essential fishpond
management task, comparable to pasture development in livestock industries.
It is done by providing suitable environmental conditions and adequate plant
nutrients in the pond (organic and inorganic fertilizer), proper management of
the water conditions (depth, salinity, temperature, transparency, etc.),
eliminating undesirable algae feeders (snails, worms), and preventing over-
grazing. The organic fertilizer most commonly used in the Philippine is
chicken manure, but rice bran, peanut cake, soybean cake, sesame cake, copra,
legumes and pig nature are also usod. In addition, various nitrogen, phos-
phorus, and potassium-based inorganic fertilizers are sometimes applied.
Standard procedures are difficult to enumerate because they vary significantly
with water and soil conditions and individual ideas of management. As the
costs of inputs are high, it is important for the pond operators to achieve
the growth of fish on natural fish food organisms produced in the ponds and
minimize the supplemental feed requirements.
5.        Stocking Practices.  There are broadly two ways of stocking fish-
ponds; stocking with single size fingerlings, which is more common, and
stocking with mixed size groups. In the first case, the fry are reared in
the nursery pond, and the fingerlings, all of a uniform size of about 5-6
cm, are transferred to the rearing pond where they grow to the marketable
size, and a complete harvesting is done. If managed well, three harvests
per year can be expected. The second method, introduced more recently, in-
volves the stocking of fingerlings of usually three different sizes in one
rearing pond. After a lapse of about 1-2 months the first marketable size
group is harvested (with specific mesh size nets) and a new group of finger-
lings is introduced. Through selective harvesting and repeated stocking
4-6 harvests can be gathered in a year. There are no significant differences



ANNEX 2
Page 3
between these methods in total annual production, but the latter may have
some marketing advantages. In the areas where there are many fishponds,
such as Malabon and Iloilo, there are quite a number of specialized fry
and fingerling farms and they provide rearing farms fingerlings of standard
sizes on a custom basis.
6.        Fishpond Yields.  There are large production potentials to be
achieved by increasing yields of existing fishponds by improving the manage-
ment and inputs. Although the average milkfish yields of 600 kg/ha in the
Philippines are considerably higher than the 300 kg/ha average in Indonesia,
they are far below the 1,700-2,000 kg/ha average yields obtained in Taiwan.
The high yields in Taiwan are obtained by the skillful use of inputs, fertil-
izers pesticides, supplemental feed, and scientific stocking and harvesting.
In the Philippines, the average yield data appear to be quite misleading.
Although the official data show an average yield of only 600 kg/ha/yr, it
appears that well managed fishponds in the Philippines achieve average yields
well over 1,400 kg/ha/yr and that yields of over 1,850 kg/ha/yr are achieved
by many milkfish farmers. The soil, water and climatic conditions of exist-
ing fishponds and of new ones proposed for financing under this project ap-
pear to be much favorable to the growth of milkfish and its natural food
organisms than those for the average fishponds, and, therefore, the yields for
DBP financed ponds are expected to be much higher than the national average.
7.        Fish Pen Culture.  Although restricted in location, a recent new
innovation in the industry is the development of pen culture for milkfish in
Laguna de Bay (a lake near Manila). The pen consists of nylon net enclosures
with bamboo frames set up in a relatively shallow nutrient rich lake (1.5 to
3 m deep). The ponds vary from 1 ha to several ha in area with yields in some
cases high as 5,000 kg/ha/yr. The main advantage of the pen culture is that
the fish grow on nutrients available in the water and, therefore, the operat-
ing cost is minimal. The fish pen culture is still in its experimental stage,
and appears to be too vulnerable to typhoon damages.
8.        Fishpond Areas.  BFAR estimates that in 1974 fishponds covered some
176,000 ha, almost all of brackish water (perhaps 6,000 ha are fresh water
ponds) and produced about 110,000 tons of milkfish for domestic consumption.
About half of this area consists of the lands leased from the Government
under long-term arrangements (up to 25 years, renewable for another 25 years)
and the remainder is privately owned. The leased area has increased by about
17,000 ha since 1968, whereas the privately owned area has remained more or
less unchanged. The Map (IBRD 11915) shows the distribution of the present
main fishpond areas and the production. Potentially, BFAR believes that the
fishpond area could be expanded about threefold. At present, some 60% of the
area and over 70% of the output are concentrated in Bulacan, Quezon and
Pampanga in Luzon, and in Iloilo, Cadiz, and Negros Occidental in the Visaya,
where yields rank high. More than half of the swamplands available for de-
velopment are in Northern Samar, and in Agusan del Sur and Northern Davao
in Mindanao where present yields are among the lowest (Mindanao has most of
the potential area for fresh water fishponds). There is some limited room



ANNEX 2
Page 4
for further expansion of brackish water ponds in Palawan, Quezon, Pampanga
and Mindoro Provinces (See also para 12).
9.        Milkfish Prices.  Milkfish is traditionally one of the most pre-
ferred fish species for the Filipinos and its price has always been con-
siderably higher than the average prices for the better quality marine fish.
The present farmgate milkfish price of P 4.00/kg is about 60% higher than
the average high quality marine fish wholesale price of P 2.50/kg (which is
considerably higher than the average trawler caught fish price of P 1.80/kg).
10.       Fishpond Profitability.  Because of the relatively high prices for
the product, milkfish ponds have thrived in the Philippines. The very large
total hectarage (almost 180,000 ha) devoted to fishponds attests to the ap-
parent viability. As shown in Annex 11, Tables 1 and 2, if the ponds achieve
a yield of 1,850 kg/ha, the pond farmer would have an average financial rate
of return ranging from 21% to 39% depending upon the development cost (the
return on his equity would be much higher).
11.       Project Fishponds Hectarage.  The project would finance 114 sub-
projects for construction of new fishpond with a total of 2,736 hectares
and 266 sub-projects for expansion and improvement of existing ones involv-
ing an addition of 6,384 hectares. The total fishpond hectarage to be fi-
nanced under the project would be 9,120 hectares, and this would be only
about 5% of the total fishpond area of about 176,000 hectares for 1974 re-
ported to BFAR (See Table 1).
12.       Potentials for Fishpond Expansion.  In looking toward large-scale
development of swamplands into fishponds, it should be noted that much of
those swamplands are located in remote areas with poor access to potential
markets. It is tempting to visualize the vast mangrove swamps as lands suita-
b'le for development into fishponds, but it appears very unlikely that it
would be possible to accomplish this on the scale proposed by BFAR. Most of
the lands suitable for fishing farming have already been taken up by estab-
lished fish farmers, and those that are still available tend to be prohibi-
tively expensive to develop because they are in areas where the tidal range
is unsuitable for filling completely or, conversely or draining the pond.
Pond drainage and drying are essential to the production of the lab-lab algae.
Another problem with some of the remaining areas is the high acid content of
the soil. In these areas, considerable quantities of tanic and other organic
acids are released and they interfere in a number of important ways with
optimum operation of the ponds. There are no reliable estimates of the actual
extent of land available for fishpond development, but it appears that some
further 80,000 ha (20% of the BFAR projected 400,000 ha) might be suitable for
fishpond development. This potential fishpond area amounts to about eight
times as much area as is being proposed for financing under this project.
Shrimp Culture
13.       Shrimp (prawn) cultivation is of great interest to fishpond opera-
tors, especially in the Southern Philippines. However, the technical base



ANNEX 2
Page 5
for shrimp farming is not expected to be established in the near future. For
instance, in Japan, more than 10 years elapsed since shrimp (Penaeus japonica)
cultivation was developed, and, while hatching of eggs from naturally fertil-
ized shrimps has been successful, experience with shrimp cultivation from the
fry stage to commercial size has not been financially viable because of high
production costs associated with high mortality.
Freshwater Culture
14.       Freshwater culture is not yet common in the Philippines and the
technical base and management requirements are not as well advanced as for
milkfish culture. Potentially, over time, Chinese mixed carp and American
catfish culture in freshwater could produce yields as great or greater than
those of milkfish in the brackish water ponds. A constraint now is the limit-
ed market demand for freshwater fish in the Philippines. Perhaps one-fourth
of the total undeveloped fishpond area is suitable for freshwater ponds,
and large areas could be developed in Cotabato and Agusan del Sur on Mindanao
and in Pampanga on Luzon but the prospects for commercial freshwater culture
are not promising.
Extension, Education and Research
15.       Research and extension services for aquaculture are provided by the
Department of Natural Resources through BFAR and, to some extent, by the
National Food and Agriculture Council. The College of Fisheries of the Uni-
versity of Philippines (UP) conducts research through the Inland Fisheries
Project assisted by the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID). When UP's research and training centers, one in Central Luzon and
one in Panay Islands, are fully operational, they are expected to assist in
increasing fishponds productivity by developing modern fishpond management
methods, and teaching them, to research trainees, extension workers and fish
farmers. While BFAR has a large number of personnel who are organized into
its field offices, the quality and effectiveness of the extension service
need to be improved. BFAR and UP are presently carrying out a training
program aimed at upgrading BFAR extension service. The demonstration fish
farms of BFAR and the cooperation of private operators with UP in demonstra-
tion and experimentation could also provide effective means for dissemination
of the research benefits.
16.       In addition, the Aquaculture Department of the Southeast Asian
Fisheries Development Center, one of three departments organized under the
six nation 1/ SEAFDEC Agreement has almost completed its construction pro-
gram. At full development, it would undertake and coordinate research on
aquaculture in Southeast Asia, train researchers and technicians and serve
1/   Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.



ANNEX 2
Page 6
as an information source to the member countries. The research program is
assisted by the Government of Japan. Although its main emphasis would be on
shrimp culture, the center would also carry out investigations on brackfish
water fish, including shall fish, oysters, mullet as well as other promising
species. Major SEAFDEC facilities are located at Tigbauan and Leganes, both
near Iloilo on Panay Island. When the research and training program become
fully opera tional, the center would contribute in a major way to the develop-
ment of aquatic culture methods in the Philippines and in other Southeast
Asian countries.

SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
Fish Marketing and Prices
Role in the Economy
1.        As in all other countries in the region, fisheries play a very im-
portant role in the national food economy in the Philippines. During the
past decade, fish production in the Philippines more than doubled, from 550,000
tons in 1963 to 1,200,000 tons in 1973, and per capita consumption increased
by about 50%, from 20 kg to 30 kg.
Demand Projections
2.        The major determinants of the demand for fish in the Philippines
appear to be (i) the rate of population growth, (ii) the rate at which the
road network is extended to areas hitherto inaccessible to motor vehicles,
and (iii) the level of per capita income, especially in the rural sector. All
of these indicate a high long-teri  growth rate of the demand for fish.  The
population is increasing by about 3% per year. Feeder roads are now being ex-
tended at a greatly accelerated rate with the aid of the Bank, Asian Develop-
ment Bank (ADB), and the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID). And, in the per capita real income, especially of the farmers whose
terms of trade have greatly improved along with the sharp increases in grain
prices since 1973, is expected to increase at about 2-3%. On the basis of
these, it is estimated that the demand for fish would increase by at least 6%
per year, which is about the same as the rate at which the marine fisheries
production has been actually expanding during the 1968-1973 period.
3.        The requirement for domestic fish production would be increasing
somewhat faster than 6% per year because of the recently adopted Government
program to substitute domestic fish for the significant quantities of canned
and other processed fish imports (equivalent to about 10% of domestic pro-
duction in wet weight terms). Since the sustainable yields from the Philip-
pine waters are estimated to be at least about 1.7 million tons for the ma-
rine fisheries (0.7 million tons for the municipal and 1.0 million tons for
the commercial fisheries), it should be possible for the industry to meet the
production requirement for the coming decade. In view of the fact that the
scope for further expansion of the municipal fisheries catch is now rather
limited, much of the additional production would have to come from the com-
mercial fisheries. Since the present scale of investment in the commercial
fisheries appears to be grossly inadequate to meet the projected production
requirement, however, an increasing fresh fish deficit is anticipated for
the coming years.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
Marketing
4.        Most of the fish is sold fresh, because of strong consumer prefer-
ence. Where fish is iced for transport, the ice is usually removed before
sale in order to give it a fresh appearance. Because of the limited storage
and distribution capacity and the consumer resistance to chilled or iced
fish, rural fresh fish markets are easily saturated, even where there is un-
satisfied demand in the vicinity. The excess fish is sold for processing
(drying and smoking), at greatly reduced prices.
5.        Fish wholesale markets in the Manila areas are located at Navotas,
Malabon and Divisoria. Most fishing vessels discharge fish at Navotas. Sort-
ing takes place on board and sale are by tubs. Auctioning takes place at all
three markets by a method of secret oral bidding, the buyers whispering
their bids to the broker who, on the basis of the prices offered and his as-
sessment of the collectability, decides which bidder should be the buyer.
A small number of brokers, probably 6 to 8, control the marketing at Navotas.
The brokers charge a 3 to 6% commission depending on the services performed,
such as loading and unloading, provision of containers, supply of ice (es-
pecially for milkfish), and advances for working capital. The Malabon market
handles most of the milkfish and milkfish fry arriving in Manila, but the
Navotas market is rapidly increasing its milkfish trade. There are some
minor wholesale markets in the'larger cities in the provinces with access
to the sea, but these are very small.
6.        Retailing in the Manila area takes place through some 100 central
markets with special fish sections. In addition, there are a large number of
door-to-door vendors. Retail of processed fish takes place in the grocery
sections. There is a substantial demand for processed fish in the inland
areas, and it is estimated that at least about 25% of the total catch is di-
verted to salting, drying, smoking and making of fish paste and fish sauce.
Low value fish like anchovies, slipmouth and round scad are the usual raw
materials for this processing. Freezing of tuna and shrimp for exports is
increasing, and a few small fish canning plants are being established.
Imports and Exports
7.        Imports.  The Philippines has been importing substantial quantities
of canned fish, mainly canned mackerel and sardine. The estimated 1974 fish
import of $32 million consisted of 42,000 tons of canned mackerel ($26 mil-
lion), 3,500 tons of canned sardine ($2.5 million) and 10,500 tons of other
processed fish products ($3.5 million), including about 9,300 tons of fishmeal.
As a result of the recently adopted government policy, canned fish imports
are likely to diminish in the next several years, but the extent of the im-
port restriction is not yet clear.
8.        Exports.  Philippine exports of fisheries products have been in-
creasing rapidly in recent years. The estimated 1974 fish export of $18
million consisted of 1,700 tons of frozen shrimp (estimated $4.9 million),



ANNEX 3
Page 3
11,400 tons of frozen tuna ($7.0 million) and a variety of other items includ-
ing frozen milkfish, scallop, etc. The tuna was exported mainly to the
United States, but Japan took a small share, and the shrimp export was almost
entirely to Japan. These two export items appear to have potentials for sub-
stantial expansion.
Fish Prices
9.        During the five year period from 1968 to 1973, the wholesale marine
fish price kept pace with the general wholesale price (the index for the fish
being 200 and for general price 199 with the 1968 prices as the base).
10.       Since 1973, however, the oil crisis has had far reaching effects
on the determinants of fish prices. First, it caused a sharp increase in
operating cost for fish boats. Second, by causing a business recession at
home and abroad, it greatly weakened the demand for fish. These two factors
together forced many of the relatively inefficient boat operators to suspend
their operation, and, as a result, there appears to have been a substantial
decrease in the commercial fisheries catch, hence a reduced supply of fish
from the marine sector. Average wholesale prices of fish in the meantime
appear to have risen somewhat faster than the general wholesale prices because
of the greatly reduced supply, despite the weakened demand. Compared with the
rates at which the wholesale fish prices have increased, the ex-vessel fish
prices appear to have increased very little. Surveys made in 1972 (November),
1973 (November) and 1975 (September) show that the estimated average price
received by boat operators for comparable fish delivered to Navotas (Manila)
was P 1.4/kg in 1972, P 1.6/kg in 1973 and P 1.8/kg in 1975. These indicate
that, during the three year period, the boat operators' average receipt per
kg of fish landed in Manila increased by only about 29% (13% for the last two
years), while the operating and the investment costs have nearly doubled. It
is anticipated, however, that the ex-vessel fish prices would recover along
with general economic activities. The ex-vessel prices assumed for the proj-
ect financial analyses are P 1.8/kg for the trawler and purse seiner-caught
fish and P 2.5/kg for tuna and high quality mackerels (estimated ex-vessel
prices in September 1975).

SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
The First Fisheries Credit Project
1.        The Loan Agreement for the ongoing first Fisheries Credit Project
(891-PH) was signed on May 21, 1973, and became effective September 25, 1973
(inland sector) and December 5, 1973 (marine sector). It provided for an
$11.6 million loan to the Government of the Philippines (GOP) to be onlent
to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) to carry out a program for
development of marine and inland fisheries.
2.        The project consisted of three major components; (i) financing of
viable marine fisheries sub-projects, (ii) financing of inland fishpond de-
velopment and rehabilitation mainly for milkfish-farming, and (iii) tech-
nical assistance required to support the lending operation and to build up
the technical capability of DBP for long-term fisheries development work.
3.        The marine fisheries component envisaged financing of (a) construc-
tion of 60 fully equipped fishing vessels of the 70 and 130 ton class, (b)
importation of 10 second-hand fish carrier boats, (c) construction of 3 ice
plants, and (d) 2 slipways.
4.        The inland fisheries component was to provide credit to individuals
for rehabilitation of 4,500 ha of flood-damaged fishponds to restore full
production and for improvement of existing ponds and construction of new
ones with an aggregate area of 7,500 hectares.
5.        The technical assistance component included provision for (a) a
marine specialist and a naval architect to assist the Assistant Manager
(Project Administrator), (b) a study of fish marketing and distribution to
be carried out by consultants to aid future fisheries investment plans, (c)
a feasibility study for a smallholder (milkfish) fishpond estate scheme,
(d) an aquaculture extension specialist to assist the Government to orga-
nize and execute an inland fisheries technical training program, and (e) a
test fishing program to obtain marine fisheries resource data.
Project Implementation
6.        Marine Fisheries.  There was a considerable delay in implementing
this component. It took longer than expected to staff the Fisheries Group
(FG) of DBP and prepare it to implement the rather complex project activities,
such as selecting consultants for the two studies and evolving working procedures
with the Bureau of Fisheries and with consultants, and developing suitable
fishing vessel designs. As FG prepared itself for project implementation,
the oil crisis came and seriously impaired the business outlook for marine



ANNEX 4
Page 2
fisheries. There was a sharp increase in the cost of vessels (from the ap-
praisal estimate of about $60,000 for 70 gross ton vessel to an actual cost
f about $200,000), and also in the operating cost for the oil intensive
trawler operations. Moreover, the oil crisis brought with it a general
economic downturn and caused a slackening of the demand for fish, and, hence,
3tagnant prices for the fish landed. As a result, a large number of trawl-
ers suspended their operations. Under these circumstances, DBP's efforts
in investment promotion were not as effective as anticipated at the 1972
ippraisal. In the meantime, the designs of the fishing vessels had to be
.iodified to reflect higher oil prices, so that the vessels had to have more
flexible capabilities (such as purse seining, in addition to trawling) and
be less dependent on oil-intensive techniques. Steel vessels became so
costly that they were no longer financially and economically viable. As of
February 1976, loans for 19 wooden vessels had been approved, and the project
is expected to finance about 25 wooden vessels, compared with the original
target of 60 vessels (15 steel vessels and 45 wooden vessels).
7.        As of February 1976, loans for all three ice plants originally
projected had been approved. Because of the greatly increased investment
2ost, however, the rate of commitment has been higher than the number of
-3ub-projects might suggest. As of February 1976, $2.9 million out of the
55.9 million of the Bank loan allocated for the marine sector was committed.
8.        Inland Fisheries.  From the outset, the lending for the inland
sector maintained a fairly rapid pace. As of February 1976, 383 sub-proj-
ects covering a total of about 9,300 ha for total subloans of about 1 46.5
million ($6.2 million) had been approved. The average development area was
for about 24 ha of fishponds at an average cost of about P 5,000/ha. 37%
of the loans were in Luzon, 42% in the Visayas, 14% in Mindanao and 7% in
other provinces. The table below shows the size frequency distribution of
loans in eight of the most important fish growing areas. No loans were made
for development of fishponds larger than 100 ha.

Total                145                    100%
9.        DBP experience shows that good fishpond management coupled with
appropriate inputs can raise milkfish production to at least the levels



ANNEX 4
Page 3
of 2,500 kg/ha/yr achieved by successful commercial fish farmers in Taiwan.
Milkfish production of well managed DBP fish-farms appears to be between about
1,600 kg and 2,100 kg/ha/yr, depending on the location of the ponds, the type
of management system practiced and the inputs used.
10.       FG has done well in organizing itself in the inland sector and
has developed a capable technical and financial staff who have been active
in investment counseling, in loan preparation, and appraisal. There appears
to be, however, a need to strengthen the loan supervision staff in order to
derive better measures of the impact of the lending program on overall pro-
duction and better measures of productivity.
11.       Feasibility Studies.  Consultants were retained by the Bureau of
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) to carry out two studies, (i) Small-
holder Fishpond Project Study and (ii) Fish Marketing and Distribution Study.
The Smallholder Fishpond Project Study was conducted jointly by Sinotech
Engineering Consultants, Inc., Taipei, Taiwan, and International Engineer-
ing Consultants, Inc., San Francisco, California, USA. The study was tech-
nically well done, but failed to demonstrate that the smallholder fishpond
estate concept was technically, financially or economically sound. The
Fish Marketing and Distribution Study was carried out by Norconsult A.S.,
Oslo, Norway. The study presents a large body of useful fisheries data and
analyses. Unfortunately, however, the final report of this study was not
available in time for the preparation of the Second Fisheries Credit Project.
12.       Other Related Activities.  The first project included components
for (i) a test fishing program, and (ii) an inland fisheries training pro-
gram to be carried out by the Bureau of Fisheries. For the test fishing
program three fishing vessels of BFAR (M/V Sabalo, M/V Lapu-Lapu and R/V
Research I) have conducted purse seining, trawling and longline cruises,
primarily in trial fishing in the southern part of the Philippines. These
activities have made a significant contribution towards a broader investiga-
tion of fisheries resources in the area. For the inland fisheries train-
ing program, the Pond Fisheries Extension and Training Group, under the
BFAR direction, conducted training courses and field extension service dem-
onstrations in five principal field extension units. This program, with
course in three subject areas, (i) general, (ii) extension teaching methods,
and (iii) technical, has developed into one of the best training programs
of the kind in the region and has produced a number of highly qualified ex-
tension personnel and teaching aides.
13.       Subloan Disbursement.  The rate of subloan processing in both the
inland and marine sectors was increasing rapidly at the time of last super-
vision (February 1976) and it is expected that the full amount of the loan
would be committed by December 1976. As of April 8, 1976, Bank disbursement
was $3.5 million.
DBP Fisheries Group
14.       Although increased supervision staff is needed for proper monitor-
ing and supervision of the rapidly expanding inland fisheries portfolio,



ANNEX 4
Page 4
and the technical staff in the marine sector needs to be strengthened, the
performance of FG has been good. While DBP lending in fisheries has not
been a large part of the total lending activity in the fisheries sector in
the Philippines in the past, the changes in the structure of the fishing
industry which began about 1970 requiring a rapid expansion of the catches
of commercial fleet, call for DBP to play a far more important role in
financing fisheries investments. DBP is in a unique position to develop its
institutional and technical capabilities to a greater degree by building on
the experienced gained in executing the first Fisheries Credit Project.

SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
Background
1.      DBP was established in 1958 (Republic Act No. 85) as an autonomous
government-owned development bank for supplying credit to industry and agri-
culture. It succeeded the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, created in
1947 primarily for post-war reconstruction. DBP is the single largest in-
stitutional source of long-term funds in the Philippines. Since its incep-
tion it has approved financial assistance totalling nearly $3 billion. The
volume and diversity of its operations give it a prominent and unique role
as the COvernment's arm for financing economic development.
2.      Under its Charter, DBP is empowered to engage in a wide range of
financial activities, including:
(i) granting loans for the establishment or development
of any agricultural or industrial enterprise, including
public utilities, mining, livestock, fisheries, and home
financing;
(ii)  purchasing equity investments in any agricultural or in-
dustrial enterprise;
(iii) guaranteeing loans and other obligations incurred for the
development of agriculture or industry; and
(iv) granting loans to provincial and municipal governments for
self-liquidating or income-producing projects;
The bulk of its activity, however, has been in loans and guarantees for
industry and agriculture. About 25% of the long-term loan portfolio is
in agriculture. In 1964, it was also given the responsibility of assist-
ing in the establishment of smaller private development banks throughout
the Philippines.
Management and Staffing
3.        Overall management of DBP is entrusted to a 9-man Board of
Governors consisting of the Chairman (who is chief executive officer),
4 full-time Supervising Governors (one position is now vacant) with
responsibility for different departments of DBP, and 4 part-time Governors
(presently the former Executive Secretary to the President, the Secretary of
Industry, a private lawyer, and one vacancy). One of the Supervising



ANNEX 10
Page 2
Governors is Vice-Chairman of the Board.  The present Chairman, Leonides
S. Virata, was appointed in February 1970.
4.        DBP's present organization (Chart No. 9981) dates from September
1973. The operating core consists of three broad departmental groupings
(Industry, Agriculture and Community Development) each under the direction
of a Supervising Governor. A fourth grouping of central support departments
is under the direct control of the Chairman. In addition, two other offices,
Legal and Audit, are linked loosely to the organization, although these
offices are under the functional jurisdiction of respective independent
bodies, i.e., the Department of Justice, and the Commission on Audit (COA).
In the past two years DBP has concentrated its efforts on consolidation. As
a result, noticeable improvements in the functioning of individual departments
and in inter-departmental coordination have taken place.
5.        DBP has a total staff of about 3,000, 55% of whom are located
in the 35 branches and 24 agencies. The staff must have civil service
eligibility and is of generally good calibre. Salaries are competitive
with other Government financial institutions, and above those of the
general civil service structure.
Bank Lending to DBP
6.        The Bank has so far approved eight loans totalling $213.4 million,
all since 1971, for on-lending through DBP. 1/ In addition, the Second
Grain Processing Project for $11.0 million has been appraised recently, and
Second Shipping project will be appraised soon.
Operations
7.        Through FY74, the large majority of DBP's financial assistance
consisted of the guaranteeing of foreign loans - in FY74, this was 88%
of all operations (by amount). In FY75, however, there was a dramatic
change, as DBP's loan approvals rose from P0.3 billion in FY74 to F2.4
billion (of which 23% was to agriculture), while its guarantees
fell from P2.8 billion to P0.8 billion (Table 1). Part of the lending
increase (P0.9 billion) was for a special program of hotel construction
(geared in part to the IBRD/IMF Annual Meeting in Manila in October 1976),
but other lending rose sharply as well, due largely to the increased

Small and Medium Industries Development Project 1120-PH, $15.0 million
(out of a country-wide $30.0 million).

availability of funds from the Bank, Central Bank of the Philippines (CB),
Department of Finance, and commercial banks, which enabled it to substi-
tute direct lending for a substantial proportion of its guarantee opera-
tions, chiefly of suppliers' credit for capital goods imports. In addition,
the Credit Guarantee Corporation took over part of DBP's role as a guarantor.
Equity investment approvals, mainly in government enterprises, rose to P 212
million from P 79 million in FY74.
Financial Position
8.        As of June 30, 1975, DBP's total assets stood at P 7.8 billion
(over US$1 billion) up from P 5.3 billion a year earlier (Table 2). DBP's
liquidity position is reasonably sound (current ratio 2.1) as is its
present total debt/equity ratio of 4.5:1 (long-term debt being inclusive
of contingent liabilities).
9.        An increasing proportion of DBP's long-term local currency
loans, however, is being financed with short-term funds. This should
be corrected to ensure DBP's future ability to service its debts. In
particular, a large part of the hotel financing program approved by DBP
in FY75 is to be financed by a one-year securities repurchase agreement
with CB, which would be rolled over for at least five years. Furthermore,
the approval of most of DBP's domestic currency industrial and agricultural
loans in FY75 has been based on an increase in its short- and medium-term
holdings of deposits from the Treasury and other government financial in-
stitutions. A part of these deposits might be rolled over and, therefore,
considered long-term, but there is no certainty as to the amounts or the
length of time the rollover might be permitted.
10.       DBP's management recognizes the need to increase its long-term
Tomestic resources. In the first nine months of FY75, DBP issued P 500
million in medium-term notes (5 years, 9%) and plans to raise another
P 1 billion between FY77-81 through a savings bond scheme. These actual
and planned efforts will go some distance toward establishing an adequate
long-term resource base. However, DBP will still need additional long-term
funds to support its existing commitments.
Financial Performance
11.       DBP's net income for FY75 was P 71.4 million, 21% below its FY74
net income. This decline is in sharp contrast to the rising performance
trend of FY73 and FY74. The decline in income reflected mainly a decline
in collections and rapidly rising expenses, which included a depreciation
charge of P42 million on its assets acquired through foreclosures. In
judging DBP's financial performance, it is essential to recognize that DBP



ANNEX 10
Page 4
is a government-owned development-oriented institution and that its earnings
performance is not strictly comparable to private profit-oriented institu-
tions. At negotiations for the Second Industrial Investment Project, DBP
undertook to take steps to improve its financial position, and these would
include (M) an across the board upward revision of interest rates (within
ceilings presently allowed by the Monetary Board for those loans not covered
by specific statutes), guarantee fees and associated charges on all future
loan accounts, (ii) radical measures to improve its collections performance,
including better follow-up, and (iii) an increase in its penalty charges
on overdue accounts.
Arrears and Collections
12.       A low level of collections and the magnitude of its arrears
continue to pose the main financial problem for DBP. As of June 30, 1975,
Development Bank of the Philippines
Arrears Position on Loans as of June 30, 1974 and 1975
1974     1975
No. of accounts in arrears as %

principal outstanding                              23.5%    15.5%
Principal affected by arrears as %
of principal outstanding                           58.7%    46.8%
13.       DBP has not always made adequate efforts to improve its collec-
tions performance. However, judgments about DBP's arrears situation have
to be tempered by the recognition that (i) as the major financier of entire
industries, 1/ DBP is highly vulnerable to changes in the economic conditions
affecting these industries, and in view of the wide repercussions of any
actions it takes, DBP does not have complete freedom of maneuver in dealing
with its arrears problem, and (ii) the peso devaluation in 1970 caused
outstanding obligations of foreign currency borrowers to increase by about
70%; given the economic conditions prevailing, most borrowers were unable
to service the additional debt along with previous amortization schedules.
With DBP's reluctance to reschedule loans, these accounts simply kept piling
up arrears.
14.       Delinquencies on DBP's guarantee portfolio are also a major cause
for concern, with about 50% of DBP's guarantee portfolio being affected by
I/   At present, DBP has provided, through loans and guarantees, more than
50% of the term finance needed to purchase the assets of the following
entire industries: textiles, wool products, pulp and paper, cement,
coconut oil milling, sugar, steel and shipping.

arrears. Defaults on guarantees have required DBP to advance an average
of about P 400 million a year over the last 4 years to honor forelgn
obligations. These advances, which are immediately due and payable by
clients, have also accumulated extensive arrears. DBP has reduced these
arrears primarily by converting them into long-term loans:

(c)  (a) divided by (a+b)                41.67    26.2%      13.5%
15.       Reflecting the Government's concern over arrears, a Presidential
Decree (P.D. 358) was passed in January 1974, requiring government financial
institutions (in particular DBP) to mandatorily foreclose on loans and ad-
vances for which arrears exceeded 20% of outstanding obligations. In the
wake of this measure, DBP's loan collection efforts were stepped up; unfor-
tunately, with the economic downturn in FY75 which affected several major
Philippine industries (particularly the export oriented ones), DBP had
to slacken its pressure on borrowers to repay. This factor notwithstand-
ing, the main reasons for the high level of arrears are: (i) the inade-
quacy of DBP's system and practices for recording and reporting arrears;
(ii) poor follow-up and collection practices; (iii) low penalty rates which
make it profitable for borrowers to postpone repayments, placing their funds
instead in the money market; and (iv) overdues on several large industrial
accounts which should have been rescheduled two or three years ago.



ANNEX 10
Page 6
16.       Steps are now being taken to reduce arrears by rescheduling those
major accounts on which such action is warranted and overdue. Follow-up and
collection practices are also gradually being improved. To bring this per-
sistent and serious problem under control, agreement was reached at the Second
Industrial Financing Project negotiations that DBP would, inter alia, reschedule
all accounts in need of such action by March 31, 1976; increase penalty
charges; and intensify follow-up and collection efforts. The Government also
agreed that it would protect DBP against the risk of default or loss on all
accounts which DBP finances at the Government's request (e.g. the hotels).
Furthermore, in view of information available about the quality of its portfolio,
agreement was reached on DBP's making adequate provisions for reserves against
losses on doubtful accounts, or from possible currency fluctuations on loans
on which DBP bears the foreign exchange risk.
Audit
17.       An evaluation of DBP's audit was undertaken in conjunction with the
appraisal of the Second Industrial Investment Project. The audit, carried out
by the Commission on Audit (COA), was found to be thorough as far as the test-
ing of detailed transactions went. However, it was found to lack analytical
content and to include no analysis of DBP's portfolio; nor was it sufficiently
supported by adequate documentation. Moreover, unqualified audit opinions did
not point out: (i) that DBP's financial reporting differed in material res-
pects from "generally accepted accounting principles" as applied in the Philip-
pines; and (ii) that the audit was not conducted fully in accordance with
"generally accepted auditing standards".  DBP's management and COA staff ex-
pressed a willingness to incorporate necessary changes in present auditing
practices and appropriate qualifications in audit reports to meet the Bank's
requirements. At negotiations of the Second Industrial Financing Project
agreement was reached on the following: (i) submission to the Bank of an
annual audit report on DBP prepared in accordance with the Bank's "Illustra-
tive Form of Audit Report for Development Finance Companies"; (ii) inclu-
sion of a thorough portfolio analysis in COA audit reports; and (iii) sub-
mission to the Bank of a separate audit of DBP's portfolio carried out by
CB, within four months of the end of each fiscal year. Implementation of
the agreement should materially improve the quality of the COA's audit.
Fisheries Group
18.       DBP has only recently become a major source of credit for the fish-
ing industry. Its volume and amount of lending in the fisheries sector has
increased substantially since 1972. Excluding the sub-loans under the Bank
financed first Fisheries Credit Project (Loan 891-PH), DBP had financed as
of June 30, 1975, about P 225 million for fisheries purposes, of which about
- 120 million was for a very large number (over 30,000) of small loans in
the "foreshore" fisheries sub-sector. Of the P 225 million approved, about



ANNEX 10
Page 7
? 188 million in principal is outstanding. DBP reports that a totaL of P 25
nillion of the outstanding amount is overdue. In addition, as of July 31,
1975, DBP has committed P 35.5 million in the inland sector, and P 9.8 mil-
lion in the marine sector, under the Bank-financed first Fisheries Credit
Project.
19.       Although increased supervision staff is needed for proper monitor-
Lng and supervision of the rapidlv expanding inland fisheries portfolio, and
:he technical staff in the marine sector needs to be strengthened, the per-
:ormance of FG has been good. While DBP lending in fisheries has not been
i large part of the total lending activitv in the fisheries sector in the
'hilippines in the past, the changes in the structure of the fishing indus-
:ry which began about 1970 requiring a rapid expansion of the catches of
-he commercial fleet, would call for DBP to play a far more important role in
financing fisheries investments. DBP is in a unique position tV develop
Lts institutional and technical capabilities to a greater degree by build-
Lng on the experience gained in executing the first Fisheries Credit Project.

1/ 24 ha model. Input costs and yields are based on 21.6 ha of water surface because 10% of the fishpond
area is taken up by dike and water control structures.
2/ Gross sales in the first year are assumed to be 75Z of the gross sales at full development which are
projected on the basis of a yield of 1,850 kgs of milkfish/ha/yr. sold at a farm gate price of
P4.0/kg, which is net of 7% sales tax.
3/ Commission and fees equal 5Z of gross sales.
_/ Wages for one man full-time and one man part-time at P350/mo., and social security amounting to 7,5X
of wages.
5/ Subsistence amounts to about P3.5/man/day.
6/ Fertilizer consisting of about 200 kg/ha of urea about 275 kg/ha of 18-46-0 phosphate and about 2,000
kg/ha of chicken manure.
7/ Fry are assumed to cost P70/1,000, there are three crops per year and mortality is assumed to be
35% of fry stocked. 5,400 fry/ha are required to provide the 4,000 fingerlings/ha needed per
stocking.
8/ 140 kg/ha/yr. of the highest quality rice bran is required at P1.5/kg, and chemicals to poison
unwanted species of fish are used 500 ml/ha and cost P200/1.
9/ Maintenance of screens, canals, and dikes.
10/ Approximately 25% of a years' operating costs is required as incremental working capital (P25,100),
This appears to be adequate, as on the basis of DBP experience the peak working capital requirements
are expected to be financed by materials suppliers. The interest rate is 12% per year.
11/ See Annex 7 Table 1.
12/ The first year interest on the loan (P28,534) is capitalized at 127. interest. For the following
thirteen years, the principal and the capitalized interest are amortized at 12% annual interest.

1/ The fishing vessel has the outline specifications shown in the drawing (IBRD 15330). There are 25
crew including the captain.
2/ Gross sales in the first year are assumed to be 757 of the gross sales at full development, which
are projected to be P1,226,000 based on an expected catch of 703.5 tons of fish per year. The
fish is sold in boxes of about 25 kg (in Bacolod) or in tubs of about 35 kg (in Navotas) at an
average wholesale price of Pl.80/kg, which is net of 7% sales tax.
3! Commission and fees equal 5% of gross sales.
4! Typical monthly wage rates for crew are: captain P450; master fisherman P450; engineer P350; 6
officers P350; 16 crew P350. Clothing allowances, medical and social security costs, paid by
owner, amount to 15% of wages. In addition a bonus of P0.025/kg is paid, 60% goes to the
master fisherman, the'remainder is divided on a graduated share basis to the officers and crew,
5/ Owner paid food costs are about P3.5/man/day.(P3.5 x 24 x 30 x 12); excludes the captain.
6/ The main engine burns 72 liters of No. 2 diesel oil for about 9 hours/day, for about 276 days,
at P.97/1. The auxiliary engine burns 15 liters o diesel fuel for about 12 hours/day, for
about 276 days, at P.97/1. And the main and auxiliary engine use about 18 liters of lubricating
oil a day for about 276 days at P2.85/1.
7/ The vessel uses about 703 tons of ice at P93.3/ton (one ton of ice to one ton of fish lan4ed).
8/ Based on repairing and/or replacing one new net every four years. Each complete net costs
about P430,000. A net may last in ordinary use between 5 and 8 years with extensive repairs.
9/ Spare parts are about 10% of the engine cost or P40,000, the cost of replacing one fourth of
2,400 fish tubs which have an average life of four years is P10,000.
10/ Repair of engines and winch (P8,000), dry docking (P5,000) average cost of marine railway
charges, and includes about P3,800 for license fees, and P4,700 for trucking fees, and
P7,900 for bookkeeper, and P3,600 for office rental and supplies.
11/ Insturance rates are about 47 of the loan amount.
12/ The light boat costs about P18,850 for fuel, and P5,850 for labor, and P1,600 for repairs,
and P12,000 for depreciation, the net skiff, which is fairly large, costs about P13,000 fqr
fuel, and P1,300 for repairs and P11,700 for depreciation.
13/ Approximately one fourth of a years net sales is required as incremental working capital
(P300,000). This appears to be adequate, as industry experience indicates that peak working
capital requirements are expected to be financed by materials suppliers. The interest rate
is 12% per year.
14/ See Annex 7 Table 3.
15/ The first year interest on the loan (P191,000) is capitalized at 12% interest. For the
following thirteen years, the principal and the capitalized interest  e  amortized at 127
annual interest.

1/ The fishing vessel has the outline specifications shown in the drawing (IBID 15329).  There are
17 crew including the captain.
2/ Gross sales in the first year are assumed to be 75% of the gross sales at full development which
are projected to be about P758,000 based on an expected catch of 300 metric tons of fish per
year. The fish is sold at an average wholesale price of P2.53/kg, which is net of 77 sales
tax. The catch is expected to be composed of about 20% skipjack tuna 10% yellowfin tuna and
30% mackerel.
3/ Commission and fees equal 5% of gross sales.
4/ Typical monthly wage rates are: captain P450; master fisherman P450; engineer P350; 4 officers
P350; 10 crew P250,  Clothing allowances medical, and social security costs, paid by owner,
amount to 15% of wages. In addition a bonus of P0.025/kg of catch is paid, 60% goes to the
master fisherman, the reminder is divided on a graduated share basis to the officers and crew.
5/ Food costs are about P3.5/man/day (P3.5 x 16 x 30 x 12); excludes the captain.
6/ The main engine burns 30 liters of No. 2 diesel oil for about 6 hours, for about 207 days, at
P.97/1, And the main and auxiliary engines uses about 3.4 liters of lubricating oil a day,
for about 207 days, at P2.85/1.
7/ Based on repairing and/or replacing one new net every six years. The large net costs about
P500,000, the small net P250,000, and wire rope for the two nets P90,000. A net may last
in ordinary use between 5 and 8 years with extensive repairs.
8/ Spare parts (P15,000) are about 10% of the engine cost and P7,000 for the cost of replacing
one fourth of 1,200 tube whose average useful life is about four years.
9/ Includes about F2,700 for license fees, and P4,200 for trucking fees, and P2,000 for part-
time bookkeeper, and P1,100 for office supplies, P5,000 for repair of main and auxiliary
engine and winch and P8,500 for marine railway charges.
10/ Insurance rates are about 4% of the amount of the loan.
11/ Anchored raft approximately 8 m2 requires maintenance of anchor and provision for lights
and watchman P14,000. The skiff, costs about P9,000 mainly for fuel.
12/ Approximately 25% of a years' net sales is required as incremental working capital (P200,000).
This appears to be adequate, as industry experience indicates that peak working capital
requirements are expected to be financed by materials suppliers. The interest rate is 12%
per year.
13/ Maintenance of deck gear and net handling hardware.
14/ See Annex 7 Table 4.
15/ The first year interest on the loan (P138,000) is captalized at 12% interest. For the
following thirteen years the principal and the capitalized interest are amortized at 12%
annual interest.

SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        The proposed project would assist the Philippine Government in carry-
ing out its program for expansion of fish production and for strengthening
DBP's capabilities for fisheries development financing. The principal in-
vestment would be for (i) construction of new fishponds, (ii) rehabilitation
and expansion of existing fishponds in the inland sector, and (iii) construc-
tion of 17 fishing vessels (45 to 90 gross ton class), (iv) refitting of 4
second-hand vessels into fish carrier vessels, (v) construction of 3 ice-
plants, and (vi) a slipway to service fishing vessels in the marine sector.
Incremental Fish Production
2.        When the fishponds under the projects, with an aggregate area of
9,120 ha, reach full development, they are expected to add 15,000 tons of
milkfish per annum to the present annual milkfish production of about 100,000
tons. The 17 fishing vessels would annually harvest an additional 11,000
tons of marine fish. The total incremental fish production facilitated by
the project would thus be about 26,000 tons per year, with an estimated
value of about $10.8 million.
Fisheries Supporting Services
3.        In addition, the project fish carriers and ice plants would lend
important support to efficient utilization of fishing vessels and improved
fish marketing. As a result of the increased oil prices, the need for fish
carriers is much greater than at the appraisal of the first project. The fish
carriers would permit fishing vessels to operate on more distant grounds
without having to make frequent trips to the market. These trips consume much
oil and reduce the time the vessels can put to actual fishing. With proper
coordination between fishing vessels and carriers, the productivity can be
greatly increased, and the cost of fish landed considerably reduced. As the
near-shore grounds near major markets are almost fully exploited, so that much
of the incremental production from commercial fisheries would have to come
from more distant grounds, the requirement for carrier vessels would greatly
increase in the future. For precisely the same reason, greater quantities of
ice would be required for maintaining the quality of fish over the extended
average time between harvest and consumption. An adequate supply of ice would
be a condition necessary for fishing on distant grounds, especially in the
tropical condition, and the three project ice plants would provide very
important supporting services to the marine fisheries in general.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
Institution Building Effect
4.        One of the most important benefits of the project would be its
contribution to the strengthening of DBP's capabilities for fisheries de-
velopment financing. DBP is the only financial institution in the Philip-
pines providing medium and long-term credit in any significant scale for
fisheries development. DBP has considerably strengthened its technical cap-
abilities for fisheries development, but it is in need of further strengthen-
ing, especially in the technical staff for marine fisheries and supervision
standards for inland fisheries. In the coming years, the requirement for
medium and long-term credit for marine fisheries is expected to expand rapidly,
because much of the additional fish production required to keep the per capita
fish consumption from falling would have to come from the commercial fisheries,
which cannot be expected to maintain the required level of investment without
medium and long-term credit. The project would make a significant contribution
in helping DBP to evolve into an institution competent in meeting this import-
ant develop requirement.
Financial and Economic Viability
5.        All of the seven sub-project models have acceptable financial rates
of return, ranging from 17% to 39%, with a weighted average rate of return of
27% (see Annex 11 for detailed financial analyses). Since the financial costs
and benefits of the project are assumed to approximate the corresponding eco-
nomic costs and benefits, no adjustments have been made except the deduction
of duties and taxes on imported investment goods required for the marine
sector. The respective economic rates of return, therefore, are equal to or
higher than the corresponding financial rates of return, ranging from 21% to
43%, with a weighted average of 30%. The estimated economic rates of return
are relatively insensitive to investment cost overruns and operating cost
increases. They are quite sensitive to decreases in the prices of the fish,
but the chances of fish prices decreasing are extremely remote. Detailed
economic ratds of return sensitivity analyses appear in Table 3. Tables 1 and
2 present the details of economic rate of return calculations, which are
summarized below:

/a Much of the economic benefits for the slipway would be
external, and no attempt has been made to estimate its
economic rate of return.
In the economic analysis financial costs and benefits have been regarded as
economic costs and benefits, except that economic costs of investment are
estimated by deducting import duties and taxes on the investment goods
concerned.
Employment Effect
6.        The project would create about 1,000 new jobs directly re-
quired for the sub-projects (Table 4). Virtually all of these would
be filled by those in the rural poverty target group. In addition, the
marketing of the project production of some 15,000 tons of fish per
annum is expected to generate about 150,000 man-days of employment per
year and the construction of project facilities would require about 4
million man-days of labor.
Distribution of Benefits
7.        Although the direct beneficiaries would be some 400 rural entre-
preneurs who would borrow funds under the project, about 1,000 persons from
the poverty target group would derive major benefits from the permanent
employment and an additional 750 from fish marketing job opportunities
created by the project. Finally, there would be benefits of a general nature
in that the project would help limit the widening deficit of fish, which
is a staple in the Filipino diet.



ANNEX 12
Page 4
Effects on the Environment
8.        Negative environmental effect from the project, if any, would
be infinitesimal. The only possible pollution causing elements of the
project would be the 17 fishing vessels and the 4 fish carriers projected
for financing, which would constitute less than 1.0% of the commerical fish-
ing fleet of the country. On the inland sector, however, the environmental
effect would be a positive one. The fishfarmers generally have much to lose
by pollution of the environment, and they already constitute an important
pressure group against pollution.   On the whole, therefore, the project is
expected to have a positive environmental effect.
