REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SECOND FISHERIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for the equivalent of $12 million
to help finance a Second Fisheries Project. The loan would have a term
of 18 years, including five years of grace, with interest at 8.5 percent
per annum. The proceeds of the loan would be relent to the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP), on the same terms as those of the Bank
loan, for on-lending to the private sector for specific fisheries sub-
projects.
PART I - THE ECONOMYI'
2.        A basic economic mission visited the Philippines in April/May 1975
and its report, "The Philippines priorites and prospects for Development," is
expected to be distributed to the Executive Directors in the next few days.
Paragraphs 3-21 below are a summary of that report. The previous economic re-
port, "Current Economic Position and Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH
of November 7, 1974) was circulated to the Executive Directors on November 11,
1974. Annex I of this President's report contains country economic data.
3.        During the 1960s, the economy grew in real terms at the rate of
5-6 percent per annum. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been exploited more effectively. Moreover, the bene-
fits of growth were not distributed widely, and unemployment rose. Low levels
of taxation resulted in inadequate public investment in necessary infrastruc-
ture and social services. Relatively weak export performance, combined with
a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic industry, resulted
in a steady deterioration in the balance of payments position.
4.        During 1970-72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group, they succeeded in improving substan-
tially the maturity structure of the external public debt. Real GNP during
that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972,
the Government initiated a series of social and economic reforms in the
country including an agrarian reform program, tax reforms, and an adminis-
trative reorganization. These programs are beginning to show results.
5.        In 1973 there was a sharp increase in the level of economic acti-
vity in the Philippines. This upsurge was led by the international commodity
boom, which resulted in higher export incomes, a strong recovery in agricul-
tural and industrial production for the domestic market and an expansion in
public and private investment. The growth in real GNP doubled to 10 percent.
1/   This part, except for paragraph 11, which has been added, is the same as
as in the President's Report for the Chico Irrigation Project Stage I
(Report No. P-1783-PH, dated March 11, 1976.

6.        Like most countries, the Philippines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973. With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines proved quite vulner-
able to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices and the
prolonged recession in the industrialized countries. This sequence of
events has temporarily frustrated the Government's attempt to accelerate
the rate of development, and in 1974 GNP increased by only about 6 percent
in real terms. While adverse effects of the recession were cushioned some-
what in 1974 by a modest improvement in the external terms of trade, the
Philippines has been even more seriously affected in 1975 by the continued
rise in import prices and reduced demand for Philippine exports. The real
growth of GNP in 1975 is estimated to have been at about the 6 percent rate
of the previous year. Improvement in the growth performance in 1976 can be
expected only if recovery takes place in the economies of the Philippines'
main trading partners.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3.2 percent
per year during the 1970s, a period which has been affected by unusually ad-
verse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 percent in 1973-74,
but due to serious damage by typhoons, it grew by only 1 percent in 1974-75,
and the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half of 1975 to
ensure adequate stocks. However, initial indications are that the outlook foi
rice production in 1975-76 is bright. The Government is giving the highest
priority to increasing agricultural production and has initiated a number of
programs designed to expand the use of fertilizer, irrigation and supervised
credit. It has also intensified efforts to expand social services needed in
rural areas, including rural electrification, health and family planning
services as well as small-scale road and irrigation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the Gov-
ernment has made some progress with its agrarian reform for the nation's one
million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By December 1, 1975, the
Government had issued Certificates of Land Transfer in respect of 208,000 of
the 424,000 tenants on holdings of over 7 ha; thus, title to 366,000 ha of the
total of 825,000 ha farms occupied by such tenants has been transferred. The
Government has raised the cash portion of the compensation package to landlord
to reduce their resistance to land reform, but strong administrative efforts
will be necessary to ensure continued progress in the implementation of
the program.
9.        Industry accounts for almost 30 percent of net domestic product,
one-third of total fixed investment and 15 percent of total employment. In-
dustrial production, which grew by 12 percent in 1973, was adversely affected
in 1974 by the world-wide economic slowdown and grew by only 3.6 percent in
1975. This decline is primarily a result of depressed demand for Philippine
exports on the part of the country's main trading partners and the concomitant
slowdown in the rate of economic growth in the Philippines. Nonetheless, the
long-term prospects for industrial growth are favorable because of the natural
and human resource endowment of the Philippines and a very active private
sector.



- 3 -
10.       The Government has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently about 3 per-
cent compared with 1.8 percent in FY72. The Government has also implemented
a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax administration.
These reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom in export
incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase in national
government tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in FY74. As a
result, the ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP has increased
from an average of 9 percent in recent years to an estimated 12.3 percent in
FY74 and stayed at this level in FY75.
11.       Significant financial reforms have also been enacted.     At the
beginning of 1976, the Central Bank issued circulars designed to help ration-
alize the level and structure of deposit and lending rates; deposit rates were
raised for the second time in 18 months; long-standing statutory ceilings on
the long-term lending rates of banking insitutions were increased from 12-14
percent to 19 percent per annum; and the ceilings on short-term lending rates
were also raised. Efforts were also made to control short-term money market
operations and strengthen the organized banking institutions. These actions
are important steps in improving the mobilization and allocation of domestic
resources in the Philippines.
12.       In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines and in 1974 consumer prices rose by almost 40 percent. The
rise was caused by the large increase in liquidity that came with the export
boom in 1973-74, and by a number of cost-push factors, including the higher
rate of world inflation. To deal with this problem, the Government adopted
contractionary monetary and fiscal policies, and attempted to reduce the
impact of inflation on consumers by subsidizing such essential goods as wheat,
imported rice, and cooking oil.   As a consequence of the Government's measures,
the annual rate of inflation decreased to less than 20 percent at the end of
1974 and less than 10 percent in 1975.
13.       The rapid inflation in 1974 exacerbated the decline in real wages
which had begun in 1970. Overall, there was a decline of about 20 percent
in real wages during 1974. In order to offset the deterioration of real
wages in urban areas, the Government increased the salaries of Government
employees and directed private firms to grant emergency cost of living ad-
justments to employees earning less than P 600 per month. Nevertheless
real urban wage incomes declined and reduced the demand for manufactured
products, which contributed to the poor performance of the manufacturing
sector in 1974. The depression in the urban areas was partly offset by the
improvement in rural incomes that stemmed from continued high prices for
agricultural commodities.
14.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments bene-
fitted considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973.
High prices for the country's chief exports, including coconut products,
sugar, copper and wood products resulted in a 70 percent boost in export
earnings and a balance of payments surplus of about $670 million. Since



- 4 -
mid-1974, the external trade position has deteriorated, due to the sharp
increases in the prices of oil and other imports, less favorable prices for
Philippine exports, and reduced volume of some exports resulting from the
recession in the economies of the Philipines' main trading partners. As a
result, the overall balance of payments surplus fell to about $100 million
in 1974, and a deficit of about $400 million was recorded in 1975. Inter-
national reserves stood at around $1.1 billion at the end of 1975, the
equivalent of about three months imports.
15.       The outlook for 1976 is for exports to increase by about 12 percent
in real terms on the assumption that there will be some international economic
recovery. Imports will need to grow by about 7 percent in real terms in order
to maintain the growth of the economy. Due to a modest deterioration of the
terms of trade, the current account deficit may reach about $1.0 billion com-
pared to $860 million in 1975. Medium and long term capital inflows are
expected to finance most of this deficit, producing an overall balance of
payments deficit of about $200 million. Such a deficit can be managed without
serious pressure on reserves through utilization of IMF facilities and by
short-term foreign borrowing by the Central Bank.
16.       The overall level of debt of the Philippines is expected to remain
within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service payments to exports
and non-factor services would average about 16-17 percent during the rest of
this decade. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is aboui
10 percent and its share in debt-service is about 4 percent. These shares are
expected to increase somewhat in the years ahead.
17.       Foreign assistance on concessioned terms will be essential to help
to finance the larger investment expenditures which will be necessary for the
country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement of external
assistance reaches levels commensurate with the level of development expendi-
tures which will be required during the latter part of the decade, total
commitments of official assistance will need to be maintained in real terms at
least at the level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The
Consultative Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on October 1,
1975, agreed that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Government to seek
aid commitments of about $600 million during 1976; another meeting of the
Consultative Group has been called for June 15 and 16, 1976, mainly to review
prospects and needs over the next 5-10 years, which were analyzed in the
Bank's most recent economic report.
Growth Prospects
18.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy, which is primarily
a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains committed
to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide for a con-
tinued increase in incomes and employment. High priority must be accorded
to expanding employment opportunities - in the short-term as well as the
long-term - because unemployment and underemployment are still high, and the
labor force continues to grow at 3 percent a year.



- 5 -
19.       Priority must also be given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding industrial export production and to accelerat-
ing development of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced
during the last two years in importing sufficient quantities of food at
reasonable prices, especially cereals, have increased the Government's re-
solve to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and corn as soon as possible. The
Government rightly recognizes that the incrersed cost of petroleum and other
imports cannot be financed indefinitely by borrowing abroad, and it is active-
ly encouraging both local and foreign investors to expand productive in-
vestments. Because it will take time for these investments to have an impact
on the balance of payments, the Government is seeking increased support from
the international financial community to help carry out its development pro-
gram and to ease the adjustment to higher petroleum and other import prices.
Because of the substantial easing of the external debt burden which has
taken place in the last several years, the Philippines now has the
capacity to borrow externally larger amounts of capital on appropriate terms
to support its development program.
20.       Given the likely availability of resources and the expected growth
in various sectors, it is reasonable for the Government to plan for a longer
term growth in GNP of about 7 percent a year in real terms. To achieve
this objective, increased investments will be necessary in a wide range of
industries. Public investments also need to be increased. A new public
infrastructure program is being prepared, and the Government is putting
emphasis on developing nuclear and indigenous power sources and on irriga-
tion, feeder roads and other projects to support increased food production.
The Government has made considerable progress in recent years in building up
the capacity of public sector agencies to prepare and execute projects. How-
ever, there will be a need for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect cf
administration. The ratio of public investment to GNP will need to rise from
the present level of 3 p3rcent to at least 5 percent by 1980.     To support this
level of investment, the Government will need to in.ensify its tax efforts so
that the ratio of national taxes to GNP continues to rise frGm its present
level of 11-12 percent to 14 percent by 1980.
21.       The Government's ambitious development program will ccntinue to
require foreign resources in addition to the capital which would become
available for the financing of the foreign exchange component of develop-
ment projects. Some financing of local costs is justified, esr,cially for
projects of economic and social importance which need only limited amounts
of foreign exchange. In view of the Philippines balance of payments and ex-
ternal debt position, and taking into account the country's performance in
economic development and its relatively low per capita income, the Philip-
pines is considered eligible for Third Window loans fron. the Bank. One Third
Window loan of $25 million for the Third Education Project has already been
approved by the Executive Directors, and one additional Third Window loan of
$10 million is proposed as part of the financing for the Manila Urban Develop-
ment Project.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
22.       By April 30, 1976, the Philippines had received 35 Bank loans
and 3 IDA credits totalling $886.7 million, net of cancellazions. About 33
percent of the Bank/IDA lending, $293 million, has been for infrastructure
projects in power, transportation, and water supply and $63 million has been
for population and education projects. Of the remainder, about $280 million
has been for agriculture and about $250 million for industry. There has been
a marked improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philippines have
been executed in the last three years, compared with experience in the 1960s,
when shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration to
cause serious problems. All on-going projects are now being implemented
reasonably well. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA
credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1976 and notes on the execution
of on-going projects.
23.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to support
the Philippine devrelopment effort with its particular emphasis on agriculture
and infrastructure. Shortages of domestic revenues led to low investment for
these purposes in the past. The last three years have seen major changes
which have helped to overcome these constraints and both the ambitious
Philippine development program and the Bank's lending program have been de-
signed to make good past neglect and to meet future needs. Commitments of
$165.1 million in FY74 and $208 million in FY75 compared to an average of
about $30 million a year in the preceding five years.
24.       Five loans totalling $212 million have so far been approved in FY76.
This proposed loan for the Second Fisheries Project, which is being presented
at the same meeting as a proposed loan for the Second Grain Processing Project,
and proposed loans for the Manila Urban Development Project, which may also
be presented before the end of this month, are the last loans for the Philip-
pines scheduled for consideration during this fiscal year. Loans for a
highways and a power p oject may be ready for presentation in the first half
of FY77.
25.        IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.2 mil-
lion for investments in 13 companies in the fields of development banking,
power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products, nickel
mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these investments,
as of March 31, 1976, $19.1 million had been sold, $0.4 million cancelled
and $3.7 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of $53.0 million. On the
same date, all commitments were fully disbursed. Preliminary proposals
have been received for an aluminum smelter and other projects in pulp and
paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and shipbuilidng fields.



PART III - THE FISHERIES SECTOR IN PHILIPPINES
26.       The fisheries sector in the Philippines accounts for 4 percent
of GNP and has considerable potential for further development. The
Philippines with over 7,000 islands has excellent access to productive
marine fisheries, and the coastline with its many estuarine areas is ideal
for brackish water fish farming.   Fisheries employ directly about 700,000
persons (about 5 percent of total employment), most of whom are small
fishermen in the traditional subsistence sector.    Fish is a staple in the
Filipino diet and provides over one-third of animal protein intake. Total
fish consumption was estimated to be about 1.4 million tons in 1974 and is
expected to increase by at least 6 percent per year. Exports, consisting
mainly of shrimp and tuna, amounted to $18 million in 1974, while annual
fish imports, mainly canned mackerel, canned sardine and other processed
fish products, amounted to about $32 million. Large investments will be
necessary in the coming years to increase production to meet domestic
demand.
Marine Fisheries
27.       Marine fisheries consist of municipal fisheries and commercial
fisheries. Municipal fisheries comprise about 500,000 poor fishermen, who
fish from small boats (under 3 gross tons) in coastal shallow waters; commercia
fisheries comprise some 1,500 operators using about 2,500 vessels, ranging
from three to over 100 gross tons, for deep-sea fishing. Since the sus-
tainable yields from the Philippines waters are estimated to be about 1.7
million tons, the resource base will not be a constraint in achieving further
production increases. However, the scope for further expansion of the muni-
cipal fisheries catch is limited, because the upper limit for fish production
in waters accessible to municipal fishermen has nearly been reached. Much
of the additional production needed to meet further demand will therefore
have to come from commercial fisheries. Prior to the oil crisis in 1973, the
commercial fishing industry had responded to the problem of over-fishing
in coastal waters by relying on larger boats with more powerful engines to
reach more distant fishing grounds. The increase in oil prices, however, has
resulted in much higher operating costs and commercial fishermen have adapted
to this situation by rely4ng more heavily on smaller vessels, which have more
flexible capabilities and use less oil-intensive methods such as purse seining.
Inland Fisheries
28.       Inland fisheries also have considerable potential for further
development. The Philippines is among the leading countries in the
region in developing inland fish farming, particularly milkfish culture.
Estimated 1974 production of milkfish was 110,000 tons and the average
annual yield from fish ponds was about 600 kg/ha, which compares to 300
kg/ha in Indonesia and 1,700 to 2,000 kg/ha in Taiwan. There is consider-
able scope for increasing both the area of the fishponds and their average
yield.



-8-
Support Facilities and Services
29.       Despite the importance of fisheries, there are no specialized
fishing ports in operation in the Philippines other than Navotas at
Manila. Existing ice-making facilities, transport equipment, cold storage
auction facilities are inadequate and any large scale increase in fish
production would require expansion and provision of new facilities. Navotas
is currently being developed into a modern fishing port with the assistance
of a loan from the Asian Development Bank. The project, to be fully completed
by the end of 1976, will greatly improve marketing in the Manila area, which
accounts for a large proportion of total fish consumption in the Philippines.
30.       The construction of fishing boats in the Philippines is carried
out at shipyards near Navatos, and in many small private shipyards in the
Visayas, where a number of independent contractors have successfully developed
methods of constructing wooden hulls, which require low fixed capital overhead
in the form of slipways and conventional shipyard infrastructure. The quality
of the vessels is satisfactory; boat building is usually well supervised by
the owners and the costs of the vessels are competitive with those of comparablE
ones in other countries in the region.
31.       Institutional sources for fisheries credit are commercial banks,
rural banks, and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). DBP has
been by far the most important institutional source for medium and long term
credit and is expected to play the leading role in financing fisheries
investments in the coming decade. Commercial banks are a source of loans,
mainly for marine fisheries, and the rural banks are a source of credit,
mainly for inland fisheries, but these institutions have not provided sub-
stantial amounts of longer-term financing.
Government Policies and Development Program
32.       In November 1972, a Presidential Decree was promulgated to provide
policy guidance for the fisheries sector and to coordinate the activities
of the various agencies. This was followed by another Decree in 1975,
clarifying fisheries regulations and vesting the overall responsibility for
policy coordination in the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR),
under the Department of Natural Resources. BFAR now has 1,600 staff and its
functions include fisheries policy formulation and regulation, training,
research and extension.
33.       The Government seeks to increase fish production as rapidly as
possible, and expects to achieve this objective by developing: (a) better
knowledge of the resource base; (b) impro 2d extension and training ser-
vices; (c) provision of better infrastructure (ice plants and other shore
facilities); and (d) better managed financial institutions and credit re-
sources.



- 9-
Bank's Role in the Fisheries Sector
34.       To assist the Government in achieving its development objectives
in the fisheries sector, the Bank made a loan of $11.6 million (Loan 891-PH)
in 1973 for fisheries development in the Philippines. Under the project,
DBP initiated a program of long-term lending to help rehabilitate and expand
inland fishponds and to help expand and modernize the commerical fisheries
fleet and shore facilities. The project also included technical assistance
for organizing and executing an inland fisheries training program, a test
fishing program to obtain marine fisheries resource data and a study of fish
marketing and distribution. The marine fisheries component of the project got
off to a slow start because of staffing problems in DBP and the effect of the
oil crisis on sub-loan demand. However, the staffing problems have been re-
solved and adjustments were made in the design of the vessels financed under
the project, so that they had more flexible capabilities and could utilize
less oil intensive techniques. Lending for the inland fisheries component has
from the outset proceeded rapidly. The rate of sub-loan commitments for both
components is now satisfactory and the loan is expected to be fully committed
during the second half of 1976.
35.       Under the first project, DBP has developed considerable expertise
in lending for inland and commercial fisheries and has thus become the major
source of the long-term credit and technical assistance needed to foster the
development of the fisheries sector. DBP is thus in a unique position to play
a leading role in helping to finance the large amount of investment, which
will be needed in the coming decade, to increase production to meet the rising
domestic demand for fish products and to reduce reliance on imports. The
proposed second fisheries project would help DBP to improve and expand further
its lending program for fisheries development and thus help support the Gov-
ernment's fish production program. As a result of experience gained under
the first project, the commerical fisheries component of this project has
been designed to allow for smaller vessels which are suitable in the pre-
sent conditions of higher oil prices.     The project also provides for an
improved system for monitoring the impact of sub-projects and sub-loan re-
payments. There are a number of issues related to the development of the
fisheries sub-sector which still need considerable attention. These include:
the future pattern of development of municipal fisheries, which as indicated
earlier employ about 500,000 small fishermen with little prospect for increased
productivity; and a need for a manpower analysis to assess the training re-
quirements of the sub-sector. The Government is considering the possibility
of carrying a comprehensive study aimed at developing a sectoral strategy
responding to these problems and may request the Bank to finance this study
in the context of a possible future project.

PART IV - THE P'ROJECT
Background
36.       The project would be a continuation of the first fisheries project
and was prepared by DBP. A Bank mission appraised the project in August/Sep-
tember 1975 and negotiations were held in April 1976. His Excellency Eduardo
Z. Romualdez, the Philippine Ambassador to the United States, led the Govern-
ment's negotiating team. The Appraisal Report (No. 110lb-PH) on the proposed
project is being circulated separately to the Fxecutive Directors.     Annex III
provides a loan and project summary.
Project Description
37.       The proposed project would assist the Government in its efforts
to: (a) build up the institutional base for financing investments in marine
and inland fisheries; and (b) increase fish production for domestic consump-
tion. Under the proposed project, DBP would provide long-term credit to the
private sector for the rehabilitation, expansion and construction of lnilkfish
ponds, construction of new fishing vessels, conversion of second-hand fishirg
vessels into fish carrier boats and construction of ice plants with cold
storage and a marine slipway. The project is expected to provide additional
employment opportunities for low-income people and continue the process begun
under the first project of strengthening DBP's capacity to appraise and super-
vise projects in the fisheries sector. Details of the various components
are given in the following paragraphs:
38.       Construction of New Fishponds.    The project includes construction
of about 115 new fishponds covering a total of about 2,700 hectares. The size
of fish ponds would vary, depending upon the nature of the land available and
the operator's capacity for efficient management.    There are considerable
economies of scale in investment costs for fishponds up to about 30 hectares,
and the standard commercial model adopted by DBP involves a 24-hectare fishponi
with an average investment cost of about $1,470 per hectare.
39.       Expansion and Rehabilitation of Existing Fishponds.     The proposed
loan would help finance expansion and rehabilitation of about 265 existing
fishponds damaged by typhoons and floods and expansion of existing fish-
ponds. The financial and economic returns for this kind of development are
high because the investment cost per hectare is only about $860 and existing
fishponds generally have good natural conditions (i.e. soil, water qualitv and
proximity to markets) and are operated by experienced fish farmers.
40.       Fishing Vessels.   The proposed loan would help finance 17 fishing
vessels, of which about 14 would be of the 90-gross ton class and abo.t three
would be of the 45-gross ton class.    The number of vessels financed would be
small relative to the existing rleet of 1.000 vessels of comparable size he-
cause of the currently slow rate of investments in additional ships, but the



- 11 -
proposed financing would be important to maintain the continuity of DBP's
lending operations until such time as economic recovery results in an expanded
investment in this sub-sector. All vessels financed would have wooden hulls
of a relatively simple design. They would be powered by diesel engines
and equipped with trawl and/or purse seine fishing gear, shortwave radios,
fish finders and mechanical net hauling gear. The larger vessels would have
crews of about 25, and the smaller ones about 17. The design of the vessels
takes into account the effect of increased oil prices on operating costs
and the need for vessels which have flexible capabilities and are less dependent
on oil intensive techniques.
41.       Conversion of Second-hand Vessels into Fish Carrier Boats.     The
proposed loan would help finance acquisition and conversion of four second-
hand vessels into fish carrier boats. These boats would deliver ice, fuel and
other supplies to the vessels fishing on distant grounds and transport fish
from there to markets. As a result of the sharply increased oil prices, these
specialized services have become one of the most effective means of reducing
the cost of fish landed by commercial fishing vessels. A number of inexpen-
sive second-hand vessel hulls suitable for conversion into fish carrier
boats are available in the local ship market. Appropriately refitted, these
could provide specialized fish carrier services on a financially viable
basis.
42.       Ice Plants.   The proposed loan would help finance three ice plants,
each with a capacity to produce 20 tons of ice and to hold 40 tons of fish in
cold storage. These plants to be located around the Visayan Sea would provide
the ice required for vessels operating on distant fishing grounds and provide
cold storage facilities for fish being held for better prices or for collection
by carrier boats for delivery to the Manila market.
43.       Slipway.   The proposed loan would help finance a slipway at a
suitable location on the coast of the Visayan Sea to be used for repair and
maintenance of fishing and carrier vessels. At present, there are no suitable
slipways and the vessels in need of repair are beached at high tide and
repaired at low tide. The slipway would be capable of servicing practically
all categories of fishing vessels.
Project Execution
44.       As in the first fisheries project, the proposed project would be
administered by DBP, a wholly Government-owned development bank, which oper-
ating in all sectors of the economy. It is the largest and most important
institutional source of long-term finance in the Philippines. Since its
inception in 1958, DBP has provided financial assistance, including loan
guarantees, totalling almost $3 billion and, as of June 30, 1975, its total
assets amounted to $1 billion equivalent. DBP's lending operations have
increased particularly rapidly in FY75 and reached a level of $320 million,
compared to $39 million in 1974. This increase more than offsets a deliberate
reduction in DBP's guarantee operations, which decreased from $373 million



- 12 -
in FY74 to $106 million in FY75. Equity investments, mainly in Government
enterprises, were approved totalling $28 million in FY75, a much higher
level than in the previous year. The volume and diversity of DBP's oper-
ations give it a prominent and unique role in financing development programs.
DBP has administered a number of Bank assisted projects in the industrial,
shipping and agricultural (fisheries, livestock and grain processing)
sectors; the implementation of these projects has been satisfactory.
45.       DBP's overall capabilities and financial position were described
in detail in the President's Report (SecM75-239) on the proposed loan for
the Second Industrial Investment Credit Project (Loan No. 1190-PH), approved
by the Executive Directors on December 16, 1975. Since then, DBP's manage-
ment has continued successfully to strengthen the institution and raise
the standards of its operations. As a result, noticeable improvements are
taking place in the functioning of individual departments and in operational
and financial planning. DBP has a total staff of about 3,000, over a half
of whom are located in branch offices. The calibre of the staff is generally
good, although the middle management level needs to be further strengthened.
46.       DBP's financial position is reasonably sound.    Its liquidity position
is secure (current ratio 2:1) as is its long-term capital structure (long-
term debt-equity ratio 4.5:1). In order to increase DBP's long-term domestic
resources, the Government is taking actions, agreed with the Bank, to increase
DBP's equity and convert $53 million of short-term Treasury deposits into a
loan with a five-year maturity. DBP's net income for FY75 was $10 million, a
decline of 21 percent from the previous year. The decline in income reflected
mainly a decline in collections, as a result of the effects of the economic
downturn in FY75 on many of DBP's clients. To improve its financial position,
as agreed with the Bank, DBP in January 1974 increased interest rates, penalty
charges and fees; is now introducing prompt reminder procedures for overdue
accounts; and is planning steps both to improve its system of reporting and
recording arrears and to improve its collection performance on industrial
accounts.
47.       The Fisheries Group (FG) of DBP would be responsible for the process-
ing of sub-loans financed under the project. FG presently has about 25 staff
including fisheries experts, marine engineers and financial and economic
analysts. It has two divisions, a Marine Fisheries and Inland Fisheries
Division, each having and an appraisal and supervision section. Under the
first project, FG has developed considerable expertise in fisheries lending.
It does, however, need to increase its capability to handle the growing volume
of sub-projects by recruiting additional technical staff. FG is taking
steps to fill recently created positions by recruiting five additional inland
fisheries supervision specialists and two maritime fisheries specialists.
48.       Loan collection is a problem in DBP's operations in the fisheries
sector as about P 25 million (US$3.3 million) of the total amount of P 188
million ($25.1 million) of the outstanding principal on fisheries loans is
overdue. DBP is aware of the need to concentrate on improving collection
performance and has undertaken to review its fisheries portfolio, prepare



- 13 -
a detailed plan of action for reducing arrears by June 30, 1977 for discussion
with the Bank, implement the plan thereafter in accordance with a timetable to
be agreed with the Bank and to provide arrears information to the Bank with
DBP' s quarterly reports. (Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement).
49.       To improve its overall reporting and monitoring systems, FG would
institute a system of reports from project sub-borrowers showing the quantities
and value of production, itemized production costs and indices of productivity
(Section 3.08 (a) of the Loan Agreement).   The form of these repocts has been
discussed with the Bank, and summary information would be forwarded to the
Bank. In addition to the information on the sub-projects, DBP's quarterly
reports to the Bank would, as in the first project, continue to include data
on sub-loan applications, approvals, disbursements, repayments and arrears
(Section 3.08(b) of the Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Financing
50.       The estimated total project cost is $23.5 million, of which $2.0
million would be for incremental working capital; the estimated foreign
exchange cost is $6.3 million. Cost estimates include price contingencies
amounting to 33 percent of base line costs to take into account the effects
of international and domestic inflation during the project implementation
period. The proposed Bank loan of $12 million would, as under the first
project, finance the foreign exchange cost of the marine sector ($4.6 million)
and about 50 percent of the total investment and incremental working capital
costs of the inland sector ($7.4 million), including $5.7 million of local
costs. The Bank loan would have a term of 18 years, including a grace period
of 5 years. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk and relend
the proceeds to DBP on the same terms as those of the Bank loan. The exe-
cution of a subsidiary loan agreement, satisfactory to the Bank, would be a
condition of effectiveness (Section 5.02 of the Loan Agreement).
51.       DBP would on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan, together with funds
from its own resources, to qualified individuals and private companies.
Sub-borrowers in the inland sector would contribute from their own resources
10 percent of the investment cost of a sub-project and sub-borrowers in the
marine sector would contribute 20 percent. Sub-loans would have a maximum
repayment period of 14 years, including a maximum of three years grace. DBP
would provide, out of its own resources, working capital loans needed by
sub-borrowers to finance their requirements during the sub-project implement-
ation period. Sub-loans, which together with working capital loans to the
same sub-borrower exceed $600,000, would be subject to the prior approval of
the Bank. It is expected that about 20 percent of the sub-loans for the
marine fisheries component of the project would be approved by the Bank.
Interest rates on sub-loans and working capital loans would be in accordance
with DBP's interest rate policy; at present DBP charges 12 percent for loans
secured by land and 14 percent for loans secured by other forms of collateral,
but an increase in these rates is being considered in close consultation with
IBRD staff.  In addition, sub-loans over p 3 million ($400,0GO million
equivalent) would be subject to a service charge of up to 2 percent per annum
of amounts outstanding to cover DBP's costs of sub-loan appraisal and super-
vision.

Procurement
52.       Competitive bidding for fishpond rehabilitation and development
would not be appropriate because individual needs vary, sites are geographic-
ally scattered and work would be carried out by manual labor. Fishpond oper-
ators would, therefore, make arrangements satisfactory to DBP, for carrying
out this work with local labor or contractors. New fishing vessels to be
financed under the project would be small wooden hulls, which are normally
constructed on a custom basis in backyard sites. Contracts for ship-building
are therefore not suitable for competitive bidding, and would be awarded
by sub-borrowers through normal commercial channels under supervision of DBP.
Second-hand vessels to be converted to fish carriers would be individually
procured and contracts for their refitting would be awarded through normal
commercial channels with due regard for economy and suitability. Equipment
for vessels would be procured by individual operators on the basis of price
quotations received from qualified suppliers represented or established
in the Philippines. Through international advertisements, other suppliers
would be encouraged to establish themselves in the Philippines and provide
adequate service facilities and spare parts inventories. The advertisement
would indicate the approximate type of equipment and total quantity required;
potential suppliers would quote prices on various quantities of each type
of equipment. DBP would then assist the sub-borrower in obtaining the make
of equipment and the quantity required on the basis of these quotations.
53.       Contracts for ice plants and slipway (total cost $1.4 million, net
of cancellations) costing more than $200,000 would be awarded after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Contracts
between $100,000 and $200,000 would be awarded through competitive bidding
advertised locally in accordance with procedures which are acceptable.
Contracts of less than $100,000 would be awarded through normal commercial
channels. Foreign firms are represented in the Philippines and would be
eligible to bid for these contracts.
Disbursement
54.       The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over four years.     The
Bank would reimburse 61 percent of DBP's disbursements under sub-loans for
the inland fisheries sector (excluding land and working capital) and 71 per-
cent of disbursements for the marine sector. Reimbursements would be made
against evidence of disbursements by DBP.
Markets and Prices
55.       The domestic demand for fish in the Philippines is expected to in-
crease at a rate of 6 percent per annuum, which is about the same rate at
which fisheries production has actually exanded during the period 1969-73.
Since the potential of municipal fisheries is limited and scale of investment
in commercial fisheries may not be adequate to meet future production re-
quirements, a growing fish deficit is possible during the coming years. During
the period 1969-73, wholesale fish prices rose at about the same rate as the
general wholesale price index, but have increa:._J more rapidly during the
past two years because of the decline in deep-sea production resulting from
the rapid increase in oil costs. Although ex-vessel fish prices have not



increased significantiy in the last two years, it is expected that they
will rise with the general upturn in the Philippine economy expected during
the next year or two. For purposes of the financial analysis of this pro-
ject, ex-vessel fish prices have been conservatively assumed to remain at
September 1975 price levels.
Benefits and Justification
56.       Fishponds and fishing vessels financed under the project would
increase annual fish production by 26,000 tons, which would have an estimated
value of about $11 million. In addition, the project fish carriers and ice
plants would reduce operating costs and distribution losses by improving
fish marketing and transportation facilities and thereby help increase
productivity. The fish produced under the project would constitute an Irm-
portant source of protein for the Philippine population. The project would
cause virtually no degradation of the environment.
57.       The estimated financial rates of return on investments vary between
17 and 39 percent, with a weighted average of 27 percent. The corresponding
economic rates of return range from 21 to 43 percent, with an overall weighted
average for the project of 30 percent. The economic rate of return is sensitive
to fish prices, but, given the expected increase in demand for fish products
in the Philippines, a significant decline in fish prices is unlikely. The
project would generate 1,000 new permanent jobs required for the sub-projects
and about 750 jobs resulting from the marketing of the additional fish produced
under the project. Construction of project facilities would generate about 4
million man-days of employment. Although the direct beneficiaries of the pro-
ject would be some 400 rural entrepreneurs who would receive project sub-loans,
the beneficiaries of the additional employment created would mainly be very
low income people.
58.       In addition to these quantifiable benefits, the project would
continue to help FG improve further its appraisal and supervision procedures.
During the project implementation period, particular emphasis would be given
to improving the FG's technical capability, monitoring and reporting procedure:-
and collection performance. With the assistance provided, DBP would be able
to play a major role in providing the long-term financing and technical
assistance needed to support the large investments necessary to increase
fish production to meet the expected increase in domestic demand during
the coming years.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUNtENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.



- 16 -
60.       The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the pattern for previous loans
for lending programs carried out by DBP. A subsidiary loan agreement, satis-
factory to the Bank, would be entered into between the Borrower and DBP, and
its execution would be a condition of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.
The operating policies and procedures governing the onlending of the proceeds
of the Loan are set forth in Schedule 3 to the draft Loan Agreement.
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Arti-
cles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
62.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Ln. No. 637-PH       Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1960; Date of Effectiveness: October
15, 1960; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines
and will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area.
The project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future
irrigation development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the
1972 floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule.
Most of the work has been completed and the loan is expected to be entirely
disbursed by the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40 percent cvur
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects oL
successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in costs is
being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close coordina-
tion established between irrigation and agricultural support services, the
project Is expected to reach full development in 7 years after completion of
construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate. Also,
nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including lands
which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there has
been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice.
As a result, the estimated rate of return is now more than at appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH       Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be
small, and, as explained in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress. The loan agreement was amended again in April,
1974 basically (i) to expand the scope of the project to include corn in
addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National Grains

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Authority to borrow funds under the project, and (iii) to streamline pro-
curement procedures (President's memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactori-
ly and the loan is expected to be fully committed by June 30, 1976, and
fully disbursed before the revised Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PH       Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Date of Effectiveness: July 23, 1971; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
The project is financing the construction and improvement of the
Cotabato - Digos road in Mindanao (160 km). Construction is only 55 percent
complete based on the original scope of works, the delay being mainly due
to civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing
about 20 percent of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the
contractor being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government
proposal to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually
execute the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund
will be applied to the balance of works which can be completed by contract.
The total cost of the reduced project is estimated to be about US$16.4 million
compared to appraisal estimate of US$15.8 million. The increase in cost
is due to a rise in construction costs which has been substantial since oil
price increases in late 1973. The roadworks have been completed in December
1975. The other components of the project including UNDP-financed feas-
ibility studies were completed in 1973. The closing date has been extended
from May 15, 1975 to June 30, 1976. Technical assistance to the Department
of Public Highways is continuing with Bank financing under the Second High-
way Project.
Ln. No. 809-PH       Fifth Power; US$22.0 and US$10.0 million Loan

Cr. No. 296-PH       July 1, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is proceeding satisfactorily,
and the unit is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of
1976. The erection of transmission lines has been somewhat delayed due to
unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions and is now expected to be
completed in June 1976. A tariff increases was approved, effective
July 1, 1974, and a new tariff increase is under active consideration.
Ln. No. 823-PH       Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 9, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the
Philippines. The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six



ANNEX II

months because of late appointment of technical staff. Sub-loan commitments
were slow therefore but they improved so that all funds were fully committed
by December 1975. The project has expanded the agricultural credit capability
of DBP into a new and important field thus meeting a previously unsatisfied
demand for loans for small to medium scale livestock projects.
Cr. No. 471-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of

Ln. No. 984-PH      Auroroa-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Loan of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation pro-
ject in the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project diverts
water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir, to provide year-
round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central Luzon. The project
also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central Luzon to inventory
water, land, and other resources and identify priority irrigatLon projects.
Although there has been some delay in constructing the two diversion dams
because of the need for more extensive foundations and abutment area grouting
than originally expected, most difficulties have been overcome and the work is
progressing satisfactorily. Diversion of 75 percent of Aurora water into
Pantabangan Reservoir was achieved in September 1975, one year ahead of the
appraisal schedule. In the area served by the project, lack of competition
and high bids have delayed awarding of contracts. Urgent work is being done by
Government force account. Project costs have increased about 54 percent over
appraisal estimates, largely as a result of inflation.    There would be added
benefits from early diversion, however, resulting in additional water for
irrigation sooner than planned, but the rate of return is expected to fall
from 17 percent at appraisal to 14 percent.
Ln. No. 998-PH       Industrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million Loan of June 12, 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: September 9, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1981
The proceeds of the loan are being relent to the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of the loan (US$48 mil-
lion) is being used by DBP to finance direct imports for medium and relatively
large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance (US$2 million) to finance
about 1,300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming project. As of March 31,
1976 commitments for sub-loans totalling $44.7 million had been made. The
project is progressing satisfactorily.

Ln. No. 1010-PH      Third Rural Credit; US$22.0 million Loan of June 17, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: August 27, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for an evaluation study) to participating banks. These on-
lend the funds to farmers and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment
in farm mechanization, on- farm transportation, farm support facilities
and equipment, coastal and inland fisheries, small-scale livestock development
and cottage-scale agro-industry. The project also provides for a review
of the effectiveness of the First, Second and this project. The loan became
effective on August 27, 1974, and is expected to be fully committed in 1976.
Collection of arrears by about 200 participating banks from beneficiaries
under the first and second projects is not satisfactory. This is being
watched closely by Bank staff and appropriate steps are being taken by the
Central Bank to improve such collections.
Ln No. 1034-PH       Sixth Power:   US$61.0 million Loan of July 31, 1974:
Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has been con-
tracted and project commissioning is expected in January 1977 - three months
ahead of original schedule. The transmission component of the project is
proceeding in stages. Some lines are under construction and others are being
procured. The design work has been delayed due to NPC's heavy construction
program. It is now expected that this part of the project will be completed
by the end of 1978, i.e. one year behind schedule. NPC raised its tariffs on
July 1, 1974, and a new tariff increase is under active consideration.
Cr. No. 349-PH       Second Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5,
1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The Credit is helping to finance a project for development of
technical and vocational education and for improvement in curriculum de-
velopment and teacher training. Construction has been about 11 months
behind schedule mainly due to delays in the finalization of design/drawing of
buildings and recruitment of specialist services. This delay is being
reduced through effective management by the project unit. Procurement of
equipment is on schedule. Both the program and schedule of technical
assistance have been revised to suit the current needs of project institu-
tions and to expedite implementation. Disbursements are ahead of the

The project is helping the Government to implement its program
of construction, improvement and rehabilitation of highways and feeder roads,
by financing the construction, improvement and rehabilitation of 1,400 kms of
roads in Luzon. Work has begun on all 14 contracts, 10 of which were awarded
to local contractors. Costs have increased sharply, but price adjustments are
being awarded to contractors by the Government to offset the sharp rises in
costs of basic materials, fuels and labor. The UNDP financed Road Feasibility
Studies (Phase II), for which the Bank is executing Agency, have been completed
and a possible Third Highway project is now being appraised. Execution of
other minor project items is proceeding generally on schedule.
