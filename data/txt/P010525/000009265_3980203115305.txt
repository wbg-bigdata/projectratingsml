Block 1: Country and Sector Backgrounds
1. Country Overview and Education Sector Characteristics:
Sri Lanka is a low-income developing country with a per capita GNP of US$710 in 1996. The economy grew at an annual
average rate of 4.5 percent during 1985-95. Growth declined to 3.8 percent in 1996 due to a prolonged drought that adversely
affected agriculture and caused an energy shortage. The economy is expected to grow at over 5 percent in 1997 and thereafter.
The present Government has stressed its strong commitment to promoting human development through rapid economic growth,
investment in education and targeted social safety nets. Past investments in education and health have contributed to the
achievement of relatively good social indicators. An infant mortality rate of 19 per thousand, adult literacy of 88 percent, and life
expectancy of 76 years for females and 72 years for males, compare well with social indicators in countries at considerably
higher levels of per capita income.
The General Education System
The general education system in Sri Lanka, with an enrollment of 4.2 million in 1996 (of whom 50 percent were females),
consisted of three cycles: primary education (grades 1-5) with an enrollment of 1.9 million children, secondary education
(grades 6-11) with 2.1 million children, and collegiate education (grades 12-13) with 0.2 million students. Under a recent
proposal of the National Education Commission (NEC), the Government plans to consolidate the education system into two
types of schools: Junior Schools, covering grades 1-9, and Senior Schools, covering grades 10-13. Additional objectives are to
implement compulsory education for ages 5-14 (to grade 9) and to adjust the management and financing of the education
system.
Education Sector Enrollment
The gros enrollment ratio in primary education (grades 1-5) is high (101 percent of age cohort). The ne primary enrollment rate
is 92 percent, and universal primary education is likely to be achieved before the year 2000. This is substantially faster than the
rest of South Asia. Secondary enrollment (grades 6-11) reached 75 percent of the age cohort in 1996, far above South Asian
averages. At the higher education level, Sri Lanka has the lowest participation rates in Asia, less than 3 percent of the age group,
in contrast to the Asian average of 8 percent.
During the 1996-2005 period, the total number of students is expected to decline from 4.1 million to about 3.5 million due to the
fall in fertility rates. This will have a substantial impact on the system cost. Sri Lanka has a unique position among developing
countries to have reached equitable female participation in general and university education. Almost all girls complete primary
education and most complete grade 11 (GCE O/L). Female participation at GCE A/L and university education equals that of
males. In 1996, women comprised over 80 percent of primary and 60 percent of secondary school teachers and averaged over 70
percent of teachers at all levels.
Education Sector Expenditure
By intemational standards Sri Lanka spends comparatively little on education with the proportion of GDP spent on education in
1996 being 2.9 percent. Over the past decade, the average share of education expenditure in the GDP has been approximately 3
percent, which is less than the 3.5 percent mean for Asia and the 3.9 percent mean for developing countries. The sector budget is
projected to increase by 1.4 percent per annum, a rate which is below the projected GDP growth of 5 percent.
Low Expenditure on Quality Inputs
The central problem of the Sri Lankan education system is low quality. This is seen by the large failure rates in public
examinations and high rates of repetition. At the main public examination, the GCE O/L, taken at age 16 after 11 years of
schooling, the failure rate, in most subjects, is 80 percent. Moreover, 20 percent of students fail all subjects. The average grade
repetition rate is 12 percent per year, representing a substantial degree of internal inefficiency. The low level of quality is mainly
due to the minimal expenditure on quality inputs in the education budget and the high level of untrained teachers. In 1996, 76
percent of the central and provincial recurrent budget was allocated to salaries, 16 percent for subsidies and welfare programs, 7
percent for travel and other expenditure, leaving only 1 percent for quality inputs such as essential teaching materials, equipment,
materials and supplies, and maintenance.

Issues in the Education Sector
The quality of the education system has suffered drastically as a result of the continuously low level of expenditure on quality
inputs. That in turn has created inefficiencies in the operations of the different components of the sector.
* Inappropriate and outdated school curriculum. The existing school curriculum has largely not been updated for over ten
years. It is not based on modem learning and teaching methods and contains significant gaps in information in a variety of
subjects. The curriculum is considered by the Government to be unresponsive to labor market needs.
* Poor quality textbooks. Textbooks have been a Government monopoly for over fifteen years. This has led to high cost
production by a rigidly structured Government department, the Educational Publications Department (EPD). The textbooks
are produced with inferior paper, poor binding and weak covers. Hence, the durability of textbooks is low, causing re-use
rates in Sri Lanka to be approximately one-third of those of comparable developing countries. Low re-use rates add
approximately US$1.7 million dollars per year to book production costs. The content of textbooks fails to reflect the school
curriculum adequately and has generally not been updated for over ten years. There is a single mandatory textbook per
subject per grade, preventing choice and quality competition. With a multiple textbook option, teaching and learning would
be more effective.
*  Inequalities and shortages in physical capital and basic services. A substantial deficit exists in facilities and services
with only a minority of schools possessing the necessary facilities. There is a shortfall of science rooms, libraries and book
storage facilities, particularly in rural and urban slum schools. In addition, much of the equipment, in the majority of
schools, is not in working order due to inadequate maintenance and replacement policies.
•  Shortages of quality inputs. Under investment in quality inputs has led to an acute shortage, with over 90 percent of
schools lacking adequate equipment and materials to match curriculum needs. Schools are poorly endowed with items such
as teaching equipment, resource materials, library books, duplicating machines, technology and audio-visual equipment.
This is especially true of rural and urban slum schools. Even where schools possess such items, quantities are very small. It
is estimated that needed quality inputs are available in less than 20 percent of the schools.
* Inequalities in resource allocation. Sample surveys of 120 schools in 1996-97 revealed wide inequalities in the availability
of facilities and equipment among different types of schools. Further, over 7,000 schools outside the North-Eastern
Province have no permanent libraries. Including the North-Eastern Province raises this number to about 8,000 schools or
about 80 percent with no libraries. Nearly all the remaining 2,000 schools have just one room, containing a few book
cupboards and shelves stocked with mainly outdated books and periodicals.
* An inefficient and inflexible management structure. The current management structure of the education system does not
match the operational needs of the system. The chains of command within the national and provincial education
departments are long and complex, slowing the pace of decision-making and administration. There is duplication of roles
and functions among officials in various divisions within the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) and the
Provincial Ministries and Departments of Education. Record keeping and administrative operations in MEHE and among
the Provincial Education Authorities (PEAs) are mainly performed manually, data on students and teacher- related
information required for educational planning are weak, and accounting information needed for financial management is
poor. Further, skills in data processing and analysis of information are inadequate at MEHE and among PEAs. These factors
lead to inefficient planning and an increase in the education system's administration costs.
*  Excessive teacher recruitment. The teaching force grew from 146,974 in 1989 to 187,579 in 1994. This caused an increase
in education salary expenditure of Rs 1.2 billion (18 percent) during the period. A 48 percent salary increase was granted to
teachers in 1995. This increased the education sector budget by Rs 2.8 billion. Teacher salaries presently take up
approximately 25 percent of the total public service salary bill. The large-scale recruitment of teachers during 1989-94 was
mainly a political job creation mechanism. It did not match the needs of the education system and exceeded the capacity of
teacher training institutions to provide pre-service training. In consequence, the education system experienced a substantial

compounded by an over-generous retirement policy, which caused a substantial number of trained, experienced teachers to

retire. As a result, the average productivity of the teacher force declined and was compounded by high teacher absenteeism.
*  Inefficient teacher deployment. Schools located in remote rural areas experience a shortage of teachers, while schools in
areas with attractive living conditions receive an excess supply. Existing teacher deployment mechanisms lack adequate
incentives to cause teachers in over-staffed regions to move to needy areas. Overall, poor teacher deployment is causing
considerable wastage in the allocation of educational resources.
*  Inequitable financial allocation. The present devolved funding of primary and secondary education to the provinces
through a block grant has resulted in funds not being allocated appropriately. Most funds are allocated for teacher salaries
leaving little for quality inputs and sustainability of the system. Two finance studies (ADB and IDA) indicate that the
present allocation of resources varies greatly among schools (up to 300 percent more, per student, is given to elite schools).
Thus, the Government has decided to increase equity of resource allocations and to implement a norm-based unit cost
allocation of resources. IDA has been asked to assist.
2. Project Objectives and Anticipated Outcomes (see Annex 1 for key performance indicators):
The project is linked to the Government's national education reform aiming to modernize the sector based on the National
Education Commission's vision which focuses on improving the quality, equity, internal and external efficiency and
fnancing of the Sri Lankan education system. The project objectives are to improve the quality, access, management and
financing of existing education programs, and so increase education's responsiveness to economic needs and reducing
poverty. Progress of the project will be evaluated on the basis of the following outputs:
Improving quality by: (i) revising syllabi for all subjects in grades 1-9 and in use by 2002 with sequential and cyclical
updates done every five years; (ii) producing about 20 million textbooks of improved physical quality, content, better
linkages to the curriculum by 1999 allowing the book life expectancy to be increased from one to about three years; (iii)
training about 100,000 teachers, 10,000-principals and about 3,000 In-Service Advisers (ISAs) in the revised curriculum; (iv)
distributing primarily to rural schools, education equipment and materials matching the curriculum and reaching about 55
percent of present needs, on a per capita basis; and (v) adding about 2,000 libraries and supplying another 2,000 existing
school libraries with additional books to reach about 50 percent of the schools having libraries, training of about 4,000
teacher librarians to improve learning, and enhancing the reading habits of about 2 million students.
Improving access and equity by: (i) re-organizing schools to match the new education structure forjunior (grades 1-9) and
senior (grades 10-13) schools; (ii) allocating facilities on the basis of enrollment and demographic changes and training staff
in school maintenance; (iii) improving the equitable and cost-effective allocation of educational facilities in primary and
secondary schools matching the new education structure recommended by the NEC, national education reform and
curriculum needs with main focus given to rural and urban slum areas; (iv) increasing, as part of the Teacher Education and
Teacher Deployment Project (TETD), the equity of teacher education opportunities among provinces and applying a norm-
based teacher deployment mechanism.
Strengthening management and promoting sustainability by: (i) assisting MEHE implement the new functions outlined by
the 1997 re-organization of the central ministry (MEHE), PEAs, Zonal Education Offices (ZEOs), National Institute of
Education (NIE) and the University Grants Commission (UGC); (ii) reducing duplications between the central ministry and
8 provincial and 87 ZEOs and establishing standardized management, planning and monitoring procedures; (iii) improving
the equitable distribution of resources to grades 1-9 by establishing, by 1998, a separate budget based on a unit-cost
allocation mechanism and thereby increasing equitable provision of education services; (iv) training central, provincial and
zonal staff in the application of the norm-based unit cost fnancing formula; (v) launching public awareness programs,
improving monitoring capacity and undertaking studies for the preparation of future projects in the education sector.

4. Benefits and Target Population:
The project's direct beneficiaries will be four million primary and secondary students; about 180,000 teachers; curriculum
and book sector management staff, textbook writers, printers and publishers; and education sector management and
fmancing staff. Improved education sector and fnancial management, together with reformed relevant curriculum and
improved textbooks, will increase the overall quality of students' learning outcomes. The following project benefits have
been identified:
Economic Benefits
*  Better educated and more skilled and productive labor force will result from the upgraded sequential curriculum,
updated every five years, allowing schools to respond more appropriately to national workforce training needs.
*  Books of improved physical quality will reduce the annual book replacement rate of 70 to 80 percent to be reduced to
about 35 percent allowing the introduction of a re-use book policy, resulting in better quality books and teacher
guides for some four million students and about 180,000 teachers. Savings will be used to sustain better quality
books.
*  Through competitive contracting, private sector participation will be increased and the book production contracting
gradually increased to reach about 100 percent of book writing; 80 percent publication; 70 percent printing and
continue over 90 percent distribution by 2002. Competition between public and private sector will improve the
quality and timely production of textbooks allowing MEHE to have book replacements match the curriculum cycle
(about every five years for each subject).
*  A better allocation of facilities, improved to better match enrollments, the demographic situation and the new
education structure, will increase the cost effectiveness of facilities use, and ensure that all schools have the pre-
required resources to teach the curriculum effectively. Duplication of service-s will be reduced and where
uneconomical schools exist alternative access will be piloted (busing, transport vouchers, etc.).
*  Training of central, provincial and zonal management, planning and financial officers to fit the re-organized MEHE,

Sri Lanka (LKPA10525)                                                              Second General Education Project
NIE, and PEAs will increase staff skills, improve records and monitoring practices of the education sector and,
through the introduction of technology, enable MEHE to adjust the number of staff employed and thus improve
efficiency and cost effectiveness of the education system.
* Unit cost allocation of resources by MEHE and the Finance Commission (FC) will improve the allocation of
resources for teachers' salaries, quality inputs and services and maintenance. FC will pilot the monitoring of the
provincial block grants and ensure allocation of funds shall be criteria and priority-based and more equitable. This
will be the first effort to address resource allocations within the devolved system. It will form a basis for other sectors
and is expected to result in more efficient allocation and use of resources.
Social Benefits
* Modernization of the education system will increase responsiveness of programs to 21st century employment needs
and increase Sri Lanka's economic development potential.
*   System approach will strengthen all of MEHE structures and programs, enabling it to address in an integrated manner
sector priorities and to better balance its resource allocations.
*  Textbooks' coverage of curriculum content will be increased from the present range of about 40 to 70 percent to 100
percent by 2002, thereby enhancing student leaming opportunities in schools and ensuring that the textbooks contain
all the examination content, thus reducing the present reliance on costly out-of-school tutoring.
1 The allocation of quality inputs matching the curriculum on a per capita basis to meet actual schoolclassroom
requirements replacing the present ad hoc system will increase equity and allow schools to meet the curriculum
quality needs by 2002.
*  Physical facilities matching the new school structure and responding to the curriculum needs will, by focusing on the
rural and urban slum needs, increase access and equity of educational opportunities in all-parts of the country, and
enable Sri Lanka to implement its compulsory education policy.
-  Establishment of 2,000 new libraries and the supply of additional books to 2,000 existing libraries will benefit over
one million students and 60 thousand teachers and allow teachers to apply more active leaming methods and improve
the reading habits of the students. The training of about 4,000 teachers as librarians and of about 2,000 public
librarians will improve the use of both the school and public libraries.
=  Establishment of a NILIS will formalize the certification of librarians and enhance the professional status of all
librarians.
Benefits on Unemployment
* The project investment in revising the curriculum, improving textbooks and libraries, and improving quality of education,
along with the Government's policy of restructuring the system into junior and senior schools, will have a direct impact
on the type of graduates. Curriculum revision will be based on social and economic needs and will address issues that
will improve productivity and labor market needs. This in turn will produce graduates that are better prepared for post
secondary education and graduates would gain greater employment skills that will in tum have an impact on easing the
unemployment of the school leavers.
Benefits on Poverty
* The project approach in providing facilities and quality inputs, targeting the deprived schools in rural and urban slum
areas, will bridge the gap between poor and affluent schools. Furthermore, the application of a unit cost based formula
for resource distribution under the project will ensure that poor provinces and schools will receive their share of
expenditure for quality inputs and school maintenance. A reduction of these inequalities will be pro-poor and will
increase the participation of poor children in schools and raise the quality (and hence the market value) of general
education for them.
Benefits of Quality Inputs
* Investment in quality inputs under the project will have a substantial impact on quality and equity among schools. Per
capita expenditure for these items for the needy schools (types IC, 2 and 3) will increase from Rs 27 to Rs 173 by the end

of the project period, a level that is comparable to national schools' current expenditure. This will raise the quality level
of rural and small schools and abridge the gap in resource distribution between national and type IAB schools and types
IC, 2 and 3 schools. On the other hand, the provision of equipment and materials to needy schools will motivate teachers
to teach in school rather than get private tuition fees from students. This in turn will bring about, not only a more cost-
effective general education system, but also result in cost savings for parents.
Other Benefits
*  Improved curriculum and textbooks and the availability of related educational materials will increase teacher interest,
thus reducing absenteeism and in turn improving the number of contact hours taught. The increased contact hours
will in turn give the students more learning opportunities and should reduce drop-out rates particularly in the rural and
slum areas where schools lack the needed resources.
*  Clarification of the roles of the central and provincial planning offices will improve the information system and help
produce clearer and more analytical reports, increase monitoring of inputs and the development of 3-5 years plans.
*  Strengthened capacity of planning staff to better implement the Education Management Information System (EMIS)
will result in improved management of the data base which will be used by senior managers for informed decision
making, thus allowing more informed ad hoc decisions.
*  The implementation of a more responsive, equitable, transparent and sustainable unit cost financing fornula would
increase equitable allocation of teachers, quality inputs, services and maintenance for all schools and increase
opportunities for the poor.
5. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements:
,tMpkmentation pariad: The time frame for this project is five years, from 1998 to 2002 with a completion date of
December 31, 2002 and a closing date of June 30, 2003.
Fxecuting aggncies: MEHE, PEAs, NIE, UGC, FC and the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP) will all assist with
execution, with the main coordination resting with the MEHE Education and Development Coordination Committee
(EDCC). Based on the lessons learned during GEPI the activities will be implemented by already existing operational or
administrative units with each being responsible for specific project activities. These units are all functioning with
varying ranges of abilities, and the project inputs will assist with their strengthening. The project inputs will address
system issues in an integrated manner, while taking into consideration recent successful education reforms in both
developing and developed countries during the last decade.
Implementation Capacity and Financial Analysis: Various implementation options were reviewed and in that process, it
was found that central MEHE capacity, where the project coordination Unit (PCU) will be located, was suitable with
sufficient technical assistance available to cover weaknesses. However, due to the plans to gradually decentralization civil
works, the procurement of quality inputs, and to increase the planning and financial responsibilities of the PEAs some
staff training will be necessary. Procedures for the management of the project activities were defned and training
activities included to ensure suitable transfer of skills to the PEA staff. Reporting steps have been identified and standard
reporting procedures were agreed. The procurement summary and schedule are detailed in Annex 6.
Project coordination: The PCU which successfully implemented the First General Education Project (GEPI) will be
strengthened to manage this project and will be responsible for coordinating all the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL),
IDA and bilateral donor inputs for this project. PCU will be given the-responsibilities to: (i) coordinate the project funds;
and (ii) coordinate the monitoring and reporting aspects of the project. PCU will work closely with the National
Authority for Teacher Education (NATE), MOFP, NIE, PEAs, the Director of Library Services and UGC, all of which are
responsible for the implementation of education activities. The project will cover PCU costs for project coordination, on-
site supervision, purchase of furniture and equipment and for the office and staff-related implementation costs. The
implementation of this project will be undertaken by the various implementation units of MEHE, PEAs, and GOSL. Such
responsibilities will be assumed by: (i) NIE for curriculum; (ii) the EPD for textbooks and publications; (iii) the National

Sri Lanka (LKPA10525)                                                         Second General Education Project
Book Development Council and the Director of Library Services, within the MEHE, for the library component; (iv) the
PEAs for the school rationalization with some involvement from Policy and Planning Research (PPR) of the MEHE; (v)
the EPD jointly with FC and the PEAs for the first two years of the project, and totally by the PEAs and FC thereafter for
all quality inputs; (vi) the MEHE, EPD, PEAs, NIE, UGC, and the FC for education management; (vii) the FC and PEAs
for the application of the norm-based unit cost financing for block grant funding and MEHE, MOFP and PEAs for the
capital expenditures; (viii) the MEHE/PCU, NIE and UGC for studies; and (ix) the PCU, MEHE, PPR, PEAs, ZEOs, NIE
and UGC for processing and monitoring. For this project all implementation responsibilities will rest with the various
responsible units, with increased participation from the PEAs. The PCU will be more of a processing and monitoring unit
than a management unit. The project implementation schedule is included in Annex 7.
Project oversight and guidance: National project oversight will be the responsibility of the existing Education
Development and Coordination Committee (EDCC) chaired by the Secretary of MEHE in cooperation with ERD which
oversees all the donor and intemational agencies' projects. The EDCC will meet every quarter or as needed, to ensure that
the implementation responsibilities are clearly communicated to the various units and that effective decision making and
implementation takes place and suitable reports are prepared for ERD and IDA. The MOFP/ERD, FC and MEHE will
ensure adequate and timely budget allocations, suitable staff, and appropriate procurement and payment procedures as
defined for timely project implementation. The roles of the various parties involved with implementation, particularly
that of the provinces to which education responsibilities have been largely devolved, will be reviewed annually.
IDA oversight will be provided jointly through the World Bank Sri Lanka Field Office (SLFO) and headquarters' staff,
in accordance with the supervision plan outlined in Annex 8. The approval of bidding documentation and overview of
civil works, procurement and day-to-day implementation activities will be the responsibility of the field office staff. The
responsibilities of headquarters' staff will be gradually devolved to the SLFO staff, including the coordination of the
technical assistance, professional and educational aspects of the project. These roles will be reviewed every year and
during the annual and mid-term reviews.
Accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements: The MEHE, MOFP and the PCU will establish and maintain
a separate account for the project. The account will be maintained in accordance with sound accounting practices
acceptable to IDA. Auditing will be performed annually by a qualified auditor in accordance with procedures satisfactory
to IDA, and an audit report, including separate statements on disbursements against statements of expenditures and on the
Special Account, submitted to IDA every year. During appraisal the financial capacity of the MEHE and PEAs was
assessed; in order to strengthen that capacity, particularly at the provincial level, the project will cover the employment of
consultants, related training and monitoring activities.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Sector and project performance will be monitored in the following ways:
*   Arrangements are built into the project to monitor outcomes of the Second General Education Project (GEP2).
MEHE and MOFP will monitor quarterly the project's fiscal impact. As part of the proposed education reform,
MEHE has asked each subsector to prepare routine assessment strategies (outlined in PIP for each component).
Such implementation will enable the Government to better monitor the effectiveness of the proposed project in
improving education quality.
*   A semi-annual progress report on the implementation of the project's policy, status of project activities and
financial situation (including disbursements) will be prepared by the PCUIMEHE and submitted to IDA in July and
January every year. These semester reports will be standardized by the Government, IDA and other donors so that
MEHE/PCU can prepare a common report satisfying the needs of all parties. One exception will be the annexed
financial status for each of the donors. The reports will include information such as: (i) a component-by-component
summary of implementation (actual versus planned); (ii) a financial summary by component including the status of
commitments and of disbursements; (iii) an updated implementation schedule and implementation plan and key
indicators; (iv) a list of issues and problems faced with options for resolution; (v) status of the studies; (vi) status
of technical assistance; and (vii) a work plan for the following period.
*   PCU will coordinate with other departments of MEHE, MOFP and PEAs the semi-annual update, the

implementation plan and the review of key indicators (Annex 9) prepared and updated by NIE, EPD, PEAs, MEHE
Units and UGC. In the later years of the project, the reporting will include monitoring of the impact of the project
activities.
Annual implementation reviews will be held and the monitoring reports discussed with the authorities concerned
and with other donors participating in the project. During the annual review, the status of the components will be
examined and plans for the following year's goals set. This joint review will be held about February of each year.
Government will give assurances that it will: (i) maintain policies and procedures to enable it to monitor and evaluate
on an on-going basis, in accordance with benchmarks and indicators satisfactory to IDA, the implementation of the
project and the achievement of the project objectives; (ii) prepare, under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, and
furnish to IDA by the mid-term review, a report integrating the results of the monitoring and evaluation activities of
the project and setting measures to ensure the efficient implementation of the project; and (iii) review with IDA the
progress reports and take all measures to ensure the efficient completion of the project.
Block 2: Project Rationale
6. CAS Objectives Supported by the Project: (CAS Report No. 15633-CE, Dated May 21, 1996)
The CAS objectives for human resources development (discussed by the Executive Directors on June 13, 1996) center on:
(i) improving education quality and school efficiency by focusing on the rationalization of teacher education; (ii)
improving the quality and responsiveness of curriculum and textbooks; and (iii) increasing the system's efficiency by
strengthening management and fnancing capacity in implementing a more equitable distribution of resources. The Project
is consistent with these objectives.
7. Main Sector Issues and Germent Stratey:
As a result of the NEC report, a national vision to modernize and increase national responsiveness for 21 st century needs
has been developed. That vision is embedded in the project with Sri Lanka aiming to achieve universal primary
education by year 2000 and improve the system's efficiency. Sri Lanka already enrolls about 75 percent of the
secondary education cohort; however, the quality of education remains low affecting the quality and efficiency of the
education system. The system issues consistently identified by the 1994 IDA Education Sector Report, the 1996 NEC
report and the 1997 President's Education Task Force are:
• The general education curriculum is outdated and not responsive to socio-economic needs and not prepared with
sufficient participation of users or private sector/parents.
* Textbook content does not reflect the curriculum content; development and production are uncoordinated. Because
of the poor physical quality of the textbooks' paper, binding and covers, about 70 to 80 percent of the textbooks
have to be replaced annually.
* Facilities and resources are not distributed equitably to schools throughout the nation. Shortages continue to exist in
difficult areas while surpluses exist in others. The poorer groups typically receive lower allocations.
*  Expenditures on quality inputs (e.g., equipment, textbooks, 3upplementary materials, library books, school supplies,
facilities and maintenance) are not allocated equitably and are declining, due to the fact that provinces are spending
on average only about I percent of block grant allocation for quality inputs largely due to teacher over-staffing and
over-generous social welfare allocations. Shortages of quality inputs are negatively affecting education quality.
* Teachers are poorly trained, and training programs are not run in a cost-effective manner. Teacher training
institutions are poorly maintained and not located according to population and regional needs. The capacity of
teacher training institutions is inadequate to train large,: umbc: of teachers and the country relies heavily on in-
service distance education services.
* The unplanned teacher recruitment during 1989-94 (student:teacher ratios fell from about 28:1 in 1989 to 24:1 in

Sri Lanka (LKPA1052S)                                                          Second General Education Project
1995) raised teacher salary costs to an unsustainable level. Yet teacher distribution does not respond to demand,
resulting in shortages in rural and slum areas and especially in subjects such as Tamil, English and mathematics.
* Vocational and technical education is not responsive to the labor market needs and suffers from low internal and
external efficiency resulting in fragmentation, duplication and costly programs.
*  Educational sector management remains weak as a result of almost annual ad hoc changes during the last five years.
The MEHE, PEAs, NIE and UGC do not have clearly differentiated or defned roles, and there are no measures for
career advancement for staff from lower echelons. In addition, some education sector decisions are not always made
on the basis of merit.
*  Expansion of private education is officially not permitted although there has been a rapid growth of "international"
primary and secondary schools attended by the elite. Similarly, a few private universities, associations or
organizations, have recently been allowed to operate privately at the post-secondary level. The Government needs to
rethink its policies on private education although this is highly political.
* Enrollment rate is less than 3 percent for the higher education age cohort, contrary to the average of about 8 percent
in ot.er Asian countries. Sri Lanka urgently needs to develop responsive higher level training programs and increase
the percentage of graduates to boost industrial productivity. Higher education policy requires urgent attention to
meet the challenges of the 21st century.
Government Strategies:
In August 1995, NEC prepared a National Education Strategy and a Teacher Education Strategy. It further prepared a
Higher Education Strategy in 1996 and is now addressing Vocational and Technical Education. The general education
strategies adopted by the Government in 1996 expressed the NEC vision to address 21st century system needs and
identify the following priorities: (i) increase equitable access and the availability of trained teachers particularly in rural
areas; (ii) upgrade the quality and quantity of educational materials (textbooks and library materials in particular) and
increase the equitable supply to all schools; (iii) rationalize teacher training and employment and deployment practices;
(iv) supply adequate educational facilities, science laboratories and libraries, particularly in the urban slums and rural
areas where shortages are serious; (v) increase the system's efficiency by strengthening management capacity and
implementing an equitable resource distribution mechanism; and (vi) increase the responsiveness of technical and tertiary
education to address skill shortages. These policies are consistent with the recommendations of the IDA 1994 Education
Sector Strategy Report. They are fiscally sustainable, so long as the Government strictly controls teacher employment
and deployment to allow increased spending on quality-related inputs without significantly increasing the education
budget. The Govermnent strategy of concentrating first on teacher ssues and subseque..iiy on wider education sector
issues is also consistent with the IDA Country Assistance Strategy. The teacher training and teacher deployment issues
are being addressed by the ongoing Teacher Education and Teacher Deployment Project (TETD, Cr. 2881-CE) with
combined efforts from Sida and GTZ. In April 1997, the President of Sri Lanka announced the need to reform the
education system. This declaration is very consistent with the NEC and IDA positions. The system approach of the
present project will assist GOSL in maximizing its reform efforts, to arrive at a more balanced allocation of resources.
The status of the Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka are listed in Annex 10, and Sri Lanka at a Glance can be found in
Annex 11.
8. Sector Issues to be Addressed by the Project and Strategic Choices:
In 1995, IDA and GOSL had agreed that unless the teacher education and teacher deployment issues were dealt with, as a
priority, limited benefits would occur from further civil works, quality inputs and management training. Thus, the choice
was made to proceed in two stages, addressing teacher issues first through TETD, leaving this, the Second General
Education Project, to focus on improving education quality, as part of a national reform and in an integrated system
approach. Based on the past project, experience shows that focused inputs through an investment project often starve
other essential parts of the system and do not always result in the desired impact. The system approach has been utilized
in the most successful education reforms undertaken during the last decade in various developed and developing
countries. Thus, a system approach integrating sector inputs has been taken for this project.

Issues being addressed by this project (and as phase one of the national reform) are:
*  Supporting the development of a national consolidated sequential and cyclical curriculum strategy for junior schools
(grades 1-9) to address the socio-economic needs of the country to meet the demands of the 21st century. To keep
pace with the changing world, the cuniculum will be updated every five years. This would also replace the outdated
curriculum and increase students' learning outcomes.
* Addressing the shortcomings in quality, content, production, distribution, use and cost effectiveness of textbooks by:
(i) reducing public sector monopoly; (ii) increasing private sector involvement and competition for quality
improvement; and (iii) providing training to writers, editors, printers and publishers. The quality of textbooks would
be assured by monitoring the paper, various types of book covers, binding, printing and duration of book usage.
* Improving the quantities and quality of educational materials needed to teach the revised cunriculum, based on a
more equitable per student allocation, would improve education equity and quality.
* Supporting the supply of improved educational facilities according to demographic and enrollment patterns to reduce
the urban and rural gaps in access to schooling. Equitable and cost effective distribution of educational services
would contribute to equalizing the overall quality of students' learning outcomes.
* Providing libraries, library books and training to the teachers and librarians to improve students' reading habits.
* Addressing sector management issues by clarifying and defining roles of the national, provincial and zonal education
offices to improve management efficiency and to eliminate duplications. The EMIS system will be strengthened to
improve the national database and flow of information to facilitate effective decision making.
*Implementing a unit cost fnancing formula by the project to address the inequitable distribution of educational
resources and increase the cost effectiveness of educational expenditures.
9. Project Alternatives Considered and Reasons for Rejection:
Various options were considered during project preparation, the main ones being:
a) A fist Qption was to continue GEPI format. However, the sector work and studies undertaken led to the conclusion
that the continuation of GEPI, as originally envisaged was premature. As stated above, the most crucial priorities
identified were teacher education and teacher deployment issues. Joint TETD and GEP2 project preparation was
continued with the focus put on the TETD. Once TETD project was started, the preparation of a system based
project was continued, in cooperation with DFID and GTZ during appraisal when parallel inputs were defined.
b) A second option considered and rejected was GOSL's request to include all the subsectors in a system based project.
It was determined that the main focus of this project should be basic education (primary and lower secondary) and
efforts should be concentrated on three aspects of education quality. These were: (i) improving the content,
sequence and range of curriculum; (ii) improving the links between the curriculum and the textbooks and improving
the physical qualities of textbooks to introduce a re-use policy; and (iii) increasing efficiency of education
management and resource distribution. The vocational and higher education subsectors were not included because
policy directions are still being developed.
c) A third Qotion, to address a specific or single project activity (e.g., only textbooks - an approach used by most
donors in Sri Lanka due to small amounts of funding) rather than a system approach, was also rejected. It was clear
that the difficult fiscal situation of the country demands a system approach which addresses interlinkages between
the various activities. An integrated, interrelated approach is also needed to improve the balance of resource
allocations and increase the sustainability of the system.
d) A fiurth option was to adopt a short-term operational approach which would involve the Government stabilizing its
education administrative structure and halting the almost annual changes of recent years. To strengthen the
system's capacity, the administrative structure needed to be more stable; and to increase equity the allocation of
resources needed to be strongly linked to actual needs (programs and curriculum), demographic changes and
enrollment numbers (an early 1996 survey indicated that elite schools were receiving up to 300 percent more

resources). There was a need to equate and stabilize the allocations of the resources within the sector. An agreement
was reached with the Government to address these issues.
e) In addition, for most components various options were assessed and examples of such analysis are: three
management structures and about six production options were assessed for the supply of textbooks with EPD; total
quality inputs were estimated and implementation capacity and alternatives were discussed with three provinces and
it was decided to phase implementation; two re-structuration of libraries options were examined and the scope was
determined following various costs analysis; various sector management and training options were discussed and
adjusted when provinces were consulted; and the preparation of the new financial mechanism was adjusted three
times and in spite of all provinces asking to be included from the start of the project, it was determined that a pilot
phase was necessary. As a result of the above analysis crucial staff and system incentives were established.
f)  Finally, although the project was focusing on ways to improve education quality and focusing on upgrading teachers
(through ongoing TETD project), updating of textbooks and improving the suitability educational materials and
facilities and strengthening management and financing the project will have an important impact on reducing
poverty.

11. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design:
Three education sector projects financed by IDA have been completed, the First and Second Vocational Training Projects
which were limited to the construction industry (Credits 1130-CE and 1698-CE), and GEPI (Credit 2072-CE) for which
an ICR was finalized on June 9, 1997. Experiences from these projects identify the following lessons, each of which was
taken into account in the design of GEP2:
*  Lesson 1 (see ICR, Cr. 2072-CE): The importance in Sri Lanka of ensuring ownership of the project by a wide range
of senior officials, including the provinces and obtaining their commitments up front, without which implementation
is difficult. All project components have been prepared by national committees with both MEHE and IDA using
intensive participatory and consultative processes with all the concerned parties. All conditions have been detailed
and discussed and realistic targets set within the political and economic situation of the country.
*  Lesson 2 (see ICR, Cr. 1698-CE): The establishment of the Institute for Construction Industry Training and
Development (ICTAD) as a semi-autonomous institution, with sufficient authority to use flexible staffing and
contracting procedures, was very successful; and the use of private sector and NGOs for project activities proved to be
an efficient way to implement training activities and increase the cost effectiveness of the operation. ICTAD lessons
regarding the organization of a semi-autonomous body have been taken into consideration in the case of EPD.
*  Lesson 3 (see ICR Cr., 1698-CE): The benefits of ICTAD's surveys and effective monitoring have led to adjustments
in training programs and increased responsiveness of programs. Increased participatory approach of users is
envisaged for curriculum development and surveys and monitoring for the management and financial activities of the
project.
-  Lesson 4 (see ICR, Cr. 2072-CE): Need for the Government to reduce length of time required for staffing and
procurement activities. Procurement steps are being redefined and the appointment of a project coordination officer
designate and staff was undertaken following pre-appraisal.
*  Lesson 5 (see ICR, Cr. 2072-CE): Project performance and sustainability increase when operational responsibilities
are given to the implementation units. The project plans to continue the practice of having the responsible units
undertake the work. MEHE also plans to continue the monthly consultative meetings with the provinces.
* Lesson 6 (see ICR, Cr. 2072-CE): Need for the Government to address the annual timing of resource allocation to
ensure that implementation occurs all year rather than at the present spurt-and-stop approach. Also, the authorization
of totally donor-funded project activities should be clarified to prevent present delays. MOFP, FC and MEHE are
willing to adjust the timing of funding to better match the education cycle. Various approaches will be applied as part
of the unit cost financial mechanism being piloted by the project.
•  Lesson 7 (see ICR Cr. 2072-CE): Firmer application or adherence to training selection criteria by MEHE would
ensure that appropriate staff would be trained to apply training skills and maximize investments. Training selection
criteria are being prepared including the monitoring of the application of the trainee skills. MEHE has agreed to
allow training covering more than one session or annual follow-up to be implemented during the project.
12. Indications of Borrower Commitment and Ownership:
The Government has demonstrated its commitment by fully participating in the school facilities analysis and the textbook
study; undertaking two finance studies to better understand the flow of funds within the devolved powers to the provinces;
and supporting management and planning studies to find options to improve the responsiveness of the education sector.
To ensure full understanding, MEHE established coordination committees with wide participation (including private
sector) in curriculum, libraries, textbooks and educational materials. MEHE tested the allocation of facilities to fit the new
education structure in one zone and prepared plans for national application. All the conclusions of these activities have
been discussed with provincial representatives. The Chairman of the NEC has outlined the need to address these issues
and education quality requirements during public television addresses. National consensus has been reached and the
President of the country has announced support for the reform of the education system. Sri Lanka wants to prepare itself
for the 21 st century, and with its already strong base in education backed by national commitment, the time is right to
undertake a system reform.

Sri Lanka (LKPA10525)                                                          Second General Education Project
Government's commitmen. is also evidenced by its agreement to adjust the structure of its system and to reorganize the
management and financial structures of MEHE, PEAs, NIE and UGC to match its operational needs (shift from a person-
based organization to one that better matches the services). MEHE, NIE and UGC have also agreed to adjust staff
functions and numbers to better fit the activities, thus putting this project in a positive position to address changes
identified by the GOSL. Additional activities which demonstrate the government's commitment are: (i) setting-up the Sri
Lanka Teacher Educator Service, improving work conditions, career paths and salaries of teacher educators and with
future staff selection being more merit based; (ii) further strengthening the Sri Lanka Teacher Service which increases
teacher recognition, salaries, and career path, making teaching more attractive and in turn inhibiting the recruitment of
untrained and politically appointed teachers; (iii) organizing a special National Task Force chaired by the President to
ensure that education reforms are implemented in accordance with plans. To ensure the latter, an education sector reform
unit has been set-up within MEHE; and (iv) the President reaching agreement with the opposition parties that education
reform is a priority and needs joint support.
The potential success of this project is increased because MEHE, NIE and PEAs' operational units designated to
implement the project activities are all in existence (devolution to provinces was legislated almost ten years ago).
Although still weak, the provinces and other units have the capacity to execute the proposed activities. MEHE and PEAs
demonstrated their imnplementation capacity during GEPI. Government's commitment has also been demonstrated by its
agreement to jointly prepare with IDA the system-based Policy Matrix outlined in Appendix 1 and in the PIP.
13. Value Added of IDA Support:
Until recently, few donors were active in the education sector in Sri Lanka. IDA, through the preparation of the Education
Sector Report and studies largely funded by GEPI and PHRD grants has, since 1994, been assessing the education system
in consultation with NEC. The participatory assessments have led to important consensus. Most of the studies were
undertaken with the participation of national staff and consultants. IDA's participatory approach has resulted in an
effective dialogue, with all sector issues examined, thereby enabling MEHE and IDA to assess existing policies. Initial
efforts were directed towards teacher training, recruitment and deployment policies. These resulted in the preparation of
the TETD project in 1996. That project is now being implemented with a good start (the number of teachers was reduced
in 1997 by about 9,000 through attrition and retirement packages) and efforts to allocate funds saved for quality inputs are
underway. Following the project effectiveness of the TETD project, MEHE and IDA continued to address system policy
matters. These joint efforts have placed IDA in a very positive situation to assist with system reform. In addition, GOSL
had indicated that it needed to work with IDA since it was the only source which could assist them with sufficient funding
and technical capacity to undertake the system reform advocated. To assess other donors' support GOSL/MEHE, with
IDA assistance, called a donor conference in November 1996 and a follow-up conference in July 1997, during which
potential support and cooperation among donors were examined. During the July conference agreement was reached to
hold an annual consultative meeting. IDA has proceeded to prepare in cooperation with DFID and GTZ, the necessary
inputs for a system reform. The dialogue has resulted in increased donor interests in the education sector and will result in
ADB, DFID, GTZ and potentially JICA and two or three other donors undertaking complementary activities. IDA
expects to continue to play a catalyst role for policy development and capacity building within the education sector and is
favorably positioned to assist the Govermnent with its planned education system upgrading. IDA's presence influenced a
review of the total education system and assisted the Government in developing a rational national plan for the future.
Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (The list of selected documentation used to prepare this project is listed in
Annex 12 and these documents can be found in the project files)
14. Economic Assessment (see Annex 13):
Comparative analyses and alternatives were undertaken for each project component. These include:
* The economic benefits generated by the strengthening of NIE and curriculum process which will ensure that the
curriculum will cover a wider range of content, support the application of active learning processes, enable MEHE
to bridge the gap between curriculum and economic needs and lay a foundation to increase the responsiveness of
the education system. This is not quantifiable but is expected to assist in producing a better level of human capital

Sri Lanka (LKPA10525)                                                             Second General Education Project
required for a modem economy and in the long-term will increase productivity of the labor force and increase Sri
Lanka's export-oriented economy.
* Improvements of links between the curriculum, textbooks and teacher guidebooks will facilitate the learning of
some four million students, increase cost effectiveness through the implementation of a re-use policy (resulting
from improved physical composition of books) and with the additional investment of about US$9 million, about
US$1.8 million annually in savings could result from the re-use policy making it possible to regain all the
investment costs for improved textbooks within a six-year period.
*  Quality inputs of about US$15.4 million are intended to address the inequities of the system and increase
educational opportunities of the rural and slum areas. A recent national study (Aturupane, 1996) indicates that
quality inputs necessary to teach the curriculum are available at less than 20 percent of the rural schools because
of the low per student allocation of around Rs 27, when an input of about Rs 203 is required. A norm-based unit
cost allocation will gradually redress these acute shortages and through the combination of GEPI and GEP2 it is
expected that 100 percent of the mathematics and science kit needs will be completed and about 25 to 30 percent
of other needs covered. The balance will have to be covered by the GOSL and future projects. The goal of the
project is to establish suitable mechanisms that will allow inputs to be made annually on the basis of identified
needs in the schools, replacing the sporadic and ad hoc approach now used. The per student allocation will also
redress the present inequity of elite schools receiving allocations which range of about 300 percent greater than
rural schools. The planned allocation of inputs in response to actual needs and for priority needs will assist
management to better determine the actual school needs and assist with the preparation of a 5-10 year supply
strategy. This input is directed at capacity building for future sustained resourcing. This input is intended to
improve student results and reduce teacher absenteeisrn. As part of the Finance Study an analysis of examination
results found that the largest cause of poorer results in rural areas was the lack of necessary equipment; and if such
equipment were available, it is estimated that repetition rates of about 12 percent could be lowered below 10
percent, greatly reducing system costs.
- Based on international research, the supply of library books facilitates the adoption of more active teaching
methods and increases the quality and accuracy of teacher presentations; therefore, the library inputs are
expected to have positive impact on the quality of education.
'  The allocation of facilities on the basis of enrollment, demographic changes and of matching curriculum needs is
expected to reduce the trend of oversupply of facilities at favorable locations, to have facilities built at locations
with serious shortages and to increase the use of existing facilities which would result in a more cost effective
allocation of resources.
*  Adapting organizations to their intended operational functions will increase the responsiveness of the system and
reduce management costs. The planned reorganization of MEHE, PEAs, NIE and UGC will increase
responsiveness of the education sector and will have a positive impact on the use of resources.
•  Giving management suitable monitoring, supervision and fnancing skills are known to greatly enhance
performance. Upgrading of management skills will enable managers to be more responsive and efficient.
*  Improving the fnancial procedures and making these more transparent, together with the allocation of funds to
better match the actual needs, will greatly improve the efficiency of th'e education sector and increase the system's
sustainability.
15. Financial Assessment (see Annexes 4 and 13):
The fiscal impact of GEP2 on the overall government budget is relatively small. The project will account for 0.2
percent of the budget in 1998, rise to 0.4 percent as implementation accelerates in 1999, and decline gradually to about
0.1 percent by the end of the project in 2002. Such a marginal effect on the budget is well within the fiscal capacity of
the Government and is sustainable. Within the education sector budget, the share of GEP2 is estimated at 1.6 percent

at project commencement in 1998, reaching a peak of 4 percent in 1999 and gradually decreasing to 1.5 percent by
2002. In financial terms, this is a relatively small share of the education sector budget of Rs 25 billion in 1997 which
is expected to reach Rs 36 billion in 2002 and is within the absorptive capacity of the sector.
16. Technical Assessment:
*  The project is technically sound. Within the context of equity and alleviation of poverty agenda, it addresses the
issues of quality and equity on the basis of needs, opportunities, and comparative advantages. Project components
(curriculum reform, textbook and materials, rationalizing schools, strengthening management and implementing
an equitable resource distribution mechanism ) will be focused on poor rural areas and urban slums and designed
on the basis of international and regional norms and practices, and implemented in accordance with acceptable
standards.
*  Investment and recurrent cost estimates for the project are realistically based on prevailing market unit cost
estimates, with appropriate allowance for inflation. A reasonable level of physical contingencies has also been
included as part of the cost estimates.
* The system based project is designed to work within the Government structures and financial mechanisms and
focuses on strengthening existing and generally sound implementation units within the MEHE, PEAs and NIE.
The project uses a comprehensive approach and ensures that the impact of all the interrelated investments are
taken into account. The system approach thus addresses sector wide policies within a coherent framework. Since
the project was defined with stakeholder participation, ownership has been realized at the sector and political
levels.
*  Common sector goals have been agreed upon by the various participants, including the donors, and in that
context, joint implementation arrangements and reporting mechanisms have been developed.
Considering the above, the technical assessment of the project has been well analyzed.
17. Institutional Assessment:
(a)   Executing agencies: The first project on vocational training gave IDA an entry into the sector and much of the
ongoing work has been a major building block for future operations. Based on the experiences of GEPI, which
assigned the implementation responsibilities to the different management units within MEHE and provincial
authorities, implementation roles are well defined. However, MEHE's implementation capacity is still too reliant
on seniors (about to or retired on contract), but its present mid-level manager recruitment training program should
facilitate future implementation. The appointment of younger and qualified staff with promotions better linked to
merit should enhance the MEHE's and PEAs management capacity. Project management will be further facilitated
by training and technical assistance included in the project to assist MEHE strengthen its procurement and
management skills (latter is also a need for the entire Public Service).
(b)   Project management: The project will be managed by the MEHE in cooperation with the PEAs. Key project
decisions will be made by EDCC, chaired by the Secretary of Education (or nominee) with membership including
representatives from the MOFP, two PEA representatives, NIE, UGC, NATE, FC, N4EC, National Planning, ERD,
and Chamber of Commerce. Implementation would be delegated to a PCU (focus IDA links); and implementation
units within MEHE, PEAs, NIE and UGC will undertake the actual implementation of decisions made by the
EDCC. An important feature of this project will be its integration into the national budget process. Project inputs
aimed at improving the quality, responsiveness and cost-effectiveness of textbooks and civil works will supplement
the actual budget line items, rather than create different or new activities.
18. Social Assessment:
The project takes into account the access to and quality of education for poor rural and urban slum children (where the
highest student teacher ratios exist). To increase equal access to quality education, the project will implement a more
responsive, equitable, transparent and sustainable allocation of textbooks, facilities and quality input linked to unit cost

financing formula. This will also increase the learning outcomes of school children in an equitable manner. An important
focus of the project will be to increase equity and to focus assistance to the rural poor. The project, through its per capita
allocation of quality inputs and unit cost formula, will fall within the GOSL's goals to increase equity.
19. Environmental Assessment:  [ ]A            [ ]B              [X] C
This is a Category C Project. The project will have no adverse impact on the enviromnent as there will be limited
construction activities; individual project building designs will be reviewed from an environmental impact viewpoint.
Increased quality of student achievement skill contribute to enhanced environmental awareness. A recent study (1996)
commissioned by Sida, with assistance from the IDA Environment Unit, that reviewed the inclusion of environment in all
subjects in the general education curriculum showed that the content taught is not fully responsive to the required
environmental subjects. The planned curriculum review will address this shortfall.

21. Sustainability:
The GEP2 project is expected to add about Rs 3.2 billion th the annual education budget at the end of the project. It will
increase the average annual growth rate of the sector budget marginally from 1.1I to. 1.4 percent. The fiscal imnpact is
estizmated at about 0.2 percent of the budget in 1998, rising to 0.4 percent as imnplementation accelerates in 1999 and then
declining gradually to about 0.1I percent by the end of the project. Such marginal effect is well within the fiscal capabilities
of the Government and is readily sustainable: witoin the education sector budget, the share of GEP2 is 1.6% at project
commencement in 1998, reaches a peak in 1999 at 40% and gradually decreases thereafter to 1.5% by 2002. In fmancial
terms, this is a relatively small share of the sector budget and within the absorptive capacity of the sector. Sustainability will
also be aided because:
*  The updating and publishing of the sector's policy finamework will give clear directions to all managers and the public
and assist with the sustainability of the project inputs;
*  The re-organization of MEHE, PEAs, NIE and UGC structures to better match the operational activities and development
of clearer job descriptions will greatly increase the efficiency and cost effectiveness and assist with Institutional

23. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Based on the intensive participatory approach utilized to prepare the project and general agreement that quality, equity,
management and resourcing of the education sector have to be addressed, the appraisal team does not believe that there are
any major controversies. That position was supported by the decision, in July 1997, of the Presidential National Education
System Reform Committee to utilize GEP2 PIP documentation as the main documentation for the national reform. GOSL/
MEHE should be congratulated on the determination they have expressed to strengthen the education system to meet the
needs of the 21st century.
Block 4: Main Credit Conditions
24. Board and Effectiveness Conditions:
During Negotiations Government provided assurances that it will:
a) By June 1, 1998, implement its National Curriculum Policy which shall include sequential and cyclical plans
satisfactory to IDA;
b) Confrm that EPD budget will be maintained, at the minimum, at the current level and contract thresholds will be
increased and thereafter maintained, starting January 1, 1999, to allow it to sign contracts at financial levels that allow

PEAs, NIE, and UGCs and sustain these throughout the project (management);
k) Starting January 1, 1998, pilot the application of the agreed norm-based unit cost financing mechanisms in North
Western, Central and Southern provinces and implement, with terms of reference satisfactory to IDA, the mechanism
in all provinces starting January 1, 1999 and sustain such application thereafter (fmancial and management);
I) Develop by January 1, 1999, and furnish to IDA for review, a national plan for the application of the NEC and sector
reforms, with complementary provincial plans prepared by June 1, 1999 and zonal plans including institutional
(school) plans by March 1, 2000 (management and policy);
m) Prepare and furnish IDA with a budget monitoring system, satisfactory to IDA, which ensures the application of
norm-based unit cost financing by January 1, 1999. Assign staff from MEHE and PEAs to develop monitoring
procedures (satisfactory to IDA) of the effectiveness of the quality and maintenance inputs from the recurrent and
capital block grants to provinces by June 1, 1999;
n) Project related technical assistance and training programns will be prepared and carried out by MEHE according to
terms of reference and time schedules satisfactory to IDA.
Block 6: Readiness for Implementation
The Project implementation readiness has been assessed and found satisfactory with the following status of readiness:
(i)  The engineering and architectural design for the first year's activities are complete and ready for the start of project
implementation;
(ii)  The draft procurement documents for the first year's activities are complete and ready for the start of project
implementation; and
(iii) The Project Implementation Plan has been appraised and found to be realistic and of satisfactory quality.
This project will make efforts to integrate its fnancing to the Government's budget, and project funds will be linked to the
national, MEHE and PEAs budget line items. The PEAs through Memorandums of Understanding with the MEHE have
agreed to the provisions of the Development Credit Agreement. To ensure effective project financing through the MOFP,
MEHE, FC and PEAs, the following financing steps have been agreed to and will be implemented:
* Civil works activities will be based on agreed zonal plans approved by the PEA and MEHE and reviewed by IDA.
Only plans matching the new education structure will be funded by the project. Once approved, the zonal plans will
outline annual implementation and resource needs and these will receive funding on the basis of progress
implementation reports (execution, expenditures and architectural certifications) in block allocations paid on a
quarterly basis. To reduce the inequities in facilities allocations, the proceeds of the Credit will be granted on the
basis of needs (zonal plans) and on a per student allocation. Payments will be made following receipt of progress
reports of contracted activities with IDA replenishing the special account quarterly;
* Proceeds from the Credit will be used to supplement the funds needed to ensure that writer, publication and printing

contracts are sufficiently funded to produce books of improved content and physical quality. The contracts will
supplement the present EPD budget allocation to ensure better quality products (scope and quality of book writing
and publication) are made available to increase life expectancy of the books. In this context, the project will fund the
supplement to the present budget based on the curriculum cyclical plan. EPD contracting thresholds will be increased
to allow sustainabilty of the book sector by the end of the project;
*  Funding for quality inputs will be linked to the PEAs' block grant allocation and the agreement reached under the
TETD project that starting 1998, 3 percent of the education block grant will be allocated to quality inputs with that
amount increasing by 1 percent yearly until it reaches 6 percent by 200 1. Funds from the Credit would supplement
the block grant allocation with the objective being to have all schools equipped with the essential equipment and
educational materials to teach the curriculum by the end of the project. Credit funds would be allocated on an
equitable per capita basis for all schools aiming to redress, during the first three years of the project, the present
imbalance in resource allocation between national and other schools. An annual review of the availability of essential
resources will be undertaken and credit funds with specific provincial allocations will be determined. Allocation of
funds will be conditioned on the receipt of the previous year's school-by-school match of needs, and once orders are
prepared, using competitive procedures acceptable to the Association, the credit will fund the determined amount for
quality inputs directly to large suppliers to reimburse, on the basis of documentation, satisfactory to IDA, purchases
for quality inputs at both the national (larger and special inputs) and the provincial level. The project will initially
concentrate on the supply of essential inputs for the core subjects (numeracy/mathematics, languages,
social/environmental studies and science). For the above, IDA will replenish the special account on the quarterly
basis.
*  Training cost will be paid every semester on the basis of annual training programs (start-up costs initially and then
remaining costs following certification of course attendance and course costs) agreed to prior to the start-up and the
necessary submission of supporting documentation acceptable to MEHE, PEA and IDA. The annual training program
could include courses run at and by the MEHE, PEA and institutions.

4. Quality Inputs: The objective of the component is to supply in a timely manner to Junior Schools (grades 1-9) and to
selected Senior Schools (grades 10-13), on a per capita basis, a sufficient quantity of essential educational equipment and
materials which match the requirements of an evolving and sequential curriculum. The component is closely linked with the
Curriculum Development component and the Financing component and, together with these components, aims at a maxi-
mum utilization of 6% of the provincial block grants to be devoted to quality inputs by the year 2001.

7. Education Financing: The objective of the component is to improve efficiency, equity and transparency in the distribu-
tion of educational resources. The Government will be assisted gradually to apply nation-wide a norm-based, unit cost allo-
cation mechanism, outlined in previously commissioned studies. This mechanism will be reflected in central and provincial

SRI LANKA
SECOND GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
Project Description
1.     Curriculum Development (estimated base cost: US$8.356.700)
1.1    The objectives of the component are to develop and produce a sequential framework for the
design, development, assessment and revision of the curriculum, syllabi and associated materials in all
subject fields for the Junior Cycle (grades 1-9) according to a consolidated ten-year plan; to refine, develop
and distribute syllabi for this Cycle; and to improve the management of the curriculum process. Details of
each of the activities for the component are given in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and are
summarized below.
1.2    A statement on curriculum policy has been prepared by the National Institute of Education
(NIE). Limited technical assistance will guide further formulation of this Policy to include detailed goals,
strategies and priorities within a clearly defined work plan for curriculum developers. An associated
publicity effort will ensure that all schools and parent teacher associations are fully aware of the policy by
the end of 1998. Anticipated costs are US$37,500.
1.3    To co-ordinate the process of curriculum development in accordance with the Presidential Task
Force recommendations on curriculum, NIE will put at least three managerial structures in place: (i) the
post of Deputy Director-General, Curriculum Development (DDG/CD) to oversee all activities associated
with the curriculum; (ii) a Curriculum Process Co-ordinating Unit (CPCU), and its associated Desk Top
Publishing Unit (DTPU), to lead and integrate the process of curriculum development within and outside
NIE; and (iii) NEC/NIE would establish a mechanism for involving other institutions and private sector in
curriculum development process. Costs associated with these activities, including training, equipment and
supplies, would be about US$190,500.
1.4    In order to make the curriculum process more efficient, a ten-year sequential and cyclical
Curriculum Plan for curriculum design and development will be fmalised by mid-1998. For the
implementation of the Plan, NIE will develop a detailed scope and sequence chart for each subject
syllabus for each of grades 1-9, in collaboration with staff of the National Colleges of Education (NCOE)
and Teacher Centres (TC) and with teachers themselves. Following this and in continued collaboration, the
main bulk of curriculum development work will be carried out over the project period. The details within
topics or themes for each grade and subject will be revised, incorporating the Presidential initiatives,
together with suggestions on teaching methods, means of assessing student achievement, and lists of
references and of materials and equipment essential and/or desirable for teaching each topic or theme.
Mechanisms for regular feedback from teachers and principals will be developed early in the process.
Annual work plans will be prepared and followed jointly by NIE and the Education Publications
Department (EPD) to ensure that textbooks and teacher guides reflect the revised syllabi and are published
and distributed to schools on time. Part of the curriculum development process will be the preparing,
piloting and conducting of evaluation exercises, including teacher surveys and diagnostic tests, to ascertain
the relevance and effectiveness of the revised curriculum for student leaming in the Junior Cycle. The
estimated cost of these activities is US$402,500.
1.5    Many permanent curriculum developers at NIE are due to retire within the next ten years. To
ensure that suitable staff are employed, a new recruitment policy based upon subject and merit will be
initiated to attract young, qualified graduates. At the same time, a policy for broadening participation in
the curriculum process will encourage teachers and teacher educators to work at NIE for short periods and
for NIE staff to teach in other schools and institutions. It will be essential to carry out a staff development
program, based on revised job descriptions, for new recruits as well as existing curriculum developers
37



Annex 2
Page 2 of 11
both in NIE and elsewhere. Staff will be brought up-to-date through studies in curriculum theory and
practice and from overseas visits and work experiences in key link institutions (both academic and
curriculum centres). To support work on the curriculum as well as staff development, the NIE Library will
be supplied regularly with international curriculum resource materials. Estimated costs for these
activities are US$2,423,000.
1.6 Training will be designed and delivered to teachers on the content and methods of the revised subject
syllabi. In collaboration with bilateral donor agencies (DFID and GTZ), these new syllabi will be
presented to in-service advisors who will pass on the methods, content and materials to teachers through a
series of zonal level workshops organized by the PEAs. At the same time, curriculum developers will be
trained in computer skills and will be provided with hardware to assist them in preparing syllabi, teacher
guides, materials, and assessment measures. Estimated costs are about US$5,303,200.
2.     Textbooks and Educational Publications (estimated base cost: USS10.982.000)
2.1    The objectives of the component, within an integrated textbook and publication policy and
through the strengthening of private sector participation, are to improve the content, physical quality, range
and availability of textbooks catering for all subjects in grades 1-9 and to increase the life expectancy of
textbooks from one to three years. This component, closely linked with the curriculum development
component, contributes towards improving the quality of education. Details of each of the activities for the
component are given in the PIP and are summarized below.
2.2    An integrated national textbook and publication policy will be updated and implemented in
order to clarify the roles of both public and private sectors regarding all aspects of textbook production and,
supply. The policy will include a multiple textbook option to expand the range of textbooks available
from the present single book, per subject, per grade, to two or more books. The goal will be for schools or
zones to be able to select either an Education Publication Department (EPD) or a privately produced
suitable free textbook, matching the curriculum framework. This will encourage competition for the best
textbook. The costs of printing, distributing and disseminating the revised policy are estimated at
US$40,000.
2.3    EPD will remain as a separate budget authority but will have its contracting thresholds adjusted
upwards so it has sufficient funds and authority to allocate, following competition, writer, publisher and
printing contracts to ensure that the physical quality of textbooks is upgraded and matches the
curriculum/syllabi. EPD roles and co-ordination with NIE will be strengthened to ensure linkages at the
writer specification and manuscript design stages to improve textbook quality. EPD will move from a
production type unit to a quality control and contracting unit for most of the work. To enable EPD to
improve its work practices and gradually transfer book production and distribution activities to the private
sector, it will be supplied with computers, new types of records/filing systems, fax and phone equipment
(office and cellular), modems/internet, and modern desk-top publishing and paper testing equipment. In
addition, an EPD resource library will be stocked with all the necessary reference books and materials to
enable staff to be informed on international standards and to ensure that the curriculum, syllabi and
textbooks are produced at the content and quality levels required in the 21st century. Estirnated costs of
these inputs and activities are US$502,000.
2.4    The EPD will be staffed by about 75 persons jointly having skills in writing, editing, contracting
and quality control. For about 45 of these staff, there will be international and national skills training and
upgrading in desk-top publishing, contracting, monitoring and quality control; for about another 30
staff and for up to 120 private sector representatives, the project will support skills training in subject-
based editing and textbook writing. Estimated costs for this training are US$500,000.
2.5    The component will establish with technical assistance, selection criteria, time frames and
mechanisms for contracting of textbook editing, publishing and printing to private and public
contractors, with multi-year contracts for the initial print and with reprints fitting the textbook fife cycle of
38



Annex 2
Page 3 of 11
3-5 years. This approach will (i) strengthen the capacity of private publishers and printers; (ii) increase
competition and the cost effectiveness of textbook supply; (iii) ensure that the preparation of teacher guides
is combined with the respective textbooks and contracted to the same party to achieve consistency of
content and methodology; and (iv) adjust the book, printing and supply cycle so that book production and
delivery to schools match the school academic year. This proposed adjustment will not increase cost but
will necessitate the EPD to receive their budgets in a more timely manner-to allow annual printing or re-
printing of textbooks prior to school opening. Estimated costs for technical assistance are US$45,000.
2.6    To promote the production of textbooks and teacher guides of international content quality, the
project will supplement the current low commission fees for writers. Only writers or teams of writers or
individual firms who are able to produce, within a specific timeframe, the total book and teacher guide in
direct response to the curriculum framework will be contracted. Following training (see 2.4 above), writers
will be asked to write textbooks and teacher guides of international standard to match the curriculum at the
rate of five textbooks per year for five years. Textbooks and teacher guides will be prepared on the basis
of criteria prepared jointly by EPD and the NIE/Curriculum Process Co-ordination Unit (CPCU)
committee.
2.7    The project will support an improvement in the physical quality of textbooks by adjusting the
quality of paper to a minimum of 80 gsm, page size to international standard and types, and by upgrading
the quality of covers and binding to increase the durability and subsequently the re-use of the books. This
will reduce textbook reprints from being annual to every three years. Estimated costs of supplementing
writers' fees and of equipment, vehicles and technical assistance for improving quality are US$895,000.
2.8    The project will support the production of textbooks and teachers' guides in response to the
sequential curriculum cycle (Component 1). In that context it is estimated that about five revised and two
existing textbooks and teacher guides would be produced each year, resulting in between 18 and 20
million textbooks being made available during the project period. Estimated costs of production are
US$9,000,000 (project would supplement existing budget to improve content and physical quality).
2.9    For special subject needs, such as English as a second language, the MEHE/EPD may opt to
purchase pre-published books from various international publishers, with the caveat that the book would be
adapted to the country's needs at the earliest possible date.
2.10   Book distribution will continue to be done through competitive tenders with private suppliers,
and books will continue to be transported to the 1,000 bulk distribution centres scattered throughout the
country. However, from the start of the project, private printers and government printers will be given the
option to quote a total price which would include delivery of the books directly to accessible schools or to
the existing distribution centres. Areas affected by the civil strife will continue to use government delivery
methods. The application of control mechanisms for book delivery and records of receipt by the existing
1,000 delivery centres and schools would begin during the 1998 book delivery.
2.11 Implementation responsibilities will be assumed by the EPD, in consultation with the Book Sector
Steering Committee chaired by the MEHE. Based on the EPD's implementation performance of the last
decade, combined with the proposed strengthening of management, improvement of linkages with the
curriculum, training of staff, supply of necessary equipment to improve book content and physical features,
it is expected that the sustainability of this component will be high and that it will have a very positive
impact on the quality of education in Sri Lanka.
3.     School Rationalization (estimated base cost: US$20.428.500)
3.1    The objective of the component is to ensure an equitable and cost-effective allocation of
educational and sanitary facilities to match the new structure recommended by the National Education
Commission (NEC) and the new curriculum. The focus of the project will be for Junior Schools where
there is a need for new classrooms and school libraries, renovation, services and furniture to facilitate the
39



Annex 2
Page 4 of II
policy of compulsory education for 5-14 year olds, agreed on the criteria of enrollment, demographic shifts
and relative deprivation. The expected impact of the component will be greater learning opportunities for
children in deprived areas (urban and rural) through a raising of the standards of the physical environment
in which learning takes place. Details of each of the activities of the component are given in the PIP and
are summarized below.
3.2    The project will support the application of the new government policy, recommended by the
NEC and the Presidential Task Force, of reorganizing the school structure into Junior Schools (grades 1-9)
and Senior Schools (grades 10-13) commencing from 1998. The restructuring of schools will necessitate
the separation of the Junior School and Senior School grades into distinctive schools or grouping of
students with a separate budget allocation and separate management. It will also necessitate a revision by
MEHE of the norms and standards applicable for catchment areas, facilities, quality inputs and teachers.
Thus, the first input within this component will be to fund, using information gathered from the school
facilities review conducted in 1995 under GEPI, the survey of all zones in each province, as well as a
continuation of activities following the initial survey conducted in Sabaragamuwa and Western provinces
during project preparation. This survey will enable the MEHE/SWD/PPRD, PEAs and ZEOs to prepare
zonal plans for the reorganization of schools into Junior and Senior Schools by the year 2001.
3.3    The project will only fund facilities in zones and provinces where zonal plans have been prepared
(i) which meet the requirements of the new school structure of Junior and Senior Schools; (ii) where the
school location, type and size meets the projected demand; (iii) where the space requests fit the revised and
agreed MEHE norms for the provision of facilities; (iv) where there is no duplication of schools in the
immediate location of the catchment area; (v) where there is evidence of ongoing consultation with
teachers, parents, and local communities; (vi) where both surplus and deficit facilities are identified and
costed options are produced either for their more efficient utilization or to meet the gap; (vii) where there is
evidence of agreement to separate the budgets and management responsibilities of Junior and Senior
Schools; (viii) which include an implementation plan for the period 1998 to 2001; and (ix) which indicate a
ranking for facilities provision in order of priority according to greatest need, generally in rural and urban
slum areas, together with a clear and objective rationale. Such ranking could include a limited number of
Senior Schools (2-5) per zone. Following a review of the zonal plans, IDA will give priority support to
those schools which will undertake immediately clear administrative and budgetary separations to fit the
new school structure.
3.4    To achieve the above zonal plans, the project will support the survey starting in January 1998.
The survey will also contribute to the development of a school map and individual school profiles. Each
profile will include the concept of a school catchment area which matches enrollment with local
demographic patterns for the existing and forecast 5-14 years and 15-18 years age groups. The school
reorganization planning process will be complemented by the DFID funded Master Plan for Primary
Education Project (1997-2000). Technical assistance and other support will be provided for survey
preparation and implementation, related data and policy analysis, and updating present MEHE standards
for school facilities, at an estimated cost of US$121,000.
3.5    Upon submission of detailed plans for school rationalization by each zonal office and agreement
by the PEAs, MEHE/SWD and IDA, civil works, furniture and equipment will be provided as part of a
three to five year plan. Each plan will have a list of priority sites with justifications and on that basis
project funds will be allocated. The goal of the project is to have fully operational schools with the
facilities and services required to deliver the curriculum effectively. It is expected that school development
societies (parent teacher associations) will remain involved in the monitoring of the school's operations to
ensure that the requirement of essential resources is met and the quality of education services is improved.
3.6    School rationalization criteria will also ensure the availability of adequate facilities for children in
grades 1-9 where they are most needed and a curtailment of the practice of constructing facilities in an
unplanned manner for political convenience. At this stage an amount of US$10,500,000 will be set aside
to cover the priority needs of the new education structure and to increase equity, with 50 percent available
40



Annex 2
Page 5 of 11
before the year 2000 and the priority distribution of the remainder to be determined at the mid-term review.
This figure may be adjusted following the results of the school rationalization survey. The Japanese
government through JICA may also address some of the shortfalls in physical facilities.
3.7    Dependent upon the results of the survey and agreement on zonal plans, civil works, furniture and
equipment will be provided for libraries in about 2,000 schools. Libraries are available in only 30 percent
of the schools in the country. Since reading has been proven to be a major determinant in learning, the
objective is to provide about half the schools with a library. The project will finance renovation for
existing classrooms in about 1,520 schools and construction for about 480 new school libraries, together
with appropriate furniture and equipment, to be selected by each zone according to criteria being developed
by MEHE. An amount for US$9,500,000 will be set aside for school libraries.
3.8    To ensure that school physical facilities function to their designed objectives for their economic
life span, it is necessary that schools are systematically maintained. To this end, the training of junior
school principals and concerned staff in buildings, services and furniture maintenance will be
supported, as will be the revision and distribution of the MEHE Maintenance Manual of Educational
Facilities. In addition technical assistance will be provided for developing school physical facilities
records and plans at provincial, zonal and school levels. Estimated costs of technical assistance, training,
printing and distribution are US$370,000.
4.     Quality Inputs (estimated base cost: USS16.172.000)
4.1    The objective of the component is to supply in a timely manner the needed quality inputs for the
core subjects in Junior Schools, and to a limited number of Senior Schools, on a per capita basis. The goal
is to arrive at an essential quantity of educational equipment, consumable supplies and educational
materials to supply schools with the requirements of an evolving sequential curriculum. The focus will be
to address shortages in Junior Schools where the greatest quality input resource gaps exist. Priority will be
given to filling the requirements for science and mathematics equipment, in continuation of the provision
made under GEPI, and for language and social/environmental studies teaching. For Senior Schools, each
of the 87 zones should provide justification for the inclusion of between two to five schools in order of
priority and identified as the most needy schools to provide greater equity to students. Senior Schools will
be assigned about 20 percent of the total allocation from the component.
4.2    The component is closely linked with the curriculum development and education financing
components and, together with these components, aims at maximum utilization of the designated 6 percent
of the provincial block grants for education to be devoted to quality inputs by the year 2001 . The
expected impact of the component is improved pupil achievement and enhanced teacher motivation,
leading to a reduction in reliance on private tuition and increase pupil performance.
4.3    Each school, subject and grade requires three major types of quality inputs to facilitate effective
pupil learning: (i) essential and supplementary reading materials related to the curriculum; (ii) instructional
equipment and aids which are considered essential for teaching the content of the syllabus for each subject;
and (iii) basic consumable materials such as chalk, paper, pens, pencils, etc. together with equipment
maintenance. The Libraries component (Component 5) will contribute funds for books to alleviate (i)
above. The MEHE and PEAs will estimate the costs associated with (ii) and (iii) above, and provide a
specific line item in their budgets. Based upon an inventory of current stock, this component will
contribute funds to meet the immediate resource gap needs in essential equipment and consumables for
each subject. These needs will be revised in accordance with the curriculum cycle.
A Condition of the TETD project is to allocate 3percent of the block grant to quality inputs in 1998 and to
increase this allocation by Ipercent per year to reach 6percent by the year 2001.
41



Annex 2
Page 6 of 11
4.4    To ensure that specific individual school needs are met and prior to any substantial investment for
quality inputs, an inventory will be carried out in conjunction with the school rationalization survey
(Component 3). The following actions will be undertaken: (i) NIE in cooperation with practitioners in
PEAs will update the existing detailed lists of essential equipment, consumables and materials needed
for each subject and grade and for the school as a whole, thus developing a basic standard set of quality
inputs linked to subjects and enrollments; (ii) the Deputy Directors General for Junior and Senior Schools
in MEHE, together with the DDG Curriculum Development in NIE, will prepare a questionnaire based
upon these lists to obtain an accurate inventory of existing and useable stock in each school in
comparison with curriculum requirements; (iii) each school will send the completed questionnaire to the
ZEO where the results will be collated to determine the current shortages/oversupply and prioritize needs;
(iv) each ZEO will prepare a zonal plan listing the essential resource gaps by prioritizing and costing these
needs for each year spread over three years; (v) following MEHE and PEA approval of the zonal plans, the
FC and PEAs will allocate resources to zones based upon a per pupil allocation; and (vi) priority essential
items which are not currently available in schools will be included in IDA-funded procurement for this
component (up to about US$16 million). Estimated costs for the inventory survey are US$40,000.
4.5    From the basic standard set of equipment and materials required to deliver the curriculum,
MEHE/NIE will estimate the average per pupil unit cost for quality inputs. PEAs will estimate the amount
of the block grant which is equivalent to 3 percent in 1998 up to 6 percent in 2001. Using actual and
projected enrollment figures each province, based on the block grant, will estimate the per pupil unit cost
allocation available for quality inputs in the province for each year up to 2002. The project aims to make
up the difference between the MEHE/NIE estimate and the PEA estimates from 1999 to 2002 with the
expectation being that, after 2002, 6 percent of the block grant will cover the essential equipment and
materials needed in each school to match curriculum requirements and the PEAs will become self-
sufficient.
4.6    Support will be given for monitoring and research (both mid-term and at the end of the project)
to measure both the utilization of equipment and materials and the effectiveness of such quality inputs in
improving pupil performance and increasing teacher motivation. Estimated costs of these activities,
including technical assistance with research design and analysis of results, are US$170,000.
5.     Libraries (estimated base cost: US$5.320.900)
5.1    The objectives of the component are to support and stimulate an activity-based curriculum and to
encourage the reading habit in school and community by expanding, professionalising, and strengthening
the management of, the school library sector. These objectives will be achieved through a number of
activities, given in detail in the PIP and summarized below. Costs for civil works, furniture and equipment
for libraries are included under Component 3.
5.2    The project will support the strengthening of the school library services through the
implementation of the recently developed policy framework. Fundamental to such implementation is the
creation of an adequate school library cadre and Service Minute, both of which are urgently needed. Funds
will be provided for a national consultant to assist in analysing library staff training needs, and preparing a
five year training plan. Responsibility for school libraries will be vested in the full-time post of Director:
School Libraries Services within MEHE, and for public libraries in the National Library Documentation
and Services Board (NLDSB). The estimated costs for technical assistance are $15,000.
5.3    Approximately 450,000 books will be supplied to 2,000 new school libraries (see para 3.7) from
lists, to be agreed by MEHE, NIE and PEAs, which will be related to the revised curriculum, for
knowledge broadening and enjoyment reading. In addition, about 180,000 books will be distributed to
about 2,000 schools with existing libraries to supplement their stocks with up-to-date books procured from
lists approved annually by MEHE. To prepare libraries for more effective modem operation, about ten per
42



Annex 2
Page 7 of 11
cent of the larger schools being provided with a library will also be set up as information technology (IT)
centres. Total book and IT costs are estimated at US$2,341,000.
5.4    Encouraging the habit of reading through the expansion of the "Books in Schools" project will
be supported under this project. Junior Schools where libraries are being established will be targeted. In
line with the extremely successful pilot project, national, provincial and zonal coordinators will be
designated and trained in a series of workshops. The current project team at NIE will be supported in such
training and advisory visits. About ten persons from each province, distributed according to the three
languages, will be trained by this project team to conduct provincial and zonal seminars, to monitor book
utilization and to encourage teachers to instill better reading habits. Seed money will be disbursed for
books to be translated and provided in Sinhala, Tamil and English and for enhancing the reading habit with
PTA participation. Estimated costs are US$251,400.
5.5    Staff development is an essential activity of this component. School libraries will be adequately
staffed and operated by either a full time librarian or teacher-librarians. Advertisements will seek teachers
who wish to be re-trained under the project as librarians and teacher librarians, thus not incurring additional
recurrent expenditure for expanding the school library service. Library and library management skills
will be developed for relevant staff from MEHE, PEAs, teachers, and principals. Selected staff will visit
international institutions. Training courses will continue through existing organizations and through the
new National Institute for Library and Information Sciences (NILIS). In addition, new courses will be
developed in cooperation with the NCOEs, National Library and Documentation Services Board, NIE and
universities. To broaden experience and expertise, four international and about seven regional fellowships
are proposed for key personnel. International technical assistance will be provided to complement training
and increase management experience and international exposure. Estimated technical assistance, training
and fellowship costs are US$1,626,500.
5.6    A new National Institute of Library and Information Science (NILIS), adjacent to the Faculty
of Education at the University of Colombo, approved by the University Grants Commission and the
University Senate, will accredit and establish standards for tertiary level training of teacher librarians and
librarians. NILIS will be the national umbrella for library studies. It will be an institute, independent of
any Faculty, responsible to a Board of Management to be set up under the Universities Act. It will offer
short intensive training, as well as certificate, degree and PG courses. In order to become largely self-
sustaining, all courses at NILIS will be on a fee basis for librarians for both the public and private sectors.
The project will support construction, furniture, equipment, the designing of training courses, international
visits, and national and international technical assistance to the NILIS management and academic staff
including linkages with overseas/regional institutions. Costs are estimated at US$1,087,000.
6.     Education Management (estimated base cost: US$5.903.500)
6.1    The objective of the component is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of system-wide
policy development, planning, decision-making, implementation, monitoring and communications, by
strengthening the management capacity of the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE), the
Provincial Education Authorities (PEAs), the National Institute of Education (NIE) and the University
Grants Commission (UGC). This component takes account of the findings of the Education Management
Stud& (1996), the responses of the MEHE Management Group and discussions with representatives from
the four agencies. Details of the core activities summarised below are given in the PIP, for each of the
agencies.
6.2    The project will support the application of revised organisational structures and staff cadres
for MEHE, PEAs, NIE and UGC. This activity includes: (i) rationalising the structure and functions
within and between agencies in order to ensure a comprehensive coverage of current and emergent
management responsibilities; (ii) linking structures to major operations and upgrading key functions, such
as policy development, planning, monitoring, and financial planning and management, Junior and Senior
43



Annex 2
Page 8 of 11
Schools and school library services; (iii) improving co-ordination, delegation and communication within
and between the agencies in order to minimise delays in decision making and implementation, and to
eliminate duplication; (iv) delineation ofjob functions; (v) adopting new recruitment policies, giving
greater emphasis to merit on performance of the more clearly defined functions, to fit the revised
organisation structures; and (vi) supplying equipment to improve efficiency including storing documents
in modem filing systems supplied through the project. Estimated costs for technical assistance and the
provision of equipment are US$2,702,500.
6.3    Staff development activities form the bulk of the component and will be directly related to the
revised structures, functions, duties and cadres. In order to address the system-wide management skills
deficit, a comprehensive program will be offered to: (i) some 1,400 management staff in MEHE, PEAs,
NIE and UGC in management related issues with specific attention given to developing computer skills in
senior and middle management; (ii) about 10,000 school principals, which will include management and
curriculum areas and school maintenance, and will build on the extensive training program undertaken in
GEPI (and a study of its impact on a sample of schools); (iii) about 1,180 administrative and support
staff will participate in range of skills development courses, which will include procurement and
disbursement, civil works school surveys, computer skills and competence in word processing,
spreadsheets and databases; and (iv) a small cadre of 60 able, young officers (Management Associates) will
be selected for intensive training and subsequent placement, on a merit basis to address the shortage of
experienced personnel to operate at senior and middle management levels. Estimated costs for technical
assistance, study visits, in-country training and printing are US$2,163,000.
6.4    Changes in government policy will have an impact on each of the agencies, particularly MEHE,
PEAs and NIE. Under the coordination of the Education Development and Coordination Committee
comprehensive plans at national, provincial and institutional levels will be central to effective
implementation of the changes. The preparation of national and institutional plans require informed inputs
from schools and zonal offices, with particular attention being given to the equitable distribution of
resources for quality inputs, physical facilities and teachers to schools. In the case of NIE, the institutional
plan will address both curriculum and teacher development issues and the role of NATE in responding to
teacher demand and supply projections. UGC will have an important role to play in examining policy
options and developing a national plan for higher education which is responsive to social and economic
needs. Estimated costs for technical assistance are US$85,000.
6.5    Through the project, the planning capacity of all four agencies will be upgraded in terms of both
the skills base and status (as reflected in the revised organisational structures) and EMIS. Support will be
provided to develop national education planning leadership in MEHE and for a planning skills upgrading
program which will build on the training undertaken through GEPI. The generic skills development
progran will be carried out in cooperation with the DFID funded Master Plan for Primary Education
(MPPE) project. GEP2 will focus on MEHE planners and MPPE will make provision for the training of
provincial and zonal planners. To ensure consistency of approach, the training activities for both projects
will need to be integrated and monitored (through the Additional Secretary, Policy, Planning and
Research). Under the project, personnel from NIE and UGC will be given the opportunity to participate in
generic courses as well as courses relating more specifically to tertiary planning. Considerable progress
was made in the establishment of EMIS within MEHE and PEAs under GEPI. Further upgrading is
required to ensure the ready availability and analysis of data to facilitate the monitoring of system
performance on agreed education indicators (e.g. student:teacher ratios, quality inputs, repetition rates).
While UGC -has embryonic EMIS provision, NIE has yet to embark on such a system. The opportunity
now exists for developing a comprehensive EMIS, together with an enhanced policy analysis capacity,
which will serve the interests of management in each agency and facilitate the interchange of information.
In addition to the training program, the project will assist with the provision of a modest amount of
technology to ensure that each of the key units of the agencies has access to EMIS. Estimated costs for
technical assistance, training, equipment and manuals for strengthening planning capacity are US$361,900.
44



Annex 2
Page 9 of 11
6.6    The availability of a comprehensive FMS network is central to effective financial management
and financial planning. Development work todate has been constrained and the results somewhat limited,
particularly in regard to the preparation of program budgets, forecasting of resource requirements in
relation to policy initiatives and to monitoring expenditure on key items. To assist with further
developmental work on FMS, the Project will support a modest supply of equipment and the training of
relevant personnel in MEHE, provincial and zonal offices, NIE and UGC. Particular attention will be given
to developing a common finance database which will accommodate existing Government budget and
accounting frameworks to ensure compatibility and to facilitate the tracking of expenditure of designated
items (e.g. quality inputs and maintenance for schools). For purposes of financial planning and monitoring
of expenditure, compatibility between EMIS and relevant FMS fields will be essential. Estimated costs for
technical assistance, training, equipment and preparation of manuals for strengthening capacity are
US$58,000 (equipment is included under 6.2).
6.7    Consistent with government policy on staff performance appraisal, the project will assist with
the review of current policies and practices and the training of staff in supervisory positions. In the case of
teaching and academic staff, considerable work needs to be undertaken, particularly in the development of
equitable appraisal and reward mechanisms. For MEHE and PEAs, the project will support a review of the
present system for the appraisal of schools by primary and secondary specialists responsible for quality
performance in schools, and the training of designated personnel. In relation to performance appraisal in
tertiary institutions (NIE, NCOEs and UGC), the project will provide technical assistance to enhance recent
corporate initiatives taken by the universities, which are also relevant to NIE and NCOEs. Estimated costs
of technical assistance for this activity and the production and distribution of staff performance appraisal
manuals are US$150,500.
6.8    In addition to the range of activities outlined above, all of which are highly relevant to the
Governments reforms, the project will assist with three specific areas of need: (i) community awareness
(MEHE and PEAs): the project will support the preparation, production and widespread dissemination of
information on education issues and related reforms (e.g., curriculum changes, rationalisation of facilities,
teacher deployment and financing of education). The MPPE initiatives relating to primary education will
need to be carefully articulated with this wider campaign; (ii) research and development (NIE):
irnplementation of the Government's reforms provides timely context in which to undertake relevant
applied research. NIE's charter includes research activities relating to the general education sector; its
current capacity is limited. The project will, through technical assistance, seminars and associations with
international research institutions, support the strengthening of NIE's capacity to undertake research and
development work including the implementation of mechanisms to encourage and sustain research activity
beyond the life of the Project; (iii) selection and admissions processes for higher education (UGC):
Government reforms include changes to the university entrance selection criteria involving the use of
scholastic aptitude testing. An associated factor is the protracted delays in the admissions procedures
which some 20 months minimum between completing A level examinations and actual commencement of
tertiary studies. The project will support a study visit to examine relevant practices in overseas countries.
Estimated costs for this activity, including technical assistance, a seed grant and overseas travel are
US$385,100.
7.     Education Financing (estimated base cost: US$700,OO0)
7.1    Over the past decade expenditure on educational quality inputs, services and maintenance has been
sharply reduced. Furthermore, the distribution of such expenditure has become highly inequitable, with
schools in prosperous urban areas spending three to ten times more per student than small schools in rural and
poor urban areas. The objective of this component, therefore, is to improve efficiency, equity and
transparency in the distribution of educational resources through the gradual nation-wide application of a
norm-based, unit cost resource allocation mechanism for the education sector. This mechanism will separate
the education budget (excluding civil works capital expenditures) into salaries and wages, quality inputs, and
services and maintenance. By adopting this mechanism, GOSL aims to ensure: (i) the delivery of resources
45



Annex 2
Page 10 of II
(especially teacher allocation annually based on enrolment and demographic factors) on a rational basis, linked
to the learning and teaching requirements of the school curriculum; (ii) the rationalisatiotn of capital
expenditure, recurrent expenditure, and expenditure on services and maintenance; and (iii) the attaimnent of
equity in resource allocation between and within schools. The component comprises a number of activities
given in detail in the PIP and summarised below.
7.2    The project will support standardisation of national and provincial education budget formats, of the
norm-based unit cost resource allocation formula, and of reporting and fnancial monitoring mechanisms
through technical assistance to a small-Education Budget and Monitoring Unit (EBMU) to be established in
the Finance Commission (FC). Estimated costs for this activity are US$51,000.
7.3    A series of workshops in the first and second years of the project will be conducted at both central
and provincial levels to strengthen the capacity of education finance staff in the Ministry of Finance and
Planning (MOFP), FC, MEHE, PEAs and ZEOs at central, provincial and zonal levels to use the nonn-based,
unit cost resource allocation mechanism. Equipment required for financial planning and management
activities will be provided, where needed, particularly in the ZEOs. Estimated costs for technical assistance,
workshops and essential equipment are US$540,000.
7.4    The new allocation mechanism will be field tested in three provinces in the first year of the project.
During the field test, education fnance staff from FC, MEHE and other PEAs will visit the three provinces to
assess its application and replicability and a survey of resource allocation to and within schools will be
conducted by MOFP. At the end of the field testing period, the mechanism will be refined. Training for key
staff in all provinces, will be organised jointly by FC and MEHE and will include visits to the pilot provinces.
The aim will be to implement the allocation mechanism nationwide during the second year of the project.
Monitoring of implementation of the allocation mechanism and its impact on resource delivery to schools will
be undertaken by means of opinion polls among education fnance staff in MEHE and PEAs and among
school authorities, and an annual monitoring survey of 500 schools (approximately 5 percent of all schools).
Regular feedback from the monitoring activities will be provided to the MEHE, MOFP, FC and PEAs to
improve the efficiency of the implementation process and enhance the impact of the new allocation
mechanism in delivering resources to schools. Studies will also be carried out by MOFP and MEHE on the
effect of the mechanism on (i) the ability of PEAs to meet the norms for teachers, quality inputs, and services
and maintenance; (ii) school enrolment and attendance patterns; and (iii) duration of job searches,
employment/unemployment, and labour productivity. Provision is made for technical assistance in research
design and analysis of findings, and for dissemination of results. Estimated costs of these activities are
US$115,000.
8. Studies (estimated base cost: US$600.00O)
8.1    In addition to the surveys, studies and impact monitoring activities within specific components,
the project will support a number of studies relating to the education sector. The studies will focus on the
analysis of performance outcomes for selected areas of GEP I and GEP2 and on emergent issues which
could be relevant to the preparation of future projects in the sector. Details for the following identified
study areas for Component 8 are given in the PIP:
*  Impact of Principals' Training Program under GEPI;
*  Impact of changes to management structure and capacity building on the effectiveness of system-wide
planning and financial management;
*  Effectiveness of project financed measures relating to career planning, selection, promotion and
mobility policies and procedures within the education sector. The study will assess how policies work
in the system and assess ways to make these more responsive to employment strategies;
*  Impact of changes to textbook policy, including participation of the private sector and improvement in
education quality - curriculum coverage and relevance, durability and cost-effectiveness of the
upgraded textbooks;
46



Annex 2
Page 11 of 11
*  Impact of changes to school structure and compulsory education requirements on student participation,
attrition and repetition rates, and enrollment and transition patterns at key stages (grades 5-6, 9-10,
11-12) by types of schools;
*  Analysis of school assessment strategies and trends in examination results in the context of changes to
curriculum, quality inputs and professional development of teachers;
*  Investigations in emergent areas which could impact on future project initiatives. Areas could include:
school to study/work transition; public-private partnerships in education and training; skills' needs;
and post-secondary education.
9. Project Implementation (estimated base cost USS900.000)
9.1    The costs of project implementation are estimated at US$900,000. The key activities are outlined
in the PIP.

1.     Basis for cost estimates: Baseline costs are estimated at June 1997 prices, at the time of
appraisal. Construction costs are based on US$240 to US$270 per square meter depending on
construction standards, student classroom and school norms and on specific estimates for
rehabilitation. Equipment costs are based on norms agreed to during project preparation and
costs based on specific estimates depending on the activities, level of training and the kind of
facilities. Furniture costs are based on 8 to 10 percent of new construction costs and based on
sample prices obtained from recent quotations from the ongoing GEPl and TETD projects for
schools being rehabilitated. Vehicle costs are based on $20,000 per vehicle. Unit cost for
fellowships are based on annual rates of US$1,000 for local, US$8,000 for regional and
US$25,000 for OECD countries. In-Country workshops (US$2.7 million) costs are estimated
at an average rate of $15 per day, per person. International consultant (US$4.5 million) costs
are estimated at a fee of US$12,500 per month, daily allowances US$150 and travel cost
US$5,500. Unit costs per month of local technical assistance (US$2.0 million) are estimated at
US$2,500. Textbook writing and publication (US$9.0 million) are based on present writing,
printing, publishing and distribution costs of existing and improved books, at international
standards, and linkages to the national curriculum.
2.     Contingency Allowances: The contingency allowances of US$9.6 million (about 13.0
percent of baseline cost) include contingencies for physical and price increases. Physical
contingencies are estimated at 10 percent of the baseline costs for civil works and 5 percent for
all other categories of expenditure. It is estimated that price increases will be 2.2 percent per year
for foreign expenditures and from a range of 6.5 to 10 percent per year for local expenditures
during the implementation period.
3.     Foreign Exchange Component (excluding contingencies): The foreign exchange cost
of US$30.1 million (about 41.0 percent of total estimated project base costs) has been calculated
on the basis of the following foreign exchange percentages: civil works 25 percent, equipment 70
48



Annex 3
Page 2 of 3
percent, furniturelS percent, vehicles 100 percent, survey and plans 10 percent, library books 50
percent, printing and production of education materials 80 percent, textbook writing and
publication 0 percent, overseas specialists 100 percent; national specialists 0 percent, external
training 100 percent, in-country training 0 percent, studies 33 percent, project coordination 22
percent.
4.    Disbursement: To expedite disbursements, a special account with an authorized initial
allocation of US$2.5 million would be established at MEHE in coordination with MOFP and the
Central Bank. When the total amount disbursed and committed reaches SDR 15.0 million, the
authorized amount in the special account would be revised to US$5.0 million. Applications for
replenishment of the account, supported by appropriate documentation, would be submitted
regularly (preferably monthly, but no less than quarterly) or when the amounts withdrawn equal
50 percent of the initial deposit. Disbursements would be made on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures (SOE) for: (i) contracts of less than US$50,000 equivalent for goods and vehicles;
(ii) contracts for less than US$300,000 equivalent for works; (iii) consultant contracts of less
than US$100,000 equivalent for firms and US$50,000 for individual contracts; (iv) local
training; and (v) project management and recurrent costs. Documents supporting the SOEs
would be retained by the project coordination unit and made available for inspection during the
course of IDA supervision missions. Disbursements for all other expenditures would be against
full documentation. The proposed credit of US$70.3 million equivalent would be disbursed over
a period of five years (Annex 5). Disbursements would be made in the following manner: (i)
civil works I 00 percent of foreign and 65 percent of local expenditures. All civil works should
be completed within the first four years of the project period; (ii) equipment, furniture, vehicles,
and surveys and plans at 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 100 percent of local
expenditures (ex-factory) and 85 percent of expenditures for other items procured locally; (iii)
library books, printing and production of education materials, and textbook writing and
publication at 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-
factory) and 90 percent of local expenditures; (iv) technical assistance and external training 100
percent of total expenditures; (v) in-country training 100 percent of total expenditures; (vi)
studies 100 percent of total expenditures; and (vii) project management 50 percent of total
expenditures. Disbursements of local expenditures for which 100 percent of total financing is
supported by the project, e.g., equipment, furniture, vehicles, surveys and plans, library books,
printing and production of education materials, and project management, would be net of taxes
and other mark-up costs.
5.    Accounts and Audit: The MEHE/PCU and MOFP would establish and maintain
separate accounts for project expenditures. The accounts would be maintained in accordance
with sound accounting practices acceptable to the Association. Auditing would be performed
annually by a qualified auditor in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Association and
an audit report, including separate statements on disbursements against statements of
expenditures and on the Special Account, submitted to the Association.

Second General Education Project
Financial Assessment and Sustainability
The impact of GEP2 investmnents on the sector budget are shown in following table. During the
project period 1998-2002, GEP2 is expected to add Rs 3.2 billion to the education budget. This
will increase the average annual growth rate of the sector budget during 1998-2002 marginally
from 1.1% to 1.4%.

Source: table bugprj2
The fiscal impact of GEP2 on the overall government budget is relatively small. The above table
shows that the project would account for 0.2% of the budget in 1998, rise to 0.4% as
implementation accelerates in 1999, and then decline gradually to just 0.1 % by the end of the
project in 2002. Such a marginal effect on the budget is well within the fiscal capability of the
government, and is readily sustainable. Within the education sector budget, the share of GEP2 is
1.6% at project commencement in 1998, reaches a peak in 1999 at 4% and gradually decreases
thereafter to 1.5% by 2002. In financial terrns, this is a relatively small share of the sector
budget and within the absorptive capacity of the sector.

2.    Procurement thresholds and prior review requirements and the Government's
procurement capacity are outlined in Table B above. The total civil works cost of about
US$18.2 million will be for new construction, major extensions and renovations of schools based
on zonal plans under the new school structure ofjunior and senior groupings and for NILIS at
the University of Colombo and will be awarded on the basis of national competitive bidding
(NCB) procedures for any contracts equal to or below US$1.0 million and international
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures for any contracts above US$1.0 million. The NCB
contracts shall be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost US$ 100,000 equivalent or more
each. The NCB contract bids would not preclude foreign bidders. For the NCB and ICB tenders,
documents based on IDA Standard Bidding Documentation were reviewed and approved by IDA
in early 1997 and are ready for use (already in use for TETD project). Standard designs for
classrooms, laboratories, multi-purpose rooms, latrines and furniture have been prepared and are
available in the provinces, thus allowing civil works tenders to be called immediately after
project effectiveness and upon review and following review of zonal construction plans By IDA.
Construction plans for about eight zones will be ready by the time of negotiations and tendered
immediately upon project effectiveness (illegal to do prior to effectiveness by law in Sri Lanka)
and used as model for subsequent awards in the other zones. IDA's prior approval will be
required for all tender documents, all contracts under ICB, the first two contracts in each of the
provinces, and any contracts equal to or above US$300,000.
3.    Equipment, such as computers, data processing, paper testing, mini-laboratory,
mathematics, primary science, audio-visual, roneo machines & stencil cutter, duplicators, fax
machine, photocopier, and printer, amounting to about US$12.1 million, will be procured using
ICB (about 15 packages). Other equipment, such as telephones, office furniture and equipment,
library, instructional, filing cabinets and file folders, amounting to about US$8.5 million, will be
procured through NCB (about 100 packages) by MEHE and PEAs. In addition, about US$2.3
million of equipment, using 30 contracts, would be procured on the basis of international
shopping. Equipment estimated to cost less than US$50,000 per package and aggregating to
US$500,000 considered to be procured under international shopping would be on the basis of
quotations from a minimum of three suppliers. The Department of Foreign & International
Development's (DFID) US$0.2 million financing of equipment will follow DFID's procurement
guidelines.
4.    The threshold for IDA's prior approval will be required for all contracts that are equal to
or above US$300,000 for works, US$100,000 for goods, US$100,000 for consulting firms, and
US$50,000 for individual consultant services.
5.    The procurement of furniture for schools is estimated at about US$4.6 million. All of
this would be procured on the basis of NCB by grouping schools in the same zones. This
procurement will be undertaken by PEAs following MEHE supervision and the first two tender
documents and all contracts equal to or above US$100,000 will be subject to IDA prior review.
In some exceptional cases, furniture will be procured by national shopping, with a cumulative
value of US$1.0 million.
6.    US$0.1 million of the total estimated cost of US$0.2 million for vehicles would be used
to procure vehicles on the basis of NCB with the first two tender documents subject to IDA prior
review, and the remaining US$0.1 million, DFID's portion, will be used following DFID's
procurement guidelines. The value per contract under NCB is estimated to cost $100,000
equivalent or less.

7.    Direct contracting and force account will be used to finance the estimated cost of
about US$0.4 million to carry out surveys and formulate plans.
8.    Textbook Writing & Publication, Library Books, and Printing & Production of
Education Materials: Textbooks supply would be tendered using NCB procedures acceptable
to IDA. Contracts would be tendered for textbook writing, publishing, printing and distribution
without precluding foreign bidders. Contract formats would be agreed to by IDA, and only
contracts prepared using the agreed format would be funded by the project. A minimum of three
proposals (pro-forma invoices) should be obtained to ensure best market prices while ensuring
suitable compatibility with existing systems. The project would supplement the present MERE
budget line items for writing, publication, and printing of textbooks and teacher guides
(estimated to cost US$10.1 million) to ensure improvement of the quality of textbooks
contracted to private sector firms or joint Government and private sector publishers/printers and
in a few cases the Government printer. The goal of the project would be to reach by year 2002
the target of having 100 percent contracting for textbook writing, 80 percent for publishing, 70
percent for printing and 100 percent for distribution. Library books and educational materials
including computer software (estimated to cost US$3.7 million) would be procured directly from
the publishers on the basis of pro-forma invoices. Library books would be purchased following
negotiations for volume/quantities. Whenever two or more similar books exist, comparative bids
would be sought from a minimum of two publishers. Printing and production of education
materials conracts (estimated at US$0.6 million) would be awarded on the basis of national
shopping with quotations from a minimum of three printers (including regional bidders) for a
total of US$0.1 million, using NCB for a total of US$0.2 million, and following DFID's
procurement guidelines for a total of US$0.3 million.
9.    For ICB procurement, the standard IDA ICB bidding documentation would be used,
with prior review of bidding documentation by the Association. Contracts for goods and
equipment estimated to cost US$100,000 or more and for civil works contracts estimated to cost
US$300,000 or more will be subject to IDA prior review. Based on project experience, the
Government has the capacity to undertake the procurement activities. For all NCB
procurement the standard national bidding documentation (ICTAD), agreed to by IDA, would
be used.
10.   Consultant services: The types of consultants and technical assistance and terms of
reference are outlined in the PIP. Consultant costs are estimated at US$7.1 million with US$4.4
million IDA financing, 100 percent, and US$2.7 million DFID financing, which will follow
DFID procurement guidelines. IDA's portion of consultants would be selected in accordance
with the Association's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Consultant contracts, local and
international, would result from competition based on selection criteria and specific terms of
reference. In order to develop shortlists, GOSL will request expressions of interest from suitable
firms through advertisement in the Development Business. All international consultants will be
selected using competitive procedures acceptable to IDA. The consultant TORs would be
reviewed by IDA prior to tendering. Contracts with consulting firms costing equivalent or more
than US$100,000 and contracts for individual consultants costing equivalent or more than
US$50,000 would be subject to prior review by the Association. For national consultancies,
three firms, institutions, or specialists would be sought based on advertised criteria and terms of
references. For specific subjects (upgrading and on-the-job training of national teacher
57



Annex 6
Page 5 of 9
educators), international technical assistance and consultancies based on comparative cost
estimates would be sought from potential link institutions and institutions/specialists located in a
minimum of two countries.
11.   Training and Fellowships estimated at US$13.8 million will cover in-country and out
of country training, fellowships and workshops/seminars. About US$5.9 million has been
allocated for in-country training of senior staff with focus on curriculum, publication,
management and financing aspects; about US$1.8 million for training in the region and US$3.1
million--DFID's portion US$1.4 million--in OECF countries for fellowships, short-term training
and study tours; and about US$3.0 million--DFID's portion US$0.3million--for national
workshops, seminars and public awareness campaigns. Training activities will be based on
TORs, needs assessments, course outlines, and criteria based proposals reviewed by IDA.
Courses will be linked to MEHE, PEA and zonal reform plans prepared for the first two years of
the project during appraisal and agreed to during negotiations and annually thereafter. External
training will be based on agreed programs, timetables, detailed course outlines. All candidate
selections will be based on the selection criteria outlined in the PIP. Annual training programs
will be prepared and be subject to IDA review. All courses and workshops will be required to
include monitoring measures, establish and retain training records and undertake course
evaluations. Formal training agreements with link institutions will be subject to prior review by
IDA. National Training proposals are outlined in the PIP, and implementation would be subject
to IDA prior review. Training expenditures would be based on agreed annual rates or unit costs
covering expenditures for course operation, trainee stipends, travel and lodging and for
monitoring activities. Following IDA review, training activities could also cover inter-
institution seminars and visits to the link institutions. Lists of seminars, workshops and expected
costs, would be reviewed annually. Payments for training programs would be linked to the
agreed annual plans and payment on receipts and statements of expenditures acceptable to IDA.
Fellowships would be awarded under govermnent procedures and criteria acceptable to the
Association and in concurrence with the staff development plan agreed during negotiations.
12.   Government Procurement Capacity to handle the procurement proposed under the
project is still weak although improving. All tenders undertaken for education have been
decentralized to the MEHE Tender Committee. Following discussions undertaken during GEP1
and TETD, MEHE has agreed to the following adjustments during the project:
* to continue to implement, as per the TETD project, the operation of three or four permanent
technical committees (area and subject based). Both committees (tender and technical)
should meet jointly, reducing the time lag for tender preparation and analysis. For all
tenders, time periods would be agreed to and clear time limits would be given and processing
steps agreed to;
* The IDA bidding documentation would be used for both ICB and NCB tenders;
* MEHE would establish procurement preparation and review calendars and respect the tender
periods. Technical assistance would be sought to assist with the development of improved
tender, contracting and delivery documentation. In addition, impact analysis of equipment
and materials delivered would be undertaken to maximize investments;
* Based on the availability of civil works and goods bidding documents (already agreed to by
IDA); level of readiness of civil works designs, equipment and quality inputs; availability of
lists of fellowships and TORs for all the proposed technical assistance; lists of training
programs (except management which will depend on survey) which have all been defined
and are included in the PIP; and the appointment of a National Education Reform Unit
58



Annex 6
Page 6 of 9
within MEHE, the project is judged to be suitably ready for implementation and GOSL
capacity, although still weak, have been suitably addressed.
13.   For studies (estimated at US$0.7 million), consultants would be recruited according to
IDA guidelines. All studies will be based on terms of references included in the PIP.
14.   To achieve the above, the PCU would be staffed with a director, an accountant and a
trained procurement officer. These posts would be filled prior to and at a minimum by project
effectiveness to ensure timely implementation of the large tender and procurement activities
planned.
15.   The following pages outline the procurement schedule of the project.

SECOND GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
IDA SUPERVISION PLAN
1.     Progress Reviews and Reporting: The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE)
would assume the implementation, monitoring and reporting responsibilities for this project. These tasks
would largely be delegated to the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) which would assume the day-to-day
overview of the project. PCU would also prepare the monthly status report required by the External
Resources Department (ERD) and summarize each into semester reports for IDA in July and January of
each year starting July 1998. Based on the experience of the ongoing General Education Project, the report
would include financial and data tables and status summaries using formats suitable for both the
Government and IDA. This joint effort would reduce paper work. result in consistency of reporting and
facilitate the gradual transfer of supervision responsibilities to the IDA Sri Lanka Field Office (SLFO) in
Colombo.
2.     The progress reports would include the following: summary of implementation progress (write-
up and tables) listing the status of each project component and comparing it with the plans; financial
summary by component (including funds spent, committed, actual commitments versus planned, and
proposals for the next semester); update of the implementation schedule, project implementation plan and
indicators (showing actual versus planned); list of issues and problems that have arisen and proposals of
options for their resolution; a data table on activities (planned, actual, proposed for the next semester, with
estimated funding needs) of such activities as civil works, training, fellowships, studies and technical
assistance; and finally, the status of credit disbursements. Every semester the report would assess if the
project objectives are still realistic and advise if new circumstances (political or administrative) are
affecting the implementation of the project goals as set-out at the time of appraisal. The joint reporting
format will be finalized during the start-up seminar.
3.     IDA would review the progress of the project at least twice and, if possible, three times yearly.
One of these missions (January) would be a more comprehensive annual review during which all aspects of
the project would be closely reviewed. During the first review of each year ajoint mission would be
undertaken with the other Donors contributing to the project. A mid-term review is scheduled about 2
years after project effectiveness, (about July 2000) at which time the project objectives would be closely
reviewed and needed adjustments to the project content and implementation steps would be undertaken.
4.     The proposed project would be monitored and evaluated from the perspectives of inputs, process,
outputs and impact (Annex 11). The input evaluation would focus on whether the required resources are
in place to implement the program of activities and services. Input information would be monitored and
assessed continuously (reported quarterly by ZEOs and PEAs and semi-annually by PCU) to identify the
delivery input so that problems could be resolved in a timely manner. The process evaluation would
examine the approaches used in the training, service delivery and recipient participation in each
component; PCU would report semi-annually on the levels of performance compared to project inputs and
suggest remedial actions for non-responsive inputs. The output evaluation would focus on the immediate
results of activities, for example, improvements in the quality of textbooks, or exam results in schools
where the qualifications of teachers or curricula have been improved. The output evaluation would focus
on the such factors as: the number to trainees per programs; and linkages between the budget and cadre
allocations within each province with resultant increases in grant allocations for quality resources.
5.     The above evaluation steps would be supplemented by studies (outlined in Annex 2 and PIP)..
Since this is a very technical project, supervision by IDA staff should be guided by an experienced
educator supported by an education economist who would assess the project's progress. In view of the
potential civil works activities, during the annual review, as appropriate, these specialists should also be
66

assisted by an architect (during the first year by an external specialist and thereafter by national
specialists).
6.     This is a large and complex project with many components. IDA project supervision would be
allocated an annual average of 16 staff weeks for in-country and desk supervision of this project.
However, the number of staff weeks required during the first two years, at least, would be about 20
reducing to about 12 during the last two years of implementation. It is estimated that about half or 8 staff
weeks would be used in-country and the other half doing desk work related to the project:

7.     The project would provide funds to employ national consultants to assist the MEHE and PCU
undertake the necessary analyses. External technical assistance would also be provided for various
evaluation and monitoring activities.

SRI LANKA
SECOND GENERAL EDUCATION PROJECT
Cost Effectiveness Analysis Summary
(based on the detailed analysis in the PIP)
I. Sector Economic Analysis:
A. Sector Enrollment:
1.     Sri Lanka has achieved universal primary education for th-e last three decades and has one of the
highest secondary enrollment ratios among the Asian countries. However, the neglect of teacher education
and the low expenditure on quality inputs in the last decade has reduced the quality of education and
decreased the internal and external efficiency of the system. During the 1990s declining population growth
has started to affect education enrollment and population growth rates have fallen rapidly in the past 15
years, to about one percent annually and as a result first year primary intake has been declining since 1991
by over 1.5 percent a year. Enrollment projections show a continuing decline from 4.1 million in 1996 to
3.5 in 2005.
B. Social Demand for Education:
2.     Education is one of the most sensitive issues to the Sri Lankan society as it has deep rooted
cultural and religious connotations and this has been reflected by escalating historical demand for
education. In an effort to address the system reforms, the NEC has carried out a massive endeavor to study
the system deficiencies and assess the demand for education. It was found that there has been an increasing
demand for system reforms to address quality improvement, internal efficiency, equity among schools
(rural / urban, elite / non-elite, national / provincial), and increasing access to the escalating numbers of
dropouts in remote and rural areas and other out-of-school children.
C. Education Sector Expenditure:
3.     By international standards Sri Lanka spends comparatively little on education. The proportion of
GDP spent on education in 1995 was 2.9 percent. Over the past decade, the average share of education in
GDP has been approximately 3 percent per year. This is less than the 3.5 percent mean for Asia and the 3.9
percent mean for developing countries. The proportion of the government budget devoted to education
expenditures is also relatively low by international standards. In recent years approximately 10 percent of
government spending has been on education. This is below the 14 percent average for Asia and the 15
percent average for developing countries.
D. Central and Provincial Budget:
4.     Education spending is divided into two broad categories, expenditures incurred through the central
Government and expenditures incurred through provincial budgets. Provincial budgets are received
through block grants and primarily cover salaries of teachers in provincial schools.The total education
budget for 1996 was Rs 23 billion and almost equally distributed between the central and provincial
budgets. The sector budget consists of two broad categories, recurrent expenditures (81 percent), and
capital expenditures (19 percent). The total recurrent sector budget consists of salaries 76 percent, 16
percent subsidies and student welfare programs (scholarships, food and transport subsidies, uniforms, etc.),
7 percent travel and other expenditure, and one percent for quality inputs such as essential teaching
materials, school supplies and school maintenance.
E. Pattern of Provincial Expenditure:
5.     Expenditure of three heavily inhabited provinces in 1996 (Western, Central, and Southern) make
over half of the total expenditure of all provinces. Expenditure per student show wide variations among the
provinces demonestrating inequality. Generally, provinces with high expenditure per student also have
comparatively lower student:teacher ratio and are spending more on teacher salaries confirning teacher
surpluses in these provinces. The TETD project addressed the issue of matching teacher supply with
76



Annex 13
Page 2 of 8
demand through teacher deployment, attrition and the application of the resource distribution mechanism
(Ready Recknoner) among schools. Complementary to the teacher rationalization of the TETD, the GEP2
project supports the application of a unit cost financing formula to the provinces that will address the
schools' needs by matching allocations of resources to enrollment, existing shortages and plans to
rationalize facilities and quality inputs on per capita basis. The application of the unit cost financing
formula will give the provinces equal share of the budget according to their needs based on the number of
students, the demographic change, and resource availability.
F. Expenditure on Quality Inputs:
6.     The low level of quality in the Sri Lankan education system is mainly due the minimal
expenditure on quality inputs in the education budget. In 1996, 76 percent of the total recurrent budget
(central and provincial) was allocated to salaries, 16 percent for subsidies and welfare programs, 7 percent
for travel and other expenditure, and leaving only one percent for quality inputs such as essential teaching
materials, school supplies and school maintenance. It was agreed under the TETD project that the
provinces will start to allocate 3 percent of their recurrent block grant budget to quality inputs starting from
1998, increase this ratio by I percent per year to reach 6 percent by the end of the project (2001), and
continue at that level thereafter to sustain quality input needs. Expenditure on quality inputs will increase
from Rs 113 million in 1996 to Rs 647 million in 2001and expenditure per student will have a
corresponding increase of more than six times (from Rs 27 to 171) during the same period.
G. Expenditure on School Maintenance
7.     It was also agreed under the TETD project that one percent of the total capital budget would be
allocated to school maintenance. Expenditure on school maintenance is estimated by the World Bank
Sector Report (1994) to be Rs 2,000 per school. Projections for this expenditure show that the school
share for maintenance will more than double (Rs 4,400) if one percent of the total capital budget is
allocated to this purpose and will increase to Rs 5,200 by 2001 and to 5,800 by 2005. Total maintenance
allocations to all schools is also expected to increase from Rs 44 million to 58 million during 1996-2005.
H. Budget Projections:
8.     Recurrent and capital expenditure projections were carried out for both central and provincial
budgets in a base run and two scenarios. The first scenario covered the total sector investment requirement
The second scenario covered the investments planned under GEP2. The education budget under the base
run is projected to rise from Rs 23.1 billion in 1996 to Rs.26.0 billion by 2005 at a moderate annual
average growth rate of 1.4 percent per year. The education sector currently receives 10 percent of the
government budget. GDP growth over the long-term is predicted to be over 5 percent per year, and the
government budget is expected to grow by 4 percent per year. Under the base run with such a moderate
growth in education expenditures, the share of the education sector budget to the government budget will
decline to 5 percent by 2005. The budget is expected to increase substantially when all sector investment
needs are met (scenario one) to Rs 32.5 billion in 2005, at an annual average growth rate of 4.3 percent per
year. Such growth is still within the projected growth of GDP of over 5 percent per year. Scenario two,
planned GEP2 investment, will increase the budget in the early years of project implementation and taper
off towards the end.
I. Provincial Expenditure on Qualitv Inputs:
9.     Expenditure on quality inputs for the provinces is projected for the period 1996-2005 on the bases
of the agreement reached with the Government in the TETD project (3 percent of provincial recurrent
budget in 1998 and increase it to 6 percent by 2001). The provinces have to increase their current
expenditure on quality inputs three times next year (from Rs 111 million in 1997 to 331 million in 1998).
The increase will be gradual after 1998 by about one percent per year and expenditure is projected to reach
Rs 647 million by 2001 and continue at that level thereafter.
77



Annex 13
Page 3 of 8
10.    Expenditure on quality inputs per student will also increase from the current level of Rs 27 to 170
by 2001. This level will match the current level of the affluent national schools and at that stage all students
will be housed in schools called junior and senior and all school labels will be removed and quality
allocation will be based on equitable distribution of students. Per capita expenditure on quality is expected
to continue to increase as a result of the continued decline in number of students, and reach Rs 180 by
2005. The projected increase in allocation will raise the quality level of rural and small schools and abridge
the gap in resource distribution between large schools (national and type IAB schools) and small schools
(types IC, 2 and 3 schools). This will particularly benefit the poor students and increase their opportunities.
11.    There are wide variations among provinces in per capita expenditure on quality and the goal is to
reduce these discrepancies. Provinces with low overall expenditure, such as the North Central, North East,
and Uva provinces, have low per student expenditures and provinces such as the Central, North West, and
Sabaragamuw, which have relatively high expenditure level, spend more on quality in terms of per student.
The projected pattern of expenditure for the period 1996-2005 when a unified resource formula is applied
to the budgetary allocations shows that, eventhough, the allocated amount to quality in all provinces will
increase, reflecting the projected increase in the unit cost, the relative share of the under-allocated
provinces will increase and the share of over-allocated provinces will decrease reaching an equitable level
with the rest of the provinces.
II. Project Economic Analysis
1. Rationale for Investing in GEP2 Components:
12.    The education system quality has suffered as a result of the continuous low level of expenditure
on quality inputs. That in turn has created inefficiencies in the operations of the different components of
the sector with high cost implications. The following quality issues and their cost implications show the
great need to invest in the different components of the sector to address equity, raise the quality of general
education, create a system that is more responsive to economic needs and to increase labor force
productivity.
A. Inappropriate and outdated school curriculum.
13.    The existing school curriculum has not been updated for over ten years. It is not based on modem
learning and teaching methods, and contains significant gaps in information in a variety of subjects. The
curriculum is considered by the Government to be unresponsive to labor market needs.
B. Poor quality textbooks.
14.    Textbooks have been a Government monopoly for over fifteen years. This has led to high costs of
production by a rigidly structured Government department, the Educational Publications Department
(EPD). The textbooks are produced with inferior paper, poor binding and weak covers. Hence, the
durability of textbooks is low, causing re-use rates in Sri Lanka (currently one year) to be approximately
one-third those of comparable developing countries. Low re-use rates add approximately $1.7 million
dollars per year to book production costs. The contents of textbooks fail to reflect the school curriculum
adequately and have not been updated for over ten years.
C. Inequalities and shortages in physical capital and basic services:
15.    A substantial deficit exists in facilities and services. For instance, over 2000 schools (20 percent of
all schools) lack water supply and sanitation facilities and over 70 percent of schools do not have
telecommunication services, and 40 percent of schools lack electricity. Poor system planning has led to
severe pressure on classroom space, lack of furniture in urban and semi-urban schools and substantial
quantities of initialized space and furniture in rural schools. Excessive demand for facilities, furniture and
78



Annex 13
Page 4 of 8
equipment in popular urban schools has adverse cost implications due to high levels of breakage and
accelerated depreciation. Underutilization of facilities in rural schools causes resource wastage and
increases the cost of keeping such schools operational.
D. Inequalities in resource allocation:
16.    The current fnancing system is based on previous year expenditure and does not apply a per
capita resource distribution mechanism. This has accentuated the inequalities in resource allocation among
schools. The school sample survey in 1996 revealed wide inequalities in the availability of facilities and
equipment among different types of schools. Per capita expenditure on quality items in National and type
lAB schools (Rs 134) is four times the amount spent in types IC and 2 schools and eight times the amount
for type 3 schools.
E. Shortages of quality inputs:
17.    As a result of the inequalities in resource distribution among schools, Types 2 and 3 schools
experience acute shortages in quality inputs such as science equipment, chemicals, tools and materials for
technical subjects, and teaching aids. These inputs are available in less than 20 percent of such schools. The
average expenditure on quality inputs at present is 27 rupees per student, while the actual requirement for
quality inputs is estimated at 203 rupees per student. Underinvestment in quality inputs has led to an acute
shortage, with over 90 percent of schools lacking adequate equipment and materials.
F. Inadequate library facilities:
18.    The school system has neglected libraries for over two decades. 7,000 schools (70 percent) have
no libraries at all. Nearly all the remaining 3,000 schools have just one room, containing inadequate
furniture and outdated books. Regular library hours are not part of the school week, and a systematic
policy on recruiting and training librarians is lacking. The lack of adequate library facilities lowers learning
capacity and teaching potential of teachers. This affects the quality of education and decreases the return to
investment in education.
G. An inefficient and inflexible manazement structure:
19.    The current management structure of the education system is obsolete and does not match the
operational needs of the system. There is duplication of roles and functions among officials in various
departments within the MEHE and the Provincial Ministries and Departments of Education. Record
keeping and administrative operations in the MEHE and among the PEAs are mainly performed manually,
data on student and teacher required for educational planning is weak and accounting information needed
for fnancial management is poor. These factors lead to inefficient planning and an increase in school
administration costs.
2. The Project Impact on Unemployment:
20.    Unemployment in Sri Lanka is concentrated among the young ages 15 to 29 (73 percent of total) and
relatively educated people (53 percent). Workers with 0 and A levels have exceptionally high rates of 29
percent and 24 percent respectively. The high white collar unemployment in Sri Lanka is closely associated
with the education system traditional set-up that is orienting graduates and leavers towards administrative and
clerical occupations mainly for the saturated public sector. The high repetition and dropout rates at the 0 and
A levels and the very limited access to higher education accentuates the problem of the unemployed young
school leavers. The GEP2 investment in general education in revising the curriculum, improving textbooks
and libraries, and improving quality of education, along with the Government's policy of restructuring the
system into junior and senior schools, will have a direct impact on the type of graduates. Curriculum revision
will be based on social and economic needs and will address issues that will improve productivity and labor
market needs. This in turn will produce graduates that are more prepared for the post secondary education and
with better employable skills that will have an impact on easing the unemployment of the school leavers.
79



Annex 13
Page 5 of 8
3. The Project Impact on Poverty:
21.    The World Bank sector report (1994) indicated that schools in poor provinces have proportionally
more unqualified teachers, greater shortages, and low-paid teachers, spent less on instructional and teaching
materials, and have more shortages in equipment and other quality inputs. GEP2 approach in providing
facilities and quality inputs, which is based on priority needs, will abridge the gap between poor and affluent
schools. Furthermore, the application of a unit cost based formula for resource distribution under GEP2 will
ensure that provinces and schools will receive their share of expenditure for salaries and non-salaries items
including school maintenance and quality inputs. A reduction of these inequalities is likely to be strongly pro-
poor as it will increase the participation of poor children in junior and senior schools and raise the quality (and
hence the market value) of general education for them.
4. The Project's System-wide Approach:
22.    GEP2 combats the problem of low educational quality by adopting a system-wide approach that
seeks to strengthen the weak areas in a concerted and integrated manner. This will be achieved through
investments in curriculum development, expansion of production quality and capacity in textbook and
educational publications, school rationalization, the supply of physical facilities and quality inputs,
construction and equipping of libraries, strengthening management and introducing a norm-based, unit cost
resource allocation mechanism. The GEP investments cover the different components of the sector, except
teacher education and teacher deployment, which are being addressed by the TETD project. The system wide
approach to the education sector contains three major advantages: (i) it addresses all the relevant components
of the problem, so that its potential impact is maximized, (ii) it enables the linkages and inter-relationships
between the different components to be fully exploited in the development thrust of a project, and (iii) it
prevents over-investment in one area while others are starved of resources. Currently, the political
environment is quite congenial to adopt a system approach. The President of Sri Lanka and the Minister of
Education have declared 1997 as the year of educational reforms. Large scale political and social awareness
for education reform will mobilize more financial and better qualified human resources for the sector and
strengthen the institutional environment.
5. Alternative Investment Options:
23.    Comparative analyses of a variety of alternative investment scenarios, for each of the components of
GEP2, were undertaken. These included the analysis of alternative investment options for book production
and distribution; the relative cost of the establishment of various types of libraries in different types and
locations of schools; the development of curriculum cycles of varying duration to reflect the evolution of
educational needs, up-to-date methodologies and approaches envisaged; the provision of different
combinations of basic physical facilities; the delivery of a range of student and teacher related quality inputs;
alternative models for reform of the educational management structure; and different investment options for
the establishment of a rational and equitable resource allocation mechanism. These options were examined
taking into consideration the sector institutions, their capacities, components' operations, implementation
feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. The GEP2 investment options were mostly the optimum approaches and
were selected on the bases of technical efficiency and cost-effectiveness in line with the Government's
strategy for reforming the education system.
6. Costs Effectiveness of Project Components:
24.    There will be substantial benefits when project-related reforms are carried out fully as they will
improve the internal and extemal efficiency of the educational system. Project investments will yield direct
savings in some components such as increasing the life expectancy of textbooks and indirect and
unquantifiable benefits for most components such as curriculum development and management
streamlining. When the unquantifiable (but large) benefits from improved levels of general education in the
80



Annex 13
Page 6 of 8
population at large are factored in, the project benefits are massive. The project's largest benefits by far
come from improving the quality of education received by the 4.1 million students.
A. Curriculum Development:
25.    This component, which costs US$9.1 million, has the potential to generate substantial economic
benefits by strengthening the capacity of the NIE to design and implement a sequential curriculum cycle. This
will enable the NIE to develop subject syllabi reflecting the evolution of knowledge and methodology.
Management efficiency will enable NIE to introduce up-to-date educational materials in a more timely
manner. Curriculum developers will be exposed to overseas curricula, materials and experiences, enabling
them to develop a more wide-ranging and technologically advanced curriculum. The sequential cycle will
allow books to be updated every five years resulting in textbook content better matching the needs. The
participation of teachers, parents and industry will improve the curriculum content making it more responsive
to evolving needs. These measures would bridge the gap between the curriculum and the economic needs and
lay the foundation for an education system capable of producing the range and level of human capital required
for a modem, productive labor force that is needed for a competitive export-oriented economy.
B. Textbooks and Educational Publications:
26.    This component, which costs $10.9 million, contains the potential to produce substantial benefits by
reducing expenditure inefficiencies; enhancing the quality of textbooks, workbooks and supplementary
reading material; improving links between the curriculum, textbooks and teacher guidebooks facilitating the
learning process; and increasing cost-effectiveness of book sector operations. Investments in this component
will also increase the relevance and quality of the contents of educational books, strengthen their physical
condition and durability, assist implement an updated national book policy, and strengthen the capacity of the
Education Publications Department (EPD) to promote the production of better quality, more cost-effective
textbooks and educational material. Project investments can produce cost savings by improving book re-use
from one to three years and from private sector involvment in book distribution.
27.    The total savings of the component will reach US$9 million by the end of the project and this
suggests that the entire component cost will be regained in six years, and US$1.8 million will be saved
annually after project period. In other words, the component's investment will have a 16.5 percent annual
savings as a result of improved efficiency of the book sector operations. Annual savings after project
period will enable MEHE to continue improving the physical condition of books and the quality and
content of curriculum ensuring the component's sustainability. In addition, the project will support the
overall restructuring of EPD by providing equipment and training and thus enhancing the planning,
implementation and monitoring capacity of EPD. This will enable the institution to maximize sector resource
utilization and minimize cost-inefficiencies through better management, promotion of competitive private
sector participation, and streamlining of public sector operation.
C. School Facilities Rationalization:
28.    This component, costing US$20.5 million (including the costs of developing school library facilities),
has the capacity to generate substantial economic benefits by ensuring that many of the surplus facilities are
renovated and fully utilized as classrooms, libraries, multi-purpose rooms and staff rooms. As schools are
restructured into Junior (grades 1-9) and Senior Schools (grades 10-13), through this component Junior
Schools requiring renovation or new construction will be better able to cater for compulsory education for 5 to
14 year olds. Analysis of a sample of schools indicates that, while there remains shortages of educational
facilities in rural and urban areas, there may be throughout the country a surplus of classrooms because many
are not located where enrollment are found. It is estimated that, in addition to the physical facilities
constructed and furnished through GEPI, that another US$60 million is needed to provide the needed facilities
for all schools.
81



Annex 13
Page 7 of 8
29.    The school survey conducted by MEHE and PEAs will assist in developing an up-to-date school map
and thus determine the surpluses and deficits. In this way MEHE and PEAs will be able to make considerable
cost savings and improve efficiency by ensuring that new construction, renovation and refurbishment are in
response to enrollment and demographic changes. With focussing upon deprived urban and rural areas,
benefits will accrue from a more equitable distribution of educational and sanitary facilities and from raising
the standards of the schools' physical environment. In addition, assistance will be given by the project towards
the systematic maintenance of buildings, services (utilities) and furniture. This will serve to increase their life
span and efficiency and will reduce the impact on the budget of premature replacement costs.
D. QUW4iIynp=ts:
30.    This component, costing US$15.2 million, builds upon the foundations laid by GEPI. It has the
potential to reap substantial economic benefits by supporting the provision of quality inputs to needy schools
and by developing the capacity of PEAs and ZEOs to ensure that equipment and educational materials are
distributed (and utilized) to all classes in each grade (with special attention being given to the under-resourced
primary grades) on a per capita basis and according to the requirements of the revised curriculum. As with
physical facilities, MEHE, PEAs and ZEOs will be assisted in carrying out a survey to determine where there
are quality input resource gaps. Equipment maintenance would have a recurrent cost of US$15 million over
the project period. This would increase after the project as all schools become better equippedand would
reqire an annual per capita allocation from the recurrent budget of up to ten times more than the current level.
31.    The component will have a substantial impact on expenditure for quality items. Per capita
expenditure for these items for the needy schools (types IC, 2 and 3) will increase from Rs 27 to Rs 173 by the
end of the project period, a level that is comparable to national schools' current expenditure. This will raise the
quality level of rural and small schools and abridge the gap in resource distribution between national and type
IAB schools and types IC, 2 and 3 schools. The provision of equipment and materials to needy schools will
motivate teachers to teach in school rather than get private tuition fees from students. This in turn will bring
about, not only a more cost-effective general education system, but also enormous cost savings for parents.
E. Libraries:
32.    This component, which will cost $5.3 million, has the capacity to produce considerable benefits by
increasing resources for student learning and enhancing student achievement. Investment in the library sector
will include formulating a policy on school libraries, establishing libraries in 2,000 schools, improving
libraries in a further 2,000 schools, and constructing a National Institute for Library and Information Studies
(NILIS) to provide pre-service and in-service library training. Schools will receive an allocation from the
education budget, under the new library policy, to expand its collection of books and reading material, and for
maintenance and replacement activities. This will ensure sustainability of investments in the school library
sector. The new libraries established will benefit approximately one million students and forty thousand
teachers. The improved library facilities will benefit a further one and a half million students and sixty
thousand teachers. Altogether, this will benefit 59 percent of all students and 53 percent of teachers.
F. Education Management:
33.    This component, costing $6.0 million, has the capacity to generate substantial benefits by improving
the internal efficiency of the system and maximizing sector resource utilization. First, it will clarify the
relationships between the main institutions in the education system, the MEHE, the NIE, the PEAs and the
UGC, eliminating duplication and waste. Second, it will improve communications, enhancing the flow of
information and record keeping. Third, the project will support the MEHE to establish a more flexible
organizational structure, leading to swifter decision making and more cost-effective implementation. Fourth,
the project will strengthen management capacity in these institutions by providing equipment and training. In
addition, EMIS will be established and consolidated, enhancing flexibility and efficiency. Fifth, a system of
staff recruitment and promotion based on merit and experience will be introduced, improving professionalism
82



Annex 13
Page 8 of 8
and productivity. Sixth, the research capability of the MEHE and PEAs will be developed, strengthening
forecasting and formation of long-term goals, and enhancing capacity for policy making. These measures will
exert a powerful impact on the managerial efficiency and productivity of the system.
G. Education Fin  g:
34.    This component, which will cost $0.7 million, contains the potential to generate substantial economic
benefits by establishing a rational and equitable basis for resource allocation to over 10,000 schools benefiting
over four million students. By applying a per capita resource distribution formula in the sector financing and
providing needed training, the component's implementation will ensure that the deprived poor and small rural
schools will receive their share of the budget. Central and provincial authorities will be able to plan and
manage budgets to ensure balanced fnancing of personnel costs, quality inputs, services and maintenance.
Furthermore, the budgetary process between the center and the provinces will become more transparent,
enabling the Finance Commission, through the block grants, to track expenditures within provinces. Improved
efficiency and equity in resource distribution will enhance the education system to produce productive and
sustainable human capital.
7. Project's Fiscal Sustainability:
35.    The fiscal impact of GEP2 on the overall govemment budget is relatively small. During the
project period 1998-2002, GEP2 is expected to add Rs 3.2 billion to the education budget. This will
increase the average annual growth rate of the sector budget during 1998-2002 marginally from 1.1 percent
to 1.4 percent. Project cost would account for 0.2 percent of the budget in 1998, rise to 0.4 percent as
implementation accelerates in 1999, and then decline gradually to just 0.1 percent by the end of the project
in 2002. Such a marginal effect on the budget is well within the fiscal capability of the govermment, and is
readily sustainable. Within the education sector budget, the share of GEP2 is 1.6 percent at project
commencement in 1998, reaches a peak in 1999 at 4 percent and gradually decreases thereafter to 1.5
percent by 2002. In financial terms, this is a relatively small share of the sector budget and within the
absorptive capacity of the sector.

3.      School Rationalization:
Policy Initiatives:
The Ministry of Education and Higher Education (MEHE) will reorganize the structure of schools throughout the
nation into Junior (grades 1-9) and Senior (grades 10-13) Schools to ensure an equitable and cost-effective allocation
of physical facilities through:
•   conducting a detailed survey of existing schools, their facilities and enrollments by grade;
*   costing and prioritizing plans in each education zone, based on enrollment and demographic projections, for the
provision of essential civil works, fumiture and equipment according to an agreed formula to implement the
proposed curriculum reforms.

6.      Management
Policy Initiatives:
The Government will improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the four major bodies (MEHE, PEAs, NIE and
UGC) involved in managing education in the country through:
*   restructuring the existing bodies to ensure that the staff cadre better match the functions of each level of
management and that staff performance more closely relates to defined job specifications;
*   upgrading the skills of managers and all staff, both in daily administrative operations and in such matters as
policy, planning, decision-making, communication and supervision; and
*   initiating a more merit-based recruitment system and instituting accountability in management according to
agreed outcomes.
