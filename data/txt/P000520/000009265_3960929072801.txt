MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHAD
FOR A SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ACTION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Chad for SDR 10.4 million (US$13.4
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would
be on standard IDA terms, with 40 years' maturity, and would assist the
Government in its efforts toward reconstruction and adjustment of the
economy and improvement of living conditions in Chad.
2.        Background.  In 1986 the Government took the first steps toward
rebuilding the economy and restoring the country's infrastructute and
productive capacity following a decade of disruptions that destroyed most
of the physical and administrative infrastructure. The adjustment programs
first focused or (a) restructuring the cotton sector, the mainstay of the
economy, under an initial emergency sectoral rehabilitation program
followed by a three-year program to improve the sector's economic and
financial viability, and (b) improving public finances. These programs are
described in a Policy Framework Paper (1989-91) and are supported by two
IIF Structural Adjustment Facilities (1987-88 and 1989-91) and an IDA
Financial Rehabilitation Credit (Cr. 1945-CD). A third PFP, covering the
period 1990-92, was agreed with the Government in December 1989 and will be
supported under a third annual SAP arrangement.
3.        The adjustment programs are generally on target after the first
three years, with GDP growth averaging 52 p.a. in real terms. However,
with the population estimated at 5.5 million in 1989 and expected to grow
at least 2.22 annually, and GDP at 32, per capita income will increase only
marginally over the next few years. The urban population, which has
doubled as a result of massive migration, is expected to be particularly
affected by this prospect of sluggish economic growth. The adjustment
programs would also help improve social services by providing a modest
increase in the public resources allocated to the social ministries. The
Government recognizes the urgent need to give high priority to social
services and human resources development to prevent deterioration of an
already precarious situation and to pernmit a more rapid recovery.
4.        Bank Group strategy.  Bank Group lending to Chad resumed in
FY86. It was initially aimed at helping the Government reconstruct the
shattered economy through emergency measures, but is now moving toward
longer-term priority reform and development efforts. The adjustment effort
is expected to be reinforced by a Structural Adjustment Credit in FY92.
Other areas in which the Zank Group is supporting policy reforms and
investment3 include: (a) agriculture, with ongoing sector rehabilitation
and livestock projects; (b) education, through an ongoing education project
to rehabilitate primary education and strengthen sectoral institutions; and
(c) transportation, through an ongoing road reconstruction project, to
implement a medium-term program of policy reforms and investments in that



sector. Over the next five years, the Bank Group will intensify its
activities in the agriculture sector to strengthen agricultural services,
and will also support the Government's efforts to (a) address environmental
and household energy issuest (b) exploit Chadian pmtroleum reserves, if the
existence of viable quantities is confirmedt (c) develop the private
sector; (d) rehabilitate the basic health care system and strengthen health
institutions; and Ce) strengthen municipal services. The Bank Group is
also active in technical assistance and institution building in many
sectors and will continue to assist in aid coordination, in part through
participation in a Round Table scheduled for CY1990.
5.        Rationale for IDA's involvement.  Addressing the basic needs of
the disadvantaged population groups is a high priority in the Government's
development and reconstruction effort. In addition to helping the
Government improve economic efficiency, raise production in key sectors and
develop human resources, IDA could play a crucial role in (a) supporting
the Government's efforts to address the immediate needs of the population
groups still at risk as a consequence of the prolonged period of
socioeconomic disruptions and of those expected to be adversely affected by
the transitional effects of the adjustment process recently initiated, and
(b) helping to mobilize and coordinate donor resources to that end. The
proposed project is designed to provide assistance to the Government
through priority actions to be effectively implemented by involving
techniques already tested and entities already active in the country,
including the participation of NGOs to expand the support they have already
provided in Chad. The project would also serve as a basis for the
formulation of broader sectoral strategies and further actions to be
supported as part of planned lending and sectoral operations.
6.        ProJect obiectives.   The project has three primary objectives:
(a) stimulation of employment generation by increasing access to training
facilities and productive activities for poor and/or unemployed people; (b)
improvement of the health and living conditions of vulnerable groups; and
(c) reinforcement of the Government's institutional capacity to design and
monitor programs to improve social conditions.
7.        Project description.  The proposed project comprises the
following four components: (a) stimulation of employment generation by
providing (i) credit assistance and management support for small and micro-
enterprises, (ii) technical assistance tailored to their needs, and (iii)
assistance to laid-off public employees; (b) improvement of primary health
care and social services by (i) restructuring and expanding the network of
these services in N'Djamena, including the construction and operation of
three integrated health-social centers, three dispensaries and three
maternity centers, and (ii) strengthening the regional health services in
the Prefecture of Tandjile in the cotton zone; (c) improvement of
N'Diamena's sanitation infrastructure by (i) rehabilitating the drainage
system in two flood-prone areas where a high percentage of low-income
families live, and (ii) improving public hygiene through increased
community participation and use of labor-intensive public works techniques;
and (d) strengthening of social policy planning by (i) undertaking small
sample household surveys in the cotton zone and three cities, an integrated
nationwide household survey, and socioeconomic studies, and (ii) assisting



-3-
the Government in defining future social policies and actions targeted at
vulnerable population groups.
8,        The project would be completed by December 1995, with most of
the planned activities expected to be implemented over a three-year period.
while establishing the integrated household survey and related studies
would take five years. The project would finance civil works, essential
drugs, a credit line for micro and small entrepreneurs, furniture and
equipment, specialist services and studies, training, and incremental
operating costs. Total cost is estimated at US$26.9 million equivalent,
with a foreign exchange component of US$17.2 million (64Z). A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Chad are given in Schedules -. and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7966-CD dated May 2, 1990, is also attached.
9.        Azreed actions.  The following agreements were reached with the
Governments (a) the functions, staffing and responsibilities of the
Health-Social and Sanitation Infrastructure Units will at all times be
satisfactory to IDA; (b) the interest rate under the credit scheme for
small and micro-enterprises will be 12 until June 30, 1991, and increased
to 13? thereafter, with an added front-end service fee of 2S in both cases,
and will be adjusted not later than December 31, 1991, on the basis of the
findings of a banking sector review study, and pursuant to the financial
performance of the credit scheme and the prevailing commercial lending
rates; (c) a cost recovery scheme, based on a system of fixed fees, will be
introduced for services provided by the three maternities constructed under
the project and by the health centers supplied with essential drugs; (d)
the Government's operating budgets for N'Djamena's health and social
services network and for Tandjile's regional health services will be
increased, starting from their 1990 base, by at least 10 each year in
1991, 1992 and 1993 (a rate in line with the budgetary provisions under the
third PFP 1990-92); (e) the Government will submit for IDA's approval the
annual programs, including the terms of reference, schedule, and
arrangements for undertaking the surveys and studies; (f) the Government
will review with IDA the recommendations of the policy studies and agree on
action plans for their implementation; (g) the use of insecticides under
the project's sanitation component will follow the Bank's guidelines; (h)
the Government will review annually with IDA and the other cofinanciers,
starting not later than November 1, 1991, the progress of project
implementation and agree on the next annual program for each component: and
(i) the Government will submit to IDA for review semiannual audit reports
covering credit withdrawals made on the basis of statements of
expenditures. Coaditions of credit effectiveness are that (a) contracts,
satisfactory to IDA, have been signed with the two consulting firms
involved in the improvement of N'Djamena's primary health care/social
services network and the strengthening of health services in the Tandjile
Region, and with the NGO responsible for the community participation
aspects of the component to improve N'Djamena's sanitation infrastructure;
and (b) the Coordinator recruited under the sub-component on technical
assistance for micro-enterprises, and the engineer and the head foreman
recruited for the Sanitation Infrastructure Unit, have taken up their



duties. Conditions of disbursenent on the credit scheme for small and
micro-enterprises are that (a) the USAID grant has become effective, and
(b) the contract with the NGO for management of the line of credit,
satisfactory to IDA, has been signed.
10.       Benefits.  The project would Ca) enhance job creation by
providing 15,000 jobs through labor-intensive activities and assisting
about 700 micro and small enterprises; (b) expand access to higher-quality
health care and social services for 150,000 residents of N'Djamena at the
end of the project, double the utilization of health centers in N'Djamena
and Tandjile (540,000 and 360,000 inhabitants, respectively) and reduce
health hazards for 85,000 persons living in areas whe, the project will
rehabilitat. the sanitation infrastructure; (c) test ._  sustainability and
replicability of innovative approaches to addressing social issues, and
contribute to the effective design of long-term strategies in the social
sectors, through applied socioeconomic research combined with lessons drawn
from implementing specific action plans; and Id) help the Government to
promote community and private initiatives and to collaborate more
effectively with NGOs.
11.       Risks.  The project's main risks are related to the need to
effectively implement its diversified activities while respecting its
objectives that address the urgent needs of disadvantaged groups. Measur-ts
to mitigate these risks includes (a) definition of  detailed annual action
plans and identification of the particular target beneficiary groups, as
opposed to financing activities to be identified during project
implementation; (b) refinement and expansion of the techniques already
effectively applied in Chad by NGOs or other organizations; (c) the setting
up of a Project Coordination and Support Unit with financial autonomy and
full-time staff; and (d) provision of substantial training and technical
assistance inputs to enable existing public services to operate more
efficiently. The project's multisectoral activities require close
monitoring and regular consultations among all parties concerned, including
the cofinanciers.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association, and recommend
that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
