                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The revised project objective is to contribute to the recipient#s multisectoral efforts to control the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic by improving access to
                         prevention, treatment and care particularly for the most-at-risk-population (MARP) and those infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS. This objective will be
                         achieved by: (a) strengthening the Recipient#s national response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by improving its evidence base, coordination, implementation, and
                         monitoring and evaluation capacity; (b) raising the level of awareness on HIV/AIDS through the implementation of a comprehensive sensitization plan targeting
                         MARP in particular; (c) providing access to testing and counseling facilities; and (d) providing access to treatment, care and psychosocial support to persons
                         infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS.

                         Overall, the project is progressing towards its development objectives in terms of awareness raising; access to counseling and testing; and access to treatment, care and
                         psychosocial support to persons infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS. Implementation of the project has improved with the acceleration or complete implementation of several key
                         activities. Six (6) of eleven key performance indicators (11) have already been achieved including access to laboratory monitoring and antiretroviral therapy, counseling & voluntary
                         testing, support to most-at-risk-populations, and the number of sub-projects. Three indicators will be difficult to achieve (Number of orphans going to school regularly, number of

                         required the involvement of the private pharmacies under a PPP arrangement which needs to be evaluated before scaling up. However, access to ARVs drugs has considerably
                         improved through the public sector).
