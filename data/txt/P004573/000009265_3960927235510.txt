MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A SECOND MUNICIPAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of the Philippines for US$40 million equivalent is
submitted for your approval. The proposed loan would be for a term of
20 years including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable
interest rate and would finance basic infrastructure and other
investments in the cities and municipalities in Metro Manila and the
adjacent provinces and improvements in real property tax collections.
2.        Background:  The cities and municipalities (referred to as
local governments hereafter) in the Philippines are having
difficulties providing basic infrastructure and services for a growing
urban population. This has resulted in poor roads, flooding and
stagnant water, inadequate sanitation facilities, and congested and
unsanitary public markets, all of which create health hazards,
especially in low income communities. At current growth rates, Metro
Manila, which is already facing serious infrastructure and service
deficiencies, would have to accommodate close to 200,000 more people
annually, equivalent to a medium sized city, severely taxing local
governments' financial and managerial capabilities.
3.        The Bank has been assisting the Government in coping with
this urban growth by: (a) introducing low cost approaches to optimize
the use of limited resources; and (b) strengthening sector
institutions to plan and implement investments. The Metro Manila
Infrastructure and Engineering Program (MMINUTE), a component of the
Bank's Third Urban Project (Loan 1821-PH), developed a low-cost
approach to providing basic facilities to poor communities in Metro
Manila.  MMINUTE was completed successfully in December 1988.  While
the local governments were the beneficiaries, planning and
implementation of MMINUTE was carried out by the Department of Public
Works and Highways (DPWH). Despite administrative, financial and
technical weaknesses, local governments would need to play a larger
role in the future since they are responsible for providing many of
the basic services in urban areas. The First Municipal Development
Project (Loan 2435-PH, US$ 40 million, 1984) established an
institutional framework at the national level to assist local
governments to finance and manage their own investments. That ongoing
project provides local governments with: (a) regular access to long
term financing through a Municipal Development Fund (NDF); (b) revenue
enhancement through grant financing under the Real Property Tax
Administration Program (RPTA) to conduct real property tax mapping and
improve tax administration; and (c) :raining programs in planning,
finance and project management. Tit project faced delays resulting
from the wholesale changes in local executives in 1986 but is now
making steady progress.

4.        ationalfor Bank  nvov n   The proposed project would
build on the oxporionco to date in municipal development by
transferring to local governments the approach to planning and
implementing low-cost investments targeted on the urban poor developed
under MMINUTE, and by expanding the framework for financial and
technical assistance developed under the First Municipal Development
Project to local governments in Metro Manila and the surrounding
provinces which were not included in the first project. The proposed
project supports the Government's emphasis on promottng local
autonomy.
5.        Prolect O_ ectLie:  The project would aim at: (a) assisting
local governments in Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces to
provide basic municipal infrastructure, services and facilities
especially to lower income communities; (b) improving local
governments' investment planning, financing and implementation
capabilities; and (c) expanding the coverage of the MDF to include all
local governments in the Philippines.
6.        Proiect Descrintion:  The proposed project would include
financing for: (a) Suboroiects consisting of basic infrastructure
(road, drainage, etc.), public facilities (communal faucets and
toilets, markets, slaughterhouses), maintenance equipment, and
consultant services for project preparation and construction
supervision at the local level; (b) RPT to prepare tax maps and
improve real property tax administration; and (c) Technical Assistance
for a solid waste management study and advisory services to Department
of Finance (DOF) to strengthen management of the MDF and to DPWH to
support the Project Management Office (PMO).
7.        Implementation of the subprojects at the local level would
be carried out by DPWH and the local governments. Over 30 local
governments in Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces are expected
to participate in the project. Those starting implementation in 1991
and beyond would be included in the project subject to a subproject
appraisal by the PMO and Bank approval of the appraisal report and
onlending agreements. Smaller subloans would be made for
consultancies to prepare local projects and would not require prior
approval by the Bank.
8.        The total project cost is estimated at about US$57 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$23 million
equivalent (40%). Part of the Bank loan, US$23 million equivalent
(58%), would be on-lent to the local governments through the MDF to
finance subprojects at the NDF's prevailing terms and conditions:
variable interest rates (presently 11%), repayment over 20 years with
5 years grace, and equal payments of principal and interest. The
balance, US$ 17 million equivalent (42%), would be passed on as
budgetary allocations to DPWH for subproject investmerts and to DOF
for Real Property Tax Administration. A breakdown of the costs and
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in



Schedules C and D, respectively. A map shoving the project area is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7873-PH dated
November 17, 1989, is being distributed separately.
8.        Actions Agreed:  During negotiations, the Government
confirmed: (a) counterpart financing availability; (b) commitment to
finance technical assistance from its own sources; (c) the terms and
conditions of subloans; (d) the Bank's prior approval of subloans; (e)
its understanding that Bank guidelines will be followed in procurement
of civil works; (e) staffing of the PMO; and (f) reporting and
auditing arrangements.
9.        Benefits:  The proposed project would: (a) enhance the
ability of local governments in the fast developing metropolitan area
to directly plan and manage investments to meet their investment
needs; (b) improve sanitation and health, especially in low-income
communities; and (c) strengthen the institutional framework for
financing local government investments and increasing revenue
generation at the local level.
10.       Risks:  The primary risk is that the local governments would
not undertake fiscal measures to improve real property tax collections
and market revenues required to qualify for MDF subloans. To
minimize this risk, subloans would be for short periods (two to three
years), with those local governments successfully carrying out fiscal
improvements qualifying for follow-up subloans. Local council
approval of required fiscal measures would be obtained prior to the
start of implementation to assure political support. A second risk is
that this project would overwhelm the institutional framework
developed under the first project which is still at an early stage.
However, the two projects cover different geographical areas and would
be implemented in parallel by separate project offices, both of which
are presently fully operational.  The PMO would be responsible for the
bulk of project administration so that the addition of the second
project at this time is considered a manageable expansion.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
